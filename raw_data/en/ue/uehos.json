CANADIAN COMMITTEE ON ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE (CCAR) The Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resi stance (CCAR) was formed in 1998 to co-ordinate Canadian efforts to control the development and spread of antimicrobial resist ance. Working together on activities identified in the National Action Plan to Address Antibiotic Resistance, CCAR 's main areas of interest are resistance surveillance, infection prevention and control, and optimal antimicrobial use. The Committee provides outreach to the health care and agricultural communities through a variety of activities, including professional seminars, a series of reports and informational documents for specific target audiences, an d managing one of the most comprehensive websites on antimicrobial resistance in Canada (www.ccar-ccra.org). The CCAR also works with various levels of gov ernment to develop policy and identify human and financial resources to address resistance. The Public Health A gency of Canada provides considerable financial support through a three-year contract for services which expires in March of 2008. Whenever possible, CCAR leverages these resources to undertake activities and specific projects with those partners dedicated to the same interest in reducing antimicrobial resistance.

ISBN # INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [5] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance Summary of Infection Prevention and Control Best Practices For Small Animal Veterinary Clinics This document is designed to provide a complete and read ily accessible summary of infection prevention and control best practices for small animal veterinary clinics, and is intended to be understandable to all members of the veterinary practice team. The basic contents and key messages are summarized below, and a more detailed summary is available in Appendix I. 1. Infection prevention and control strategies are designed to protect patients, owners, veterinary personnel and the community . All veterinary personnel should play an active role in protecting every person and animal associated with the veterinary clinic. 2. Every veterinary clinic, regardless of type or size, should have a formal infection control program , a written infection control manual, and an infection control practitioner (ICP) to coordinate the program. 3. Some form of surveillance (either passive or active) should be practic ed by all veterinary facilities. The keys to passive surveillance are to centralize the avail able data, and to have a designated ICP who compiles and evaluates the data on a regular basis. 4. Routine Practices that are critical to infectio us disease prevention and control: a. Hand hygiene, including: i. Handwashing ii. Use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers b. Risk reduction strategies, particularly those related to: i. Use of personal prot ective equipment (PPE) ii. Cleaning and disinfection iii. Laundry iv. Waste management c. Risk assessment of animals and personnel with regard to: i. Disease transmission ii. Disease susceptibility d. Education i. Veterinary personnel ii. Animal owners iii. Public 5. All surgical procedures cause breaks in the normal defensive barrier s of the skin or mucous membranes, and therefore carry an inherent risk of surgical site infecti on (SSI). Good general infection control practices (e.g. hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection) are important for prev ention of SSIs, but there ar e also specific infection control measures pertaining to surgery that should be considered. 6. Every veterinary clinic should have an isolation area for caring for and housing animals with potentially contagious infectious diseases. 7. Proper wound care is critical to preventing transmission of bact eria, particularly multidrug-resistant pathogens, between animals, personnel and the environment. 8. Animals from shelters and similar facilities should be considered high risk from an infectious disease standpoint and managed appropriately to prevent transmission of disease. 9. Safety of personnel and animal owners should always be a priority. Personnel should take all necessary precautions to prevent animal-related injuries (e.g. bi tes, scratches), and all bite wounds should be taken seriously. Proper sharps handling practices should be em phasized to reduce the risk of needle-stick injuries. 10. Education of personnel and clients about zoonotic and in fectious disease risks and prevention is crucial.

Veterinary facilities face many of the same challenges that human healthcare facilities encounter. Hosp ital-acquired infections (HAIs) can have devastating effects on the health of veterinary patients, as well as the emotional and financial well-being of their owners. Outbreaks of HAIs can have a significant impact on patient s, their owners and veterinary personnel. Additionally, the close contact between most people and their pets allows fo r transmission of infectious agents between humans and animals, in both directions, and many of the most important HAIs in human hospitals are now emerging in veterinary hospitals. Veterinary clinics can act as reservoirs of hum an and animal pathogens and play a role in dissemination of infectious agents including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria into the general population, with potential effects on humans and animals. Veterinary personnel also face an inher ent risk of zoonotic disease from contact with both healthy and ill animals. All these issues clearly indicate why infection control is an important aspect of veterinary practice. However, the field of veterinary infection control is poorly developed compared to that of infection control in human healthcare, and few resources are currently availabl e to help veterinarians design and implement adequate infection control programs. PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to provide veterinary personnel with a succinct guide to principles and practices of infection control relevant to small animal veterinary clini cs. This document provides the basic information needed to develop an infection control program and establish basic infe ction control practices for su ch a clinic, with specific emphasis on critical aspects such as hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection. SCOPE OF DOCUMENT This document covers small animal veterinary clinics and is relevant to all personnel that work in association with such clinics, including veterinarians, veterinary techni cians and lay staff. For the purposes of this document, 'veterinary personnel' refers to all person nel that work in a veterinary clinic. Th is includes non-clin ical staff, as in many situations these individuals may still have periodic direct or indirect contact with patients and pathogens within a clinic. GUIDING PRINCIPLES (Modified from Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, 2004) 1. Infection prevention and control strategies are desig ned to protect patients, owner s, veterinary personnel and the community. 2. A significant percentage of hospital-associated infections (HAIs) in veterinary clinics can likely be prevented with proper compliance to basi c, practical infection control practices. Although poorly quantified, HAIs occur in veterinary clinics and can have a significant impact on animal health. While the proportion of preventable HAIs in veterinary clinics is unknown, it has been estimated at 30-70% of HAIs in human hospitals are preventable (Haley et al. 1985). 3. A systematic approach to infection prevention and control requires all veterinary personnel to play an active role in protecting every person and animal associated with the veterinary clinic, patients or veterinary personnel. 4. Veterinary personnel need to follow infection prevent ion and control protocols at all times and use critical thinking and problem solving in managing clinical situations. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [10] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance BASIC PRINCIPLES OF INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL GENERAL CONCEPTS Every veterinary clinic, regardless of size and type, s hould have a documented infection control program. This may range from simply a written collection of basic infection control practices, to a formal infection control manual with specific training, monitoring, surveillance and complianc e programs. Lack of a clearl y defined infection control program may lead to unnecessary patient morbidity and morta lity, and exposure of veterinarians, staff and owners to zoonotic pathogens. Improved infection control is a necessity as veterinary medicine evolves. Advances in veterinary medicine mean that animals are living lo nger, and owners are often expecting a higher level of care for their pets that is more comparable to what they themselves may receive. There are also more animals at higher risk for infection in general because of more invasive and immunosuppressive therapies. In addition to the desire to achieve \"best practice\" standards whenever possible, the increasingly litigio us nature of society may be one of the driving forces toward improved infection control in veterinary clinics. While the potential liability associated with morbidity and mortality in individual pets is limited, the potential cons equences of zoonotic diseases in owners and staff are significant and warrant careful consideration. Infection prevention and control measures can be broadly divided into three main categories: those that decrease host exposure, decrease host susceptibility and increa se host resistance to infectious pathogens. 1. Decreasing exposure is the most important aspect of disease control in most situations. If a pathogen does not encounter an individual, then dise ase cannot occur. The number of orga nisms to which a host is exposed is also an important factor in determining whether or not colonization or infection (disease) will ensue. Depending on the pathogen, decreasing or preventing exposure may be easy, difficult or impossible. 2. There are many factors that interact to determine whether or not infectious disease will develop in a particular host. In most cases, simple exposure of an animal to an infectious agent does not mean that disease will result. The susceptibility of the individual to a particular number of an infectious agent plays an important role. Although difficult to quantify, certain si tuations may result in increased susceptibility to infection and disease. Many factors causing increased susceptibility are not prevent able, but some are, and efforts should be undertaken to address these issues. Factors to consider include judicious use of antimicrobials and other drugs, prov ision of proper nutrition, adequate pain control, and appropriate management of underlying disease. 3. Measures to actively increase resistance of a host are commonly used in veterinary medicine, but these should be considered only the third line of defense, after those meant to decrease exposure and susceptibility. Vaccination is currently the main technique used to increase resistance of animals or humans to infection. However, no vaccine is 100% effective. Therefore, while vaccination is an important part of infection prevention and control, it must not be the only component of an infection control program if the program is to be successful. In addition, many HAI-infe ctions are caused by oppor tunist microorganisms for which vaccines are unavailable. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [11] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance RATIONALE FOR ROUTINE PRACTICES - THE CHAIN OF TRANSMISSION (Modified from Public Health Agency of Canada, 1999) Transmission of infection during the provisi on of health care requires three elements: a source of infectious microorganisms, a susceptible host , and a means of transmission for the microorganism. Prevention of infection in animal health care settings should be directed primarily at interrupting the transmission of microorganisms from source to host, because agent and host factors are typically more difficult to control. SOURCE Animal sources of infectious microorganisms may be anima ls which are merely colonized by an infectious agent (meaning the pathogen resides in or on the body, but is not associated with any clinical disease or host response), animals in the pre-clinical (incubation) phase of disease, animals with acute disease, animals with chronic disease caused by persistent infection, and animals that are re covering from clinical disease but are still shedding the infectious agent. People can be an important source of zo onotic pathogens, and like animals they may be colonized or infected. Contamination on a person's clothing or body , particularly the hands, can also be a source of infectious microorganisms. Other potent ial sources include food, water, and an animal's own indigenous microflora, which may be difficult to control. Inanimate objects, incl uding medical equipment, supplies and drugs, animal bedding, environmental surfaces and waste that have been contaminated can also be important sources. Microorganisms to consider include bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. In so me cases, vectors such as lice, mosquitoes, flies, ticks, fleas, rodents and other vermin can transmit certain pathogens. HOST Decreasing host susceptibility Decreasing host susceptibility to infection is difficult to achieve in a hospital setting. Regarding patients, the judicious use of antimicrobials, minimizing the use of immunosuppr essive agents, avoidance of dietary changes whenever possible, ensuring adequate nutritional intake, adequate pain control, and limiting the use of invasive devices should be considered, as these can all have an impact on host immune function. For hospital personnel, it may not be possible to directly decrease their own susceptibility to infection, but it is im portant to be aware of those individuals who may have increased susceptibility. These include persons who are i mmunosuppress ed due to disease or medical treatment, or who are being treated with antimicr obial drugs, have open wounds or who are pregnant. Good communication between veterinary personnel, their physicians an d clinic administration is important to lessen the risk of zoonotic infection. Increasing host resistance Vaccination is currently the main technique used to increase resistance of animals and humans to infection. As noted, no vaccine is 100% effective and there are many infe ctions for which vaccines are unavailable. Factors to consider when developing vaccination recommendations or requirements include the prevalence of a particular disease in the area, risk to healthy and compromised patients, transmissibility of the disease, risk to veterinary personnel, ability to treat the disease, efficacy of vaccination and safety of vaccinat ion. Vaccination can only be maximally effective when it is used in conjunction with other appropriate infection control practices. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [12] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance TRANSMISSION Microorganisms are transmitted in animal health care settings by four main routes: contact, droplet, air-borne and vector-borne transmission. The same microorgani sm may be transmitted by more than one route. 1. Contact transmission is the most important and frequent mode of transmission of health-care associated infections (HAIs). It can be divided into di rect and indirect contact transmission. Direct contact transmission involves direct body surface-to-body surface contact resulting in physical transfer of microorganisms from an infected or colo nized animal. For example, two dogs in a waiting room that come into direct contact when they sniff each other may transmit pathogens present in their noses or perineal areas; direct contact of a veterina rian's hands with a wound on an animal may result in transmission of opportunistic pathogens from the normal microflora of the person' s hands, or infectious organisms present in the animal's wound, to the patient or the veterinarian, respectively. Indirect contact transmission is the result of physical transfer of microorganisms from the original animal (or human) source to a new host, without direct contact between the two. This typically involves body surface contact with an inanimate object, env ironmental surface or th e integument of another animal or person that has been transiently contaminat ed by the original animal (or human) source. For example, handling one animal and then petting another animal without washing one's hands constitutes indirect contact between the two animals. 2. Droplet transmission is theoretically a form of c ontact transmission. However, the mechanism of transfer of the pathogen from host to host is quite di stinct from either direct or indire ct contact transmission. Droplets are generated from the source animal primarily during coughing or sneezing, and during the performance of certain procedures such as suctioning. Transmission occurs when droplets containing microorganisms generated from the source animal are propelled a short distance through the air (usually less than one metre) and deposited on the new host's conjunctiva (i.e. in the eye), nasal mu cosa, mouth, or an open wound. For example, a cat with an upper respiratory tract infection can transmit viruses or bacteria to another cat in the waiting room by sneezing on it, particularly if they are face-to-face, even if the animals do not touch each other directly. Because droplets do not remain suspended in the air, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission; that is, droplet transm ission must not be confused with air- borne transmission. Droplets can also contaminate the surrounding environment and lead to indirect contact transmission. 3. Airborne transmission occurs by dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei (5 m or smaller, about 2-3 times the size of most bacterial pathogens) from partly -evaporated droplets containi ng microorganisms, or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner remain suspended in the air for long periods of time and can be dispersed widely by air currents. They may be inhaled by another host within the same room, or they may reach hosts over a longer distance from the source, depending on environmental factors. Airborne transmission of pathogens in veterinary clinics is very rare. 4. Vector-borne transmission occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, f lies, ticks, fleas, rats, and other vermin transmit microorganisms. Some act as simple mechanical ve ctors, comparable to indirect contact transmission, whereas others acquire and transmit microorganisms by biti ng. It is important to have control measures in place to reduce or eliminate the presence of such vectors in veterinary clinics.

Indirect Contact INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [14] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance HIERARCHY OF INFECTIO N CONTROL MEASURES (Modified from British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, 2004) The coordinated efforts of occupational health and safety gr oups and building engineers have created a framework in human medicine that includes three levels of infection control : engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective measures. These levels of control can easily be applied to veterinary practices as well. 1. Engineering controls are built into the design of a facility (e.g. ro om design, sink placem ent, Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning [HVAC] systems). It is important for infection prevention and cont rol professionals to be involved in the design and planning of new facilities. They can also help to plan and design improvements which may be incorporated into an existing fac ility. Engineering controls include logica l design of clinic s to facilitate use of routine infection control measur es such as hand washing, proper cleaning, and separation of animals of different species and different infectious disease risks. All new building or renovation plans need to be evaluated from an infection control perspective. 2. Administrative controls include protocols for hand hygiene, immuni zation of animals and staff, protocols for managing animals and staff during an infectious disease outbreak, and protocols for caring for animals with zoonotic infections. 3. Personal protective equipment (PPE) , although very important, is the least desirable way to control infectious hazards because it does not eliminate them - it merely contains the hazard. Nonethel ess, the inherent risk of exposure to microbial pathogens in veteri nary clinics means that proper use of PPE is a critical component of a complete infection control program. Effective use of PPE is dependent on appropriate education and compliance of all staff. Personal protective equi pment should be considered a last line of defense for hazard s that cannot be overcome with other preventative measures. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [15] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance THE INFECTION CONTROL PROGRAM Every veterinary clinic, regardless of ty pe or size, should have a formal infection control program that is coordinated by one specific person. This infection control practitioner (ICP) should develop protocols, ensure that protocols are being followed, act as a resource fo r infection control questions, ensure proper training of new staff, direct and interpret surveillance and communicate with staff regarding infection control issues. This is not necessarily a cumbersome or time-consuming job, as many may think! The day-to-day responsibilities are typically minimal. It is also a not a pos ition that needs to be filled by an expert in infection control or someone with specific training, although that would cert ainly be desirable. In human hospitals, ICPs are typically nurses with specialized infection control training, who perform the day-to-day infection control duties and work under an infection control head, who is typically a physician with training in one or more of infection control, infectious diseases, microbiology and/or public health. These indivi duals are rarely available in veterinary medicine, but that does not mean that an effective program cannot be established. Either veterinary technicians or veterinarians would be appropriate in veterinary clinics. Formal training would be ideal but is not readily available, and the key requirement for the position is an interest in infection control . Ideally, over time, the IC P will advance his or her skills through formal and informal continuing education. In veterinary clinics, the ICP should be the central infect ion control resource. Among other duties, he or she should: Help facilitate development of a written infection control manual Direct and document training of new staff (particularly lay staff) Perform formal or informal quality control evaluation of infection control practice compliance (e.g. observing cleaning and disinfection practices, hand hygiene) Be the person designated to receive information about and record incidents of suspected hospital-associated infections. A written infection control manual is a critical part of the infecti on control program. Written documentation can clearly explain infection control practices, ensure that new staff members are properly informed and raise awareness about infection control. Furthermore, written documentation may be important legally in the event of hospital-associated, or more concerni ngly, zoonotic infections. A written manual demonstrates a level of awareness and effort towards infection control and could be a critical measure to reduce liability risks by demonstrating use of some degree of due diligence. Support of hospital administration is also crucial to an effective infect ion control program. If practice owners and managers are unwilling to provide the ICP with adequate time, resources and support, the infection control program will fail. Hospital administration needs to ensure that all veterinary personnel understand and accept the importance of an infection control program, and intervene when r equired if issues (e.g. poor compliance) arise. Every veterinary clinic, regardless of type or size, should have a FORMAL INFECTION CONTROL PROGRAM, a written infection control manual that describes the program, and an infection control practitioner (ICP) to coordinate the program INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [16] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance SURVEILLANCE Surveillance is a key component of any infection control pr ogram. Effective infection control is impossible without surveillance, and some form of surveillance shoul d be practiced by all veterinary facilities. Many clinical aspects of surveillance are easy, inexpensive and can be readily incorporated into day-to-day veterinary practice. PASSIVE SURVEILLANCE In the absence of an ongoing infectious disease outbreak, passive infectious disease surveillance is likely adequate for most clinics . Passive surveillance is practical, cost- effective and can be performed in any clinic. It involves analysis of data that are already available (e.g. bacterial culture and susceptibility results, results of other kinds of infectious disease testing) to determine elements su ch as endemic disease rates, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and trends, and changes in disease patterns. An example of passive surveillance would be monitoring the surgical site infection (SSI) rate following all surgical procedures and specific surgical procedures (e .g. spays, neuters). Monitoring of bacterial culture and susceptibility testing can provide information regarding possible outbreaks of hospital associated infections (HAIs), as well as information to guide empirical antimicrobial therapy. Routine recording of animals with spec ific syndromes such as vomiting, diarrhea, coughing or sneezing is another simple means of providing information that can help in the prevention and early detection of outbreaks, a nd can help to identify index cases should a hospital outbreak occur. Post-discharge surveillance is more problematic, but is very important for conditions such as SSIs, as many such infections do not develop until after the animal is discharged from the hospital. Post-discharge surve illance can consist of direct ex amination of the patient during a recheck appointment, evaluation of readmission data or simple telephone or mail contact with owners. The keys to passive surveillance are to centralize the available data , and to have a designated infection control practitioner (ICP) who is responsible for compiling and evaluating this data on a regular basis. Simply collecting the data or even entering it in a spreadsheet is of no value unless someone looks at it. T h i s i s p a r t i c u l a r l y important in large clinics or hospitals where multiple veterinarians may have patients with similar infections but do not communicate this to others, and therefor e the start of an outbreak can be missed. If an outbreak is identified, then a plan can be formulated and implemented in order to stop the spread of disease. This plan may or may not include additional active surveillance to identify additional cases. ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE Active surveillance involves gathering data specifically for infection control purposes. As a result, it is usually more expensive and time consuming but usually provides the highes t quality data. This is rarely needed in most veterinary clinics and is typically reserved for la rge facilities with increased infection c ontrol threats and personnel available to direct such testing, or during a specif ic outbreak investigation. An example of active surveillance is collection of nasal and rectal swabs from all animals being admitted to a hospital, whether or not they have signs of infection, to screen for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . The keys to passive surveillance are to centralize the available data, and to have a designated ICP who compiles and evaluates the data on a regular basis. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [17] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance ROUTINE PRACTICES HAND HYGIENE (Modified from Ontario Provincial Infect ious Disease Advisory Committee, 2008) Hand hygiene is the responsibility of all individuals involved in health care . Effective hand hygiene kills or removes microorganisms on the skin while maintaining hand health and skin integrity (i.e. prevents chapping and cracking of skin). Sterilization of the hands is not the go al of routine hand hygiene - the objective is to reduce the number of microorganisms on the hands, particularly the number of microorganisms that are part of the transient microflora of the skin, as these include the majority of opportunistic pathogens on the hands. These transient microbes may be picked up by contact with a patient, another person, contaminated equipment, or the environment. There are two methods of removing/killing microorganisms on hands: washing with soap and running water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer . Hand hygiene is the single most im portant way to prevent infections in the healthcare setting. Routine Practices are a way of thinking a nd of acting that forms the foundation for limiting the transmission of microorganisms in al l health care settings. It is the standard of care for all patients/clients/residents. - Rick Wra y, Hos pital for Sick Children , Toronto , Canada Routine practices include: Hand hygiene Risk reduction strategies through use of personal protective equipment (PPE), cleaning and disinfection of the environment and equipment, laundry management, waste management, safe sharps handling, patient placement, and healthy workplace practices Risk assessment related to animal clinical signs, including sc reening for syndromes that might indicate the presence of infectious disease (e.g. fever, coughing/s neezing, diarrhea, abnormal excretions/secretions), and use of risk assessment to guide control practices Education of veterinar y personnel and owners INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [18] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance ALCOHOL-BASED HAND SANITIZERS Alcohol-based hand sanitizers/rubs are, with some exceptions, the preferred method for decontaminating hands that are not visibly soiled. They have superior ability to kill microorganisms on the skin than even hand washing with antibacterial soap, can quickly be applied, are less likely to cause skin damage, and can be made readily available at almost any point of care. Use of non-alcohol-based waterless hand sanitizers in healthcare settings is not recommended . Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain 70-90% alcohol . Use of products containing emollients helps to reduce skin damage which can otherwise occur with frequent use of hand sanitizers. Products containing alcohol and chlorhexidine are also available. Chlorhexidine provides some residual antimicrobial action on the hands after use, but it is unclear whether or not these combinations provide any true benefit in clinical settings. They may be more useful as alternatives to traditional surgical scrubbing techniques (see Surgery section on page 40). Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against certain pathogens , including bacterial spores (e.g. clostridial spores) and Cryptosporidium spp . Nonetheless, alcohol-based hand if alcohol-resistant pathogens like Clostridium difficile are present. The improved hand hygiene compliance seen with alcohol-based hand sanitizers and their efficacy against ot her pathogens are important aspects of infection control Routine use of these products has not resulted in detectable increases in C. difficile infection rates in human hospitals. However, if hands are potentially contaminat ed by one of these organisms, hand washing with soap and running water should be performed if possible. Although even antimicrobial soaps are similarly ineffective against these pathogens directly, the physical process and mech anical action of hand washing can decrease the number of these organisms on the hands. Alcohol is also not as effective against non-enveloped viruses (e.g. canine parvovirus, feline panleukopenia virus) as it is against mo st other microbes. As for clostridial pathogens, hand washing with soap and running water is likely more effe ctive, and should be used whenever possible when these pathogens are involved. Technique : 1. Remove all hand and arm jewelery. 2. Ensure hands are visibly clean (if soiled, follow hand washing steps). 3. Apply between 1 to 2 full pumps or a 2-3 cm diameter pool of the product onto one palm. 4. Spread the product over all surfaces of hands, concentrating on finger tips, between fingers, back of the hands, and base of the thumbs. These are the most commonly missed areas. 5. Rub hands until product is dry . This will take a minimum of 15 to 20 seconds if sufficient product is used. \u0017 Hands must be fully dry before touching the patient or patient's environment/equipment for the hand rub to be effective, and to eliminate the rare risk of flammability in the presence of an oxygen-enriched environment, as may occur in the presence of gas anesthetic machines. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [19] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance HAND WASHING Most transient bacteria present on the hands are removed during the mechanical action of washing, rinsing and drying hands. Hand washing with soap and running water must be performed when hands are visibly soiled. If running water is not available, use moistened towelettes to re move all visible dirt and debris, followed by an alcohol- based hand rub. Bar soaps are not acceptable in veterinary practice settings because of the potential for indirect transmission of pathogens from one person to another. Instead, liquid or foam soap should be used Soap should be dispensed in a disposable pump dispenser Soap containers should not be refilled without being disinfected, sinc e there is a risk of contamination Antibacterial soaps should be used in critical care areas such as ICU, and in other areas where invasive procedures are performed Technique : 1. Remove all hand and arm jewelery. 2. Wet hands with warm (not hot) water. Hot water is hard on the skin, and will lead to dryness and additional skin damage. 3. Apply liquid or foam soap. 4. Vigorously lather all surfaces of hands for a minimum of 15 seconds . This is the minimum amount of time required for mechanical removal of transient bacteria. Pay particular attention to finger tips, between fingers, backs of the hands and base of the thumbs. These are the most commonly missed areas. A simple way many people time their hand-washing is by singing \"Happy Birthday\". 5. Using a rubbing motion, thoroughly rinse soap from hands under warm running water. Residual soap can lead to dryness and cracking of skin. 6. Dry hands thoroughly by blotting hands gently with a pape r towel. Rubbing vigorously with paper towels can damage the skin. 7. Turn off taps with paper towel to avoid recontamination of your hands \u0083 NOTE: If air hand dryers are used, hands-free taps are necessary, as turning taps off without using paper towel as described will result in recontamination of hands after washing. WHEN HAND HYGIENE S HOULD BE PERFORMED Before and after contact with a patient \u0083 Especially before performing invasive procedures Before and after contact with items in the patient's environment After any contact with or any activity involving the body fluids of a patient Before putting on and especially after taking off gloves Before eating food After personal body functions, such as using the toilet or blowing one's nose INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [20] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE EF FECTIVENESS OF HAND HYGIENE Condition of the skin : Intact skin is easier to clean than skin that is chapped, cracked, cut, abraded or otherwise inflamed. Intact skin is the first line of defense against bacteria. Finger nails : Natural nails more than 3-4 mm long are difficult to clean, can pierce gloves and harbour more microorganisms than short nails. Artificial nails or nail enhancements (including nail polish) should not be worn by anyone involved directly in patient care , as they have been implicated in the transfer of microorganisms in human medicine. Jewelery : Jewelery is very hard to clean, and physically pr otects bacteria and viruses from the antiseptic action of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and the mech anical cleaning action of soap and running water. Rings and bracelets should not be worn during patient c ontact. Rings, in particular, increase the number of microorganisms present on hand s and increase the risk of tears in gloves. SKIN CARE Careful attention to skin care is an essential part of the hand hygiene program. Products used for hygiene should be \"hand-friendly\" - for example, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients ar e available, which can help reduce the drying effect of the alcohol. If skin integrity is an issue, the individual should consult his or her physician. Skin lotions can help maintain the health and integrity of the skin, but it is important to use a skin lotion that does not interfere with glove integrity. Petroleum-based loti on formulations can weaken latex gloves and increase permeability. Lotions that contain petroleum or other oil emollients should only be used at the end of the work day. If lotions are used during the work day, select a water-based product. It is reassuring to the client to see cl inic personnel performing hand hygiene, and it increases client awareness of the importance of hand hygiene. Practices ma y wish to reinforce this b y providin g alcohol-based hand sanitizers in the waitin g room. Intact skin is the first line of defense against bacteria. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [21] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) Personal protective equipment (PPE) is an important routine infection control tool. PPE use is designed to reduce the risk of contamination of personal clot hing, reduce exposure of skin and mucous membranes of veterinary personnel to pathogens, and reduce tran smission of pathogens between patients by veterinary personnel. Some form of PPE must be worn in all clinical situations, including any contact with animals and their environment. Tables 1 and 2 summarize infectious disease control precautions by disease condition and agent, and recommended personal protective equipment for routine veterinary procedures, respectively. These recommendations must always be tempered by professional ju dgment, while still bearing in mind the basic principles of infectious disease control, as every situation is unique in terms of the specific clinic, animal, personnel, procedures and suspected infectious disease. Personal protective outerwear is used to protect vete rinary personnel and to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission by clothing to patients, owners, veterinary pe rsonnel and the public. Protective outerwear should be worm whenever there may be contact with an animal or when working in the clinical environment (including cleaning). LAB COATS Lab coats are meant to protect clothing from contamination, but genera lly they are not fluid resistant, so they should not be used in situat ions where splashing or soaking with potentially infectious liquids is anticipated. These garments should be changed promptly whenever they become visibly soiled or contaminated with body fluids, and at the end of each day. Lab coats worn in the clinic should not be worn outside of the work environment. Lab coats worn when handling patients with potentially infectious diseases should be laundered after each use, because it is almost impossible to remove, store/hang and reuse a contaminated lab coat without contaminat ing hands, clothing or the environment. SCRUBS Scrubs are often worn in veterinary clinic s as a form of basic personal protective equipment. They have the advantage of being durable and easy to clean, and their use prevents contamination and soiling of the street clothes t hat personnel wear outside the clinic. Clinic scrubs should not be worn outside the clinic. They should not be taken home by personnel to be washed, rather they should be washed on- site, with other clinic laundry. Scrubs should be washed at the end of each day and whenever they become visibly soiled. Designated scrubs should always be worn during surgery - these scrubs should not be worn during other procedures or when handling patients. Scrubs worn for surgery should be covered with a lab coat outside of the surgical suite. Street clothes should always be covered by protective outerwear, such as a lab coat, when working in the clinic. Protective outerwear, including scrubs, should not be worn outside the clinic. Use of personal protective equipment does not eliminate the need for appropriate environmental engineering controls, such as hazard removal a nd separation of patient areas from staff rooms. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [22] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance NON-STERILE GOWNS Gowns provide more coverage for barrier protection than l ab coats, and are typically used for handling animals with suspected or confirmed infectious diseases, that are housed in isolation. Permeable gowns can be used for general care of patients in isolation. Impermeable (i.e. waterpr oof) gowns should be used to provide greater protection when splashes or large quantities of body fluids are present or anticipated. Disposable gowns should not be reused, and reusable fabric gowns should be laundered after each use, because hanging/storing and reusing contaminated gowns inevitably leads to contamination of hands, clothing or the environment. Gloves should be worn whenever gowns are worn. Gowns (and gloves) should be re moved and placed in the trash or laundry bin before leaving the animal's environment, and hands should be washed immediately afterwards. Personnel should learn to remove gowns properly, in such a way as to avoid contaminating themselves and the environment ( Figure 2 ). The outer (contaminated) surface of a gown should only be touched with gloves. 1. After unfastening or breaking the ties, peel the gown from the shoulders and arms by pulling on the chest surface while hands are still gloved. 2. Ball up the gown for disposal while keeping the contaminated surface on the inside. 3. Remove gloves and wash hands. 4. If body fluids soaked through the gown, promptly remove the contaminated underlying clothing and wash the skin. GLOVES Gloves reduce the risk of pathogen transmission by provid ing barrier protection. They should be worn when contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions and muco us membranes is possible. Gloves should also be worn when cleaning cages and environmental surfaces, as well as when doing laundry if gross contamination of items is present. Gloves should be removed promptly after use, avoiding contact between skin and the outer glove surface. Gloved hands should not be used to t ouch surfaces that will be touched by people with no n-gloved hands. Care should be taken to avoid contamination of personal item such as telephones, pens and pagers. Hands should be washed or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be used immediately after glove removal. It is a common misconception that using disposable gloves negates the need for hand hygiene. Gloves do not provide complete protection against hand contamination, therefore hand hygiene immediately after removing gloves is essential. Disposable gloves should not be washed and reused. Gloves are NOT a substitute for proper hand hygiene. All gowns should be used only once, then discarded or laundered. These diagrams are available to download from the CDC website http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/ppe.html FIGURE 2: HOW TO REMOVE A GOWN INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [23] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance Change gloves and perform hand hygiene when: Moving from contaminated areas to clean areas on the same animal Moving from dirty to clean procedures on the same animal After contact with large amounts of blood and/or body fluids Between individual animals Gloves come in a variety of materials. The choice of glove material depends on their intended use. Latex gloves are commonly used, but if latex allergies are a concern, acceptable alternatives include nitrile or vinyl gloves. Latex gloves will decompose and lose their integrity when exposed to many c hemicals. If exposure to chemicals such as disinfectants is expected (e.g. when cleaning and disinfecting cages), disposable nitrile gloves or heavier, reusable rubber gloves (e.g. common dishwashing gloves) can be used. Reusable gloves must also be disinfected at the end of each task. FACE PROTECTION Face protection prevent s exposure of the mucous membr anes of the eyes, nose and mouth to infectious materials. Fa ce protection typically includes a nose-and-mouth mask (e.g. surgical mask) and goggles, or a full face shield, which should be used whenever exposure to splashes or sprays is likely to occur, including dental procedures, nebulization, and wound lavage. RESPIRATORY PROTECTION Respiratory protection is designed to protect the respirat ory tract from zoonotic infe ctious diseases transmitted through the air. The need for this type of protection is limited in veterinary medicine because there are few relevant airborne or aerosol zoonotic pathogens in com panion animals, in most regions. The N95 rated disposable particulate respirator is a mask that is inexpensive, readily available, easy to use and provides adequate respiratory protection in most situations. However, people need to be fit-tested to ensure proper placement and fitting of N95 masks. Special N95 masks are required for people with beards. Surgical masks are not a replacement for N95 masks. FOOTWEAR Closed toed footwear must be worn at all time s to reduce the risk of injury from dropped equipment (e.g. scalpels, needles), scratches fr om being stepped on by dogs, and to protect the feet from contact with potentially infectious substances (e.g. feces, discharges and other body fluids). Designated footwear or disposable shoe covers are required in areas where infectious materials are expected to be present on the floor , in order to prevent their spread to other areas. This is particularly important in ve terinary clinics because patients, and sometimes the personnel working with them, often have very cl ose contact with the floor, unlike human hospitals. Designated footwear or disposable shoe covers may be required for patients with infectious diseases that are kept on the floor (e.g. in a large dog run) or that may contaminate the floor around their kennel (e.g. an animal with severe diarrhea). Such footwear must be removed as the person leaves the contaminated ar ea, and should be immediately disposed of in the garbage (if disposable), or left at t he entrance of the contaminat ed area on the \"dirty\" side. In veterinary clinics, it is important to prevent the spread of infectious materials present on the floor, as patients and personnel often have ver y close contact with the floor.

Cleaning involves the removal of visible organic matter with soap or detergent, whereas disinfection involves the application of a chemical or other proc edure in order to kill the remaining microbes that cannot be adequately removed by cleaning. Cleaning is essential because the survival time of many infectious agents outside the host is prolonged by the presence of organic matter, and organic matter also decreases the effectiveness of disinfectants. Depending on the level of disinfection used, disinfection kills or prevents the growth of many or most pathogens. Equipment should be cleaned and disinfected according to its intended use, the manufacturer's recommendations, and practice policy. Equipment must be cleaned before sterilization or disinfection. Surfaces where animals are housed, examined, or treated should be made of non-porous, sealed, ea sy-to-clean materials to facilitate cleaning and disinfection and minimize infection transmission. Personnel whose duties include cleaning and di sinfection of equipment and different hospital areas should be trained regarding how to safely handle and us e the products available in the clinic. In Canada, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be readily accessible for all the applicable chemical products. CLEANING Cleaning entails the removal of all forms of organic matter (e.g. feces, urine, blood, food, dirt etc.) from a surface. Recommended cleaning procedures for common environmental surfaces are shown in Table 3. Ensure all areas are well ventilated during cleaning. After cleaning, allow all surfaces to dry completely. Removing loose, dry debris from surfaces : Avoid generating airborne dust that may contain pathogens by: o using a vacuum cleaner e quipped with a HEPA filter \u0083 The filter helps to prevent aerosolization of pathogens such as ringworm. For this reason, vacuums without HEPA filters should not be used for cleaning in patient-contact areas. o lightly spraying surfaces with water prior to mopping or sweeping o using an electrostatic wipe (e.g. Swiffer cloth) o using a wet mop Exposure to aerosols generated by brushes during cleaning can be minimized by taking certain precautions, such as wearing a face mask and containing spatter if the brush or surface is damp. A surgical nose-and-mouth mask will provide some protection against droplet spatter, but not against finer particles and dry dust that can become suspended in the air. A properly-fitted N95 face mask can provide this level of protection (see Respiratory Protection on page 23). Removing sticky, wet or dried-on organic material from surfaces : This kind of debris should be removed using a detergent or soap and a brush or cloth, as necessary. During cleaning, it is the mechanical action and surfac tant properties of the soap that are important, not necessarily its antimicrobial activity. Avoid the use of pressure washers, particularly those that produce more that 120 psi of pressure. This amount of pressure may cause aerosolization of pathogens, and pressure washing may even damage surfaces, thus making them harder to disinfect properly. A home gard en hose sprayer usually produces less than 120 psi of pressure, and would therefore be relatively safe to use in a small animal kennel area. Cleaning must always be done before a disinfectant is used. *Gloves should be worn when cl eaning and disinfecting, and hands should be washed after finishing any cleaning activity. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [29] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance DISINFECTION Disinfection can only be maximally effective if it is prec eded by thorough cleaning. Some pathogens (e.g. clostridial spores) are highly resistant to disinfection, therefore cleaning in these cases is particularly crucial in order to mechanically remove the organisms. Ensure all areas are well ventilated during disinfection *Gloves should be worn when handling disinfectants, but latex gloves will decompose and lose their integrity when exposed to many chemicals. For small jobs, dispos able nitrile gloves should be used instead. For large jobs, heavier rubber gloves (e.g. common dishwashing gl oves) can be used, but reus able gloves of this type must also be disinfected at the end of each task. Use of protective eye goggles is also recommended when handling disinfectants due to the splash risk. Always apply the selected disinfectant according to the product label, with particular attention to: o appropriate dilution o required contact time If patients or personnel may have direct skin contact with the surface, or if the disinfectant used may damage a particular surface, the disinfectant may need to be rinsed off with clean water after an appropriate amount of time has elapsed. After disinfection, allow all surfaces to dry completely. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [30] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance TABLE 3: RECOMMENDED CLEANING PROCEDUR ES FOR COMMON ENVIRONMENTAL SURFACES Surface / Object Procedures Special Considerations Horizontal surfaces with low patient contact (e.g. front desk, records area) 1. Clean regularly with detergent, e.g. bi-weekly 2. Clean and disinfect promptly if visibly soiled with feces, urine or body fluids Horizontal surfaces with high patient contact (e.g. exam tables, scale, kennels) 1. Clean and disinfect between all patients. Surface should be cleaned of visible debris then a disinfectant should be applied. Adequate contact time should be provided, as per label directions. 2. Provide enhanced disinfection after contact with high-risk patients (i.e. diarrheic). Higher level disinfection (i.e. bleach, oxidizing agent) should be used if lower level disinfectants are used routinely Vertical surfaces (e.g. walls, doors, windows including blinds/ curtains) 1. Clean regularly with a detergent, e.g. monthly 2. Clean and disinfect if visibly soiled with feces, urine or body fluids See Tables 5 and 6 for selection of appropriate cleaning & disinfectant products Electrostatic wipes (i.e. Swiffer cloths) can be used to remove loose fur and dust Hard floors (e.g. tile, wood, sealed cement) 1. Clean daily with a detergent. Disinfect regularly, e.g. weekly 2. Clean and disinfect after potentially infectious patients 3. Clean and disinfect if visibly soiled with feces, urine or body fluids Carpets/upholstery 1. Vacuum regularly, e.g. monthly Note: Do not vacuum if there may have been contact with an animal shedding an infectious pathogen (i.e. ringworm), unless the vacuum is equipped with a HEPA filter 2. Shampoo or steam clean if necessary to remove visible dirt and debris See Tables 5 and 6 for selection of appropriate cleaning & disinfectant products Cleaning is especially important for these surfaces as they are difficult or impossible to disinfect INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [31] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance SINGLE-USE VS REUSABLE EQUIPMENT Single-use equipment (e.g. hypodermic needles) should not be re-sterilized or disinfected for re-use. Such items should be properly disposed of immediately after initial us e. In veterinary medicine, some equipment that is considered single-use in human healthcare is reused because the cost of some items makes it impractical to discard them after a single use (see Disinfection of Anesthetic Equipment on page 41). There is little to no objective information on how to disinfect or resterilize such equip ment, and how often this can be done without compromising the integrity of item. The level of disinfection required should be evaluated as for mult i-use equipment (below). Items should be carefully inspected prior to each use, and r eplaced if there is evidenc e of damage that may impair the function of the equipment or subsequent cleaning and disinfection. Multi-use equipment must be properly cleaned and disinfected between each patient. There are three categories of multi-use equipment used on patients: critical , semi-critical and non-critical . Each category defines how instruments must be cleaned and disinfec ted to prevent transmission of infectious agents. In human healthcare, these categories are defined as per Table 4. TABLE 4: SPAULDING'S (1970) CLASSIFICAT ION OF MEDICAL EQUI PMENT/DEVICES AND REQUIRED LEVELS OF PROCESSING AND REPROCESSING Classification Definition Level of Processing/ Reprocessing Critical equipment/device (e.g. surgical instruments) Equipment/device that enters sterile tissues, including the vascular system Cleaning followed by sterilization Semi-critical equipment/device (e.g. endoscopes, thermometers) Equipment/device that comes in contact with non- intact skin or mucous membranes but does not penetrate them Cleaning followed by High Level Disinfection (as a minimum), sterilization is preferred Non-critical equipment/device (e.g. stethoscope) Equipment/device that touches only intact skin and not mucous membranes, or does not directly touch the patient Cleaning followed by Low Level Disinfection, in some cases, cleaning alone is acceptable See Tables 5 and 6 for selection of disinfectants. In veterinary medicine, exceptions to the level of processing required are typically made for some pieces of semi- critical equipment that come in contact with tissues or mucous membranes which are normally considered non- sterile, such as those of the upper respiratory or gastrointest inal tracts. If a transmissib le infectious disease is not suspected in the patient, and the subse quent patient is not significantly immunocompromised, thorough cleaning and low level disinfection is likely adequate in these cases. However, if an infectious disease is suspected or the subsequent patient is immunocompromised, then cl eaning and high level disinfection or sterilization are recommended in order to prevent disease transmission. Fo r example, a rectal thermometer should undergo cleaning and low level disinfection between every patient, but if used on a diarrheic animal it should undergo high-level disinfection or be discarded and replaced. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [32] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance Food and water bowls of patients with infectious diseases should be cleaned and disinfected separately, but careful selection of the disinfectant used is required because only some disinfectants are approved for use on surfaces that come in contact with food. Otherwise disposable dishes can be considered for these animals. Cleaning alone (with regular dish soap) is adequate for food and water bowls from other patients. Toys, litter boxes, and other miscellaneous items should be cleaned and disinfec ted between patients, or discarded if they are not amenable to proper cleaning and disinfection. Gloves sh ould be worn when handling items from patients carrying zoonotic pathogens or any items that are visibly soiled. Litter boxes should be cleaned out at least daily, and completely emptied and disinfected between patients. Ideally, litter boxes should not be handled by pregnant women, however if daily cleaning and disinfection are pe rformed properly, the risks are minimized. DISINFECTANT SELECTION There is no \"standard\" disinfection progra m that can be used in all veterinary clin ics, as clinic environment, surfaces, caseload, general practices and other factors influence disi nfectant choices. Selecti on of a disinfectant for a particular purpose should take into account the product's spec trum of activity, susceptibility to inactivation by organic matter, potential pathogens in the environment, compatibility with soaps and detergents, toxicity for personnel and animals, contact time required, residual activity , corrosiveness, environmental effects and cost ( Tables 5 and 6 ).

Because of the toxicity of some cold sterile solutions, the time required to achiev e sterilization using these chemicals, and the availability of autoclaves for sterilization, there is minimal indication for the use of cold sterilization . Its main indication is for sterilization of items that cannot tolerate steam sterilization, such as endoscopes. Although cold sterilization can be an effect ive means of sterilizing instruments, misuse can result in ineffective sterilization . Potential problems include the use of inappropriate solutions, improper preparation of solutions (i.e. inadequate concentration), inadequate cont act time, inadequate replacement/refreshment of solution, or inadequate removal of organic debris from equipment prior to immersion in solution. Commonly used disinfectants such as alcohol, iodophors, phenolics and most quaternary ammonium compounds are not effective sterilants and therefore are not acceptable for use on items intended to be used in su rgical or other invasive procedures. Of the chemical sterilants, only glutaraldehyde and stabilized hydrogen peroxide-based compounds are effective at sterilizing instruments, and then only if the so lutions are prepared and maintained prop erly, and allowed adequate contact time. Prolonged contact time (e.g. 10 hours) is required for sterilization using these solutions. Therefore, cold sterilization is not a means for rapid sterilization of surgical inst ruments that have been inadvertently contaminated during surgery or for surgical instruments that will be used freque ntly on different patients throughout the day. In some veterinary clinics, disinfectant solution s of other kinds in which a set of inst ruments is routinely kept are frequently referred to as \"cold sterile.\" Such misuse of this term sh ould be avoided, as instruments kept in disinfectant solutions other than glutaraldehyde or high-level sterilants should not be used for surgical or other invasive procedures. Instruments must be cleaned to remove all visible organic debris (including blood) before placing them in a clean, fresh cold sterilant solution in order for the procedure to be effective. Most chemical sterilants come in solutions consisting of two parts that, when combined, form what is referred to as an \"activated\" solution. Refer to the product's label for the shelf life of the activated solution. Cold sterilant must be rinsed off all instruments using sterile saline or water before they are used, as some of these compounds (particularly glutaraldehyde) can be irritating to tissues. As with all other chemicals used in a veterinary clinic, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for these products must be readily available to all personnel who work with them and around them. Disinfectant solutions in which a set of instruments is routinely kept are often referred to as \"cold sterile.\" Such misuse of this term should be avoided, as such instruments are rarely, if ever, truly sterile. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [36] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance MAINTENANCE OF ENDOSCOPES Proper cleaning and maintenance of endoscopes ar e important to prolonging the useful life of the instrument, but cleaning and disinfection are also important from an infectious disease control aspect. Endoscopes are semi-critical equipment, and as such require high level disinfection when used in humans. In veterinary medicine, high level disinfection is required prior to use in relatively sterile areas (e.g. urinary tract), but thorough low level disinfections is considered adequate for use in non-steril e areas (e.g. gastrointestinal tract, upper respiratory tract) if a transmissible infectio us disease was not suspected in the previous patient and the subsequent patient is not signi ficantly immunocompromised. Manufacturers typically provide detailed reprocessing (clean ing and disinfection) instructions for their instruments, which should be readily available as a refe rence for staff members responsible for the care of endoscopes. If the endoscope was purchased second hand an d the reprocessing instructio ns were not provided, it is important to contact the manufacturer to obtain a copy. Some general guidelines regarding endoscope maintenance include: Endoscopes must be meticulously cleaned immediately after every use. Endoscopes typically have several moving or detachable parts and small channels in which moisture, debris and discharge can become trapped. Cleaning must be performed as soon as possible in order to prevent debris from drying onto surfaces, as this can make the debris considerably harder to remove . Prior cleaning is crucial to effective disinfection. All instrument and suction channels must be thoroughly cleaned after each use , even if the channels were not used during the procedure. Failure to clean these channels is a common error which can result in accumulation of debris, bacteria and biofilms within the instrument. Not only does this pose risk of disease transmission to subsequent patients, but it c an also confound sample collection and culture. Rinsing and drying of the endoscope are also critical to proper ma intenance. Failure to rinse off detergents or disinfectants can lead to significant irrita tion of the tissues of the next patient. Chemical sterilants (e.g. glutaraldehyde) are typically used for high-level disinfection or sterilization of endoscopes, as most cannot be steam-sterilized (autoclaved). Consult the manufacturer's instructions regarding what methods can be safely used for any particular endoscope. If a chemic al sterilant is used, a timer should be used to measure the exact contact time - too short a time may result in an inadequate microbial killing, while too long a time may result in damage to the instrument. MAINTENANCE OF CLIPPERS Use of good-quality clippers and maintenance of clipper bl ades are of great importance. Improper clipper use or maintenance can result in skin trauma, with subsequent ri sk for infection, or transmi ssion of opportunistic pathogens between patients. Following routine use of clippers on areas of unbroken skin and non-infectious animals, basic cleaning with a stiff brush to remove visible dirt and hair from the blade is lik ely adequate. More thorough cleaning and disinfection of the blade, as described below, should be done periodically as well, depending on how often the clippers are used. Clippers should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after every use on an animal with a potentially transmissible infection (e.g. an animal with diarrhea), on any area where the skin or hair is significantly contaminated with feces, urine, blood or other body fluids, and before and after use on an area where the skin is brok en (especially if there is evidence of skin infection). First, a stiff brush should be used to remove visible dirt and hair from the blade, and a soapy, wet cloth used to remove any visible debris from the body of the clippers. The clipper blades can then be ster ilized using a chemical sterilant (e.g. glutaraldehyde) or by autoclavi ng. The body of the clippers c an be sterilized using hydrogen peroxide vapour or ethylene oxide (if available). Otherwise, after removing all visible debris, thorough manual wiping with a cloth wetted with a sta ndard disinfectant solution should be performed, paying particular attention to the small crevices of the device and allowing for adequate contact time with the disinfectant. Refer to the clipper's instruction manual to determine what degree of contact with liquid the clippers can safely withstand. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [37] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance LAUNDRY (Modified from Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance, 2007) Although single-use, disposable items are ideal from an in fectious disease control aspect, such items can also produce tremendous waste. Laundry is therefore a very important component of infectious disease control in the clinic setting. Although soiled linens are a potential sour ce of microorganisms, with appropriate hygienic handling, storage and processing of clean and soiled linens, the risk of disease transmission from these items can be reduced to an almost negligible level. Linens and special clothing used in veterinary clinics (e.g . cage blankets, towels, surgical drapes, surgical gowns, scrubs, lab coats) can be an important means of transporti ng pathogens from one area to another within the clinic, and to areas outside the clinic. As a result, clinic clothing (e.g. scrubs, lab coats) should always be washed on- site or sent to a commercial laundry facility that is equipped to handle laundry from medica l/veterinary facilities. This helps to prevent transmission of pathogens to fa mily members, family pet s and the general population. Personnel should change into clinic clothes at the beginning of their shift and back into street clothes at the end of their shift. Clinics should have approp riate laundry facilities or laundry serv ices to accommodate the need to change clothing daily, or more frequently if required. Microbial numbers on soiled linens (e.g. towels, blankets) and clothing are significantly reduced by dilution and during the mechanical action of washing and rinsing. Linens used in veterinary clinics should be laundered together using detergent, and dried in a hot air dryer to promote killing of microorganisms. COLLECTION AND HANDLING Except for linens potentially contaminated with infectious agents (see below), all used linens can be handled in the same way. Heavily soiled linens should be rolled or folded to contain the heaviest contamin ation in the centre of the bundle, without contaminating personal clothing or the environment. Large amounts of solid debris, feces or blood clots should be removed from linen with a gloved hand and disposable tissue or paper towel, which are then immediately placed in the garbage. Excrement should not be removed by spraying with water or shaking as this may result in contamination of the surr ounding area and personal clothing. BAGGING AND CONTAINMENT Linens should be handled with a minimum of agitation and shaking. Always place soiled linens directly in a hamper or bag designated for dirty laundry. Never place soiled linens on the floor. Laundry bags should be tied securely and not over-filled. Carts and hampers should be cleaned after each use. Laundry bags should be washed after each use. They can be washed in the same cycle as the linens they contain. TRANSPORT Linen transported by cart should be moved in such a way that the risk of cross-contamination is mi nimized (e.g. avoid moving the cart from potentially contaminated area s (runs/kennel area) to cleaner areas (prep room, surgery). Clean linen should be transported and stored in a manner that prevents contamination. If laundry carts are used, separate carts should be used for clean and dirty linens. Linens contaminated with gross organic material must be pre-cleaned by hand to remove such material prior to laundering. It is not possible to adequately clean laundry by machine when gross organic material is present, and laundering such items can lead to contamination of other laundered items. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [38] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance WASHING AND DRYING Use of normal machine washing with a commercial laundry detergent and machine drying are sufficient to greatly reduce the numbers of most significant infe ctious pathogens from most soiled linens. If laundry is washed in cold water, an appropriate co ld-water detergent must be used according to label directions. It should not be assumed that hot water washing will disinfect or sterilize items. High temperature (> 71.1\u00baC) washing can significantly reduce bact erial numbers, but standard household washing machines do not typically reach this temperature, even if the hot water setting is used. The heat and drying effects of tumble drying are a critical step in the laundering process, and account for a large proportion of the decrease in bacterial counts achieved. Therefore, laundry should not be considered clean until it has also been dried completely, i deally using the highest heat possible. o Line-drying linens outdoors may have the advantage of also exposing the surface of the fabrics to ultraviolet (UV) light, if they are hung to dry in t he sun. However, it would be difficult to expose all surfaces to sunlight, and thick fabrics, items made of multiple fabric layers and those containing seams may protect bacteria from UV exposure. Also, the ant imicrobial action of the high heat of tumble drying is lost if linens are line-dried, therefore tumble dryi ng is recommended, especially for any materials that may have been contaminated with a transmissible infectious pathogen. LAUNDRY FROM INFECTIOUS CASES Laundry from potentially infectious cases s hould be treated separately from other laundry. Linens should be collected in a separate linen bag and washed and dried separately. For linens with gross contamination of a potentially infectious nature (e.g. feces from a diarrheic animal, discharge from an infected wound, urine from an animal with a urinary tract infection), as much organic material as possible should be removed by hand (using gloves and disposable tissue or paper towel, as described above). The items should then be pre- soaked in bleach solution (9 parts water:1 part household bleach) for 10- 15 minutes prior to machine washing. Bleach should also be added to the household detergent in the washing machine as per label instructions. PROTECTION OF PERSONNEL Personnel need to protect themselves from potential transmission of pathogens from soiled linens by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (e.g. gl oves, gown, apron) when handling soiled linens. Personnel should wash their hands whenever gloves are changed or removed, or if they come in contact with soiled linens while not wearing gloves. Hand hygiene stat ions should be available in laundry area. COMMERCIAL LAUNDRY FACILITIES A company which specializes handling laundry from medical/ve terinary facilities should be used if it is not possible for laundry to be cleaned on-site. Adequate separation of clean and dirty laundry in the transport truck is essential to ensure that there is no opportunity for mixing or cross-contamination of clean and dirty linens. Laundry should not be considered clean until it has also been dried. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [39] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance WASTE MANAGEMENT Veterinary biomedical waste is a potential source of both zoonotic and non-zoonotic infectious pathogens. Therefore, it is important to handle all such waste app ropriately. In Canada, biomedical waste is defined and regulated at the provincial/territorial and municipal levels (usually by the Department/Min istry of the Environment). Biomedical waste typically includes sharps, tissues ( anatomic waste), highly contaminated (e.g. blood-soaked) materials, and dead animals. National guidelines for biomedical waste management have been published through the Canadian Council of Minist ers of the Environment (CCME), and are available at http://www.ccme.ca/assets/pdf/pn_1060_e.pdf. However, individual provinces and territories may have more stringent regulations. Details are usually readily available through provincial and municipal web sites, or through provincial veterinary associations. Small clinics in rural areas, where biomedical waste di sposal services are not be readily available, may be able to make arrangements with a local human hospital or other healthcare institution to have their waste disposed of with that of the human facility. Although it is beyond the scope of these guidelines to descr ibe veterinary biomedical waste management in detail, the following basic information may be helpful: Used sharps are considered biomedical waste and should be disposed of in accordance with regulations from municipal and provincial/territorial authorities. Use approv ed, puncture-resistant sharps disposal containers to remove, store and dispose of used sharps such as needles , blades, razors and other items capable of causing punctures. Non-anatomical waste saturated or dripping with blood (e.g. blood-soaked lap sponges and gauze) are also best disposed of as biomedical waste . Liquid waste such as chest fluid, abdominal fluid, irrigating so lutions, suctioned fluids, excretions and secretions usually may be poured carefully down a toilet or any drain connected to a sanitary sewer or septic tank. Provincial and territorial regulations may dictate the maximu m volume of blood or body fluids that is permitted to be poured into the sanitary sewer. If there is likely to be splashes or sprays during this disposal process, appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn. All other waste , such as general office waste and non-sharp medical equipment, may be disposed of in the regular waste stream, and requires no special treatment other than containment during disposal and removal. Waste should be contained in a leak-proof container or b ag that can be discarded with the waste (e.g. a plastic garbage bag). Urine and feces are not considered biomedical waste, nor is disposable equipment that has come in contact with an infectious animal (e.g. examination gloves, gowns, bandage materi als that are not saturated with blood). Nonetheless, some of these materials may pose a risk to c linic personnel, patients and wa ste disposal personnel in terms of their potential to transmit infectious pathogens. Therefore, additional precautions should be taken to minimize contamination of the clinic environment an d the risks to people and animals from potentially infectious waste . These may include double-bagging of materials from isolation areas, and keeping waste cans covered to prevent access by curious animals and to prevent spillage if a waste can is knocked over. If contamination of the inside of a waste can occurs (e.g . due to a tear in a garbage bag), the container should be thoroughly disinfected after emptying. Precautions should be taken to minimize contamination of the clinic environment and the risks to people and animals from potentially infectious waste. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [40] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance SURGERY All surgical procedures cause breaks in the normal defensive barriers of the skin or mucous membranes. These breaks are therefore accom panied by an inherent risk of surgical site infection (SSI). Surgical site infections can oc cur sporadically or as part of an outbreak, and can have devastating outcomes in some situations. Good general infection control practices (e.g. hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection) are important for prevention of SSIs. Specific measures pertaining to surgery include maint enance of the surgical environment, use of appropriate personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, disinfection and sterilization of anesthetic equipment and surgical instruments, appropriate use if peri-operative antimicrobials, and surgical site care before, during and after the procedure. Many of the recommendations below are already considered minimum practice standards in Canada. Actual requirements may vary somewhat by province. Veterinarians should contact t heir provincial veterinary asso ciation for details about the specific regulations in their area. SURGICAL ENVIRONMENT Having a well designed and maintained surgical area or suite is very important. In order to keep the surgical environment as clean as possible, this area should be sepa rated from personnel and animal traffic, and be easy to thoroughly clean and disinfect. A surgical area should only be used for surgical procedures , and should not be used for non-surgical procedures between surgeries. Entr ance to the area should be restricted at all times to minimize traffic in the room. The number of people in the surgical area has been identified as a risk factor for SSI in small animals, so only essential personnel should be allowed in the area during any surgical procedure. All personnel participating in the procedure, including those performing surgical nursing duties, must be trained in operating room procedures. PERSONNEL CONSIDERATIONS PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT All personnel in the surgical area should wear designated surgical scrubs, a surgery cap or hair bonnet, and a nose-and-mouth mask when surgery is underway, regardless of whether or not they ar e directly involved in the procedure itself. Scrubs worn in surgery should not be worn when handling or treating other patients , and at a minimum should be covered with a lab coat when outside the surg ery area (see Personal Protective Equipment under Routine Procedures). Personnel directly involved in the procedur e should also wear a sterile gown and sterile gloves. HAND HYGIENE A surgical hand scrub should be performed before putting on a sterile gown and sterile gloves. Various surgical scrub techniques have been desc ribed. Most commonly, a structured five-minute surgical scrub with antibacterial soap is used: Remove all hand and arm jewelry A pick or file should be used to clean all dirt out from underneath the fingernails. If hands or arms are visibly dirty, they should initially be washed with soap and water as per standard hand hygiene protocols. Hands and forearms are then lathered with antibacterial soap. Scrubbing with a bristled sponge proceeds proximally from t he fingertips to the forearms, just below the elbow. Additional details can be found in a surgical reference book. A sterile towel must be used to dry the hands before donning a gown and gloves. Application of commercial alcohol-chlorhexidine combinations can be used as a replacement for traditional surgical scrubbing. This approach has been shown to be equa lly effective at removing bacteria, and is less time consuming and irritating to the skin, particularly if a surgic al hand scrub is required multiple times in a day. If such a commercial combination is used, hands must be thoroughly washed and fingernails carefully cleaned initially. It is also critical to follow the label directions regardi ng the amount of product to use and how to apply it. A surgical area should only be used for surgical procedures. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [41] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance EQUIPMENT CONSIDERATIONS STERILIZATION OF INSTRUMENTS Complete sterilization of surgical instruments and any items that might come in contact with the surgical field is a crucial procedure. Poor sterilization or inappropriate handling of instruments after sterilization can result in contamination of sterile tissues durin g surgery. Steam sterilization (i.e. autoclaving) is most commonly used in veterinary clinics. Quality control testing of aut oclaves should be performed regularly and documented: Sterility indicator strips should be placed in every surgical pack. External autoclave indicator tape is not a reliable indicator of the sterility of a pack's internal contents. Biological sterility indicators should be used periodically. These indicators contain bacterial spores, which are the most resistant form of bacteria. After being autoclaved, the indicator is submitted for te sting to ensure that all of the spores have been killed by the sterilization process. In human healthcare facilities it is recommended that these indicators are used daily, or at least weekly. Weekly or bi-weekly use is likely adequate in most ve terinary clinics, depending on how heavily the autoclave is used. A biological sterilit y indicator should also be used in the next cycle anytime the autoclave has been moved, repaired, or if there has been any other indication of sterilization failure. Flash sterilization should not be used unless absolutely necessary for em ergencies only. Flash sterilization should never be used for surgical implants. Countertop \"cold st erile\" disinfectant solutions should not be used for any surgical instruments or implants, as these solutions typica lly do not achieve true steriliza tion of the instruments they contain (see Cold Sterilization on page 35). DISINFECTION OF ANESTHETIC EQUIPMENT Endotracheal tubes: In human medicine, endotracheal (ET) tubes are typically considered single-use devices, but reuse of ET tubes has become more common with the rising costs of healthcare. These tubes can be effectively re- sterilized between patients using glutaral dehyde or ethylene oxide gas, although t he physical integrity of the cuffs in particular can be compromised by repeated sterilization with these methods. These tubes are considered semi- critical equipment, and as such should be subjected to high-le vel disinfection or sterilization. In veterinary medicine, it is impractical to discard ET tubes after a single use, but glutaraldehyde or ethylene ox ide gas sterilization may not be readily available. Evidence-based gui delines for reuse of ET tubes in veterinary medicine are not available. Nonetheless, at an absolute minimum , ET tubes must be thoroughly cleaned (inside and outside) with hot water and detergent immediately after use to prevent any disc harge or debris from drying and forming a biofilm on the device. Tubes should then be soaked in a solution of a quaternary ammonium compound (QAC), rinsed thoroughly and dried prior to being reused. It is important to test the integrity of the cuff before every use to ensure the device has not been compromised by repeated exposure to the disinfectant. Anesthetic gas tubing and rebreathing bags: Although the tubing connecting the anesthetic machine to the patient's endotracheal tube should not come in direct contact with the patient, moisture and condensation often accumulate in the tubes and may contain microorganisms fr om the animal's airway. In human medicine, this equipment is also typically single-use. As for ET tubes, evidence-based guidelines for reuse of this equipment in veterinary medicine are not available. At a minimum , gas tubing should routinely be washed thoroughly with hot water and detergent and hung to dry at the end of the day' s procedures, or more often if they are heavily used. If there is visible discharge in the tubing, or if the animal has a known or suspected respiratory tract infection, the tubing should be washed with hot water and detergent, soaked in a solution of a QAC, rinsed with water and dr ied prior to being reused. Rebreathing bags should be cleaned/disinfected as for the associated gas tubing, as they also come in contact with the expired air from the patient. If an animal has a known or suspected transmissible respiratory tract infection, filters are available which can be placed between the ET tube and the rest of the anesthetic circuit in order to help protect the equipment from contamination. Qualit y control testin g of autoclaves should be performed re gularl y. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [42] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance PERI-OPERATIVE ANTIMICROBIALS Administration of peri-operative (i.e. before, during and a fter surgery) antimicrobials is an important and complex issue. The goal of peri-operative antim icrobial therapy is to reduce the risk of post-operative infection, while minimizing the negative impact on the patient's natural microflora and t he risk of antimicrobial-associated complications such as diarrhea. There is currently very little objective information about the need for antimicrobials for spec ific veterinary procedures, as well as the optimal choice of drug(s), timing and dosages. Antimicrobials are indicated in clean-contaminated, contaminated and dirty procedures. The need for antimicrobial prophylaxis in clean procedures is unclear. In human medicine, antimicrobials are no t typically recommended for clean procedures such as arthroscopy, however there are conflicting opinions. Regardless, it is unclear whether recommendations from human medicine should be directly extrapolated to veterinary procedures, because ther e are obvious differences in post-operative incision care and patient environment for animals, which may increase the risk of infection. The need for peri-operative antimicrobial therapy for different procedures, particularly clean procedures, requires further research. Concerns with this practice that currently exist include inappropriate timing of administration (i.e. too far in advance of surgery or starting after surgery), excessive duration of therapy, inadequate dosing and inappropriate drug choice. If peri-operative antimicrobials are used , they should be administered so that therapeutic levels are present at the surgical site at the time of first incision. This typica lly requires parenteral (i.e. not oral) administration of an antimicrobial approximately one hour before surgery. If the surgical time is longer than two half-lives of the drug(s), then an additional dose should be given during the surgery. In human medicine, it has been shown that starting antimicrobial therapy after surgery is no more effective t han not using antimicrobials at all. Typically, antimicrobials are not needed after surgery since the highest-risk time for c ontamination of the surgical site (i.e. during the surgery itself) is already passed. Starting antimicrobial therapy afte r surgery is no more effective than not usin g antimicrobials at all. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [43] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance SURGICAL SITE MANAGEMENT PRE-OPERATIVE CARE Pre-operative management of the surgical site may be very important, but there has been very little research in this area in veterinary medicine. The goal of pre-operative surgical site management is to eliminate potential pathogens without creating a physical environment that may increase bacterial colonization or infection post-operatively. If the patient's hair coat is visibly dirty, bat hing the animal before surgery is reasonable if there is adequate time for the hair coat to dr y before the procedure. In humans, it has been suggested that any method of hair removal can be associated with higher SSI rates, but obviously this cannot be avoided for the vast ma jority of procedures in veterinary medicine. Shaving the surgical site the night before has been associated with higher SSI rates in humans, therefore clipping (not shaving) of the surg ical site should only be performed right before surgery . Care must be taken to avoid damaging the skin during this procedure, as abrasions provide sites for invasion and pro liferation of opportunistic bacteria. Use of good quality, well-maintained clippers and blades he lps to reduce the risk of skin abrasions. If skin lesions around the surgical site are noted before or after surgery, the finding should be recorded and investigated, to determine whether equipment maintenan ce and/or personnel training need to be improved. Animals should not be clipped in the surgery area/suite itself . A \"prep\" area outside of surgery area should ideally be used for this and any other pre-operative procedures. Skin preparation after clipping is also important. Typical practices include thoroughly cleaning and scrubbing the site with antibacterial soap, followed by application of alcohol, and finally application of a chlorhexidine or i odine solution. Potential problems that need to be avoided include: Failure to prepare a large enough area of skin Inadequate initial cleaning with soap and water Contamination of preparation solutions Inadequate contact time with the antiseptic Contamination of the area during or afte r preparation due to improper technique If skin preparation solutions (e.g. antibacterial soap and water, alcohol, chlorhexidine, iodine) are kept in refillable containers, these containers must be di sinfected when empty before being refill ed. Contamination of these solutions with bacteria that are resistant to their respective antimicrobial actions can occur. Refilling t he containers without disinfecting them can allow these resistant contaminants to accumulate. An outbr eak of catheter site infections was reported in a small animal clinic that was associat ed with contaminated skin preparation solutions. POST-OPERATIVE CARE Post-operatively, a surgical incision site is highly suscept ible to opportunistic infectio n from the bacteria of the patient's own microflora, from the environment or from hospital personnel. Contact with the surgical incision, particularly with bare hands, should be avoided. Covering or bandaging incisions for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours after surgery has been recommended in humans; this is also a reasonable recommendation in small animals in most situations. Bandage changes should be performed using aseptic technique . Pet owners and handlers should be instructed on how to manage an animal with an incision, and the signs for which to look that may indicate the development of a SSI. There is no objective information about the need to cover surgical incisions for more that 48 hours in veterinary or human medicine , but arguments can be made for both sides. Preventing the animal from licking, scratching or otherwise traumatizing the surgical site is critical. Damaging to the healing incision or the skin around it can result in the deposition of opportunistic pathogens, and make it easier for bacteria to grow in the area. Clipping (not shaving) of the surgical site should be performed right before surgery. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [44] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance PATIENT CARE AND HANDLING ISOLATION FACILITIES Every veterinary clinic should have a dedicated isolation area for caring for and housing animals with potentially contagious infectious diseases. The size and stru cture of the isolation facility varies with aspects such as clinic size, types of animal species treated and diseases that are endemic to the area. A proper isolation area should allow for complete physical separation of potentially infectious case s, and have areas for performing routine procedures such as bandage changes, thereby reducing the risk of direct or indirect infection of other hospitalized animals or clinic personnel. Ideally, isolation facilities should be in a low traffic location within the clinic . If an isolation area was not included in the original physical design of the clinic, a potential alternative in some cases may be to convert an examination room into a dedicated isolat ion room. The room selected should be in the area of the lowest human and animal traffic possible. The room should be easy to clean and disinfect and emptied of all non-essential equipment. This type of r oom conversion can be difficult to do effectively depending on the design and layout of the clinic and the room itself. The feasibility of us ing such a room for isolation of infectious animals must be assessed on a facility-by-facility basis. Ventilation should be designed such that movement of air from t he isolation room to other areas of the clinic is prevented (i.e. the room should be vented to the outdoors). If this is not readily possible, a HEPA air filtration system should be used for the air leaving the isolation room. Only the equipment and materials needed for the care and treatment of the individual animal should be kept in the isolation room. This may include items such as a desig nated stethoscope, thermometer, grooming supplies, leash, and muzzle. Supplies of items that will be used on subsequent isolation patient s (e.g. packages of bandage material, boxes of needles and syringes) should not be kept in the isolation area. All items entering an occupied isolation area should be considered infectious and disposed of or disinfected after discharge of the patient. Items should not be removed from the room except for disposal. Use of disposable articles can minimize the need to take soiled items out of the isolation room. When the isolation room is in use by an animal with a potentially contagious infectious disease: Prominent signage should indicate that the animal may be infectious and should outline any additional precautions that need to be taken in addition to routine isolation protocols. Access to the isolation room should be limited to the minimum number of essential personnel necessary to provide appropriate patient care. Every veterinary clinic should have an isolation area for caring for and housing animals with potentially contagious infectious diseases. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [45] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPM ENT AND WASTE IN ISOLATION All personnel entering an isolation area housing a potentially infectious animal, regardle ss of whether they plan on having direct contact with the animal, must wear appropriate personal protective clothing. At a minimum, this consists of a clean lab coat or similar item of outerwear that is only worn in the isolation area and disposable examination gloves. Depending on the diagnosis and the mode of tr ansmission of the disease, shoe covers, masks and eye protection may be required when handling an animal in isolation. Gloves should be discarded after a single use. H ands must be washed immediately after gloves are removed. Similarly, gowns should be discarded (if disposable) a fter a single use. Reusable gowns and lab coats used in isolation should be laundered after a single use. Storing/hanging and reusing a contaminated gown or lab coat inevitably leads to contamination of hands, clot hing and the environment. Therefore, when removed, these items should immediately be placed in t he isolation room garbage or laundry bag. Eye/nose/mouth protection may be re-used with the sa me animal if they are not visibly soiled and can be consistently removed without contamination of t he inside of the eye wear/mask or the immediate environment. Nose and mouth masks should only be reused by the same person. If the eyewear or mask becomes contaminated with body fluids such as urine or feces, it should be replaced with a clean article. Designated personal protective equipment must remain in the isolation room. Contaminated items and waste alike should be bagged prior to being removed from the isolation area. Articles should then immediately be either discarded or taken to the appropriate area for additional cleaning and disinfection. Waste from an isolation room should be treated as potentially infectious. PATIENTS IN ISOLATION Dogs that are housed in isolation should not be walked nor allowed to urinate or defecate in public areas or areas used by other animals. If a dedicated area for walking is not available and the dog needs to be taken out of the primary isolation area to urinate and def ecate, a separate run should be designated for each dog in isolation (i.e. if there is more than one animal in isolation, they cannot all use the same run). The run selected should be as far as possible from runs being used by other animals. The dog should be moved directly to the run by personnel wearing appropriate personal protective clothing. Moving the animal through other areas of the clinic should be avoided as much as possible. Carrying the dog or transporting it on a gurney is ideal in order to minimize the risk of contamination of the floor and clinic environment. The des ignated run should be prominently labeled and disinfected daily. If a patient being housed in isolation absolutely must be taken elsewhere in the clinic for essential procedures such as radiographs or surgery, if at all possible this should be done the end of the day, or during a time where there is the least animal and personnel movement in the clinic. Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn by all personnel involved with the procedure. Other animals should be kept out of the procedure area. The procedure area should be thoroughly cleaned and di sinfected as soon as the procedure is completed. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [46] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance FOOTBATHS AND FOOTMATS Footbaths or footmats are used to decrease (but do not eliminate) microbiological contamination of footwear. Footbaths are shallow container s containing a disinfectant solution. Foot mats are spongy commercial mats covered with a durable, easy-to-clean material that can be saturated with disinfectant. Footmats can increase compliance because they are easier to use, but they are more exp ensive and more difficult to maintain than footbaths. Data regarding the need for and efficacy of footbaths and footmats are very limited, and there is essentially no information relating to small animal clinics specifica lly. It has been shown that footbaths can reduce bacterial contamination of footwear in large animal clinic settings. Although other sources of contamination have been shown to be more significant in infection transmission, footw ear and floor surfaces cannot be overlooked in an infection control program in a small animal clinic, because patients so often have extensive direct contact with the floor. Possible problems with footbath or footmat use must al so be considered. Footbath or footmat use is almost invariably accompanied by spillage of disinfectant solution; this can create a slipping hazard on smooth floor surfaces, which are typically present in small animal clin ics. Certain disinfectants can also damage floor surfaces with prolonged contact. Footbaths or footmats should be considered when personn el will be walking on a surface that could potentially be more contaminated than the general floor environment, and where spread of this contamination might pose a risk to patients or personnel. The most likely area where footbaths or footmats could be useful would be at the exit of an animal housing area (e.g. dog run) that contains a potentia lly infectious case, and where clinic personnel will be walking in and out of the potentially contaminated area. The need for routine use of footbaths or footmats in isolation areas where animals are confined in cages is questionable. If footbaths or footmats are used, selection of an appropriate disinfectant is important. The disinfectant should be effective against the specific pathogen(s) of concern, stable in solution, and effective with a relatively short c ontact time (see Tables 5 and 6). Oxidizing agents such as accelerated/stabilized hydrogen peroxid e and peroxygen disinfectants are ideal. The solution should be changed daily, or sooner if gross contamination of the bath/mat occurs. Maintaining proper concentrati ons of active disinfectants in footbaths and footmats is essential for proper performance. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [47] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance WOUNDS AND BANDAGES Wound infections can be caused by ma ny bacterial pathogens, some of which can be transmitted between animals or between animals and people. One example is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which can infect both people and animals, but there are a variety of other pathogens that are of c oncern. This includes both multidrug resistant (e.g. S. aureus , S. pseudintermedius , enterococci) and susceptible bacteria. Wounds provide a prime site for invasion of opportunistic bacteria such as th ese. Even wounds that are not known to be infected should be protected from contaminatio n by veterinary personnel and from the environment to reduce the risk of secondary infection. Sterile gloves should be worn for debridement, treat ment and bandaging of deep wounds and those involving vital structures. Clean, non-sterile examination gloves are adequate for these procedures if the wound is more superficial. Bandages must be kept dry to prevent bacterial strike-though. Th is means keeping the outside of the bandage as dry as possible, and also including sufficient absorbe nt material in the bandage itself to prevent discharge from the wound from soaking through the bandage. If the outside of a bandage appears wet, it should be changed. Used bandage materials should be considered infectious . Such materials should be placed directly in the garbage and not on the floor, examination table or any ot her surface. The risk of contamination and spread of any pathogen is likely higher for wounds with a large amount of discharge. Wound treatments and bandage changes should be perform ed in an area that is easily disinfected (e.g. on an examination table). Wound irrigation and lavage should be performed in such a way that the fluid used is contained (e.g. in a sink or tub, or with disposable absorbent material). Bandages should NOT be changed in the kennel/ward area where there is a higher risk of cross-contamination of other patients. Hands should be washed thoroughly after changing a bandage. Equipment used for bandage changes (e.g. bandage scissors) should be disinfected between uses. Animals with known MRSA or multi-resistant bacterial w ound infections are likely to be colonized with these pathogens at other body sites as well (e.g. nose, rectum , intestinal tract), and should therefore be handled with contact precautions and housed in isolation. Wound infections can be caused by many bacterial pathogens, some of which can be transmitted between animals or between animals and people. Wounds provide a prime site for invasion of opportunistic bacteria. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [48] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance FEEDING OF RAW MEAT Raw meat-based diets for cats and dogs often contain a variety strains of Escherichia coli such as O157:H7. It has also been shown that animals fed raw meat diets may shed higher levels of Salmonella and ESBL Enterobacteria cea in their feces. Raw meat diets and feces from animals fed these diets may pose a risk to hospitalized animals and clinic personnel, and may contami nate the hospital envir onment. Therefore, a policy against the feeding of raw meat to hospitalized animals should be in place . Clients who do not wish to have their animal fe d a commercial kibble diet could consider cooking the pet's normal diet for the duration of the hospit alization period. However, if it is the opinion of the attending veterinarian that changing an animal's diet from a raw meat diet would adversely affect the animal's health, then the following guidelines should be followed: Animals regularly fed raw meat should be housed in isolation and considered infectious. All protocols for handling isolated animals should apply. Raw meat should be kept frozen until the day before feeding. It should be thawed in the refrigerator on the bottom shelf in a sealed container. Any uneaten meat should be promptly discarded in such a way that it will not attract nor be accessible to insects, vermin or other animals. Si gnificant bacterial growth can occur in any meat that is left out at room temperature, even for a short period of time. Any items that come in contact with raw meat (e.g. bowls, storage containers) should be cleaned and disinfected immediately after use. Hand hygiene should be strongly emphasized after hand ling raw meat or any items that have been in contact with raw meat. ADMISSION OF ANIMALS FROM SHELTERS Humane societies, animal shelters and similar facilities typically contain transient, st ressed populations of animals, large numbers of young animals, sick animals and animals with unknown health and vaccination status. As such, they should be considered high risk from an infectious disease standpoint . Animals admitted from these facilities should be subjected to a high degree of scrutiny. Recommended practices include: All animals from such facilities should be examined immediately upon arrival. They should not be allowed to come in contact with other animals in the waiting/reception area. If there is an ongoing outbreak of an infectious disease at an animal shelter, admission of animals from the facility for elective procedures should be restricted (i.e. admission for emergencies only). Otherwise, all animals from the facility should be admitted directly to isolation. Animals from these facilities should be housed separately from other patients, if possible. Use of a separate ward, separate area of a ward or leaving empty ca ges between those animals and other patients can be used, depending on the degree of separation requir ed for the diseases of primary concern. For elective procedures (e.g. spay, neuter): All dogs, cats and ferrets must have been vaccinated agai nst rabies at least 2 weeks prior to presentation if they are more than 14 weeks old. All dogs and cats must have received other routine vaccinations (as needed according to geographic region) at least twice if they are more than 14 weeks old, with the most recent vaccine administered at least 2 weeks prior to presentation. All animals must have been dewormed with a broad spectrum anthelmintic at least 7-10 days prior to admission. Animals with abnormalities including, but not limited to, fever, oculonasal discharge, coughing/sneezing, diarrhea and potentially infectious skin conditions should not be admitted for elective procedures. Depending on the geographic region and time of year, flea treatment prior to admission may also be required. It should be clinic policy not to feed raw meat to hospitalized animals. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [49] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance SAFETY OF CLINIC PERSONNEL BITES AND SCRATCHES Bites and scratches are an inherent risk in veterinary medicine and a common cause of occupational injury and illness. In a survey of veterinarians from the USA, appr oximately two-thirds had sustained a major animal-related injury at one time. Bites and scratches accounted for just ov er one-third of these injuries. Up to 60% of dog bites and 80% of cat bites require medical attention. Approximat ely 3% to 18% of dog bites and 20% to 50% of cat bites become infected. Most dog and cat bite wound infections are caused by a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. In general, veterinary personnel should be able to recognize behaviour in animals and situations that are associated with an increased tendency for an animal to bite. Professi onal judgment must be exercised to guide bite prevention practices. Personnel should take all necessary precautions to prevent animal-related injuries in the clinic. These may include physical restraint or chemical restraint (sedation or anesthesia) of an animal. Appropriate equipment (e.g. different sizes of muzzles, bite-resist ant gloves, catch pole, cat bags) should be readily available. Such equipment should also be as easy to clean as possible. Experienc ed veterinary personnel rather than owners should restrain animals for procedures whenever possible. Personnel must al ways be aware of changes in their patients' behaviour which may precede attempts to bite. Veterinary personnel should not let client perceptions or attitudes prevent them from using appropriate bite-prevention measures (e.g. muzzling). If anyone is bitten or scratched by an animal: Immediately wash the wound thoroughly with plenty of soap and water. Report the incident to the local public health unit. o If a bite occurred, the rabies vacci nation status of the animal must be noted Seek medical attention as soon as possible for any bite that: o is on a hand or is over a joint o is over a prosthetic device or an implant o is in the genital area o is over a tendon sheath, such as bite on the wrist or the ankle o causes a large amount of tissue damage (e.g. a deep tear or tissue \"flap\") Medical attention should also be sought for any bite (particu larly from a cat) sustained by a person with any of the following conditions: Compromised immune system (e.g. HIV/AI DS, transplant or chemotherapy patients) Chronic swelling (edema) in the area that was bitten If the person has had his or her spleen removed Liver disease, diabetes, lupus or other chronic systemic disease If the bitten area becomes increasingly painful or swollen, if the wound develops a discharge, or if the person develops a fever or swollen lymph nodes, consult a physician as soon as possible. A physician will decide (in some cases in consultation wi th public health personnel) if antimicrobial therapy, tetanus vaccination, rabies vaccination, or any additional treatment (e.g. lavage, debridement, sutures) are necessary. Most bite wounds are not sutured in order to promote drainage and reduce the risk of infection. Emergency contact information (i.e. physician, public heal th department) should be clearly posted in the clinic. All bites or scratches should be reported to the clinic in fection control practitioner (ICP) and the injury documented. Bites and scratches should not be considered \"part of the job\" and summarily dismissed. Even seemingly small, innocuous injuries can develop severe complications. Regu lar review of injuries is useful to identify trends in behaviour that may be associated with injuries and to develop protocols to reduce the risk of injuries. Documentation is also important for employees in the event t hat serious health problems subsequently develop. All animal bites should be reported to the lo cal public health unit due to the risk of rabies exposure . INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [50] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance SHARPS Injuries from needles and other sharp implements are comm on in veterinary medicine but are largely preventable. Although there is not the level of risk of bloodborne pathogen exposure in veterinary practice as there is in human medicine, serious outcomes can result following needlestick or other sharps injuries, including significant trauma, secondary infection and drug reaction (i.e. toxic, allergic, idiosyncratic). Proper sharps handling practices are a practical yet effective way of reducing workplace injuries in veterinary clinics. Use appropriate barriers (e.g. closed toed shoes) and safe work practices when using sharp instruments and devices (e.g. needles, scalpels, etc.), after proce dures and when cleaning used instruments. Never remove needle caps by mouth. Do not bend or manipulate needles in any way. Do not pass uncapped needles to another person. Ensure proper animal restraint to reduce inadvertent needlestick injuries from animal movement. Do not recap needles by hand. If recapping is required, use the \"one-handed sc oop\" technique (see below), forceps or a needle cap holder. Ensure that approved point-of-use sharps disposal containers are located everywhere needles are handled. These containers are puncture-resistant, leak- proof, and prevent removal (both accidental and intentional) of discarded sharps. Always dispose of sharps immediately in an approved sharps disposal container. Never dispose of needles or other sharps into anything other than an approved sharps container , even if they are capped or otherwise contained. This reduces the risk of accidental injury to veterinary personnel, patients, clients and non-veterinary personnel (e.g. waste disposal personnel). The most important precaution for prev enting needle-stick injuries is to avoid recapping needles . Recapping needles causes more injuries than it prevents. When it is absolutely necessary to recap needles as part of a medical procedure or protocol: Use a mechanical device such as forceps or hemostats to replace the cap on the needle. Alternatively, the needle can be recapped using the \"one-handed scoop\" technique: o Place the cap on a flat horizontal surface. o Holding the syringe with the attached needle, or the needle hub alone (when unattached), scoop up the cap with the needle by sliding the needle tip in side, without touching t he cap with one's other hand. o Once the point of the needle is covered, tighten t he cap by pushing it against an object, or by pulling the base of the needle cap onto the hub of the needle with the same hand holding the syringe . After injecting live vaccines or aspirating body fluids or tissue, the used syringe should be placed in a sharps container with the needle attached. Following most other veterinary procedures, the needle and syringe may be separated for disposal of the needle in the sharps containe r. This is most safely accomplished by using the needle removal device on an approved sharps container, which allows the needle to drop directly into the container without being handled or touched. SHARPS SAFETY FOR CLIENTS Periodically, owners may be required to treat their animals at home with injectable medications (i.e. insulin, subcutaneous fluids). In these situations, it is the responsibility of the attending veterinarian to: Provide (and document) training on how to handle shar ps, including injection and disposal practices. Provide an approved sharps container or give clie nts clear instructions regarding how to obtain one. Ensure that the client is able to safely handle and dispose of sharps. Advise clients that the sharps container should be returned to the clinic for disposal when 3/4 full, and exchanged for a new container (if necessary). Used sharps are considered biomedical waste in veterinary practices. Disp ose of used sharps containers in accordance with regulations from municipal and/or provincial/territorial authorities. Recapping needles causes more injuries than it prevents. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [51] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance DIAGNOSTIC SPECIMEN HANDLING Urine from animals with suspected urinary tract disease, and all feces, aspirates, and swabs should be treated as potentially infectious material. Protective outerwear (e .g. lab coat) and disposable gloves should be worn when handling these specimens. Gloves should be discarded and hands washed immediately after handling these items. Care should be taken to avoiding touching clean items (e.g., microscopes, telephones, food) while handling specimens or before glove removal. A separate refrigerator should be used for diagnostic specimens, which should be cleaned on a regular basis. A designated area of the clinic should be used for specimen processing. This should be separate from treatment and surgery areas so as to decrease the risk of contaminati on of these areas. After proc essing a specimen, materials should be disposed of or stored properly and promptly. Specimen processing areas should be cleaned a nd disinfected immediately after use. Samples from animals with suspected or known infe ctious diseases should be disposed of as infectious waste. Leak-proof plastic containers should be used for specimen storage in a designated refrigerator which does not contain food, vaccines or medications of any kind. o Contamination of the outside of sample container s should be avoided. If the outside of a container becomes contaminated, it should be cle aned and disinfected prior to storage. Sharps such as microscope slides and glass pipette s should be disposed of in approved sharps containers. DENTAL PROCEDURES Dental procedures often entail a signific ant risk of splash exposure involving saliva, blood, and bacteria-laden debris. Procedures such as ultrasonic scaling can result in aerosolization of large numbers of bacteria. There is also potential for personnel to sustain cuts and abrasions from dental equipment or teeth during dental procedures. To reduce the risk of transmission of harmful bacteria from the animal's mouth to veterinary personnel, the person performing the procedure and anyone in the immediate vicinity should wear: Protective outerwear (e.g. desi gnated lab coat, designated scrubs) Disposable gloves Surgical (i.e. nose and mouth) mask Protective eye glasses/goggles, or a full face shield Dental procedures should be performed in a contained area away from other patients, personnel and high traffic areas. Procedure such as bandage changes, wound care or placement of invasive devices (e.g. intravenous catheters, urinary catheters) should nev er be performed in close proximity to a dental procedure due to the risk of contamination by aerosolized bacteria. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [52] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance NECROPSIES Necropsies are high risk procedures bec ause of potential contact with infectious body fluids, aerosols, and contaminated sharps. Non-ess ential persons should not be present during necropsy procedures in order to minimize exposure of personnel to these hazards. Personnel involved in or present at necropsies should wear: Protective outerwear (e.g. desi gnated lab coat, designated scrubs) Disposable gloves Protective eye glasses/goggles, or a full face shield In addition, when opening the body cavities of larger anima ls or for any other heavy cutting, cut-proof gloves which can be washed in the laundry should be used to prevent accidental injury from necropsy blades. Additional precautions for respiratory protection (including environm ental controls and face masks) should be employed if power equipment is used, since these in struments increase the amount of potent ially infected material that becomes aerosolized. It is recommended that in-clinic necropsies not be conducted on any animal suspected of being infected with a pathogen requiring biosafety precautions above the entire body should be s ubmitted to an approved diagnostic laboratory. Ensure that all requirements for shipment of biological samples are met (these can usually be pr ovided by the laboratory in question), including providing notificati on of any suspected infectious disease in order to protect laboratory personnel. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) fo r human pathogens, including many zoonotic pathogens, are available on the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) website at http://www.phac -aspc.gc.ca/msds-ftss/index- eng.php. These sheets list the recommended precautions for handling these pathogens and potentially infectious materials as safely as possible. For more information on risk group classification of infectious agents, visit the American Biological Safety Association website, http:// www.absa.org/riskgroups/index.html. Information on the requirements for the different containment levels needed to handle infectious pathogens can be found in the Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines (2004 edition) which are al so available on the PHAC website at http://www.phac- aspc.gc.ca/publicat/lbg-ldmbl-04/index-eng.php. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [53] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance VACCINATION OF PERSONNEL Vaccination should be considered a final line of protection but is important for certain diseases. Decisions regarding vaccination policies should consider the risk of exposure, t he severity of disease, whether the disease is treatable, the transmissibility of disease, as well as the quality and safety of the vaccine. Rabies : Rabies vaccination is indicated for anyone who has a greater than average risk of exposure to the virus. All veterinary personnel that might have contact with animals should therefore be vaccinated against rabies , except in areas that have been formally declared rabies-free (e.g. Hawaii). This includes lay staff that might have periodic animal contact, such as front office staff. Even animals that are kept indoors can be ex posed to rabies by bats, and the disease may not be suspected on initial admission. Rabies vaccines for humans are generally considered safe and highly effective. In areas where rabies is endemic, rabies titres should be checked every 1-2 years to ensure that protective immunity is maintained, with re-vaccination provided as required. For additional information on rabies vaccination in people, see t he Canadian Immunization Guide, 7th edition (2006) (http://www.phac-aspc.gc .ca/publicat/cig-gci /p04-rabi-rage-eng.php) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rabies website (http://www.c dc.gov/rabies/exposur e/preexposure.html). Tetanus : Although bites and scratches are very low risk for tet anus infection, cuts and sc ratches from other objects or soil contamination of puncture wounds are still a risk. Therefore, tetanus vaccination is indicated in veterinary personnel. Boosters are generally administered every 10 years. Influenza : Human influenza is a common and highly transmissible disease, even though it is not transmissible to companion animals. Infected veterinary personnel can rapidly infect their colleagues and veterinary clinics could act as sources of community infection if infected employees are present. It is reasonable for veterinary clinics to recommend annual influenza vaccination of all personnel (as per the recommendations of the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI)), and to ensure that personnel have time to visit their physician or a vaccination clinic for this purpose. Employees shou ld also be encouraged to stay home if they are ill. TRAINING AND EDUCATION OF PERSONNEL Personnel training and education are essential components of an effective infection co ntrol program. All personnel, including temporary lay personnel, kennel staff, students and volunteers, shoul d receive education and training about injury prevention and infection control dur ing their initial orientation and periodic ally thereafter. Additional training should be provided as recommendations change or if problems with infection control practices are identified. Training should emphasize awareness of the hazards associated with individual work duties, and prevention of zoonotic disease exposure. Staff participation in training should be documented by the infection control practitioner (ICP). A list of additional electronic and print resources that ma y be useful for training purposes can be found under References. All personnel should receive education and training about injury prevention and infection control. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [54] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance CLIENT EDUCATION Client education is t he responsibility of the entire practice team. By helping clients unde rstand infectious and zoonotic disease risks and the basic steps they can take to protect themselves and their animals, they can live happier and healthier lives with their pets. Discussion of zoonotic disease risks should be a routine par t of new pet examinations and new client visits. Client education must also occur when the veterinarian has a reasonable suspicion of a potentially infectious disease, and particularly if the disease is zoonotic. Notification of the owner to this effect must be documented in the patient's medical record. This documentation may also be very im portant legally, should an animal's infection result in human illness. Items to discuss, information to provide to the client in print form, and/or information to document in the medical record may include: What disease is suspected or has been diagnosed How the disease is confirmed, if necessary How the disease is transmitted Risks to members of the household Risks to other in-contact individuals (e.g. elderly grandparents who live elsewhere) Risks to in-contact pets Symptoms in humans Clinical signs in animals How to prevent disease transmission from the pet to people and to other pets How the disease is treated in animals Public health enforcement issues such as quarantine, submission of tissues to labs, etc. Circumstances under which the client shoul d seek medical attention, if applicable CLIENT VISITATION Given the strong bond between owners and their pets, it is understandable when clients wish to visit their hospitalized pets. However, animals carrying transmissibl e infectious pathogens pose a potential risk to other animals at the clinic and at the owner's home, as well as to the clinic employees, the owner and other household members. As a policy, clients should not be allowed to visit animals that are considered potentially infectious. Under extenuating circumstances, such as an ani mal whose condition is imminently life-threatening, owners may be allowed to visit their animal, but the us e of proper personal protective equipment should be demonstrated to the clients and all infection control procedures should be followed , as for clinic personnel involved in the animal's care. As a policy, clients should not be allowed to visit hospitalized animals carrying any suspected infectious disease. Client education is the responsibi lity of the entire practice team. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [55] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance CLINIC PETS It is currently common for veterinary clinics to have resident animals. From an infection control perspective, these animals pose a potential risk for disease transmission, and fr om the health perspective of the clinic pet itself. Clinic animals that have free access within the clinic could be sources of pathogen transmission. Uncontrolled access to waiting room areas could result in a large number of contacts, with the corresponding potential for pathogen transmission. Although there are no objective data quantifyi ng the risks to patients, people or clinic animals themselves, the theoretical risks and lack of a real need for clinic pets indicates a need for consideration of the cost- benefit of keeping clinic pets. Based on the potential risks, it is recommended th at veterinary clinics do not keep such animals, and every attempt should be made to adopt out any existing pets. While suboptimal from an infection control standpoint, if a clinic has a clinic pet, the following recommendations should be considered. The clinic pet should not have access to any patient treatment areas, patient housing areas, examination rooms, isolation, surgery or the patient waiting area. It should not be allowed to wander freely through the kennel/ward areas where it could cross-contaminate kennels. The animal should have a dedicated food and water bowl, litter box, toys, etc. The pet must also re ceive regular health checks and have an appropriate vaccination, deworming and external parasite control program. Clinic pets, particularly cats, should not be allowed to have unsupervised outdoor access beca use of the higher risk of exposure to (and subsequent shedding of) pathogens such as Salmonella and Toxoplasma from hunting birds and rodents. VECTOR CONTROL Some important pathogens can be transmitted by wild rodent s (e.g. mice, rats) or insect vectors (e.g. fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, houseflies). A few of these pests can be true carri ers of certain diseases, meaning they can be infected by or incubate particular pathogens, but many of them can also be non-specific mechanica l vectors that simply move microbes from one area or surface to another. Pest manag ement is an important aspect of effective prevention and control of infectious disease transmiss ion. Pest management practices include: Examination of animals upon arrival for ectoparasit es such as fleas, and treatment with an adulticidal antiparasitic medication prior to admi ssion if ectoparasites are detected. Storing food and garbage in metal or thick plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. Prompt disposal of food waste and other material (e.g. feces) that may attract rodents or insects. Sealing potential pest points-of-entry into buildings. Common methods include the use of caulk, steel wool or mesh wire under doors and around pipes. Installation and maintenance of window screen s to prevent entry of insects into buildings. Elimination of potential rodent nesting sites (e.g. clutter). Removal of standing water (e.g. empty cans, clogged gu tters) outside buildings that can otherwise serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Additional measures may be warranted for the control of spec ific pests. Consultation with a pest control expert is recommended if a particular infestation is present, or for additional guidance and information. From an infection control standpoint, veterinary clinics should never have a resident \"clinic pet.\" INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [56] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance CLINIC DESIGN Clinic design is critical to effectively implementing infection control measures. Unfortunatel y, infection control has not always been considered when designing clini cs. Commonly encountered problems include: High animal and personnel movement in areas where procedures are performed Use of flooring and kennel surfaces that are difficult or impossible to disinfect Inadequate (or absent) isolation facilities Lack of a separate area to examine or treat animals with potentially infectious diseases Lack of sinks in all examination rooms and treatment areas Lack of a separate area for diagnostic specimen processing Lack of a separate area for staff to store personal items and eat In established clinics, correcting these deficiencies can be difficult or im possible, and often expensive. However, practical and cost-effect ive measures can often be underta ken to improve infection control within an existing facility. For example: Place alcohol-based hand sanitizers in patient c ontact areas wherever sink access is inadequate. Provide separate refrigerators for diagnostic specimens, vaccines and medications, and food for human consumption. Alter personnel and animal movement patterns to reduce direct and indirect contact of relatively healthy patients with sick patients. Infection control issues should be considered when desi gning new clinics or when undertaking renovation or expansion of existing clinics. An archit ect with experience designing veterinary clinics should be used, and infection control considerations should be emphasized. Consultation or review of preliminary plans by a veterinary infection control expert is also useful. However, critical assessment of plans with an infection control mindset can readily be performed by any veterinarian. Special emphasis should be given to issues such as: Number and placement of sinks - a sink should be present in every exami nation and procedure room. Overall clinic flow from \"clean to dirty\", with isol ation areas well removed from other animal housing or procedure areas. Use of sealed flooring materials that are amenable to frequent cleaning and disinfection. Separation of animal procedure areas from area s where specimens (i.e. stool) are processed. Provision of a dedicated \"personnel-only\" space fo r breaks, food storage and consumption, and storage of personal items. REPORTABLE DISEASES Certain diseases are immediately reportable to regulatory bodies, often at the time the disease is suspected but still not diagnosed. These diseases vary between countries and tend to focus on exotic pathogens and those of significant zoonotic concern (e.g. rabies). Every veterinary clinic should have a list of r eportable diseases prominently displayed in an area easily accessible to clinic personnel. The clinic's Infection Control Manual should clearly state the required reporting procedures, including contact numbers for the appropriate animal health and/or public health authorities. See Appendix III on page 68 for case management of rabies suspects. Designated staff areas should be set asi de for eating, drinking and breaks. These activities should not occur in any area where animals or diagnostic specimens may be present. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [57] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance APPENDICES APPENDIX I: Detailed Summary of Infection Prevention and Control Best Practices For Small Animal Veterinary Clinics Below is a detailed summary of the contents and key me ssages of this document. This summary can be used for review, and as an infectious disease control checklist, in addition to the clinic audit tool in Appendix II (page 62). 11. Infection prevention and control strategies are designed to protect patients, owners, veterinary personnel and the community . All veterinary personnel should play an active role in protecting every person and animal associated with the veterinary clinic. 12. Decreasing exposure to microorganisms is the most important aspe ct of disease control in most situations. 13. Every veterinary clinic, regardless of type or size, should have a formal infection control program , a written infection control manual that describes the program, and an infection control practitioner (ICP) to coordinate the program. 14. Some form of surveillance (either passive or active) should be practic ed by all veterinary facilities. The keys to passive surveillance are to centralize the avail able data, and to have a designated ICP who compiles and evaluates the data on a regular basis. 15. Routine Practices that are critical to infectio us disease prevention and control: a. Hand hygiene, including: i. Handwashing ii. Use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers b. Risk reduction strategies, particularly those related to: i. Use of personal prot ective equipment (PPE) ii. Cleaning and disinfection iii. Laundry iv. Waste management c. Risk assessment of animals and personnel with regard to: i. Disease transmission ii. Disease susceptibility d. Education i. Veterinary personnel ii. Animal owners iii. Public 16. Hand hygiene is the single most important way to prevent infectio ns in the healthcare setting. Intact skin is the first line of defense against bacteria. Hand hygiene of some kind should be performed: a. Before and after contact with a patient (e specially before performing invasive procedures) b. Before and after contact with items in the patient's environment c. After any contact with or any activity involving the body fluids of a patient d. Before putting on and especially after taking off gloves 17. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is used to protect veterinary pe rsonnel and to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission by clothing to patients, owners, veterinary personnel and the public. a. Street clothes should always be covered by protective outerwear, such as a lab coat, when working in the clinic. b. Protective outerwear, including scrubs, should not be worn outside the clinic. c. Lab coats and gowns worn when handling patients wi th potentially infectious diseases should be laundered after each use. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [58] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance d. Gloves should be worn when contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions and mucous membranes is possible, as well as when cleaning environmental surfaces and when doing laundry if gross contamination of items is present. i. Gloved hands should not be used to touch su rfaces that will be touched by people with non- gloved hands. ii. Gloves should be removed promptly after use and hand hygiene performed immediately. iii. Gloves are NOT a substitute for proper hand hygiene. e. Face protection should be used whenever exposure to splashes or sprays is likely to occur. f. Designated footwear or disposable shoe covers may be required for some patients with infectious diseases. In veterinary clinics, it is important to prevent the spread of infectio us materials present on the floor, as patients and personnel often have very close contact with the floor. 18. Cleaning involves the removal of visible organic matter with soap or detergent, whereas disinfection involves the application of a chemical or other procedure in order to kill the remaining microorganisms. a. Cleaning must always be done before a disinfectant is used. b. Gloves should be worn when cleaning and disinfecting, and hands should be washed after finishing any cleaning activity. c. Selection of a disinfectant for a particular purpose should take into account the product's spectrum of activity, susceptibility to inactivation by organic matter, potential pathogens in the environment, compatibility with soaps and detergents, toxicity for personnel and animals, contact time required, residual activity, corrosiveness, environmental effects and cost. d. Multi-use equipment must be properly cleaned and di sinfected between each patient. There are three categories of multi-use equipment used on patients: critical, semi-critical and non-critical. i. Disinfectant solutions in which a set of instrum ents is routinely kept are often referred to as \"cold sterile,\" but such instruments ar e rarely, if ever, truly sterile. The main indication for cold (chemical) sterilization is for item s that cannot tolerate steam ster ilization, such as endoscopes. 19. Laundry is also an important component of a complete infectious disease control program. a. Linens used in veterinary clinics should be launde red together using detergent, and dried in a hot air dryer to promote killing of microorganisms. i. Laundry from potentially infectious cases shou ld be treated separately from other laundry, including use of bleach in the wash cycle. ii. Linens contaminated with gross organic materi al must be pre-cleaned by hand to remove such material prior to laundering. iii. Laundry should not be considered clean until it has also been dried. b. Clinic clothing (e.g. scrubs, lab coats) should al ways be laundered on-site or sent to a commercial laundry facility that is equipped to handle laundry from medical/veterinary facilities. c. Always place soiled linens directly in a hamper or bag designated for dirty laundry. d. Clean linens should be transported and stor ed in a manner that prevents contamination. e. Personnel should wear appropriate personal protec tive equipment (e.g. gloves, lab coat) when handling soiled linens, and perform hand hygiene when the task is complete. 20. Veterinary clinic waste is a potential source of both zoonotic and non-zoonotic infe ctious pathogens. Therefore, it is important to handle all such waste appropriately. a. Biomedical waste typically includes sharps, tissues (anatom ic waste), highly contaminated (e.g. blood- soaked) materials, and dead animals. b. All waste should be contained in a leak-proof cont ainer or bag that can be discarded with the waste. c. Additional precautions should be taken to minimize contamination of the clinic environment and the risks to people and animals from potentially infectious waste (e.g. body fluids of and disposable equipment that has come in contact with an infectious animal). INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [59] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance 21. All surgical procedures cause breaks in the normal defensive barriers of the skin or mucous membranes, and therefore carry an inherent risk of surgical site infecti on (SSI). Good general infection control practices (e.g. hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection) are important for prev ention of SSIs, but there ar e also specific infection control measures pertaining to surgery that should be considered. a. A surgical area should only be used for surgical procedures. b. All personnel in the surgical area should wear designated surgical scrubs , a surgery cap or hair bonnet, and a nose-and-mouth mask when surgery is underway. i. Scrubs worn in surgery should not be worn when handling or treating other patients, and should be covered with a lab coat outside of the surgical suite. c. Steam sterilization (i.e. autoclaving ) is most commonly used in veteri nary clinics for sterilization of surgical instuments. Quality control testi ng of autoclaves should be performed regularly. d. At a minimum, anesthetic equipment , including endotracheal (ET) t ubes, must be thoroughly cleaned (inside and outside) with hot water and detergent immediately after use to prevent any discharge or debris from drying and forming a biofilm on the devi ce. Additional disinfection may be required for certain pieces of equipment or under particular circumstances. e. Peri-operative antimicrobials are indicated in clean-contaminated , contaminated and dirty procedures. The need for antimicrobial prophylaxis in clean procedures is unclear. i. If peri-operative antimicrobials are used, they should be administered so that therapeutic levels are present at the surgical site at the time of first incision. Starting antimicrobial therapy after surgery is no more effective than not using antimicrobials at all. f. Clipping (not shaving) of the surgical site s hould only be performed right before surgery. Use of good quality, well-maintained clippers and blades helps to r educe the risk of skin abrasions which can provide sites for invasion and proliferation of opportunistic bacteria. g. Refillable containers in which skin preparation so lutions (e.g. antibacterial soap and water, alcohol, chlorhexidine, iodine) are kept must be disinfected when empty before being refilled, as contamination of these soluti ons with bacteria that are resistant to their respective antimicrobial actions can occur. h. Contact with a surgical incision post- operatively, particularly with bare hands, should be avoided. i. Bandage changes should be performed using aseptic technique. ii. Pet owners and handlers should be instructed on how to manage an animal with an incision, and the signs for which to look that may indicate the development of a SSI. 22. Every veterinary clinic should have an isolation ar ea for caring for and housing animals with potentially contagious infectious diseases. a. Only the equipment and materials ne eded for the care and treatment of the individual animal should be kept in the isolation room. All items entering an occupied isolation area should be considered infectious and disposed of or disinfected after discharge of the patient. b. Access to the isolation room should be limit ed to the minimum number of essential personnel. c. All personnel entering an isolation area, regardless of whet her they plan on having direct contact with the animal, must wear appropriate personal protective clothing. i. Designated personal protective equipment must remain in the isolation room. d. All waste from an isolation room shou ld be treated as potentially infectious. e. Dogs that are housed in isolation should not be walked nor allowed to urinate or defecate in public areas or areas used by other animals. 23. As a policy, clients should not be allowed to visit hospi talized animals carrying any suspected infectious disease. 24. Footwear and floor surfaces cannot be overlooked in an infection control program in a small animal clinic, because patients so often have extensiv e direct contact with the floor. a. Footbaths or footmats should be considered when personnel will be walking on a surface that could potentially be more contaminated than the gener al floor environment, and where spread of this contamination might pose a risk to patients or pers onnel. Maintaining proper concentrations of active disinfectants in footbaths and footmats is essential for proper performance. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [60] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance 25. Wound infections can be caused by many bacteria l pathogens, some of which can be transmitted between animals or between animals and people. Wounds provide a prime site for invasion of opportunistic bacteria. a. Sterile gloves should be worn for debridement, treatment and bandaging of deep wounds and those involving vital structures. Clean, non-sterile gloves are adequate for more superficial wounds. b. Bandages must be kept dry to prevent bacterial strike-though. c. Used bandage materials should be considered infectious. d. Wound treatments and bandage changes should be perfo rmed in an area that is easily disinfected. e. Hands should be washed thoroughly after changing a bandage, and equipment used for bandage changes should be disinfected between uses. f. Animals with known multi-resistant bacterial wound infections are likely to be colonized with these pathogens at other body sites as well (e.g. nose , rectum, intestinal tract), and should therefore be handled with contact precautions and housed in isolation. 26. It should be clinic policy not to feed raw meat to hospitalized animals. 27. Animals from shelters and similar facilities should be considered high risk from an infectious disease standpoint. All animals from such facilities should be examined immediately upon arrival without coming in contact with other animals in the waiting/reception area. Animals from these facilities should be housed separately from other patients, if possible. a. For elective procedures (e.g. spay, neuter), all animals should be appropriately vaccinated for their age and treated for relevant intestinal parasites and ecto parasites. Animals with clinical signs compatible with an infectious disease should not be admitted for elective procedures. 28. Personnel should take all necessary precautions to prevent animal-related inju ries (e.g. bites, scratches) in the clinic, including physical or chemical restraint of an ani mal, if necessary. Experienced veterinary personnel rather than owners should restrain animals for procedures whenever possible. a. If anyone is bitten or scratched by an animal: i. Immediately wash the wound thoroughly with plenty of soap and water. ii. Report the incident to the local public he alth unit (due to risk of rabies exposure). iii. Seek medical attention for bite wounds in certain locations on the body, and for any bite wound in certain persons, such as immunocompromised individuals. 29. Proper sharps handling practices are a practical yet effe ctive way of reducing workplace injuries in veterinary clinics. a. The most important precaution for pr eventing needle-stick injuries is to avoid recapping needles. b. Ensure that approved point-of-use sharps disp osal containers are located everywhere needles are handled. Never dispose of needles or other shar ps into anything other than an approved sharps container c. If owners are required to treat thei r animals at home with injectable medi cations, ensure that the client is able to safely handle and dispose of sharps. 30. Urine from animals with suspected urinary tract disease, and all feces, aspirates, and swabs should be treated as potentially infectious material. a. Protective outerwear (e.g. lab coat) and disposable gloves should be worn when handling these specimens. b. Avoiding touching clean items (e.g ., microscopes, telephones, food) while handling specimens or before glove removal. c. A separate refrigerator should be used to store diagnostic specimens, which should be cleaned on a regular basis. d. A designated area of the clinic should be used for specimen processing. 31. Persons performing dental procedures, and anyone in the immediate vicinity, should wear appropriate protective outerwear (e.g. designated lab coat), disposable gloves, a surgical (i.e. nose and mouth) mask and protective eye glasses/goggles, or a full face shield. a. Dental procedures should be performed in a cont ained area away from other patients, personnel and high traffic areas. INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [61] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance 32. Personnel involved in or present at necropsies should wear appropriate protective outerwear (e.g. designated lab coat), disposable gloves, protective eye glasses/goggles, or a full face shield. a. It is recommended that in-clinic necropsies not be conducted on any animal suspected of being infected with a pathogen requiring biosafety precautions above level 2. Instead the entire body should be submitted to an approved diagnostic laboratory. Ensure that all requirements for shipment of biological samples are met, including providing notification of any suspected infectious disease in order to protect laboratory personnel. 33. All veterinary personnel that might have contact with animals should be vaccinated against rabies , except in areas that have been formally declared rabies-f ree. This includes lay staff that might have periodic animal contact, such as front office staff. 34. All personnel should receive education and training about injury prevention and infection control, including temporary lay personnel, kennel staff, students and volunteers. 35. Client education is the responsibility of the entire practice team. a. Discussion of zoonotic and infectious disease risks should be a routine part of new pet examinations and new client visits. b. Client education must also occur when the vete rinarian has a reasonable suspicion of a potentially infectious disease, and particular ly if the disease is zoonotic. 36. From an infection control standpoint, veterinary clini cs should never have a resident \"clinic pet.\" 37. Pest management is an important aspect of effective preventio n and control of infectious disease transmission, including Examination of animals upon arrival for ec toparasites, proper storage of food and waste, sealing potential pest points-of-entry into build ings, elimination of potential rodent nesting sites, and removal of standing water outside buildings. 38. Infection control issues should be considered when designing new clinics or when undertaking renovation or expansion of existing clinics. a. Designated staff areas should be set aside for eati ng, drinking and breaks. These activities should not occur in any area where animals or diagnostic specimens may be present. 39. Every veterinary clinic should hav e a list of reportable diseases prom inently displayed in an area easily accessible to clinic personnel. The clinic's Infection Control Manual should clearly state the required reporting procedures, including contact numbers for the appropria te animal health and/or public health authorities.

INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARY CLINICS [68] Canadian Committee on Antibiotic Resistance APPENDIX III: MANAGEMENT OF RABIES SUSPECTS Animals with acute neurological disease are commonly encountered in companion animal practice. Although in most areas it is rare for these animals to have rabies, rabies must be considered in many situations due to the potential devastating consequences of human exposure to the rabies vi rus. It is important to err on the side of caution when determining whether to declare an animal a \"rabies suspect.\" A history of rabies vaccination should not be used to rule out the possibility of rabies. If an animal is suspected of having rabies, th e following must be carried out by the attending veterinarian: 1. Notify the owner that rabies is being considered. The owner should be told about the potential for zoonotic transmission, that the animal will be tested for rabies if it dies/is euthanized and rabies is still considered a possible diagnosis, and that the owner should make a list of individuals that have been in contact with the animal recently. The owner should be asked whether the animal has bitten anyone in the past 10 days. This information should be documented in the medical record. 2. Notify the clinic's Infection Control Practitioner or equivalent. 3. Notify the local animal health and public health aut horities. In Canada, these are the district office of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and the local provincial or municipal public health unit. 4. The animal must be placed under strict isolation with a clear warning sign that the animal is not to be handled unless otherwise directed by the attending veterinarian. Entry into isolation and treatment of the patient should be limited to the minimum number of personnel necessary. 5. A clear \"Rabies Suspect\" sheet must be placed on the cage door. The names of all personnel coming into contact with the animal must be recorded on this sheet. 6. If additional diagnostics or treatments are required, all sta ff must be informed that the animal is a rabies suspect. Personnel should not be forced to handle the animal if they do not wish to do so. 7. Invasive procedures and procedures likely to result in contact with bodily fluids should be avoided. 8. Anyone handling the animal must wear protective barrier clothing including gloves, gown and face protection. Ensure that any areas of broken skin are secu rely protected by a bandage or other clothing. 9. Rabid animals can have very unpredi ctable behavior, therefore additional pr ecautions such as the use of catch poles and heavy gloves should be employed to reduce the risk of bite injury occurring. 10. Do not euthanize the animal unless it is in extremis , or authorized to do so by the owner and the appropriate authorities. 11. If an individual is exposed through a bite or potential salivary contamination of a wound or mucous membrane, a. IMMEDIATELY and THOROUGHLY wash the wound/ar ea with copious amounts of soap and water for at least ten minutes. Small wounds should be allowe d to bleed to help flush the virus from the tissues. b. The wound should then be disinfected using a com pound of proven lethal effect for rabies virus (e.g. 0.1% benzalkoniumchloride, 43.70% ethanol, tincture of thimerosal, tincture of iodine up to 0.01% aqueous solution of iodine). c. The individual must then immediately seek m edical attention in order to receive post-exposure prophylaxis as soon as possible. d. All bites should also be reported to the local public health unit. 12. If rabies is ultimately confirmed, public health per sonnel will determine need for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis for each individual who had contact with the ani mal, depending on the circumstances for each. In Canada, any animal that dies or is euthanized within ten days of biting a person must be submitted to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) for rabies testing. If any animal has physical contact with a potentially rabid animal, including any and all bats, t he CFIA must be notified of the case im mediately. The local CFIA inspector will then advise those involved regarding quarantine times and revaccination requirements. Local and national requirements regarding potential rabies cases may vary, however every veterinary clinic must be aware of proper pr ocedure in its area, which should be prominently displayed for clinic staf f, and include current contact information for the a ppropriate authorities.
