The way we saw it, there had to be more out there than just a bag of ascorbic acid when we were feeling run down. So we got plant-based Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Zinc, Reishi Mushrooms, and some organic fruit powder together to give us something better. You may consume as many drink mixes as you want. However, you reach a point of diminishing returns after two drink mix packets as your body has trouble processing all of the vitamins. Less water = more flavor! Add 4-8 ounces of water with the powder and mix well. To maximize taste, we suggest using less water as it concentrates the mix and brings out a wonderful burst of delicious flavor. The electrolytes in our drink mix are made up of magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Pure water actually pulls minerals out of your body, but by having minerals in solution you replenish what you sweat out.

They also taste way better than Emergen-C. I highly recommend! A lot of drink packets are very sweet. Ethan's immune support powder was flavorful but not overpowering making it the perfect enhancement to my regular water consumption. Love the orange pineapple flavor as well! When I'm feeling a little rundown, this definitely kicks up your immune system! Lorem ipsum dolor sit "}
