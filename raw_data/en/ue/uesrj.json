Statute and the enacting legislation do not state the deduction's purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on our review of legislative history and historical context, our evaluation considered a potential purpose: to encourage employers to offer mass transit and ridesharing options to employees by providing a financial benefit to employers that incur expenses for these options . WHAT POLICY CONSIDER ATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider: Establishing a statutory purpose andperformance measures for the deduction. Reviewing whether the deduction is meeting itsintent and, if necessary, revise statute in order for the deduction to do so. MASS TRANSIT AND RIDESHARING EXPENSES DEDUCTION EVALUATION SUMMARY | JANUARY 2021 | 2021 -TE7 KEY CONCLUSION : The deduction has not likely encourag ed employers to offer mass transit and ridesharing options to employees because it was generally not usable prior to Tax Year 2018 and has likely not been used much since then due to a lack of awareness. Additionally , it may not provide a large enough benefit to induce a change in taxpayer behavior for most employers. 12 MASS TRANSIT AND RID ESHARING EXPENSES DEDUCTION MASS TRANSIT AND RIDESHARING EXPENSES DEDUCTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Under the Mass Transi t and Ridesharing Expenses Deduction (Mass Transit Expenses Deduction) [Section 39- 22-509(1), C.R.S.], a corporate employer may deduct contributions they make to mass transit or ridesharing arrangements for employees from their Colorado taxable income . However, because Colorado uses federal taxable income as the starting point for determining Colorado taxable income, employers may only claim the deduction to the extent that they have not previously deducted eligible expenses when calculating their federal taxable income. In order for amounts to be eligible for the deduction, the mass transit or ridesharing arrangement must be primarily used to travel to and from an employee 's workplace . In addition, for the purposes of the deduction, an eligible \"ridesharing arrangement\" is one in which people travel in a vehicle together with a commonality of purposes, provided that the vehicle is not operated for profit, which includes carpools and vanpools. Further more , statute provides that the deduction is a vailable to \"corporate employers,\" and Department of Revenue staff have interpreted this phrase to indicate C -corporations, including any entity that has made an election to be treated as a C -corporation for federal tax purposes. Employers claim th e Mass Transit Expenses Deduction on Line 13 of the Colorado C -Corporation Income Tax Return (Form DR 0112). The deduction was created by Senate Bill 79- 001 in 1979 and has remained largely unchanged since then. 23 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF TH E TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not directly state the intended beneficiaries of the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction. Based on our review of the statutory language, we considered the intended beneficiaries to be corporations in Colorado that incur expenses for ma ss transit or ridesharing benefits they provide to employees. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute and the enacting legislation for the Mass Transit Expenses Deduct ion do not state its purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on our review of legislative history and historical context, we considered a potential purpose: to encourage employers to offer mass transit and ridesharing options to employees by providing a financial benefit to employers that incur expenses for these options. Specifically, the deduction was enacted alongside a number of other provisions that appear to be designed to encourage the increased use of altern ative transport ation options in lieu of single -occupancy vehicles. Additionally, national and local news articles indicate that policymakers and the public were increasingly interested in alternative transportation options when the enacting legislation was passed due to a number of recent trends, including the energy crises of 1974 and 1979, increases in gas prices paired with inflation, and concerns about air pollution. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? We could not definitively determine whether the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided for it in statute or its enacting legislation. However, we found that it is not likely meeting the potential purpose that we identified in order to 34 MASS TRANSIT AND RID ESHARING EXPENSES DEDUCTION conduct this evaluation because it is not likely that many taxpayers are using the deduction. Statute does not pr ovide quantifiable performance measures for this deduction. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measures to determine the extent to which the deduction is meeting its potential purpose: PERFORMANCE MEASURE #1: To what extent has the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction provided financial support to employers that incur expenses for mass transit and ridesharing options provided to employees? RESULT : We determined that the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction has not likely provided financial support to employers in recent years because the deduction was generally unusable for corporations prior to 2018. Additionally, awareness of the deduction appears to be relatively low, indicating that the deduction has not likely been used much between 2018 and the present, although the Department of Revenue lacked information to allow us to quantify its use . Prior to 2018, the Ma ss Transit Expenses Deduction was generally not usable because employers could claim a federal income tax deduction for transportation benefits they provided employees under the Internal Revenue Code [26 U .S. Code, Section 162(a)(1)] , which allow s businesses to deduct all ordinary and necessary business expenses, including employee salaries and other forms of compensation. The Mass Transit Expenses Deduction allows expenses to be deducted only to the extent that they were not previously deducted when calculating federal taxable income . As a result, employers would have been able to deduct all of their expenses for employees' mass transit and ridesharing costs under the federal deduction and, thus, would not have been able to claim the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction when the federal deduction was available. 45 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Beginning in 2018, due to changes to the Internal Revenue Code made through the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, employers could no longer deduct most mass transit or ridesharing expenses they paid on behalf of employees when calculating their federal taxable income . As a result , these employers have been able to claim the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction for most eligible expenses since 2018. However , we found that a wareness of the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction appears to be low; therefore, the deduction may not have been claimed by many employers even after the federal deduction was no longer available beginning in 2018. Specifically, none of the Colorado transit a gencies that we consulted were aware of the deduction, including those that regularly have contact with employers and had informed employers about the federal deduction when it was available. We also attempted to contact businesses that may have been aware of the deduction. Most of these businesses did not respond, and those that did were either unaware of the deduction or had not incurred expenses to which the deduction would apply. PERFORMANCE MEASURE #2: To what extent has the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction increased the mass transit and ridesharing options available to employees at Colorado businesses? RESULT : The Mass Transit Expenses Deduction has not likely expanded the mass transit and ridesharing options available to employees at Colorado busine sses because it is not likely being used much, as discussed in Performance Measure #1. Additionally, there are other savings programs available to some Colorado employers that likely provide a more substantial financial benefit than the deduction. For exam ple, we estimated that the EcoPass program, which allows employers to purchase RTD transit passes for their employees at a discounted rate, could have saved employers between $953 and $1,817 per employee in 2018. In comparison, as discussed below, we estim ate that the deduction could save employers $50 to $87 per employee per year. Although employers may benefit from these savings programs and the deduction simultaneously, the larger financial benefits provided by the savings programs that we identified ind icate that these programs are 56 MASS TRANSIT AND RID ESHARING EXPENSES DEDUCTION more likely than the deduction to influence businesses' decisions on whether to offer mass transit options for employees. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? We determined tha t the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction likely had no revenue impact in 2017 because the deduction was generally not usable in 2017 or in previous years when expenses for employees' transportation were allowed to be deducted from the employe r's income under federal law . We were unable to estimate the deduction's revenue impact in 2018 and 2019 due to a lack of Department of Revenue data and because publicly available data on mass transit fares does not include information about amounts paid by employers . In addition, we did not have sufficient information to determine how many, if any, employers are aware of the deduction and may have claimed it . The revenue impact in these years was probably minimal because taxpayer awareness of the deduction appears to be low. However, i f awareness o f the deduction increases in future years and more employers begin claiming it on their income tax returns, the deduction's impact to s tate revenue could increase substantially. For example, if all employers that purchased transit passes for employees via RTD's EcoPass program in 2018 had paid for these expenses in full and claimed the deduction, we estimate that the deduction could have resulted in more than $1 million in forgone state revenue. This estimate does not include any amounts that Colorado employers could have claimed for expenses incurred through other transit agencies in the state , which would further increase the revenue impact . 67 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIE S? Eliminating the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction would not likely have a significant impact on most taxpayers, since awareness of the deduction seems to be low. However, it would increase the income tax liabilities of employers that incur expenses for providing mass transit or ridesharing options and would otherwise have claimed the deduction for these expenses. Specifically, employers would be liable for corporate income tax on amounts they spent for these alternative transportation options, incur ring income tax liabilities equal to 4.55 percent of these expenses (based on the Colorado income tax rate for Tax Year 2021). As shown in EXHIBIT 1, based on 2018 transit costs, we estimate d that Colorado employers that claim the deduction for purchas es of monthly mass transit passes for employees could incur between $50 and $87 in additional annual corporate income tax liability per employee if the deduction were eliminated . For a Colorado employer with 14 employees (the statewide average number of employees per employer in 2018), this would amount to $700 to $1, 218 in additional income tax liability . 78 MASS TRANSIT AND RID ESHARING EXPENSES DEDUCTION EXHIBIT 1 . ESTIMATED IMPACT OF MASS TRANSIT EXPENSES DEDUCTION TO AVERAGE COLORADO EMPLOYER1, 2021 Minimum Maximum Estimated average cost of one monthly transit pass in Colorado, 20182 $92 $159 Total estimated annual cost of one monthly transit pass in Colorado, 2018 $1,104 $1,908 Colorado corporate income tax rate, 2021 4.55% = Estimated annual impact of deduction to employers, per employee, 2021 $50 $87 x Average number of employees per Colorado employer, 2018 14 = Estimated impact of deduction to average Colorado employer, 2021 $700 $1,218 SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of Section 39-22-509(1), C.R.S., data from the United States Census Bureau and the National Transit Database, and information from Colorado transit agencies' websites and financial reports . 1For purposes of these calculations, we assume d that the employer paid 100 percent of the expenses incurred for each employee to have a monthly transit pass throughout 2018. 2We calculated the average cost of a monthly transit pass in Colorado based on transit agency ridership data from the National Transit Database and fare information on transit agencies' websites. If 2018 fares were not available for a given transit service, we used current fares instead. Finally, based on feedback from Colorado transit agencies and businesses, we determined that awareness of the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction is fairly low. Eliminating the deduction would have no impact - financial or otherwise - on employers that would not have claimed the deduction because they were unaware of it. However, a transit agenc y indicated that the deduction may be a useful tool in their future conversations with businesses looking to purchase mass transit options for their employees; if the deduction were eliminated, this would no longer be the case. 89 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? We identified six states with tax expenditures similar to C olorado's Mass Transit Expenses Deduction, all of which allow employers to claim a credit or deduction for expenses incurred for providing alternative group transportation options to employees : California, Connecticut, Delaware, Mary land, Minnesota, and Wa shington. These tax expenditures may be claimed against various business income or similar taxes in all six states and may also be claimed against individual income taxes in Maryland and Minnesota. As demonstrated in E XHIBIT 2, other states' tax expenditures' benefits to taxpayers as a percentage of allowable costs are generally larger than Colorado's and range from about 9 percent to 50 percent of allowable expenses. Additionally, Connecticut, Delaware, and Washington all limit the statewide benefit to taxpayers resulting from their credits to $1.5 million, $100,000, and $2.75 million, respectively. 910 MASS TRANSIT AND RID ESHARING EXPENSES DEDUCTION EXHIBIT 2.

ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? Although we did not ide ntify any similar tax expenditures, w e identified three Colorado public transit agencies that offer discount programs for employers that provide mass transit options to employees. Employers must obtain approval from the transit agency prior to purchasing passes at the reduced rate and must also meet certain minimum purchase requirements. As demonstrated in E XHIBIT 3, we estimated that 1011 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT employers could save between 15 percent and 87 percent on the costs of mass transit passes for employees as a result of participating in these programs. However, employers' actual savings would depend on the extent to which they would have purchased transit passes without the programs' availability and the extent to which they may pass on the cost of the transit passes to their employees. Finally, any expenses incurred by employers purchasing passes through these programs wou ld likely be eligible for the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction. EXHIBIT 3.

Actual savings may be less than the percenta ges presented here as a result of this. Additionally, the calculations do not include any savings that employers may receive if they claim the expenses incurred under the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction for corporate income tax purposes. 2Estimates of EcoPass savings are based on 2019 data. 1112 MASS TRANSIT AND RID ESHARING EXPENSES DEDUCTION WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURE ? The Department of R evenue was not able to provide us with data on the number of taxpayers that claimed the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction or the amount s claimed. Specifically, the deduction is not itemized on the Colorado C -Corporation I ncome Tax Return (Form DR 0112) . As a result, taxpayers claim the deduction on the \"Other subtractions\" lines of this return , which combine s severa l other deductions and cannot be disaggregated for analysis . To address this limitation, the Department could create a new reporting line for the deduction on the income tax return. Additionally, the Department would need to capture and house the data collected on the new line in GenTax, which would also require additional resources (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO ESTABL ISH A STATUTORY PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE MASS TRANSIT EXPENSES DEDUCTION . As discussed, statute and the enacting legislation for the deduction do not state the deduction's purpose or provide performance measures for evaluating its effective ness. Therefore, for the purposes of our evaluation, we considered a potential purpose for the deduction: to encourage employers to offer mass transit and ridesharing options to employees by providing a financial benefit to employers that incur expenses fo r these options. We identified this purpose based on our review of the following sources: 1213 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT LEGISLATIVE HISTORY . The Mass Transit Expenses Deduction was passed as part of a larger bill [Senate Bill 79 -001] that primarily addressed concerns regarding motor vehicle emissions. In addition to the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction, several other provisions in thisbill seem to have been designed to encourage increased use ofalternative t ransportation in lieu of single -occupancy vehicles. For example, the bill established preferential off -street parking rates for vehicles used by more than one person going to or from work andallowed non- State employees to fill vacant spaces in State -owned vanpools for a monthly fee. HISTORICAL CONTEXT . National and local news articles published around the time that the deduction was enacted indicate that therewas an increased interest in alternative transportation amonglegislators and the public at this time. These articles cited a numberof reasons for this increased interest, including the energy crises of 1974 and 1979, increases in gas prices paired with inflation, andconcerns about air pollution. We also developed two performance measures to assess the extent to which the deduction is meeting its potential purpose. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the deduction by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure(s) in statute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the deduction's purpose and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the deduction is accomplishing its intended goal(s). THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO REVIEW WHETHER THE MASS TRANSIT EXPENSES DEDUCTION IS MEETING ITS INTENT AND , IF NECESSARY , REVISE STATUTE IN O RDE R FOR THE DEDUCTION TO DO SO . As discussed, we identified a number of factors that may limit the extent to which the deduction is meeting the potential purpose that we identified for this evaluation: 1314 MASS TRANSIT AND RID ESHARING EXPENSES DEDUCTION THE DEDUCTION HAS LIK ELY NOT BEEN USED MU CH, IF AT ALL , IN RECENT YEARS . We determined that awareness of the Mass Transit Expenses Deduction is low among transit agencies and businesses, indicating that the deduction has not likely been used much in recent years. Additionally, prior to 2018, employers would have been able to deduct all of their expenses for employees' mass transit and ridesharing costs as ordinary and necessary business expenses when calculating federal taxable income. Therefore, employers would not have been able to claim the Mass Transit Expe nses Deduction until 2018, when most expenses for employee transportation were nolonger allowed to be deducted under federal law . THE DEDUCTION 'S BENEFIT MAY NOT BE LARGE ENOUGH TO IND UCE A CHANGE IN TAXPAYER B EHAVIOR FOR MOST EMP LOYERS , especially since there are other programs that provide much larger benefits to employers seeking to reduce the costs of providing mass transitoptions to employees. For example, we estimated that the EcoPassprogram, which allows employers to purchase RTD transit passes fortheir employees at a discounted rate, could have saved employersbetween 77 percent and 87 percent on these expenses in 201 9 compared with the 4.55 percent savings employers would receive from the deduction for Tax Year 2021. Additionally, the tax savings provided by the deduction is much smaller than the savings providedby comparable tax expenditures that we identified in six other states,which provide savings between 9 percent and 50 percent of eligible expenses incurred . We also identif ied several other considerations that the General Assembly may want to take into account if it decides to review the deduction for potential revision: THE DEDUCTION 'S REVENUE IMPACT HAS LIKELY BEEN SMALL BUT MAY INCREASE . We determined that the deduction likely had no revenue impact in 2017, and though we were unable to estimate the deduction's revenue impact in 2018 and beyond due to a lack of available data, the impact was likely still minimal due to a lack of 1415 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT awareness of the deduction. However, if more employers begin claiming the deduction in future years, its impact to s tate revenue could increase substantially. For example, if all employers that purchased transit passes for employees via RTD's EcoPass program in 2018 had paid for these expenses in full and clai med the deduction, we estimated that the deduction would have resulted in over $1 million in forgone revenue to the State. THE DEFINITION OF \"RIDESHARING \" FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE DEDUCTION MAY BE OBSOLETE . The deduction has not been substantively revised since its enactment in 1979, and transportationpatterns have changed since then. For example, part of the definitionof \"ridesharing arrangement\" for purposes of the deduction appearsto be targeted towards private ridesharing programs that are established by employers specifically for their employees' commutingneeds. Although we were unable to determine how common privateridesharing programs are among Colorado employers, ridesharingtrips accounted for on ly 0.3 percent of total paid public transit trips in Colorado in 2018, which may indicate that private ridesharingprograms are less common now than they were in the past.Additionally, more modern forms of ridesharing, such as Uber Pooland Lyft Shared rides, are not likely to be allowable under thededuction because the deduction requires that the ridesharingarrangement not be operated for profit by a transportation business . 15161 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITOROLD AND NEW INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS SEPTEMBER 2020 EVALUATION SUMMARY 2020 -TE26 THIS EVALUATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2020 OLD INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT NEW INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT YEAR ENACTED 1979 1987 REPEAL / EXPIRATION DATE None None REVENUE IMPACT $174,300 (T AX YEAR 2017) $218,400 (T AX YEAR 2017) NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS 10 301 AVERAGE TAXPAYER BENEFIT $17,430 $726 IS IT MEETING ITS PUR POSE? Yes, but to a limited extent Yes, but to a limited extent WHAT DO THE SE TAX EXPENDITURE S DO? OLD INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT (OLD CREDI T)\u2014provides a state -level tax credit for C- corporations that make investments , such as in energy property and projects, reforestation property, and rehabilitation of historic structures, that qualify for the current Federal Investment Tax Credit [Section 26 USC 38 & 46] . The Old Credit is equivalent to 1 to 3 percent of the investment. NEW INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT (NEW CREDI T)\u2014provides a credit of 1 percent of C-corporations' investme nts in a broad range of property with a useful life of 3 -years or more , reduced by any amount of Old Cred it claimed during the same year. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Statute d oes not explicitly state the intended purpose of the New and Old Credits. Based on their operation and discussions with Department of Revenue staff, we infer red that their purpose is to encourage businesses to make investments in qualifying property. WHAT POLICY CONSIDER ATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The General Assembly may want to review the effectiveness of the New and Old Credits to ensure that they are meeting their intended purposes , and c ould consider repealing the credits if it concludes that their impact is less than intended. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? We determined that the cr edits are meeting their purpose, but only to a limited extent because they are used relatively infrequently and are likely too small to have a significant impact on business investment decisions. 172 OLD AND NEW INVESTME NT TAX CREDITS OLD AND NEW INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT ARE THE TAX EXPENDITURES? This evaluation covers two related income tax credits available to corporations that make qualifying investments in Colorado: O LD INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT (OLD CREDIT ) [SECTION 39-22-507.5, C.R.S.] \u2014 Established by House Bill 79- 1611 in 1979, the Old Credit provides a state -level tax credit for corporations that make investments that qualify for the current Federal Investment Tax C redit [Section 26 USC 38 & 46] . The federal credit is available to firms that invest in certain energy property and project s; reforestation property ; and rehabilitation of historic structures , and is calculated as 10 to 30 percent of the total investment in qualifying property, depending on the type of project or property purchased. The Old Credit is calculated as 10 percent of the value of the Federal Investment Tax Credit, meaning that the Old Credit is equiva lent to 1 to 3 percent of the qualifying investments. The Old Credit is capped at $5,000, plus 25 percent of a taxpayer 's remaining tax liability beyond that $5,000, for each tax year it is applied . For example, a taxpayer with a tax liability of $105,000 would calculate their annual credit cap as follows: $5,000 + 25 percent of t ax liability in excess of $5,000 (.25 x $100,000, which is $25,000) = Credit Cap ($30,000) 183 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT The Old Credit can be carried forward up to s even years, and can be carried back to the t hree preceding years. Originally, the Old C redit was available to businesses that file d as individuals and to C-corporations; however, in 1987, House Bill 87- 1331 limited the credit to only C- corporations. Further, when the Old Credit was established, the F ederal Investment T ax C redit allowed businesses to qualify for the credit based on most types of inves tments in depreciable property; however, beginning in 1986, Congress ma de changes to this credit to narrow the types of qualifying investments to those discussed above. This had the effect of significantly narrowing the Old Credit , which is tied to the F ederal Investment Tax Credit amount . N EW INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT (NEW CREDIT ) [SECTION 39-22-507.6, C.R.S.] \u2014 In 1987, responding to federal legislation that had the effect of narrowing the Old Credit, the General Assembly created the New Credit to continue to provide a credit at the state level for the broad range of business investments that were previously included in the Old Credit. To accomplish this, the New C redit is based on the amount that would have been available for the F ederal Investment Tax C redit based on its prior eligibility requirements, which allowed a broad range of investment s in depreciable or amortizable property with a useful life of 3 years or more to qualify . For example, qualifying property includes machinery, furniture, appliances, law books, and real property that is an in tegral part of manufacturing. The New Credit is equal to 10 percent of the prior federal credit, which offered a 10 percent credit for qualifying investments. Colorado's New Credit, then, is equal to 1 percent of qualifying investments. Only C- corporations can claim the New Credit , which is limited to $1,000 per year, reduced by any amount of Old Credit claimed in the same year . It can be carried forward up to 3 years. Based on the annual cap and 3- year carry forward period, the total credit available to co rporations is $4,000. C-corporations doing business in Colorado claim both the Old and New Credit s on their annual Colorado C -Corporation Income Tax Return (Form DR 0112) . The amount of the New Credit is calculated in section 194 OLD AND NEW INVESTME NT TAX CREDITS A, lines 2 -6, of the Credit Schedule for Corporations (Form DR 0112CR ). The Old Credit is claimed in section B, line 7 , of the same form. The sum of the New and Old Credits is included in the sum of nonrefundable credits then claimed on Form DR 0112, line 20. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Based on statute and legislative history, we inferred that the intended beneficiaries o f the Old and New Credits are C -corporations doing business in Colorado. Each credit can be claimed by a wide array of corporat ions because eligibility for the credits is determined by the type of investm ent made \u2014not by the type of business. In 2017, the Old Credit was claimed by 10 corporations, including corporations in the following industries : industrial equipment whol esaling and manu facturing , sports broadcasting, construction, and retail. In the same year, the New Credit was claimed by 301 corporations, including some in the following industries: chemical manufacturing, meat processing, farming, retail, financial services, and mineral extraction. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RES? Statute d oes not explicitly state the intended purpose of the New and Old Credits . Based on their operation and discussions with Department of Revenue staff , we inferred th at their purpose is to encourage businesses to make investments in business property . More specifically, the New Credit appears intended to provide an incentive for a broad range of investments since most purchases of depreciable property qualify. The Old Credit a ppears intended to provide an incentive for a narrow range of qualifying investments, including energy property and projects, reforestation property, and rehabilitation of historic structures. 205 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT ARE THE TAX EXPENDITURE S MEETING THEIR PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? We determined that the credits are meeting their inferred purpose, but only to a limited extent because they are used by relatively few taxpayers and are not large enough to have likely had a significa nt impact on businesses' investment decisions. Statute does not explicitly provide performance measures for these credits . Therefore , we created and applied the following performance measure to determine if the expenditures are meeting their inferred purpose : P ERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent d o the New and Old Cred its serve as an incentive for C -corporations operating in Colorado to increase their qualifying investments in the s tate? R ESULT: N EW CREDIT \u2014We estimate that taxpayers made annual investments of at least $27.8 million associated with the New Credits they claimed on average during Tax Years 2013 through 2017. This estimate is based on t axpayers claiming credits of about $278,000 annually . The Department of Revenue was not able to provide comprehensive data on the investment amounts reported by taxpayers who claimed the credit . Therefore, we estimated the total investment amount assuming that the credits claimed were equivalent to 1 percent of the investments; however, because some taxpayers are not able to claim the full credit available due to the credit cap or a lack of tax liability, the true value of the investments i s likely higher. Because many corporations may have made the same investments regardless of the credit, it is likely that the amount of investment that was caused by the credit is substantially less than the investments associated with the credit. Economic reports on business tax incentives, 216 OLD AND NEW INVESTME NT TAX CREDITS such as A New Panel Database on Business Incentives for Economic Development Offered by State and Local Governments in the United States , prepared in 2017 by Timothy Bartik for the Pew Charitable Trusts, indicate that tax credits can influence businesses to make additional investment s; however, credits that are small in comparison to the investment amount, such as the New Credit, have less impact on business investment decisions. Based on our review of Department of Revenue taxpayer data, it appears that the credit amount, which is capped at $1,000 annually and $4,000 total , is likely too small to incentivize most corporations to make qualifying investments. As discussed, t he total benefit from the credit is no more than 1 percent of the qualifying investment amount . Additionally, investments of more than $4 00,000 effectively receiv e a credit at less than 1 percent of their investment, since beyond that amount, the taxpayers would reach the maximum $4,000 in credi ts allowed to be claimed or carried forward to future years (i.e. , $1,000 in the first year, with an additional $1,000 annual credit for the three -year carryforward, for a maximum of $4,000 in credits for investments of $400,000 or more). Our review of Dep artment of Revenue data indicates that, due to the $1,000 annual cap, many businesses that claimed the New Credit received a credit significantly less than 1 percent of the investment amount. Although the Department of Revenue could not provide comprehensi ve data showing the value of the investments that taxpayers who claimed the credit reported in order to qualify, we found that 181 of the 301 corporations (60 percent) that claimed the credit in Tax Year 2017 claimed the maximum $1,000 in credits, indicating that their credits may have been too large to receive a credit equivalent to 1 percent of their investment. We reviewed investment data for a random sample of 106 of these corporations and found th at the average qualifying investment was about $1 million, an amount which would qualify for credits equivalent to at most, 0.4 percent of the investment (based on the $4,000 maximum credit amount over 4 years) . Thus, it appears that most of these businesses would have likely made the same investment decisions regardless of the credit. 227 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT We also found that relatively few eligible taxpayers appear to use the New C redit, indicating that it is not a significant incentive for most businesses making investments t hat would qualify. Specifically, f rom Tax Year s 2013 to 2017, on average , 388 firms claimed the New Credit annual ly, which likely represent s a small proportion of the businesses that were eligible. For example, bas ed on Department of Revenue reports, 49,619 corporations filed income tax returns in Tax Year 2015 (the midpoint of the years we reviewed) . Although we did not have data indicating how many of those corporations made purchases of property that would qualify for the New C redit, such purchases are c ommon for many corporations , which indicates that many may not be claiming the credit even though they are eligible. For example, if only 25 percent of corporations made eligible investments in 2015, about 12,405 would have been able to claim the credit. Further, as shown in E XHIBIT 1.1, the number of taxpayers claiming the New Credit declined substantially from Tax Year s 2013 to 2017, from 555 taxpayers in 2013 to 301 in 2017, a 46 percent decline. EXHIBIT 1.1 . TOTAL NEW CREDITS CL AIMED, TAX YEARS 2013 THROUGH 2017 SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of Colorado Department of Revenue data. 0100200300400500600 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 238 OLD AND NEW INVESTME NT TAX CREDITS OLD CREDIT \u2014We estimate that on average , corporations made at least $4.8 million in investments annually during Tax Years 2013 through 2017, which we estimated based on the $144,000 in annual credits claimed . The Department of Revenue does not require taxpayers to report the value of the investments made to qualify for the credits . Therefore, we estimated the total investment amount assuming that the credits claimed were equivalent to 3 percent of the investments; however, because some taxpayers are not able to claim the full credit available due to the credit cap or a lack of tax liability, the true value of the investments is likely higher. Further, de pending on the type of property that qualifies for the credit, businesses may have only been able to claim credits equivalent to 1 percent of the investment amount, which would also cause our estimate to be lower than the actual amount. Because many corporations may have made the same investments regardless of the credit, it is likely that the amount of investment caused by the credit is substantially less than the investments associated with the credit. Based on our review of economic stu dies, such as the Bartik report previously cited, it appears that a 3 percent tax credit, the maximum amount available under the Old Credit, is likely too small to drive most businesses' investment decisions, though it could be a factor some businesses con sider when making an investment. Additionally, the Old Credit may not be necessary to incentivize investments because the investments that qualify are also eligible for the Federal Investment Tax Credit, which provides a much larger potential benefit to ta xpayers. Specifically, the federal credit provides a credit again st federal income tax liability equivalent to 10 to 30 percent of a corporation' s qualifying investments. Thus, the Old Credit, at 1 to 3 percent of qualifying investments , provides a relativ ely small additional benefit. For example, a taxpayer who made a qualifying investment of $1 million would receive a federal credit of up to $300,000, and an additional $30,000 at the state level for the Old Credit, assuming they had sufficient tax liability to claim the credits. Thus, it appears that the federal credit would provide a substantial incentive for businesses to invest regardless of the Old Credit. 249 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? According to Department of Revenue data, in total, the Old and New Credits had a revenue impact to the State of about $2.1 million during Tax Years 2013 through 2017. E XHIBIT 1.2 shows the revenue impact to the State and corresponding benefit to taxpayers for the New and Old Credits for T ax Years 2013 through 2017. EXHIBIT 1.2 . NEW AND OLD TAX CRED IT REVENUE IMPACT, TAX YEAR S 2013 THROUGH 2017 Tax Year New Credit Old Credit Total 2013 $392,400 $92,400 $484,800 2014 $144,300 $422,1 00 SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor review of Department of Revenue data. As shown, the revenue impact for the New Credit decreased substantially between Tax Year s 2013 and 2017, declining by about 44 percent as fewer taxpayers claimed the credit each year . The Old Credit has had a variable revenue impact, likely due to larger investments by the busine sses that claim it in some years. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE S HAVE ON BENEFICIARI ES? As discussed, because relatively few businesses claim either credit and the credits are likely too small to drive a significant number of business investment decisions, it appears that eliminating the credits would have a small impact on overall business i nvestment and spending in the State. 2510 OLD AND NEW INVESTME NT TAX CREDITS However, eliminating them could impact some businesses, especially those that claim the Old Credit, which is typically claimed for larger amounts. Specifically, t he average value of the Old Credit claimed from Tax Y ears 2013 through 2017 , was about $10,600 and the average value of the New Credit for the same years was about $700. If these credits were eliminated, corporations that claim them would likely see their state income tax liability increase by similar amounts . Since the credit s are provided to corporations that purchas e qualifying business property, the effective after -tax cost of the property would increase by 1 percent for businesses that claim the New Credit and between 1 and 3 percent for those that claim the Old C redit. Although this amount appears too small to have a substantial impact on most investment decisions, there could be some businesses, especially smaller corporations and those that operate on small margins , for which eliminating the credits would be more impactful, though we could not confirm this. We reached out to multiple Colorado certified public accountants, as well as industr y groups that represent industry sectors with claimant firms for each credit, but did not receive any response. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? We identified tax expenditures intended to encourage businesses to make investment s in 49 states (including Colorado), with most states offering multiple tax expenditures targeting specific business activiti es. Although these tax expenditures have a common purpose, the benefit they provide taxpayers and the eligibility requirements vary widely. Similar to the New Credit, several states offer a relatively small credit for investments in business property. For example, Oklahoma offers a 1 percent credit for investments in qualified depreciable property used in qualifying manufacturing operations ; South Carolina offers a 0.5 to 2.5 percent credit for investments in qualified manufacturing equipment ; and Idaho off ers a 3 percent credit for purchases of qualifying business equipment. Similar to Colorado's Old Credit , Vermont offers a n investment tax credit for investments that qualify for the Federal Investment Tax C redit equivalent to 24 percent of the federal cred it amount. 2611 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? We identified several tax expenditures with a similar purpose, as follows: The Enterprise Zone Investment Tax Credit [Section 39-30- 104(1)(a) , C.R.S .] offers an income tax credit of 3 percent of the value of qualifying investments in an enterprise zone, capped at the lesser of $750,000 or $5,000 plus 50 percent of a taxpayer's liability in excess of $5,000. Eligible investments include depreciable tang ible personal property (machinery, livestock, furniture, etc.) and certain real property (excluding buildings) used in manufacturing, extraction, transportation, and energy. This credit may be claimed concurrently for the same property as the New Credit, but not the Old Credit . The Office of the State Auditor published its evaluation of the Enterprise Zone Investment Tax Credit in January 2020. The Historic Structures Credit [Section 39-22-514.5, C.R.S.] provides a 20 to 25 percent income tax credit for taxpayers who make expenditures to preserve a historic commercial or residential property that meets certain criteria, capped at $50,000 for residential and $1 million for commercial properties. The Old Credit is available for qualif ied investments in structure rehabilitation and has a similar purpose to this credit. The Federal Investment Credit [Section 26 USC 38 & 46] provides between a 10 percent and 30 percent credit against federal tax liability for corporations that make qualifying investment s in energy property and projects, reforestation property, and rehabilitation of historic structures. This credit applies to the same investments that qualify for the Old Credit and taxpayers may claim both credits. 2712 OLD AND NEW INVESTME NT TAX CREDITS WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE S? The Department of Revenue was unable to provide complete information on the investments taxpayers made to qualify for the credits. Specifically, c laimants of the Old Credit are not required to report the value of the investment that qualifies them to claim the credit . Further, although taxpayers must report the value of the investments they made to qualify for the New Credit, this information is not stored in GenTax, the Department of Revenue's tax reporting and information system, in a format that allows it to be easily extracted. Although we were able to look up the investment amounts one at a time in GenTax for a sample of taxpayers , because there were more than 300 taxpayers who claimed the credit each year and the credit can be carried forward for up to 3 years, it was not possible to conduct a comprehensive review of the investments. In order to provide complete information on investments made to qualify for the Old and New Credits , the Depart ment of Revenue would have to add a reporting line to F orm DR 0112CR for taxpayers to report this information for the Old Credit . The Department of Revenue would also have to perform additional programming in GenTax to capture and house the investment amounts reported by taxpayers for both the Old and New Credits , and allow this data to be extracted for review. These changes would require additional resources at the Department of Revenue (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? T HE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO REVIEW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NEW AND OLD CREDITS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE MEETING THEIR INTENT . As discussed, statute does not provide a purpose for either 2813 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT credit; however, based on their operation, we inferred that their purpose is to encourage businesses to make investments in business property in the state . Because businesses made at least $32.6 million in investment s associated with the credits , we found that they are meeting their purpose. However, we found that they are like ly only meeting their purpose to a limited extent because many corporations that claimed the credits would likely have made the same investments regardless of the credit , so the amount of investments caused by the credits is likely substantially less than the total investments that qualified businesses to claim them . Specifically, a t 1 percent of the investment amount for the New Credit and between 1 and 3 percent for the Old Credit, they appear unlikely to have a significant impact on most businesses' deci sions regarding investments in business property. Further, the Federal Investment Tax Credit provides a much larger credit against federal taxes (from 10 to 30 percent of the investment amount) for the same investments that qualify for the Old Credit. Therefore, it appears that the federal credit would likely provide a substantial incentive even in the absence of the Old Credit. On the other hand, statute does not provide performance measures indicating the credits' intended impact . Businesses claimed $393,000 in credits in Tax Year 2017, which likely served the purpose of providing general support to these businesses following their investments. For these reasons, the General Assembly may want to review the effectiveness of the credits and could consider repealing them if their impact is less than it intends . 29 30TAX TYPE Individual income YEAR ENACTED 1989 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE NoneREVENUE IMPACT Less than $5,000 annually (T AX YEARS 2016-2018) NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS 16 (T AX YEARS 2016-2018) WHAT DOES THIS TAX E XPENDI TURE DO?

The tax credit amount is claimed against income related to taxpayers' expenditures. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? According to the legislative declaration in the enacting legislation for the credit [House Bill 89-1300], its purpose i s \"to encourage the development of the recycling industry and thedevelopment of markets for recycled plasticmaterials.\"WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider reviewing the effectiveness of the credit and repealing it if it is not having the intended impact; or alternatively, amending the credit to increase its usage and potential impact . NEW PLASTIC RECYCLING TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT TAX EVALUATION SUMMARY | APR IL 2021 | 2021-TE 12 KEY CONCLUSION : The credit has not likely encouraged the development of new plastic recycling technology beca use of the small average size of the credit claimed relative to claimants' total expenditures; the eligibility requireme nts, which prevent corporations and pass -through entities from claiming the credit; and the limited number of taxpayers claiming the credit from Tax Years 2016 to 2018. 312 NEW PLASTIC RECYCLING TE CHNOLOGY INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT NEW PLASTIC RECYCLING TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? The New Plastic R ecycling Technology Investment Tax Credit (Plastic Recycling Technology Credit) [Section 39 -22-114.5, C.R.S.] allows taxpayers who file income tax returns as individuals , including sole proprietorships and single -member limited liability companies (LLCs), to claim an income tax credit for their investment in new pla stic recycling technology. The credit is available for up to 20 percent of the taxpayer's expenditures to third parties on qualified expenses related to recycling technology, such as rent, wages, supplies, consumable tools, equipment, and utilities . The maximum credit amount is $2,000 , which can only be claimed against income tax levied on income generated from activities related to qualifying expenses . The credit is nonrefundable, but unused portions may be carried forward for 5 years. House Bill 89 -1300 cre ated the Plastic Recycling Technology Credit in 1989. Originally , the tax credit was available to individuals and corporations ; however , the corporate credit expired January 1, 1994. Therefore, t he Plastic Recycling Technology Credit is not curre ntly available for C -corporations ; it is also not available for pass -through entities, such as S-corporations, partnerships, and other pass- through entities , such as multi -member LLCs . The credit for individuals has remained unchanged since its enactment. 323 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Taxpayers claim t he credit on Line 17 of the ir Individual Credit Schedule (Form DR 0 104CR) , which is filed as part of their individual state income tax return . Additionally, taxpayers are required to report their total plastic recycling net expenditures and attach copies of receipts, bills, or other documentation of eligible expenses to the tax return. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state the intended beneficiaries of the Plastic Recycling Technology Credit. Based on statute and legislative history, we inferred that the intended beneficiaries of the credit are individuals domiciled in the state who invest i n new technology for recycling plastic. In recent years, t he plastic recycling technology industry has primarily focused on creating plastics that are more recyclable, as well as developing new technologies to more efficiently recycle the plastics that already exist , with the goal of reducing costs and increasing the amount of material recovered. According to stakeholders and our review of the recycling industry, although larger companies, which would likely be ineligible for the credit because they are cor porations , tend to account for most recycling, there are also smaller start -up businesses in the state that focus on developing new recycling technology and could potentially claim the credit . According to Colorado Department of Public Health and E nvironm ent data on m unicipal solid waste (MSW) and recycling, about 30,300 tons of plastic were recycled in 2019, making up about 3.6 percent of all materials recycled. E XHIBIT 1 shows the amount of plastics , in tons , diverted from landfills for recycling , which increas ed from 2016 to 2019. 334 NEW PLASTIC RECYCLING TE CHNOLOGY INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment data. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? According to the legislative declaration in the enacting legislation for the credit [House Bill 89 -1300], its purpose was \" to encourage the development of the recycling industry and the development of markets for recycled plastic materials.\" In 1989, when House Bill 89 -1300 was passed, state governments, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the recycling industry were engaged in significant efforts to develop technology necessary to recycle and use the increasing amount of plastic materials being consumed by the public . IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEAS URES WERE USED TO MA KE THIS DETERMINATION? We found that the Plastic Recycling Technology Credit is likely meeting its purpose to only a limited extent because it provides a relatively small benefit in comparison to taxpayers' typical qualifying expenses and has been used by few taxpayers in recent years. 15,00017,00019,00021,00023,00025,00027,00029,00031,00033,000 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Plastics diverted (tons)EXHIBIT 1. COLORADO PLASTIC RECYCLING DIVERSION TREND, 2016 - 2019 345 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Statute does not explicitly provide performance measures for the credit. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine if the expenditure is meeting its purpose: PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent does the Plastic Recycling Technology Tax Credit encourage investments related to develop ing new plastic recycling technology? RESULT: To assess the potential for the credit to incentivize individuals' investment decisions , we compared the average credit amount claimed by taxpayers with the average investment each made on an annual basis during Tax Years 2016 through 2018. During this time period , 16 taxpayers claimed the credit and reported less than $500,000 in qualifying expenses related to developing recycling technology. On average, the credit provided taxpayers with a tax benefit of about 1.6 percent of the qualifying expenses. As discussed, alt hough taxpayers can claim credits for up to 20 percent of qualifying expenses, the credit amount is capped at $2,000 and can only be claimed against a tax liability that arises from income related to qualifying plastic recycling activities . This can cause taxpayers who make larger investments or who do not generate income from activities related to their qualifying expenses to receive credits well below 20 percent of their expenses . Our review of the plastic recycling industry, legislative audio, and interviews with stakeholders indicated that the $2,000 maximum credit amount is not large enough to significantly offset the costs typically associated with development of plastic recycling technologies. For example, analytical instruments used for plastic recycling development or equipment for processing recycled material can cost up to $30,000. Therefore, although the credit provides some financial support to individuals with qualifying expenses, it ap pears that the credit may have had a relatively small impact on most individuals ' investment decisions . Further , with only 16 individual taxpayers receiving a total tax benefit of less than $10,000 from Tax Years 2016 through 2018, averaging less 356 NEW PLASTIC RECYCLING TE CHNOLOGY INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT than $625 per taxpayer during those 3 years, it appears that the overall usage and benefit provided by the credit is insufficient to have a significant impact on the plastic recycling industry in the state. Specifically, in addition to the tax benefit being much smaller than taxpayers' typical costs, because the credit is limited to taxpayers who file as individuals, stakeholders indicated that most of the business es that would be likely to make larger investments in recycling technology, which are typically C- or S-corporations or multi -member LLCs, are excluded. In addition, this benefit is much smaller than other state programs that have the purpose of advancing the State's recycling industry. For example, the Recycling Resources Eco nomic Opportunity Grant Program administered by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment provide s $2 million in grants to support recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion, waste reduction, and beneficial use/reuse. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? According to Depa rtment of Revenue data, the Plastic Recycling Technology Credit resulted in an average annual revenue impact to the State of less than $5,000 from Tax Years 2016 through 2018. H owever , because few taxpayers claimed the credit, under Section 39- 21- 113(4)(a) and (5), C.R.S. which protects the confidentiality of tax information, we could not provide precise annual ized revenue impact totals . Further, due to its limited usage, the credit appears unlikely to have had a significant impact on the recycling industry in the state. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? The average value o f the Plastic Recycling Technology Credit claimed from T ax Year s 2016 through 2018 was less than $625, though taxpayers can claim up to $2,000. If the credit w as eliminated, individuals who have qualifying expenses related to the development of plastic recycling technology and would otherwise claim it , would likely 367 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT see their state income tax liability increase by similar amounts . As discussed, the credit appears too small to have a substantial impact on large- scale investment decisions; however, there could be some businesses, especially smaller sole proprietorships and those that operate on small margins, for which eliminating the credit w ould be more impactful. Accor ding to stakeholders, there are small er businesses and start -ups focused on recycling technology in the state. For these businesses, a credit of up to $2,000 could be a more significant financial support. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTH ER STATES? We identified at le ast nine states that provide a credit for purchases or investment s related to recycling and recycling technology , though not all of them are limited to just plastic recycling . Of the se states , seven states make individuals and corporations eligible for the credit while the other two limit it to corporations . Other than Colorado, we did not identify any states that limit recycling credits to individuals. E XHIBIT 2 provides examples of recycling -related credits in four other states , which all make the credit available for both individuals and corporations : 378 NEW PLASTIC RECYCLING TE CHNOLOGY INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT STATE RECYCLING TAX CREDIT OPERATION OF CREDIT Utah Recycling Market Development Zones Tax Credit Provides the less er of a 20 percent or $2,000 credit for expenditures to third parties for the purpose of establishing or operating recycling technology, as well as a 5 percent credit for the purchase price of recycling equipment. Montana Recycling Credit Provides a tax cre dit for 25 percent of the cost of property for the first $250,000 (15 percent for the next $250,000 and 5 percent for the next $500,000) invested in property purchased to collect, process, or manufacture products from reclaimed material. Louisiana Qualified New Recycling Manufacturing Process Equipment and Service Contracts Credit Provides a credit equal to 14 percent of a taxpayer's cost of purchasing new recycling manufacturing or processing equipment and qualified service contracts. Idaho Postconsumer Waste Credit Provides a credit equal to 20 percent of the cost of investments limited to $30,000 annually for taxpayers that invest in machinery and equipment used to manufacture products composed of postconsumer waste. SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of Bloomberg Law resources and other states ' statutory provisions, accessed in February 2021. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? We identified the fo llowing similar tax expenditure and a variety of programs that may also support businesses engaged in the development of recycling technology : MANUFACTURING MACHINERY SALES TAX EXEMPTION [Section 39-26- 709(1)(a)(II) AND (2), C.R.S. ]\u2014This provision allow s an exemption from state sales and use taxes for machinery, machine tools, or parts that are used in Colorado. T o qualify for the exemption, the property EXHIBIT 2. OTHER STATES' RECYCLING TAX CREDITS 389 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT must be used in Colorado, purchased for more than $500, be depreciable and have a us eful life of at least a year , and be used in manufacturing tangible personal property. Purchases of equipment that qualify for th is sales tax exemption could also be claimed as an eligible expense with the Plastic Recycling Technology Credit if plastic recycling technology developers me et the eligibility requirements. RECYCLING RESOURCES ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY (RREO) PROGRAM \u2014 This grant program is administered by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) and promotes economic development through the management of materials that would otherwise be landfilled . Specifically, under the program, the Pollution Prevention Advisory Board is allowed to provide private and public sector entities up to $2 million in grants in Fiscal Year 2021 to support recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion, source reduction, and beneficial use/reuse. The RREO Program also supports Colorado NextCycle, a program designed to promote end markets for recovered or diverted materials, by providing funding from existing RREO grant dollars. Passed in 2020, Senate Bill 20 -055 also aimed to promote recycling and develop recycling end markets by directing CDPHE to convene stakeholders about a recycling market development center and to administer a recycling education campaign. The bill also allows the Pollution Prevention Advisory Board to use RREO funds to reimburse eligible recycling businesses for property taxes , appropriat ing almost $1 million from RREO funds to implement the bill. A DVANCED INDUSTRIES EXPORT GRANT AND EARLY -STAGE CAPITAL AND RETENTION GRANT \u2014These grants are administered by the Global Business Division within the Office of Economic Development and International Trade. The Export Grant reimburses small and medium - sized advanced industry businesses for international export marketing costs and business development. Businesses can apply for up to $15,000 and up to 50 percent of approved expenses. The Early -Stage Capital and Retention Grant helps Colorado advanced industry technology businesse s develop and commercialize technologies that will be manufactured in Colorado. G rantees can receive up to $250,000 if they 3910 NEW PLASTIC RECYCLING TE CHNOLOGY INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT have headquarters in Colorado or have at least 50 percent of their employees based in Colorado, have annual revenues of less than $10 million and received less than $20 million in grants and from third -party investors since inception, and are registered with the Colorado Secretary of State . Recycling technology businesses eligible for the Plastic Recycling Credit may also be eligib le for these grant programs. SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM \u2014The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers yearly awards for small businesses developing innovative environmental technologies. The EPA often provides up to $100,000 for the first phase of funding and up to $400,000 for the second phase for projects focused on clean and safe water, air quality, land revitalization, sustainable materials management, and s afer chemicals. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 'S (DOE) PLASTIC INNOVATION CHALLENGE \u2014The U.S. DOE's innovation challenge provides funding and coordinates programs to encourage the develop ment of new highly recyclable plastics, and establish the United States as a global leader in plastic recycling technologies . As part of the innovation challenge, the U.S. DOE provided $27 million towards 12 projects that are developing innovative plastic recycling technologies or creating new plastics that are recyclable- by-design. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE? The Department of Revenue was able to provide data related to the credit . However, data for the credit has not been releasable in recent years due to taxpayer confidentiality requirements. Statute s [Section s 39-21-113(4)(a ) and (5), and 305(2)(b) , C.R.S.] prohibit the Department of Revenue from publishing any information that would allow the identification of any particular tax return and require our office to follow the same requirement for our tax expenditure evaluations. As a result of this data constraint, we were unable to use 4011 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Department of Revenue data to report precise annual ized totals for the credit's revenue impact and the number of claimants. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO REVIEW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PLASTIC RECYCLING TECHNOLOGY CREDIT . As discussed, we found that due to its size and limited usage, the credit likely has a limited impact on encouraging the development of new recycling technology in the state. Specifically, the average credit taxpayers claimed during Tax Years 2016 through 2018, was only about 1.6 percent of the qualifying expenses reported by the 16 taxpayers who claimed it during those years , with some taxpayers ' credit s significantl y limited by the credit 's $2,000 annual cap. Further, although the credit could provide financial support to some individuals and small businesses that have qualifying expenses, the combined tax benefit it provided to all taxpayers averaged less than $5,000 per year for Tax Years 2016 through 2018, which was unlikely large enough to have had a significant impact on the recycling industry in the state. Therefore, the General Assembly may want to review the credit to determine whether it is meeti ng its purpose and could consider repealing it if it is not having the intended impact. Alternatively, the General Assembly could consider amending the credit to increase its usage and potential impact. Specifically, we identified the following issues: T HE CREDIT , CAPPED AT A MAXIMUM OF $2,000, MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO ENCOUR AGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLASTIC RECYCLING TECHNOLOGY . This cap has remained unchanged since the credit w as established in 1989 and, based on our discussions with stakeholders , this am ount is relatively small in comparison to the cost of equipment typically used to develop recycling technology. We found that other states with incentives designed to encourage recycling technology investment provide a larger credit amount. For example, Id aho provides an annual credit for 20 percent of the costs 4112 NEW PLASTIC RECYCLING TE CHNOLOGY INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT of investments in equipment up to $30,000 ; Utah provides a credit similar to Colorado, but also includes a credit for 5 percent of the purchase price paid for machinery or equipment with no cap ; and Montana provides one of the largest credits , in comparison, by allowing up to 25 percent of a property's cost up to $250,000 invested, 15 percent for the next $250,000, and 5 percent of the property's cost on the next $500,000. BECAUSE THE CREDIT IS LIMITED TO TAXPAYERS WHO FILE AS INDIVIDUALS , BUSINESSES SUCH AS C- AND S-CORPORATIONS , AND MULTI -MEMBER LLC S CANNOT PARTICIPATE . As discussed, the credit was originally available to corporate taxpayers, but their eligibility expired in 1994. Although expanding the amount of the credit or the businesses eligible for the credit could increase its impact, doing so would also increase the revenue impact and we lacked data necessary to estimate this. 42FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORHUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT & CROP AND LIVESTOCK CONTRIBUTION CORPORA TE INCOME TAX CREDIT EVALUATION SUMMARY SEPTEMBER 2018 2018-TE4 THESE EVALUATION S ARE INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2018 HUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT CALENDAR YEAR 2016 CROP AND LIVESTOCK CONTRIBUTION CORPORATE INCOME TAX CREDIT CALENDAR YEARS 2012- 2016 YEAR ENACTED 2014 1982 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE January 1, 2020 None REVENUE IMPACT $71,000 Minimal NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS 353 Too few to report AVERAGE T AXPAYER BENEFIT $201 Too few taxpayers to report IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? Yes, but the impact is relatively small No, because it has been used infrequently WHAT DO THE SE TAX EXPENDITURE S DO? The Hunger Relief Income Tax Credit (Hunger Relief Credit) allows a farmer or rancher to claim an income tax credit equivalent to 25 percent of the value of food donations to hunger relief organizations, up to a maximum of $5,000 per year. The Crop and Livestock Contribution Corporate Income Tax Credit (Crop and Livest ock Corporate Credit) allows agricultural C-corporations to claim a n income tax credit of 25 percent of the value of food donations , up to a maximum of $1,000 per year. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for either of the tax expenditures. However, we inferred that the purpose of the credits is to incentivize Colorado agricultural producers to donate more fresh produce, meat, dairy, and eggs to hunger relief organizations. 432 WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? The Hunger Relief Credit is meeting its purpose of providing an incentive for agricultural producers to donate food and may have resulted in a relatively small increase in food donations of healthy, fresh produce. The Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit has only been used infrequently in recent years, and is doing little to meet its purpose. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? Some non-corporate agricultural producers are unaware of the Hunger Relief Credit and therefore have not used it because it has only been available since Calendar Year 2015. Constraints, such as the cost to harvest crops, low tax liabilities among agricultural producers, and federal filing status, likely limit the financial incentive provided by the credits and the ability of some food donors to use them. The $1,000 annual cap on the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit may be too low for it to provide an adequate incentive for C -corporations.

This report include s our evaluation of the two tax credits currently in place related to the donation of food by agricultural producers: the Hunger Relief Income Tax Credit (Hunger Relief Credit), which was created in 2014, and the Crop and Livestock Contribution Corporate Income Tax Credit (Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit), which has existed in its current form since 1987. House Bill 14 -1119 [Sec tion 39- 22-536, C.R.S .] created the Hunger Relief Credit, which was effective beginning in 2015 and allows farmers and ranchers who donate grains, fruits, vegetables, or other crops, as well as milk, eggs, livestock, or big game, to claim a credit against their state income tax liability. To qualify, taxpayers must donate the food to \"hunger -relief charitable [organizations]\" that \" [use] food contributions for hunger -relief \" in their communities (e.g., food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, etc.) . The bill permits all individuals or business entities, other than C -corporations or fiduciaries, to claim the credit, as long as they have filed a federal Schedule F tax form, which indicates profit or loss from agricultural operations. The amount of the credit is 25 percent of the value of their food donation, up to a maximum of $5,000 per year. If the credit excee ds a taxpayer's tax liability, it is not refundable; however, taxpayers may carryforward credits and apply them against their future tax liabilities for 5 years. 454 HUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT & CROP AND LIVESTOCK C ONTRIBUTION CORPORAT E INCOME TAX CREDIT The Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit [ Section 39- 22-301(3), C.R.S .] was established in 1982 and was the State's first tax expenditure covering agricultural donations to qualified charities. Initially, it was available to all agricultural businesses, but in 1987, the General Assembly limited it to C -corporations. The Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit has a similar structure as the Hunger Relief Credit in that it provides a credit to taxpayers based on their charitable donationsof food, but it has a more limited definition of what type of donations qualify. The Crop and Livestock Corporate Credi t allows all of the same types of donations as the Hunger Relief Credit, with the exception of eggs, milk, and big game. Like the Hunger Relief Credit, the amount of the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit is equivalent to 25 percent ofthe value of the fo od donation, but only up to an annual maximum of $1,000. It is also not refundable, but can be carried forward for 5 yearsto be applied against future tax liabilities. To claim eithe r credit, taxpayers must obtain a receipt from the charitable organization that confirms the donation. For the Hunger Relief Credit, taxpayers must submit the receipt to the Department of Revenue when filing their tax return and for the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit, taxpayers must retain the receipt and provide it to the Department upon request. The taxpayer is then able to claim 25 percent of the donation's \"most recent sale price \" or \"wholesale market price, \" as estimated by the taxpa yer, as a credit on their state income taxes. There is an interpl ay between the Hunger Relief Credit and the enhanced federal deduction for charitable contributions allowed by Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code (for taxpayers who choose to itemize) . Taxpayers making eligible food donations are allowed to take both the federal deduction and the state credit. However, to prevent \"double dipping, \" when taxpayers complete their Colorado state tax return, they must add back an amount equal to the value of the donation for which they claimed the federal deduction to their federal taxable income, which is the starting point for calculating Colorado taxable income. Taxpayers also cannot claim both the Hunger Relief Credit and the state deduction for charitable giving for the same donation. None of these restrictions apply to the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit. 465 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURES? According to the le gislative declaration in H ouse Bill 14 -1119, which established the Hunger Relief Credit, the intended beneficiaries of the credit are individuals who are experiencing food insecurity; hunger relief organizations, such as food banks and food pantries; and agricultural producers, including farmers and ranchers who file individual tax returns. Although the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit does not include a similar legislative declaration, we inferred that it has a similar set of beneficiaries, with the primary difference being that it is intended to benefit agricultural producers who file as C - corporations, as opposed to individual filers. According to the non -profit, Feeding America , as of 2016 , over 627,000 Coloradans were experiencing hunger, which represents about 11 percent of all residents in the state. To help address this problem, a network of non- profit organizations operate in the state with the mission of encouraging food donations and distributing food to those in need. These organizations include Feeding Colorado, which coordinates the operations of five large food banks. These food banks handle a large volume of the food donated in the state and are a significant place for agricultural producers to donate food. In addition to receiving donations from agricultural pro ducers, the food banks receive donations of food from individuals and food retailers, and also accept monetary donations which they use to purchase food. The food banks then distribute food into communities throughout Colorado through about 1,500 organizat ions, such as food pantries, churches, and community centers. This network of hunger relief organizations distributed 110 million pounds of food to Colorado residents in Calendar Year 2017. According to Feeding Colorado, the State's five food banks report that they, and the organizations they distribute food to across the state, are experiencing historic demand, which they are unable to keep up with\u2014 particularly for produce, meat, and dairy products. According to the U . S. Department of Agriculture, the St ate's 34,000 476 HUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT & CROP AND LIVESTOCK C ONTRIBUTION CORPORAT E INCOME TAX CREDIT agricultural producers (7 percent of which were C -corporations at the time of the most recent Colorado Agricultural Census in 2012) and are, according to Feeding Colorado, an important source of food donations because of the volume they can donate and because they can increase the supply of fresh, healthy food available to those needing food assistance. In addition to making donations based on a desire to help those in need, agricultural producers also have food available that cannot be sold, either due to a lack of demand or because of blemishes that make the food less marketable, though it is still healthy and suitable for consumption. The Food and Ag riculture Organization estimates that 2 4 percent of all fruits and vegetables are wasted before they even reach the grocery store or restaurant. This includes food that is left in the field post -harvest and food that spoils or is unable to be sold by the agricultural producer. Food banks have been able to reduce this waste and obtain a source of healthy food, by accepting deliveries of excess food from producers, sending their own trucks to collect food from producers, and organizing volunteers to harvest excess crops that are left in the field post -harvest, a practice called \"gleaning.\" WHAT ARE THE PURPOSES OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RES? Statute does not e xplicitly state a purpose for the Hunger Relief Credit. However, based on the legislative declaration for House Bill 14- 1119 [Section 39- 22-536, C.R.S .], which established the credit, we infer red that the purpose of the credit is to: Incentivize Col orado agricultural producers to donate more produce, meat, dairy, and eggs to hunger relief organizations. Increase access t o healthy, fresh foods, in greater variety for Coloradans who require food assistance. Statute does not e xplicitly state a purpose for the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit. However, given its similarity to the Hunger Relief Credit, we inferred the same purpose, limited to donations from C - corporations. 487 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT ARE THE TAX EXPENDITURES MEETING THEIR PURPOSES AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINAT ION? HUNGER RELIEF CREDIT We determined tha t the Hunger Relief Credit is meeting its purpose, but the impact of the credit has likely been small. Specifically, we found that the Hunger Relief Credit may provide an additional incentive for some agricultural producers to donate healthy, fresh food. However, the extent to which the credit has driven increased food donations in recent years is unclear. Given na tional food donation trends, the relatively small size of the credits claimed, and information we received from stakeholders, it appears that the Hunger Relief Credit has had, at most, a relatively modest impact on food donations. Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this expenditure. Therefore, we evaluated the Hunger Relief Credit using the following performance measures that we inferred from the legislative declaration in House Bill 14- 1119. PERFORMANCE MEASURE #1: The extent to which the Hunger Relief Credit ha s directly resulted in an increase in the total pounds of food donations from Colorado farmers and ranchers to food banks. RESULT : Agricultural food donations have increased significantly since 2014, when the Hunger Rel ief Credit was enacted, but only a small portion of the increase can potentially be attributed to the Hunger Relief Credit. The five major food banks in Colorado track how many pounds of produce, dairy, and meat have been donated by agricultural producers. The Calendar Years 2014 to 2016 totals for each food bank are shown in E XHIBIT 1.1. 498 HUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT & CROP AND LIVESTOCK C ONTRIBUTION CORPORAT E INCOME TAX CREDIT EXHIBIT 1 .1. AGRICULTURAL FOOD DO NATIONS TO FOOD BANK S CALENDAR YEARS 2014 -2016 (IN MILLIONS OF POUN DS) FOOD BANK 2014 2015 2016 PERCENT CHANGE Community Food Share (Louisville) 5.4 5.2 6.2 14% Weld Food Bank (Greeley) 3.6 5.1 5.8 63% Food Bank for Larimer County (Fort Collins) 2.0 2.3 2.6 26% Care and Share Food Bank (Colorado Springs) 7.9 7.5 10.2 29% Food Bank of the Rockies (Denver and Palisade) 4.9 7.0 10.3 109% TOTAL 23.8 27.1 35.1 47% SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of data provided by Feeding Colorado. Agricultural foo d donations at the five food banks have increased by 47 percent, or 11. 2 million pounds, from Calendar Years 2014, the year before the Hunger Relief Credit came into effect, and 2016. We found that this increase was consistent across food types: 4 7 percent for produce, 47 percent for dairy, and 52 percent for meat from Calenda r Years 2014 to 2016. Though the increas e in total donations may suggest that the Hunger Relief Credit has increased donations from Colorado farmers and ranchers to in -state food banks, it is unclear to what extent the increase has stemmed from the credit . There are several indications that most of the increase is due to other factors. Specifically, according to Department of Revenue data, the total value of all of the credits taken for Calendar Year 2016 was about $129,000. Applying an average price of $0 .34 per pound for the food donated, which we calculated based on receipts provided by the food banks, we estimate that approximately 1.5 million pounds of food were donated by taxpayers who claimed the credits in Calendar Year 2016. Therefore, given the 11.2 million pound increase in agricultural donations reported by the food banks, at most, only about 13 percent of the annual increase could be attributed to the Hunger Relief Credit. However, the true impact is likely less since some of the agricultural producers who took the credit may have donated the food regardless of the incentive provided by the credit. We considered the f ollowing factors to further assess the potential incentive provided by the Hunger Relief Credit: (1) national food 509 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT donation trends , (2) the average amount of credit taken by taxpayers, and (3) information provided by food bank staff and agricultural industry representatives. As shown in EXHIBIT 1.2, from Calendar Years 2014 to 2016, fresh fruit and vegetable distributions through the Feeding America charitable food distribution network rose by about 29 percent nationwide, despite the fact that only three other states and the District of Columbia cre ated a similar credit during that time period. Therefore, it appears that factors outside of the Hunger Relief Credit are providing incentives to increase donations. Notably the federal deduction available for crop donations was increased in 2015, which could have increased donations nationwide. EXHIBIT 1.2. POUNDS OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SO URCED AND DISTRIBUTED ACROSS F EEDING AMERICA NETWO RK OF FOOD BANKS CALENDAR YEARS 2014 -2016 YEAR POUNDS OF PRODUCE1 2014 970 million 2015 1.1 billion 2016 1.25 billion Percent Change 2014 -2016 29% SOURCE: Information obtained from Feeding America. 1Includes food obtained through donations and purchased by hunger relief organizations with monetary donations. In addition, we f ound that the average value of the tax credits claimed was not high enough to provide a strong incentive to donate food. On average, taxpayers who took the credit in 2016 received an annual tax benefit of just over $200 and had a federal t axable income of about $58,000. This indicates that the credit may be enough to incentivize taxpayers to donate food in situations where the additional cost of doing so is low ; for example , when a food bank offers to pick up excess crops (according to the food banks we interviewed this is a common service they offer). Further more , 28 percent of the taxpayers who took the credit in Tax Year 2015 or 2016 did not have sufficient tax liability to take the full amount available. This indicates that the credit's effectiveness in incentivizing larger donations is limited among the group who have claimed the credit, since taxpayers who have already 5110 HUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT & CROP AND LIVESTOCK C ONTRIBUTION CORPORAT E INCOME TAX CREDIT offset their entire tax liability would not be able to claim additional tax benefits even if they donated more crops. Stakeholders from food banks, food pantries, and organizations representing agricultural producers generally indicated that the Hunger Relief Credit has only had , at most, a modest impact on food donations. Specifically, a representative from one food bank thought the credit may incentivize food donations of already harvested crops, but that it was not large enough to encourage farmers to go back and re -harvest their land. Other food bank and food pantry representatives indicated that they were unsure of whether the credit was providing any incentive at all, although some thought that could be due to lack of awareness of the credit. Representatives of agricultural producers and the farmers we spoke with also reported that many farmers would donate food regardless of the credit, in particular crops that were already harvested but not as marketable due to blemishes, though the credit could potentially provide an additional incentive in some cases. PERFORMANCE MEASURE #2: The proportion of food donations that were healthy, fresh food. We considered food to meet this standard if it was fresh produce, meat, eggs, or dairy. RESULT : The food donated by producers who took the credit was healthy and fresh. To determine the type of food donated to food banks, we rev iewed donation receipts for Calendar Years 2015 and 2016 provided by the five major food banks in the state. Although this was not a complete set of all food donation receipts, it included all of the receipts maintained by the food banks and we considered it to provide a reliable sample of the types of donations received. Of the available 188 food bank receipts that contained descriptions of the items donated, almost all (9 8 percent) of the items donated were fruits and vegetables and the remaining donations were eggs and legumes. Many of these donations were not supermarket or restaurant -quality due to blemishes or size, and they were not always as fresh as supermarket goods. However, the food banks reported that the vast majority was of good quality and su itable for consumption. 5211 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT CROP AND LIVESTOCK CORPORATE CREDIT We determined tha t the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit is not meeting its purpose. Specifically, we found that it is used too infrequently to have had any meaningful impact on food donations or the agricultural industry, with too few taxpayers taking the credit for us to be able to report the number who took the credit or the amount they claimed without compromising confidentiality of the taxpayers' data. Section 39- 21-305(2)(b), C.R.S. requires us to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer information. Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this expenditure. Therefore, we created and applied the same performance measures that we used to evaluate the Hunger Relief Cr edit. PERFORMANCE MEASURE #1: The extent to which the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit ha s directly resulted in an increase in the total pounds of food donations from Colorado farmers and ranchers to food banks. RESULT : Due to its limited use, we found that the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit has not resulted in a measurable increase in food donations. PERFORMANCE MEASURE #2: The proportion of food donations that were healthy, fresh food. We considered food to meet this standard if it was fresh produce, meat, eggs, or dairy. RESULT : We were not able to obtain information on the type of food donated for this credit. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? HUNGER RELIEF CREDIT REVENUE IMPACT The Hunger Relief Credit has directly reduced state tax revenue by an 5312 HUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT & CROP AND LIVESTOCK C ONTRIBUTION CORPORAT E INCOME TAX CREDIT average of about $7 1,000 annually and provided an average benefit of about $206 per year to taxpayers who used it. EXHIBIT 1.3 shows the number of taxpayers claiming the credit, the credit amount available, and the credits actually claimed for Calendar Years 2015 and 2016. The amount of credits used is less than those available because some taxpayers had tax liabilities less than the credit available during each year. These taxpayers may carry forward the credits for 5 years to offset future tax liabilities. EXHIBIT 1.3. HUNGER RELIEF CREDIT S CLAIMED CALENDAR YEARS 2015 AND 2016 2015 2016 Total Credits Used $71,000 $71,000 Total Credits Available $118,000 $129,000 Average Credit Available $351 $367 Average Credit Claimed $211 $201 Total Taxpayers 337 353 SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of Department of Revenue taxpayer data. As shown, the average total amount claimed has been about $71,000 per year. However, the revenue impact to the State may be less than the amount claimed because, according to Section 39- 22-104(3)( j), C.R.S., to take the credit, taxpayers have to add back to their state taxable incom e any amount deducted on their federal return that was based on the same donation of food, which increases state revenue. Although we were unable to obtain federal taxpayer data due to federal confidentiality requirements, we estimate that if all of the ta xpayers had to add back federal deductions, the revenue impact to the State would be $59,000 (i.e., approximately $ 12,000 would be added back to state revenues). If none of the taxpayers had to add back federal deductions, the revenue impact would be $71,000, or the total amount claimed for the credit. Although the fisca l impact of the credit has been small, it is important to note that this amount could grow in future years if more taxpayers begin taking the credit. Based on our interviews with stakeholde rs and our survey of farmers and ranchers, most agricultural producers are not aware of the credit, especially since it had only been in place for 2 years 5413 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT at the time of our review. Further more, the revenue impact could increase over time if more taxpayers apply unused credits from previous years. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE HUNGER RELIEF CREDIT IS COST - EFFECTIVE . To assess the cost effectiveness of the credit, we calculated the potential cost per pound to the State of food donations attributable to the credit (i.e., the donations that would not have occurred but for the incentive provided by the credit). Because we did not have a source of data to determine what proportion of the donations were actually attributable to the credit, as opposed to other factors such as taxpayer altruism and the federal charitable deduction, in E XHIBIT 1.4 we provide several scenarios t hat assume varying percentages of donations being attributable to the credit. For each scenario , we took the cost of the credits to the State (estimated at $211 ,000 based on the total credits available for Tax Years 2015 and 2016 and assuming 15 percent of available credits are never claimed) and calculated the pounds and cost per pound of donations attributable to the credit based on a total of about 2.9 million pounds of donations made using the credit in Calendar Years 2015 and 2016, which we estimated using food bank receipts. EXHIBIT 1.4. HUNGER RELIEF CREDIT SCENARIOS BY ADDITIONAL POUNDS DONATED IN CA LENDAR YEARS 2015 AN D 2016 AND DOLLARS -PER-POUN D STATE IS \"PAYING \" PERCENT OF DONATIONS INCENTIVIZED BY CREDIT POUNDS DONATED ATTRIBUTABLE TO CREDIT COST PER POUND TO THE STATE 5 Percent 146,000 $1.44 10 Percent 293,000 $0.72 20 Percent 585,000 Even) 30 Percent 878,000 $0.24 SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of Department of Revenue data for Tax Years 2015 and 2016 and food bank receipts for Calendar Year 2015 -2017 . As shown, the Hu nger Relief Credit can be seen as more or less cost effective depending on the percentage of donations attributable to the credit, with the credit being more cos t-effective the more it incentivizes donations. Based on the $0. 34 per pound average fair market value of 5514 HUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT & CROP AND LIVESTOCK C ONTRIBUTION CORPORAT E INCOME TAX CREDIT the donations and the revenue impact to the State from the credit, we estimate that about 21 percent of the donations would need to be attributable to the credit in order for the State to be \"breaking even. \" If a smaller proportion of donations are incentivized by the credit, then the State could potentially provide the same funds to food banks to use to purchase the food and achieve a greater impact. F or example, if 5 percent of the donations, about 146 ,000 pounds of food, are incentivized by the credit, at a cost to the State of $ 1.44 per pound ($211,000 total), the State could potentially instead provide the equivalent funds to food banks who could purchase over 620 ,000 pounds of food at the $0. 34 average fair market value. Although it is possible that the credit could be incentivizing a high enough proportion of the donations to be cost -effective, the true proportion could also be less and we lacked d ata to form a reliable conclusion in this regard. CROP AND LIVESTOCK CORPORATE CREDIT REVENUE IMPACT During Fiscal Y ears 2012 through 2016, C -corporations claimed too little under the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit for us to report under Section 39- 21-305(2)(b), C.R.S without compromising taxpayers' confidentiality . Due to the low usage of the credit, its economic impact is likely insignificant and we performed no further analysis. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURES HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Eliminating the Hu nger Relief Credit would have a relatively small impact on hunger relief organizations, food insecure households, and agricultural producers. The credit has incentiviz ed, at most, about 1.5 million pounds per year in food donations, and likely less than that given the other incentives agricultural producers have to donate crops. By comparison, food banks report distributing about 110 million pounds of food (from all sources) to Coloradans in need during Calendar Year 201 7. Similarly, the average tax credit taken was relatively small in comparison to the average income of the taxpayers who took it, about 0.3 percent of their federal taxable income for the 5615 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT year. Further, an average of only 345 taxpayers took the credit for Ta x Years 2015 and 2016, which is about 1 percent of the 34,000 agricultural producers in the state. Eliminating the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit would have no significant impact on beneficiaries because it has been very seldom used. ARE THERE SIMILAR TAX EXPENDIT URES IN OTHER STATES ? We identified si milar expenditures in several other states, although we did not conduct a comprehensive review of all states. Specifically, California, New York, Iowa, Oregon, West Virginia, and Missouri have enacted similar income tax credits, while Virginia, Arizona, and Maryland have introduced similar income tax deductions. South Carolina also has a similar credit, but it only applies to packers, butchers, or processors of deer meat. The percentage of t he value of the donation (though calculated in different ways) that can be claimed as a tax credit or deduction ranges from 10 percent in California and Oregon to 100 percent in Arizona . The annual cap in other states ranges from $2,500 per taxpayer in Missouri to no cap in a number of states. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROG RAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPO SE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? The enhanced federal deduction for charitable contributions provided under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code provides agricultural producers with a similar incentive to donate food. Though the incentive varies based on individual circumstances, this deduction allows many agricultural producers to deduct 50 percent of the market value of the donated food from their federal taxable income. To illustrate the relative potential benefit provided by both the federal deduction and the Hunger Relief Credit (assuming eligible taxpayers would take both) , EXHIB IT 1.5 provides information on tax incentives 5716 HUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT & CROP AND LIVESTOCK C ONTRIBUTION CORPORAT E INCOME TAX CREDIT for donating food for several hypothetical taxpayers. As shown, though the federal deduction is potentially more valuable for taxpayers with high taxable income amounts and very large donations (as illustrated by Taxpayer 4 in the table), the Hunger Relief Credit may be more valuable for other taxpayers with more typical income and donation amounts (in practice none of the donations we reviewed for 2015 and 2016 exceeded $35,000) . EXHIBIT 1.5. EXAMPLE TAXPAYER BENEFIT FROM THE FEDERAL CHARITABLE DEDUCTION FOR FOOD DONATIONS AND THE HUNGER RELIEF CREDIT TAXPAYER 1 TAXPAYER 2 TAXPAYER 3 TAXPAYER 4 Federal Taxable Income $10,000 $50,000 $100,000 $500,000 Donation Fair Market Tax $4,537 SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis. 1 The tax benefit of the Hunger Relief Credit is less than the available credit amount because taxpayers may not have sufficient tax liability to use the full credit amount, and because of the requirement that taxpayers add back to their state taxable inco me the amount they deducted on their federal returns that was related to the same donation. As discussed previ ously, we were not able to obtain information on the number of taxpayers who claimed the federal deduction, or the total amount claimed. In addition, in Colorado , the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), administered by the Department of Human Services serves a similar purpose of providing food to those in need. According to a 201 4 survey of Feeding America food pantry recipients, 72 percent live in households with annual incomes at or below the federal poverty line, and 55 percent live in households currently receiving benefits from SNAP. A key difference between SNAP and food pantries is that SNAP has specific eligibility requ irements and provides a consistent source of funds with which to purchase food. Conversely, food pantries generally do not have eligibility requirements (though some verify that recipients liv e in the area), but some may only operate a few days per week or even month. 5817 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT Thus, they serve a broader population than SNAP and often act as a supplemental source of food for both SNAP recipients and those who may not qualify for SNAP, but who may periodically have difficulty affording adequate food. In comparison to the Hunger Relief and Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit s, SNAP has a far larger fiscal impact on the State, $55 million in state administrative expenses and $728 million in benefits issued to recipients during Fiscal Year 2016, compared to the $71,000 av erage direct annual impact of the Hunger Relief Credit. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURES? The Department of R evenue does not capture donation information for the Hunger Relief Credit in GenTax, its tax processi ng information system, in a format that allows for a comprehensive analysis. Specifically, the Department of Revenue requires taxpayers to submit donation certification forms that provide information relevant to the credit, including the amount and type of food donated, the market price, the hunger -relief organization receiving the donation, and donation date. The Department of Revenue maintains scanned images of the forms, which it can pull manually on a taxpayer -by-taxpayer basis; however, GenTax does not digitally capture the information from the form and does not clearly link the taxpayer's account to the form. As a result, the process to search and pull each form is time consuming. The Department of Revenue reported that it would take hundreds of hours to pull all of the forms for the 2 years included in our analysis, which was beyond the staff resources available. We were able to conduct our analysis based on copies of donation receipts for the credits maintained by the food banks. However, these receipts did not cover all donations claimed by taxpayers and may include some donations for which taxpayers never actually claimed a credit. Therefore, our analysis was limited to estimating the type of food, and the average size and market price of the donations. With complete information from the certification forms received by the Department of Revenue, our analysis would be more reliable and could 5918 HUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT & CROP AND LIVESTOCK C ONTRIBUTION CORPORAT E INCOME TAX CREDIT include additional information, such as the distribution of donations to hunger relief organizations across the state and the timing of the donations. According to the Department of Revenue, GenTax would need additional programming to be able to capture the information from the donation certification forms in a format that would allow for a comprehensive analysis (see the Tax Expenditures Overview section of this Compilation Report for details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and potential costs of addressing these limitations) . WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? SOME AGRICULTURAL PRO DUCERS ARE UNAWARE OF THE CRED ITS AND HOW TO TAKE THEM . The food banks and the Colorado Farm Bureau both reported that some agricultural producers and the accounting firms they work with may not be aware of the credits and how to claim them. Furthermore, the food banks and Colorado Farm Bureau report that some farmers who have heard of the credit and do occasionally donate food do not know how to apply for the credits and they have a perception that it is \"too much work \" to do so, even though all that is required is weighing the donation (which food bank staff always do), estimating the donation's value, obtaining a signature from food bank staff, and submitting a form to the Department of Revenue when filing taxes. In addition, of the 2 8 agricultural producers that we surveyed who respon ded to the questions, 23 (82 percent) had not heard of the Hunger Relief Credit, and 24 (86 percent) had not heard of the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit. Although greater public awareness of the cred its may increase their impact, it could also le ad to larger revenue impacts to the State. MANY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS ' STATE TAX LIABILITIES ARE TOO LOW TO BENEFIT FROM THE HUNGER RELIEF CREDIT . According to a 201 5 study from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 69 percent of all farms in the United States have operating profits that comprise less than 10 percent of their gross farm income, meaning that their federal and state tax liabilities may be low or negative. In addition, the Department of 6019 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT Revenue' s most recent data shows that in Tax Year 2013, the average Colorado taxpayer who reported a profit or loss from agricultural operations on their tax return reported a loss of almost $4,600. Although agricultural profits and losses can vary from year -to-year, based on this data, it appears that many agricultural producers in the state may not have any taxable income. Because the Hunger Relief Credit is not refundable, meaning the State will not issue a refund check to the taxpayer if the credit exceeds thei r state tax liability, individuals only receive a financial benefit from the credit to the extent that they have tax liability to offset. SOME SMALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR THE HUNGER RELIEF CREDIT DUE TO FEDERAL FILING STATUS . Section 39-22- 536(1)( e), C.R.S., limits the pool of eligible taxpayers who could claim the hunger relief credit to those who have filed a Schedule F with their federal tax returns, which is required for taxpayers who posted a profit or loss from crop production, animal production, forestry, or logging. Though the intent of this requirement may be to limit the credit to taxpayers who are professional agricultural producers, it may reduce the population of potential beneficiaries. While the Department of Revenue does not have data on how many state taxpayers have filed a Schedule F, food bank staff reported that many small agricultural producers, some of whom donate food, choose not to file the form. None of the relevant statutes and guidance documents that we examined from the other 10 states with similar tax expenditures indicated that donors had to file a Schedule F in order to claim the expenditure. THE CROP AND LIVESTOCK CORPORATE CREDIT , CAPPED AT $1,000, IS LIKELY TOO LOW TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL INCENTIVE TO C- CORPORATIONS . According to the most recent Colorado Agricultural Census , conducted in Calendar Year 2012, 7 percent of in- state agricultural operations are incorporated as C -corporations. Incorporating as a C -corporation has tended to be more beneficial f or larger- scale agricultural operations, which might not be highly incentivized by a tax credit that is capped at only $1,000 per year, in comparison to the $5,000 cap for the Hunger Relief Credit. Further, 6120 HUNGER RELIEF INCOME TAX CREDIT & CROP AND LIVESTOCK C ONTRIBUTION CORPORAT E INCOME TAX CREDIT agricultural C -corporations tend to be more focused on growing grain and commodity crops, as opposed to food that is suitable for donation. FEDERAL TAX REFORM COULD SHIFT THE BALANCE OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS WHO INCORPORATE AS C-CORPORATIONS , WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR BOTH THE HUNGER RELIEF AND CROP AND LIVESTOCK CORPORATE CREDIT . Federal corporate tax rate changes, effective starting in Tax Year 2018 , lower the top tax rate for corporations from 35 percent to 21 percent. This may provide an incentive for some agricultural producers who c urrently file as individuals to incorporate. Though the incentive to incorporate would still be stronger for larger- scale operations, these taxpayers would no longer be able to claim the Hunger Relief Credit and would become eligible for the Crop and Lives tock Corporate Credit. This could cause the Crop and Livestock Corporate Credit to be used more often in the future, though these taxpayers would be subject its $1,000 cap. 621 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORSTATE-EMPLOYED CHAPLAINS HOUSING ALLOWANCE EVALUATION SUMMARYJULY 2020 2020-TE17 THIS EVALUATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2020 YEAR ENACTED 1979 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT $194 or less NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine AVERAGE TAXPAYER BENEFIT Could not determine IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE? No, because most eligible taxpayers are not aware of it WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? The State-employed Chaplains state-employed chaplain's salary as a rental allowance when the State does not otherwise provide housing. This allowance enables the chaplains to deduct this portion of their salary from their taxable income for both federal and state tax purposes by allowing them to qualify for a federal housing deduction.WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for this tax expenditure. However, based on its legislative history and historical context, we inferred that the purpose of this expenditure was to give state-employed chaplains the ability to claim the same deduction available to chaplains not employed by the State. U.S. Code has allowed clergy to deduct any housing allowance they receive as part of their compensation since 1954. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? We found that most currently eligible individuals were not aware of the allowance and had not claimed the related deduction. Specifically, we were able to confirm that three of the four chaplains employed by the State did not use it and could not determine if one had used it.WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENTIFY? The General Assembly could consider: Repealing this tax expenditure since it is likely not being used and is not necessary to enable chaplains to deduct a housing allowance. Reviewing the allowance amount. 632 STATE -EMPLOYED CHAPLAIN SHOUSING ALLOWANCESTATE-EMPLOYED CHAPLAINS HOUSING ALLOWANCE EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The State-Employed Chaplains of a state-employed chaplain's salary as a rental allowance when the State does not provide housing. This allowance enables chaplains to deduct this portion of their salary from their taxable income for both federal and state tax purposes. House Bill 79- 1323 established the allowance, which became effective in 1979. United States Code, Title 26 - Internal Revenue, Section 107 (IRC 107), allows a chaplain to exclude a rental allowance or the fair rental value of a parsonage from their gross income for income tax purposes. However, the chaplain's employer, which can be a public or private entity, must designate a portion of their salary as a rental allowance through \"official action taken in advance of such payment.\" The Chaplains Housing Allowance [Section 39-22- 510 (2), C.R.S.] serves as the State's housing allowance designation under IRC 107, stating, \"The state of Colorado, being a tax-exempt entity, designates a portion of the compensation of every chaplain who is employed full-time by this state, in the amount of four thousand two-hundred dollars, as the payment of a rental allowance for the purpose of renting or providing a home for the chaplain and his family when such rent or home is not provided by the state.\" Taken together with IRC 107, the Colorado statute enables state-employed chaplains to claim $4,200 as a deduction on their federal taxes. Further, because Colorado uses federal taxable income as the basis for calculating Colorado taxable income, taxpayers who claim the federal deduction automatically receive the same reduction in taxable income for state tax purposes without needing to claim any additional deduction when filing their state taxes. 643 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute identifies full-time state-employed chaplains as the beneficiaries of this tax expenditure. Historically, the State employed at least 19 paid chaplains at the Department of Corrections. In 1993, the State cut the majority of these chaplain positions and most who continue to serve the State do so in a volunteer capacity and are not eligible for the Chaplains Housing Allowance. According to information from the Department of Personnel & Administration, as of April 2020, the State employed four full-time, paid chaplains, three at the Department of Human Services and one at the Department of Corrections. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for this tax expenditure. However, based on the legislative history and historical context, we inferred that the purpose of this expenditure was to give state-employed chaplains the ability to claim the same deduction available to chaplains not employed by the State. Federal law has allowed clergy to deduct any housing allowance they receive as part of their compensation from federal taxable income since 1954, if their employer designates a portion of their salary as a housing allowance in advance. Presumably, the Chaplains Housing Allowance was intended to make a job as a chaplain for the State more attractive when other job opportunities for clergy would offer a similar allowance, if housing was not provided directly. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? We determined that the Chaplains Housing Allowance is not meeting its purpose, because most eligible taxpayers are not aware of it. Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this exemption. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance 654 STATE -EMPLOYED CHAPLAIN SHOUSING ALLOWANCEmeasure to determine the extent to which the Chaplains Housing Allowance is meeting its inferred purpose. PERFORMANCE MEASURE :To what extent do eligible individuals use the Chaplains Housing Allowance? RESULT : Although we lacked data necessary to confirm whether the four eligible taxpayers claimed the federal deduction related to the allowance, we interviewed three of them and asked if they were aware of this allowance (we did not receive a response from one chaplain). All three reported that they were not aware of the allowance and had not used it to claim a deduction on their federal tax return. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The Chaplains Housing Allowance had, at most, a revenue impact of $194 to the State in Tax Year 2018, if the one chaplain we were not able to interview used the allowance. If the four full-time state-employed chaplains who were eligible used this tax expenditure in the future, the revenue impact would be a maximum of $194 per person, or $776 for all four chaplains. We calculated this amount by multiplying the maximum allowance amount ($4,200) by the State's income tax rate of 4.63 percent. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Eliminating this tax expenditure would have a limited effect on the intended beneficiaries, since three of the four eligible state-employed chaplains were not aware of this provision. If the fourth individual who was eligible used it, or if the three we contacted decided to use the allowance in the future, eliminating the Chaplains Housing Allowance could potentially increase their state and federal taxable income. This would increase their annual state income tax liability by, at most, $194 each. 665 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT ARE THERE SIMILAR TAX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? We did not identify any similar tax expenditures in other states. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? We did not identify any similar tax expenditures or programs in Colorado. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURE? There were no data constraints that impacted our ability to evaluate this tax expenditure. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY COULD CONSIDER REPEALING THIS TAX EXPENDITURE SINCE IT IS NOT BEING USED BY MOST ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES AND IS NOT NECESSARY TO ENABLE CHAPLAINS TO DEDUCT A HOUSING ALLOWANCE .As discussed, the state employs four eligible full-time chaplains, three of whom reported that they were not aware of the allowance and had not used it to claim the federal deduction (with the fourth chaplain not providing a response). Further, although IRS guidance requires an amount designated as \"the housing allowance pursuant to official action taken in advance of such payment\" for taxpayers to claim the related federal deduction and receive the same state tax benefit, this designation does not need to be made in a statutory provision. For example, Internal Revenue Service guidance indicates that this amount can be included in an employment contract or other official employment documentation. Therefore, state-employed chaplains could qualify for the same tax benefit even in the absence of the Chaplains Housing Allowance if the state department that employs them designates a portion of their salary as a housing allowance and the chaplains deduct allowable amounts from federal taxable income. 676 STATE -EMPLOYED CHAPLAIN SHOUSING ALLOWANCETHEGENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO REVIEW THE CHAPLAINS HOUSING ALLOWANCE AMOUNT .As discussed, we inferred that the purpose of this tax expenditure was to provide state-employed chaplains with a tax benefit similar to what would be available through other employers. However, the current $4,200 allowance has remained unchanged since 1979 when this expenditure was established. Since that time, average annual housing costs in Colorado have increased substantially. For example, the average cost for a two-bedroom apartment in Colorado is about $15,700 annually, so the allowance likely only allows state-employed chaplains to deduct a portion of their housing costs and no longer provides the same tax benefit as intended when it was established. Because IRC 107 allows employers to provide a federally deductible housing allowance equivalent to the market rate for housing, other employers may provide chaplains with significantly higher allowances than the State. Therefore, the General Assembly could amend statute to increase the allowance amount to ensure that state chaplains receive a similar benefit. If the four chaplains currently employed by the State claimed an allowance of $15,700 each, the potential revenue impact to the State would be $2,908. 681 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORALTERNATIVE INCOME TAX JULY 2020 EVALUATION SUMMARY 2020-TE20 THIS EVALUATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2020 YEAR ENACTED 1969 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT $70,268 or less ( TAXYEAR2018) NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS 76 AVERAGE TAXPAYER BENEFIT Unknown IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? Yes, but not for businesses that file as individuals WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? The Alternative Income Tax [Sections 39-22- 104(5) and 301(2), C.R.S.] allows individual and corporate taxpayers to elect to pay tax on 0.5 percent of their annual Colorado gross sales receipts, in lieu of paying the State's 4.63 percent income tax. It is optional for corporations and individuals that qualify to use it. To qualify, taxpayers must: Limit business activities in the state to making sales; Not own or rent real estate within Colorado; and Generate annual Colorado gross sales of $100,000 or less.WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? The purpose of the Alternative Income Tax, as stated in House Bill 69-1530, was to \"provide for an alternative tax to the income tax for certain taxpayers, consistent with the 'Multistate Tax Compact.'\" According to the Multistate Tax Commission, which was created under the Multistate Tax Compact, this provision was intended to benefit small businesses by offering a simplified method of calculating their tax due. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENTIFY? We identified two policy considerations related to the Alternative Income Tax: The General Assembly may want to review its eligibility requirements, in particular the $100,000 limit on sales, which has not changed since 1969. Individual taxpayers cannot use the expenditure because the Department of Revenue has not established an administrative process or form for these taxpayers to claim it.WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? We found that this tax expenditure is meeting its purpose for corporate taxpayers, but its use is limited because few corporations qualify. For individuals we found that it is not meeting its purpose because there is not a process for them to use it. 692 ALTERNATIVE INCOME T AXALTERNATIVE INCOME TAX EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The Alternative Income Tax [Sections 39-22-104(5) and 301(2), C.R.S.] allows individual and corporate taxpayers to elect to pay tax on 0.5 percent of their annual Colorado gross sales receipts, in lieu of paying the State's 4.63 percent income tax. This tax expenditure was established for corporate taxpayers in 1969 and was expanded to individuals in 1987. The Alternative Income Tax is optional for corporations and individuals who qualify to use it. According to statute, to qualify, taxpayers must: Limit business activities in the state to making sales, Not own or rent real estate within Colorado; and Generate annual Colorado gross sales of $100,000 or less. We determined that the Alternative Income Tax functions as a tax expenditure because it likely reduces some qualifying taxpayers' tax liability and reduces state tax revenue. For example, a qualifying corporation with $50,000 in gross sales receipts would pay $250 ($50,000 x 0.5 percent) in taxes if it elected to use the exemption. If that corporation instead elected to pay the State's regular 4.63 percent income tax and had taxable income of over $5,400 it would pay more in taxes ( $5,400 x 4.63 percent= $250 ). Taxpayers' taxable income is typically less than gross sales, since it is generally established by subtracting business expenses and depreciation from gross sales. It is likely that some taxpayers can reduce their tax liability by using the Alternative Income Tax. In order to claim the Alternative Income Tax, corporate taxpayers check a box (number 45) in the applicable section of the Colorado C-Corporation Income Tax Return (Form DR 0112). The corporation must enter its annual Colorado 703 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT gross receipts on line 18 of DR 0112, then calculate 0.5 percent tax on line 19, and enter \"gross receipt tax\" next to each of these two lines. According to state regulations [1 CCR 201-2, Rule 39-22-301(2)], the taxpayer must also attach a statement to the return that establishes their eligibility for the election as well as the computation of the tax. According to the Department of Revenue there is no established form or procedure for individuals to use the Alternative Income Tax. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state the intended beneficiaries of this tax expenditure. Based on its eligibility requirements, we inferred that the intended beneficiaries are small businesses, filing as corporations or individuals, with operations in the state limited to making sales. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The purpose of the Alternative Income Tax, as stated in House Bill 69-1530, was to provide \"for an alternative tax to the income tax for certain taxpayers, consistent with the 'Multistate Tax Compact.'\" The Multistate Tax Compact (MTC), which became effective in 1967, is an advisory compact among 16 member states (including Colorado) with the purposes of promoting uniformity of tax systems and facilitating taxpayer convenience and compliance. A broad range of uniform tax provisions have been established under the MTC, including the Alternative Income Tax. According to staff from the Multistate Tax Commission, which was created under the MTC, this provision was intended to benefit small businesses by offering a simplified method of calculating their tax due. We considered this to be the intended purpose of this tax expenditure. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? Overall, we found that the Alternative Income Tax is likely meeting its purpose to a limited extent for corporate taxpayers, but not for individuals because there 714 ALTERNATIVE INCOME T AX is not an administrative process for them to use it, as discussed further in this section. Statute does not provide a quantifiable performance measure for this tax expenditure. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the tax expenditure is meeting its purpose: PERFORMANCE MEASURE :To what extent do eligible corporations and individuals opt to take the Alternative Income Tax? RESULT :We determined that the Alternative Income Tax is used by a relatively small number of corporations. Specifically, based on Department of Revenue data, 76 corporations used it for Tax Year 2018 (the most recent year that data were available). The Alternative Income Tax is likely used infrequently because few corporations meet its eligibility requirements and have sufficient business activity in the state to be required to file any form of income tax. Department of Revenue regulations [1 CCR 201-2, Rule 39-22-301.1(2)] require businesses to pay income taxes if they meet any of the following criteria during the tax year: Own at least $50,000 worth of property; Have at least $50,000 of payroll; Make at least $500,000 of sales; or Have more than 25 percent of its total property, total payroll, or total sales occur in the state. Because a company must generate no more than $100,000 in annual Colorado gross sales to take the Alternative Income Tax, many corporations that may otherwise be eligible lack sufficient sales to have a need to use it, since they must have sales of over $500,000 to be subject to income tax in the state under Department of Revenue regulations. However, according to Department of Revenue staff, corporate taxpayers could claim the Alternative Income Tax if they have no property or payroll in Colorado and make less than $100,000 of 725 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT sales in the state, but more than 25 percent of their total sales occur in Colorado. Another situation when the Alternative Income Tax could be claimed is, if corporations have more than $50,000 in payroll, but do not rent or own property, while having less than $100,000 in sales in the state. We determined that the Alternative Income Tax is not currently used by businesses that file as individuals because the Department of Revenue has not implemented an administrative mechanism or procedures to allow eligible individuals to use it. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? We estimate that the Alternative Income Tax had a maximum revenue impact to the State of $70,268 in Tax Year 2018. To arrive at this estimate, we used data from the Department of Revenue showing that corporations choosing the Alternative Income Tax for Corporations paid a combined total of $8,507 in taxes in 2018. By dividing the total tax paid ($8,507) by 0.5 percent, we calculated that these taxpayers had $1,701,400 total gross receipts during 2018. Multiplying the total gross receipts amount by the income tax rate of 4.63 percent resulted in $78,775 in income taxes that would have been owed. We then subtracted the tax paid ($8,507) from the estimated income tax ($78,775) to arrive at our estimate. However, this method likely overestimates the true revenue impact by assuming taxpayers do not claim any deductions, which would be subtracted from their gross sales receipts when calculating taxable income, and could substantially reduce their tax liability and the amount of income tax owed. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? If the Alternative Income Tax was eliminated, taxpayers who have previously used this tax expenditure would have to calculate their taxes based on 4.63 percent of their net income rather than on 0.5 percent of their annual gross sales receipts. This would likely increase some corporations' tax liability. Further, eliminating the Alternative Income Tax option might make filing income taxes more difficult for corporations that currently use this option. 736 ALTERNATIVE INCOME T AX Specifically, for a C-corporation to calculate its corporate income tax liability in Colorado, it must first calculate its Colorado net income, which is its federal taxable income modified by any additions or subtractions required or permitted under Colorado law. Further, businesses operating in multiple states would also need to apportion and allocate their income across Colorado and the other states they earned income within, as prescribed by Colorado law. ARE THERE SIMILAR TAX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? We reviewed the laws of MTC member states and identified five other states: Alabama, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico with an alternative income tax. Although the provision's eligibility requirements are similar to Colorado in all five of these states, the tax rates vary from 0.25 percent in Alabama to 1 percent in Idaho. New Mexico, the only bordering state with a similar provision, taxes gross receipts at 0.75 percent. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? There are no similar expenditures or programs in the state. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURE? There were no data constraints that impacted our ability to evaluate the tax expenditure. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENTIFY? THEGENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO REVIEW THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ALTERNATIVE INCOME TAX.As discussed, only 76 taxpayers used the Alternative Income Tax in Tax Year 2018. Based on our review of this tax expenditure's eligibility requirements and Department of Revenue regulations, which establish the criteria for businesses to pay income taxes in Colorado, few businesses would both be required to pay income taxes in Colorado and meet the eligibility requirements for the Alternative Income Tax. In particular, the requirement that businesses have $100,000 or less in sales 747 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT in the state likely limits its usage, since Department of Revenue regulations require that businesses have more than $500,000 in sales in the state to be liable for paying income taxes, unless they have more than $50,000 in property or payroll in the state or more than 25 percent of their total sales, property, or payroll in the state. Because the $100,000 limit on sales has remained unchanged since 1969, when the provision was established, due to inflation, it is now effectively limited to a smaller scale of sales than in 1969. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, adjusting for inflation, $100,000 in 1969 would be equivalent to about $700,000 in 2020. THEGENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WISH TO DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE TO ESTABLISH AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS TO USE THE ALTERNATIVE INCOME TAX.Although Section 39- 22-104(5), C.R.S., makes taxpayers who file as individuals eligible for the expenditure under the same criteria as corporations, there is no form for individual taxpayers to claim the election and the Department of Revenue has not established any other process or guidance for individual taxpayers who wish to use it. It is unclear how many individual taxpayers would use this tax expenditure if a process was established for them to claim it; however, because of the narrow eligibility requirements discussed above, it is likely that few businesses that file as individuals would claim it. Establishing a form or amending an additional form for individuals to use and capturing this information in GenTax, the Department's tax processing and information system, would require the expenditure of resources at the Department of Revenue (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). 75761 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORDEDUCTION FOR WAGES & SALARIES DUE TO IRC 280C EVALUATION SUMMARY APRIL 2019 2019-TE8 THIS EVALUATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2019 YEAR ENACTED 1979 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT Less than $51.4 million (TAX YEAR 2015) NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine AVERAGE T AXPAYER BENEFIT Could not determine IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? Yes WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? The Deduction for Wages & Salaries Due to Internal Revenue Code Section 280C (IRC 280C Deduction) allows C -corporations and individuals with income from S -corporations to modify their federal taxable income for purposes of determining state taxable income by deducting w age and salary expenses that are not deductible for federal tax purposes due to IRC 280C. IRC 280C limits the deduction of expenses that are used as the basis for federal credits referenced by IRC 280C. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for this deduction. We inferred that the purpose was to neutralize the effect of IRC 280C on the deductibility of wage and salary expenses for the purposes of determining Colorado taxable income. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERAT IONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The General Assembly may want to consider whether sole proprietors, partnerships, and limited liability companies should also be allowed to claim the deduction. Additionally, due to changes to the Federal Tax Code since the deduction was created, the General Assembly may want to determine whether limiting the deduction to only wages and salaries and only amounts disallowed from deduction by IRC 280C meets its intent. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? The IRC 280C Deduction i s generally meeting its purpose since it appears that taxpayers are using it to offset the impact of IRC 280C on Colorado Taxable Income . 772 DEDUCTION FOR WAGES & SALARIES DUE TO IRC 280C DEDUCTION FOR WAGES & SALARIES DUE TO IR C 280C EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? The Deduction for Wag es and Salaries Due to Internal Revenue Code 280C ( IRC 280C Deduction) [ Section s 39-22-30 4(3)(i), 322, and 323, C.R.S. ], allows C -corporations and S -corporations to deduct for state tax purposes , wage and salary expenses that are not allowed to be deducted from federal taxable income under Internal Revenue Code , Section 280C (IRC 280C). In 1977, the U.S. Congre ss passed IRC 280C as part of a broader bill that established federal employment tax credits . Under IRC 280C, taxpayers who claimed the federal employment tax credits were required to reduce the amount of wage and salary expenses that they could otherwise deduct from their federal taxable income by the amount of the credit they received. It appears that Congress included IRC 280C t o prevent taxpayers from receiving a double tax benefit by both receiving a credit and deducting from their taxable income the associated expenses they incurred to qualify for the credit, up to the credit amount . For Colorado tax purpos es, IRC 280C had the side effect of increasing state tax liability for taxpayers subject to it s requirements. This occurred because since 1965 , Colorado has used federal taxable income as the starting point when calculating Colorado taxable income. Businesses subject to IRC 280C had a higher federal taxable income because they were no longer able to deduct a portion of their wage and salary expenses when calculating their federal taxable income and would, therefore, have had a higher Colorado taxable income , since it was tied to federal taxable income . However, because Colorado does not offer the same 783 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT employment credits that trigger the application of IRC 280C at the federal level, taxpayers would not receive an offsetting tax benefit for state tax purposes , resulting in higher st ate tax liabilities. I n 1979, the General Assembly created the IRC 280C Deduction to address the higher state tax liabilities caused by IRC 280C. The d eduction applies only to C -corporations and S -corporations; it does not apply to sole proprietors , partnerships , or limited liability companies . C- corporations are subject to income tax, federally and in Colorado, at the entity -level. S -corporations are not subject to income tax at the entity - level, but rather, the income from an S -corporation passes throug h to the individual shareholders based on their pro- rata share of ownership in the S-corporation. Individual shareholders report their share of the S - corporation's income on their individual income tax returns. When calculatin g Colorado taxable income, the deduction allows C- corporations and shareholders of S- corporations to deduct the wage and salary expenses that were disallowed from being deduct ed when calculating federal taxable income due to IRC 280C. This ha s the effect of adjusting taxpayers ' Colorado taxable income to be equivalent to what it would have been if not for IRC 280C. E XHIBIT 1.1 illu strates the application of the d eduction. EXHIBIT 1.1. APPLICA TION OF THE IRC 280C DEDUCTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF CALCULATING FEDERAL AND COLORADO TAXABLE INCOME Federal Gross Income - F ederal Deductions + Amount not deductible due to a credit referenced in IRC 280C = Federal Taxable Income - Deduction for wages and salaries not deductible from federal taxable income due to IRC 280C = Colorado Taxable Income SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of federal and Colorado taxable income calculations. 794 DEDUCTION FOR WAGES & SALARIES DUE TO IRC 280C The deduction has not been modifi ed since its enactment ; however, Congress has made several additions to IRC 280C since 1977, so that it now disallows deductions for expenses related to 12 different federal credits, some of which are not limited to wage and salary expenses . At the state level, the IRC 280C Deduction applies to expenses related to these federal credit s as well, but only to the extent that they are for wages and salaries. EXHIBIT 1.2 lists the federal credits referenced in IRC 280C and indicates the types of expenses that taxpayers are disallowed from deducting from federal taxable income due to IRC 2 80C. For state tax purposes, Section 39-22-304(3)(i) , C.R.S. , allows taxpayers to claim the IRC 280C Deduction for all of the credits indicated in the exhibit , but only to the extent that the amount disallowed from deduction at the federal level include d wages and salaries. Other business expenses, such as materials and overhead, that are disallowed from being deducted from federal taxable income for several credits under IRC 280C do not qualify for the d eduction. 805 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT EXHIBIT 1.2 .

To claim the IRC 280C Deduction, C-corporations include the amount of the d eduction on Line 13 for \"O ther Subtractions\" on their Corporation Income Tax Return ( Form DR 0112) . Taxpayers also use this line for several other unrelated deductions, which they combine for tax reporting purposes . Individuals who receive income from an S- corporation may claim the ir pro -rata share of the deduction based on their ownership interest on Line 17, also for \" Other Subtractions ,\" on the Subtractions from Income Schedule (Form DR 0104AD) when filing their Individual Income Tax Return (Form DR 0104) . This line also combines taxpayer reporting of several other unrelated deductions. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly identify the intended beneficiaries of the IRC 280C Deduction. Based on statutory language and the interaction 816 DEDUCTION FOR WAGES & SALARIES DUE TO IRC 280C between federal and s tate tax laws, we inferred that the intended beneficiaries of the d eduction are C-corporations and individuals with income from S -corporations that IRC 280C does not allow to deduct a portion of their wage and salary expenses from thei r federal taxable income if they take the associated federal tax credits . WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute does not explicitly state the purpose of the IRC 280C D eduction. Based on our review of the federal Internal Revenue Code, state statutes, legislative history, Department of Revenue taxpayer guidance, and similar statutes in other states, we inferred that the purpose is to neutralize the effect of IRC 280C as it applies to Colorado taxable income for wage and salary expenses for C-corporations and S -corporations doing business in Colorado. This is a common structural provision in states that tie their state taxable income amount to federal taxable income. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? We found that the IRC 280C Deduction is likely meeting its purpose, although we lacked the information necessary to quantify how frequently taxpayers use it. Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for th is expenditure . Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the d eduction is meeting its purpose . P ERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent are eligible taxpayers using the IRC 280C D educti on? R ESULT : We found evidence that taxpayers are likely using the IRC 280C Deduction, although we lacked information from the Department of Revenue to quantify the extent to which it is used. Specifically, the 2018 827 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT U.S. Treasury Department 's Tax Expenditures report estimated that, nationally, taxpayers claimed $ 23.7 billion in Fiscal Year 2018 for seven of the 12 federal credits referenced by IRC 280C. This indicates that Colorado taxpayers would likely continue to have a need to use the deduction to reduce their state taxable income for the amount disallowed by IRC 280C . This report did not include information for five of the credits referenced by IRC 280C , so it is likely the amount of credits claimed by taxpayers is higher than this amount. In addition, the Department of Revenue provides guidance for taxpayers specific to the deduction and its staff reported continued inquir ies from taxpayers regarding the deduction's application , which indicates that Colorado taxpayers are aware of it and likely using it . WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? For C -corporations , Department of Revenue data indicate that the IRC 280C Deduction had a state revenue impact of less than $51.4 million for Tax Year 2015 . Because t axpayers combine the IRC 280C Deduction with up to nine other deductions when reporting the deduction, the Department of Revenue cannot provide data specific to the total amount reported for the deduction . However, the Department of Revenue was able to provide aggregate data showing that taxpayers claimed a combined total of about $51.4 million for these 10 deductions, which is the basis of our revenue impact estimate. For individuals who claim the IRC 28 0C Deduction through an S - corporation, we were unable to determine an estimated revenue impact for the d eduction . Similar to C-corporations, individuals also combine the amount they claim for the d eduction with several other deductions on a single reporting line; however, GenTax, the Department of Revenue's tax processing system , does not collect this information in a format that is easily extractable to allow for an aggregate total of the amount claimed for these deductions. 838 DEDUCTION FOR WAGES & SALARIES DUE TO IRC 280C WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? If the IRC 280C Deduction were eliminated, corporations that have wages and salaries that cannot be deducted from federal taxable income due to IRC 280C would be unable to deduct those amounts for the purpose of determining Colorado taxable income and would, therefore, have a higher state tax liability. Eliminating the d eduction could also be a relative disincentive for taxpayers to claim the federal credits subject to IRC 280C. Specifically, if the tax benefit at the federal level for the credits was less than the benefit of being able to deduct the associated expenses for state tax purposes, ta xpayers may choose to forgo the federal credits. E XHIBIT 1.3 shows the state tax liability for a hypothetical corpora te taxpayer under t wo scenarios: ( 1) if the taxpayer claims a federal credit referenced by IRC 280C and claims the state deduction, and ( 2) if the taxpayer claims a federal credit referenced in IRC 280C and the state did not allow for the deduction. 849 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT EXHIBIT 1.3 .

Businesses would typically deduct other expenses as well. As EXHIBIT 1.3 demonstrates , if corporations were unable to deduct wages and salary expenses included in the calculation of the federal credits referenced in IRC 280C, then their state taxable income and tax liability would be greater due to their election to claim the federal credit. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES OR THROUGH OTHER PRO GRAMS ? Of the 4 3 states (excluding Colorado) and the District of Columbia that have a broad -based corporate income tax that uses federal taxable 8510 DEDUCTION FOR WAGES & SALARIES DUE TO IRC 280C income as the starting point for calculating sta te taxable income, we identified 2 7 that provide a similar deduction for wage and salary expenses that are not deductible due to IRC 280C. Of these states, 11 provide a deduction for expenses related to federal credit provisions referenced in IRC 280C and 16 provide a deduction for only certain types of expenses disallowed from being deducted due to the federal credit provisions referenced by IRC 280C , similar to Colorado . We did not identify any similar programs or expenditures available in Colorado. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE ? The Department of Revenue was unable to provide data on the number of taxpayers who took the IRC 280C Deduction or the amount they claimed . As discussed , C-corporations claim the d eduction on Line 13, \"Other Subtractions ,\" of the Corporat ion Income Tax Return ( Form DR 0112). Taxpayers combine the total amount of nine other deductions on this line, which the Department of Revenue cannot disaggregate. In all cases, the Department of R evenue requires taxpayers to submit explanations for the deductions taken as other subtractions that are reported on Line 13. However, GenTax does not capture and compile these explanations in an easily extractable format. Similarly, individuals who claim the IRC 280C Deduction due to having income from an S -corporation claim the d eduction on Line 17, also \"Other Subtractions,\" on their Subtractions from Income Schedule (Form DR 0104AD) when filing their Individual Income Tax Return (Form DR 0104). This line also combines taxpayer reporting of several other unrelated deductions, which the D epartment cannot disaggregate or extract. Due to these limitations, we were unable to determine the revenue impact of the d eduction and were unable to determine how many taxpayers claim ed it. To address these limitations, the Department of Revenue would have to create new reporting lines on the DR 0104, DR 0105, and DR 0112 8611 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT forms and then capture and house the data collected on those lines in GenTax, which would require additional resources (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's September 2018 Tax Expenditures Compilations Report for additional details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations) . WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? T HE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER ADDITIONAL TYPES OF TAXPAYERS SHOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE IRC 280C DEDUCTION . Specifically, other than individuals who receive income from an S -corporation, the deduction is not available to taxpayers who file as individuals and receive sole proprietorship , limited liability company , or partnership income even though they are eligible for the federal credits referenced in IRC 280C and are also subject to its limitations on deducting the expenses that are the basis for these credits from federal taxable income. As a result, t hese taxpayers are currently subject to a higher stat e tax liability than C -corporations and S -corporatio ns relative to the deduction of the applicable expenses . However, t his change would likely increase the state revenue impact of the d eduction, although we lacked data to quantify this potential impact. T HE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE IRC 280C DEDUCTION SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO WAGE AND SALARY EXPENSES AND ONLY AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT DEDUCTIBL E DUE TO IRC 280C . In 1979, the year the d eduction was created, IRC 280C only restricted taxpayers from deducting \"wage s or salaries paid or incurred\" related to the applicable federal employment credits. Statute [Section 39- 22-304(3)(i), C.R.S.] limits the d eduction using this same language and ties it to IRC 280C . Therefore, it is unclear if the General Assembly specifically intended to limit the d eduction to wages and salaries or included this limitation to conform the language of the deduction with the original language in IRC 280C. However, since that 8712 DEDUCTION FOR WAGES & SALARIES DUE TO IRC 280C time, the U.S. Congress has expanded IRC 280C to disallow the deduction of all types of expenses (not just wages and salaries) related to several other federal credits (see EXHIBIT 1.1 above) . As a result, the IRC 280C Deduction no longer fully addresses taxpayers ' increased state tax liability due to IRC 280C, which may mean that it is not fully addressing its original purpose . Of the 2 7 states with similar deductions, we found that 11 allow taxpayers to deduct all expenses that are disallowed by the applicable credits referenced by IRC 280C . Similarly, the d educt ion does not include expenses related to the federal Employer Social Security Credit (also known as the FICA Tip Credit) under Section 26 USC 45B (IRC 45B) . This credit is available to all employers (i.e., it is not limited to C - or S-corporations) who pay excess social security tax for tipped employees and, like the credits referenced in IRC 280C, taxpayers are limited from deducting these expenses if they take th e federal credit. However, the d eduction does not cover these expenses because they are disallowed from deduction at the federal level under IRC 45B , not IRC 280C . Congress in 1993, after Colorado's IRC 280C Deduction was created, so it is unclear whether the General Assembly would have included expenses not deductible under IRC 45B as qualifying for the deduction if IRC 45B had existed at the time the deduction was established. We identified one state, Arizona, that has a similar deduction that includes IRC 45B in the expenses taxpayers can deduct when cal culating state taxable income. Expanding the types of expenses the IRC 280C Deduction applies to would increase its state revenue impact, al though we lacked the necessary data to quantify this potential impact. 881 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORPREVIOUSLY TAXED INCOME OR GAIN DEDUCTION FOR C-CORPORATIONS EVALUATION SUMMARY APRIL 2019 2019-TE11 THIS EVALUATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2019 YEAR ENACTED 1964 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT None NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS None AVERAGE T AXPAYER BENEFIT None IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? No, because it is likely not being used WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? When computing Colorado taxable income , the Previously Taxed Income or Gain Deduction for C -Corporations [Section 39 - 22-304(3)(e), C.R.S.] allows C -corporations to deduct from their federal taxable income any income or gain that was taxed previously by Colorado prior to 1965, to the extent that it is included in the C -corporation's current federal taxable income. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not state the purpose of this tax expenditure. We inferred that its purpose is to prevent the double taxation of income or gain that was previously included in the income of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's decedent, or an estate or trust from which the taxpayer received the income or gain and was taxed by Colorado in a tax year prior to 1965. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? Due to its age, it appears unlikely that this expenditure is being used, although w e lacked data to confirm this. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The General Assembly may want to consider repealing the deduction since it does not appear to have current or future applicability. 892 PREVIOUSLY TAXED INC OME OR GAIN DEDUCTIO N FOR C -CORPORATIONS PREVIOUSLY TAXED INCOME OR GAIN DEDUCTION FOR C-CORPORATIONS EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? The Previously Taxed Income or Gain Deduction for C -Corporations [Section 39-22-304(3)(e), C.R.S.] was created in 1964. Although i t was revised in 1987 due to a revision and reenactment of the income tax section in the Colorado Revised Statutes, the operation of the deduction has remained unchanged since its creation. When computing Colorado taxable income, t his deduction allows C - corporations to deduct from their federal taxable income any income or gain that was previously taxed by Colorado prior to 1965, to the extent that it is included in federal taxable income. To qualify for the deduction, the income or gain could have previously been taxed \"to the taxpayer..., a decedent [ of the taxpayer ] by reason of whose death the taxpayer acquired the right to receive the income or ga in, or a trust or estate from which the taxpayer received the income or gain.\" To claim the deduction, taxpayers include the amount of previously taxed income or gain on Line 13 ( \"Other Subtractions \") of their state C -Corporation Income Tax Return ( Form DR 0112). WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly identify the intended beneficiaries of the Previously Taxed Income or Gain Deduction for C -Corporations. Based on the statutory language of the deduction and i nteractions between the federal and Colorado income tax systems, we inferred that the intended 903 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT beneficiaries of the deduction are C -corporations that have income or gains included in their federal taxable income that were previously taxed by Colorado prior to 1965. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute does not explicitly state the purpose of this tax expenditure. Based on statute [Section 39- 22-304(3)(e), C.R.S.], we inferred that the purpose of the deduction is to prevent the double taxation of income that was taxed by Colorado in a tax year prior to 1965. The General Assembly enacted this deduction in 1964, the same year it established federal taxable income as the starting point for determining Colorado taxable income for C -corporations . Therefore, it is likely that this deduction was a transitional and structural provision necessary to prevent double taxation at the s tate level of transactions that were previously taxed differently by the State and the federal government. In particular, this provision may have been needed to avoid the double taxation of installment sales which occurred prior to 1965. With installment sales , a corporation would receive income from payments over multiple years . Due to possible differences in how state and federal income was calculat ed prior to 1965, the corporation may have been required to recognize more of this income at the state level sooner than at the federal level and would have therefore , paid state income taxes on this income earlier tha n federal income taxes. When the State began using federal taxable income as the basis for Colorado taxable income, if any of the income included in federal income had already be en taxed by the state, the corporation could have been double taxed . IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We found that this tax expenditure is no longer meeting its purpose because it is likely not used by taxpayers and is unlikely to be used in future years. Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this deduction. Therefore, we created and applied the 914 PREVIOUSLY TAXED INC OME OR GAIN DEDUCTIO N FOR C -CORPORATIONS following performance measure to determine the extent to which the Previ ously Taxed Income or Gain Deduction for C -Corporations is meeting its purpose: P ERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent are C- corporations using the deduction to prevent the double taxation of income or gain previously taxed in Colorado in a tax year prior to 1965? R ESULT : It appears likely that the deduction is not being used. However, we were unable to confirm whether any taxpayers have claimed this deduction in recent years due to a lack of data. We consulted with several certified public accountants practicing in Colorado, and they had either not heard of the deduction or could not think of a situation in which a corporation would be able to use this deduction now or in the future. Additionally, in order for this deduction to be used , a corporation must ha ve included the income or gain in its current federal taxable income , and it must have also been taxed by Colorado on the income or gain over 54 years ago. We were not able to identify a likely scenario where this situation would occur. Given this large timespan, which will only continue to grow, it seems unlikely that taxpayers will use the deduction in future years . WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? We did not identify any economic costs or benefits of the deduction since it is likely not being used. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Because it is not likely being used, if the deduction was eliminated, there would be no impact on intended beneficiaries. 925 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT ARE T HER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES OR THROUGH OTHER PRO GRAMS ? We identified several other states and jurisdictions with a similar deduction or exemption, including Alabama, the District of Columbia, Missouri, North Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. Missouri's deduction replicates Colorado's statutory language nearly verbatim, and the date in its statute corresponds to the date that Missouri began using federal taxable income as the starting point for calculating Missouri taxable income for corporations. Additionally, we identified a parallel deduction available in Colorado for individuals, estates, and trusts [Section 39- 22-104(4)(c), C.R.S.], but that provision does not restrict the deduction to income or gains taxed prior to January 1, 1965. Department of Revenue staff reported that the deduction available to individuals, esta tes, and trusts is claimed with some frequency by individuals . We will be evaluating th is deduction in a future year. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE ? The Department of Revenue was not able to provide us with da ta to confirm whether any C-corporations claimed the deduction. Currently, C-corporations would claim the deduction on Line 13 ( \"Other Subtractions \") of the C-Corporation Income Tax Return ( Form DR 0112) , which aggregates severa l deductions . Therefore, the Department of Revenue does not have data specific to this deduction. To accurately determine if any taxpayers took this deduction and its revenue impact, the Department of Revenue would have to create a new reporting line on the DR 0112 and then capture and house the data collected on that line, which according to the Department , would require additiona l resources (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's September 2018 Tax Expenditures Compilations Report for additional details on the 936 PREVIOUSLY TAXED INC OME OR GAIN DEDUCTIO N FOR C -CORPORATIONS limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing th e limitations). Since it is likely that taxpayers are not claiming this deduction, it may not be worth the additional expense to amend the DR 0112. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? The General Assembly may want to consider repeali ng the Previously Taxed Income or Gain Deduction for C -Corporations since it does not appear likely to have current or future applicability. 94TAX TYPE Income YEAR ENACTED 1964 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE NoneREVENUE (TAX YEAR 2018) $865,000 NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS 2,700 WHAT DOES THE TAX EXPENDITURE DO?

WHAT I S THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute and the enacting legislation for the Previously Taxed Income Deduction do not explicitly state its purpose; therefore , we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the deduction, the legislative history of the deduction and income taxes in Colorado, and discussions with Department of R evenue staff, we considered a potential purpose : to reconcile differences between state and federal tax law and prevent the State from taxing the same income twice. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider: Establish ing a statutory purpose and performance measures for the deduction. Whether taxpayers who claimed a tax credit pursuant to section 1341 of the Internal Revenue Code should be allowed to claim the deduction. PREVIOUSLY TAXED INCOME DEDUCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES, AND TRUSTS EVALUATION SUMMARY | APRIL 2021 | 2021 -TE9 KEY CONCLUSION : Eligible taxpayers appear to be aware of and use the deduction, which allows them to avoid payin g tax on income that the State has already taxed in previous years. 952 PREVIOUSLY TAXED INC OME DEDUCT ION FOR INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES, AND TRUSTS PREVIOUSLY TAXED INCOME DEDUCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES, AND TRUSTS EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? The Previously Taxed Income Deduction for Individuals, Estates, and Trusts [Section 39- 22-104(4)(c), C.R.S.] (Previously Taxed Income Deduction) allows taxpayers who file as individual s, estate s, or trusts to deduct from their federal taxable income any income or gain that was previo usly taxed by Colorado when calculating Colorado taxable income. Colorado uses federal taxable income , which is calculated by subtracting federal deductions from gross income, as the starting point for determining Colorado taxable income. Therefore, any in come included or deductions allowed in calculating federal taxable income automatically apply in Colorado unless Colorado statutes specifically require taxpayers to add back the amount they claimed for a federal deduction or to subtract certain types of income included in federal taxable income . Currently, Colorado generally conforms to federal tax treatment of income and gains with regard to when they are taxed. However, in the past, there have been periods in which the tax treatment of deferred compensation, such as certain retirement and pension plans, w as different for Colorado and federal income tax purposes. Specifically, employee contributions made to the Public Employee Retirement Association (PERA) from July 1, 1984, to December 31, 1986, and employee contributions made to the Denver Public Schools Retirement System (DPSRS) from January 1, 1986, to December 31, 1986, were taxed by the State when the contributions were made, but the contributions were tax- deferred for federal tax purposes. This 963 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT discrepancy occurred due to changes in federal law in 1984 (for PERA) and 1986 (for DPSRS) that made those contributions tax- deferred, and there was a delay between the time federal law changed and the General Assembly changed Colorado law to conform to the tax treatment of these retirement contributions. When employees who contributed to PERA or DPSRS during those dates receive their benefits, the pension income is included in federal taxable income. The Previously Taxed Income Deduction allows those empl oyees to deduct the amount of income on which they already paid Colorado income tax. F or example, if a state employee contributed $10,000 to PERA in 1986, when that employee retires and begins receiving retirement benefits, they are eligible to deduct $10,000 when calculating their Colorado taxable income , since they paid Colorado income tax when that $10,000 was contributed to PERA . If a taxpayer does not have enough taxable income in the year they retire to claim the entire deduction, they can continue to claim it until they have received the entire deduction amount that they are entitled to claim . It is possible some taxpayers besides PERA and DPSRS members have income previously taxed by the State; however, we spoke with Department of Revenue (Department) staff and a certified public accountant (CPA) in Colorado, and they were not aware of any other reasons to use the deduction. The Previously Taxed Income Deduction was created in 1964 with House Bill 64- 1003 , which is the same legislation that established federal income as the starting point for determining Colorado taxable income. T he operation of the deduction has remained unchanged since its creation, although it was revised in 1987 with House Bill 87 -1331 as part of a revision and reenactmen t of the income tax section in the Colorado Revised Statutes . Individuals claim the Previously Taxed Income Deduction on Line 11 (for eligible PERA/DPSRS -related income) or Line 19 (for other previously taxed income) of the Subtractions from Income Schedu le (Form DR 0104AD) , which gets attached to the Individual Income Tax Return ( Form DR 0104). Estates and trusts claim the deduction on 974 PREVIOUSLY TAXED INC OME DEDUCT ION FOR INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES, AND TRUSTS Line 5 (subtractions from federal taxable income) of the Fiduciary Income Tax Return ( Form DR 0105). WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARI ES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not directly state the intended beneficiaries of the Previously Taxed Income Deduction. Because the deduction applies to individuals, estates, and trusts who have previously taxed income included in their federal taxable income, we inferred that they are the intended beneficiaries of the deduction. In particular, this tax expenditure appears to benefit PERA and DPSRS members who made contributions in 1984 through 1986, at which time the contributi ons were taxed by the State, but tax -deferred for federal tax purposes. Accordin g to data from PERA, there were, on average, about 98, 000 contributing PERA members each year in 1984 through 1986 and about 6,000 DPSRS members in 1986. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute and the enacting legislation for the Previously Taxed Income Deduction do not state its purpose; therefore , we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the opera tion of the deduction, the legislative history of the deduction and income taxes in Colorado, and discussions with Department staff, we considered a potential purpose : to reconcile differences between state and federal tax law and prevent the State from ta xing the same income twice. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We could not definitively determine whether the Previously Taxed Income Deduction is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided for it in statute or its enacting legislation. However, we found that it is meeting the potential purpose we considered in order to 985 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT conduct this evaluation because eligible taxpayers are likely claiming it to reconcile differences between their state and federal taxable income . Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this deduction. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the deduction is meeting its inferred purpose: P ERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent are eligible taxpayers using the deduction to prevent double taxation on income that was previously taxed by the State? R ESULT : In Tax Year 2018, which was the most recent year of data available, the Previously Taxed Income Deduction was claimed for PERA and/or DPSRS contributions on just under 2,700 individual income tax returns. Although we lacked data on the total amount of potentially eligible taxpayers (i.e., State and DPS employees who worked in 1984, 1985, or 1986 and who retired in 2018, as well as taxpayers with other previously taxed income ), the number of claims in Tax Year 2018 indicates that many eligible taxpayers are aware of and use it. Additionally, information about this deduction is wi dely available from several sources , which indicates that eligible taxpayers are likely to learn of the exemption and claim it . Specifically, there is a dedicated line for this deduction for PERA/DPSRS 1984- 1986 contributions on the Subtractions from Income Schedule (Form DR 0104AD) , which is part of the Individual Income Tax Return ( Form DR 0104) ; the return instructions include information on who is eligible and how to cl aim the deduction. The Department also has published a taxpayer guide about the deduction that is available on its website . PERA includes information about this deduction in its Taxes on PERA Benefits booklet, which is included in its retirement kit for soon- to-be retirees. PERA staff indicated that they believe most retirees are aware of the deduction, that retirees can contact PERA to receive a letter that provides them with the amount of contributions made in the eligible 996 PREVIOUSLY TAXED INC OME DEDUCT ION FOR INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES, AND TRUSTS years , and that some retirees can access this information on demand through their personalized secure account. TurboTax, a tax preparation software that taxpayers can use to prepare and file their own taxes , also provides information about this deduction. We also consulted with a CPA in Colorado and they were aware of the deduction, and believe professional tax- return preparers in Colorado are aware of it , but that most taxpayers may not be. However, the CPA reported that they believ e most eligible taxpayers would already have claimed the deduction. We lacked information and data on claims of this deduction for previously taxed income other than 1984- 1986 PERA or 1986 DPSRS contributions . However, because Colorado generally conforms to federal law regarding the timing of the taxation of income, Department staff reported that claims of this deduction for prev iously taxed income other than 1984- 1986 PERA or 1986 DPSRS contributions would be rare. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMI C COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? According to Department data, in Tax Year 2018, about 2,700 individuals claimed $18.7 million in previously taxed income deductions , resulting in $865,000 in revenue impact to the State in that year. However, these deducti ons were all attributable to individual taxpayers claiming the deduction for 1984- 1986 PERA or 1986 DPSRS contributions, which were subject to tax at the time they were contributed. We lacked data on the number of estate and trust taxpayers who claimed the Previously Taxed Income Deduction and the total amount claimed by those taxpayers , as well as data on individuals who claimed the deduction for income other than 1984- 1986 PERA or 1986 DPSRS contributions. However, Department staff reported that an estate or trust claiming this deduction or an individual claiming it for previously taxed income , other than a 1984- 1986 PERA or 1986 DPSRS contribution, would be rare and, thus, would likely have little to no revenue impact in most years. 1007 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Additionally, unless the State changes the way it conforms to federal law regarding the timing of the taxation of income, most of the revenue impact of this deduction will eventually phase out since it typically only applies to employee contributions made to PERA from July 1, 1984 to December 31, 1986 and employee contributions made to DPSRS from January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1986. Since the last date that eligible contributions would have been made was about 34 years ago, it is likely that many of the employees who contributed during those years have already retired or will retire in the near future. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Eliminating the deduction would result in individual, estate, and trust taxpayers being taxed twice a t the state level on income that was previously taxed in Colorado , and is included in their federal taxable income. Specifically, s tate employees who made contributions to PERA from July 1, 1984, to December 31, 1986, and DPS employees who made contributions to DPSRS from January 1, 1986, to December 31, 1986, would be taxed twice on the amount contributed. In Tax Year 2018, this would have resulted in an increase of about $865,000 in tax liability for about 2,700 taxpayers, which is an average of about $300 per taxpayer. Additionally, although there are likely few taxpayers who claim the deduction for other types of previously taxed income, Department staff reported that it is advantageous to have the provision in statute in case there are any changes to s tate law that would change the timing of taxation of income or gains. ARE THERE SIMILAR TA X EXPENDITURES IN OT HER STATES? We exami ned the statutes of the other 40 states (excluding Colorado) and the District of Columbia with a broad income tax and found that nine states, including Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, and Virginia, along with the District of Columbia , have a similar deduction. However, states differ in the specific language used in their statutes, with six of the nine states and the District of Columbia having a broad deduction for any previously 1018 PREVIOUSLY TAXED INC OME DEDUCT ION FOR INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES, AND TRUSTS taxed income that is very similar to Colorado's deduction and the others providing narrower exemptions. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? We identified two similar income tax deductions available in the State: PREVIOUSLY TAXED INCOME OR GAIN DEDUCTION FOR CORPORATIONS [SECTION 39-22-304(3)( e), C.R.S.] \u2014This deduction allows corporations to deduct from their income used for federal tax purposes any income or gain that was taxed previously by Colorado prior to 1965, to the extent that it is included in the C -corporation's current federal taxable income, wh en calculating Colorado taxable income. The Office of the State Auditor evaluated this deduction in 2019 and found that it is likely not being used. The evaluation of this deduction is available in the September 2019 Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expen diture s Compilation Report . PENSION OR DEDUCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS [SECTION 39-22- 104(4)( f), C.R.S.] \u2014This deduction allows individual taxpayers who are at least 55 years old to deduct up to $20,000 in qualifying pension or annuity income from their federal taxable income when calculating their Colorado taxable income. Taxpayers who are at least 65 years old are allowed to deduct up to $24,000. If a taxpayer's federally taxable pension or annuity income is less than $20,000 ($24,000 for taxpayers 65 and older), they do not need to use the Previously Taxed Income Deduction because all of their pension or annuity income is fully deductible under the Pension or Annuity Deduction for Individuals. However, if a 55 -year- old taxpayer receives, for example, $ 25,000 in PERA distributions and is entitled to a $5,000 PERA deduction because they contributed $5,000 to PERA between 1984 and 1986, the taxpayer is allowed to claim both the $20,000 Pension of Annuity Deduction and $5,000 Previously Taxed Income Deduction in the same tax year. 1029 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE? The Department was not able to provide us with data on the number of estates and trusts that claimed the Previously Taxed Income Deduction or the total amount claimed. Estates and trusts claim the deduction on Line 5 (subtractions from federal taxable income) of the Fiduciary Income Tax Return (Form DR 0105), which aggregates several deductions. Therefore, the Department of Revenue does not have data specific to this deduction for estates and trusts. Additionally, the Department was not able to provide us with data on individuals who claimed the Previously Taxed Income Deduction for eligible income other than 1984- 1986 PERA or 1986 DPSRS contributions; the deduction for income other than 1984- 1986 PERA or 1986 DPSRS contributions is reported on Line 19 (for other previously taxed income) of the Subtractions from Income Schedule (Form DR 0104AD), which aggregates several deductions. To provide complete information on the deduction and its revenue impact, the Department would have to create new reporting lines on the Form DR 0105 and the Form DR 104AD , and then capture and house the data collected on those lines, which, according to the Department, would require additional resources (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations ). Department staff reported that estates and trusts claiming this deduction is likely rare. Department staff also indicated that they were not aware of any previously taxed income besides 1984- 1986 PERA and 1986 DPSRS distributions that would currently qualify for the deduction since Colorado and federal tax law are generally aligned with regards to the timing of taxation of income. Therefore, it may not be worth the additional expense to amend the Form DR 0105 and Form DR 0104AD. 10310 PREVIOUSLY TAXED INC OME DEDUCT ION FOR INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES, AND TRUSTS WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATI ONS DID THE EVALUATI ON IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATU TORY PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FO R THE PREVIOUSLY TAXED INCOME DEDUCTION . As discussed, statute and the enacting legislation for the deduction do not state the deduction's purpose or provide performance measures for evaluating its effectiveness. Based on its operation and discussions with Department of Revenue staff, we considered a potential purpose: to reconcile differences between st ate and federal tax law and prevent the State from taxing the same income twice. We also developed a performance measure to evaluate its effectiveness. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the deduction by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure(s) in statute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the deduction's purpose and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the deduction is accomplishing its intended goal( s). T HE GENERAL ASSEMBLY COULD CONSIDER WHETHER INDIVIDUA L, ESTATE , TRUST , AND CORPORATE TAXPA YERS WHO CLAIMED A C REDIT PURSUANT TO SECTION 1341 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLAIM THE PREVIOUSLY TAXED INCOME DEDUCTION . For federal income tax purposes, Section 1341 applies \"when a taxpayer properly reports an amount of income in one taxable year and later repays all or a portion of that same amount in a later taxable year because the taxpayer, in fact, did not have an unrestricted right to that income.\" The purpose of Section 1341 is essentially to put the taxpayer in the same economic position they would have been in had they not included the income that they later had to return in a previous year's gross income for tax purposes. An example of a transaction in which Section 1341 may apply is when someone accepts a signing bonus for accepting a job but later has to repay all or part of the bonus because they did not remain at the company for the required time stipulated in the contract. Sect ion 1341 provides two options for resolving the situation: (1) a deduction for the amount of income that was previously 10411 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT included in gross income or (2) a credit for the amount of tax that was previously paid on that income. A taxpayer may choose to take th e credit rather than the deduction in a case in which the tax rate had changed and claiming a deduction for the income would not fully restore the taxpayer to the same economic position. For example, if an individual taxpayer included $10,000 of income on their return that was taxed at the 32 percent rate , but in a subsequent year determined they did not have an unrestricted right to that income and deducted it against income that fell into the 24 percent bracket, they would have paid $3,200 tax on the income but later received a deduction that would provide a reduction in tax of only $2,400 \u2014$800 less tax than was paid. Colorado uses federal taxable income as the starting point for calculating Colorado taxable income. Therefore, if a taxpayer claimed a deduction for income previously included in their gross income, that deduction would flow through to the Colorado return for Colorado income tax purposes. However, if a taxpayer elected to claim a credit in lieu of a deduction, the credit does not flow through for Colorado income tax purposes. In prior years, the Department allowed individuals, estates, and trusts to use the Previously Taxed Income Deduction in cases where taxpayers had claimed a credit under Section 1341. However, the Department recently reviewed the statutory language of the Previously Taxed Income Deduction and determined that it does not support the allowance of a deduction in relation to credits claimed on a taxpayer's federal income tax return under Section 1341. Therefore, the General Assembly could consider whether taxpayers that claim Section 1341 credits should be allowed to claim the deduction and if so, amend statute accordingly. Further, because corporations are not eligible for the Previously Taxed Income Deduction, but also cannot claim a deduction at the state level when they claim Section 1341 credits, the General Assembly could also consider amending statute to allow them to claim a deduction when this occurs. To the extent taxpayers claimed a deduction, this change would decrease state revenue; however, for individuals, estates, and trusts, it 10512 PREVIOUSLY TAXED INC OME DEDUCT ION FOR INDIVIDUALS, ESTATES, AND TRUSTS appears that this use of the deduction, when the Department allowed it, was rare. For example, in 2016 and 2017, the Department identified about 10 claims in each year related to the Section 1341 credit for individuals, estates, and trusts. There is no data available on how many corporations would benefi t from the state allowing a deduction or credit related to a Section 1341 credit. Additionally, it appears this is a relatively common provision in other states with an income tax. We examined the statutes of the other 40 states (excluding Colorado) with a broad income tax and found that at least 16 states have a provision that specifically addresses Section 1341. Of those 16 states, we identified seven that apply the provision to all taxpayers, including corporations. 1061 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORSTATE INCOME TAX REFUN D DEDUCTION S EVALUATION SUMMARY APRIL 2019 2019-TE12 THESE EVALUATION S WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2019 STATE INCOME TAX REFUND DEDUCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS , ESTATES , AND TRUSTS STATE INCOME TAX REFUND DEDUCTION FOR CORPORATIONS YEAR ENACTED 1964 1964 REPEAL / EXPIRATION DATE None None REVENUE IMPACT $47.7 million for individuals (TAX YEAR 2015) ; unable to determine for estates and trusts Less than $51.4 million (TAX YEAR 2015) NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS 445,000 individuals; unable to determine for estates and trusts Less than 2,800 AVERAGE TAXPAYER BENEFIT $107 for individuals ; unable to determine for estates and trusts Could not determine IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? Yes Yes WHAT DO THE SE TAX EXPENDITURE S DO? The State Income Tax Refund Deductions allow individuals, estates, trusts, and corporations to deduct from their federal taxable income refunds or credits for overpayment of state income taxes that were included in their federal gross income when computing their Colorado taxable income. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Statute does not explicitly state the purpose of the State Income Tax Refund Deductions. We inferred that th e purpose of these deductions is to prevent state taxation of state refunds and credits that are incl uded in taxpayers' federal gross income. 1072 WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? We determined that these deductions are generally accomplishing their purpose since taxpayers are aware of them and use them as inte nded to prevent being taxed on s tate refunds and credits due to overpayment of income taxes. WHAT POLICY CONSIDER ATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider reviewing the state income tax add- back provision for individuals, estates, and trusts due to changes in federal law that establish a $10,000 cap for the state and local tax deduction. State law does not indicate whether taxpayers should apportion these deductions among state and local real property taxes, personal property taxes, and income or sales taxes for the purposes of determining their state tax liability. 1083 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT STATE INCOME TAX REFUND DEDUCTIONS EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT ARE THE SE TAX EXPENDITURE S? This evaluation covers two parallel income tax deductions: (1) State Income Tax Refund Deduction for Individuals, Estates, and Trusts [Section 39- 22-104(4)( e), C.R.S .], and (2) State Income Tax Refund Deduction for Corporations [Section 39- 22-304(3)( f), C.R.S.] (State Income Tax Refund Deductions). These tax expenditures allow Colorado taxpayers to reconcile discrepancies caused by the interaction between Colorado and federal tax laws when taxpayers overpay their Colorado income taxes. House Bill 64 -1003 created both of these deductions in 1964, and they have remained largely unchanged since then. Colorad o uses federal taxable income as the starting point for determining Colorado taxable income for all taxpayers. Federal taxable income is the amount on which a taxpayer's federal tax liability is based and reflects any federal deductions, which ta xpayers subtract from federal gross income when calculating federal taxable income. However, because Colorado's tax laws do not exactly conform to federal tax laws, certain adjustments must be made to federal taxable income to determine a taxpayer's Colorado taxable income. Specifically, federal law [26 USC 164(a)] allows individuals , estates, trusts, and corporations that itemize deductions on their federal income tax returns, to deduct from their federal gross income certain state and local taxes paid dur ing the year. However, Colorado does not permit individuals, estates, and trusts to deduct any state income taxes paid for the purposes of determining Colorado taxable income, and corporations are only allowed to deduct other state income taxes. Therefore, statute s [Sections 39- 22-104(3)(d) and 39- 22-304(2)(d), C.R.S.] require individuals, estates, trusts, and corporations that deduct state income taxes on their federal income tax returns to add back all 1094 STATE INCOME TAX REFUND DE DUCTIONS or part of the state income tax deductions to federal taxable income when computing their Colorado taxable income. E XHIBIT 1.1 shows this calculation as it relates to state income taxes . EXHIBIT 1.1. TREATMENT OF STATE T AXES FOR THE PURPOSE S OF CALCULATING FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME AND COLORADO TAXABLE INC OME Federal Gross Income - FEDERAL DEDUCTIONS 1 = Federal taxable income + STATE INCOME TAXES IN CLUDED IN FEDERAL DE DUCTIONS = Colorado Taxable Income SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of federal and Colorado taxable income calculations. 1 Federal deductions include the amount of state and local taxes paid during the year. However, Colorado's requirement that taxpayers add back t he amount of state income taxes deducted from federal income when calculating Colorado taxable income creat es a potential discrepancy in the following tax year if taxpayers overpay their state income taxes and receive a state income tax refund . Overpayment of individual income taxes is common and typically occurs when the taxpayer's estimated tax payments or withholding exceed the amount of tax due for the tax year. When a taxpayer overpays their s tate income taxes, the State issues the taxpayer a refund or credit for the overpa yment amount in the following y ear, after the taxpayer has filed their tax return . To the extent that the taxpayer deducted s tate income taxes on their federal return and the deduction reduced the taxpayer's federal tax liability , federal law [26 USC 61] r equires some or all of the state refund or credit to be added back to federal gross inc ome for the tax year in which the refund was actually received , which is typically the following year . This is because the taxpayer received a larger federal deduction than they should have in the first year since the amount deducted was based on 1105 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT the original amount of state taxes paid, prior to the refund or credit . A discrepancy occurs in this situation because the state tax refund or credit must be included in federal taxable income for the following year and thus, would also be included in the taxpayer's Colorado taxable income for the following year. This means that the refund or credit gets taxed by the State . EXHIBIT 1.2 illustrates how this discrepancy occurs. EXHIBIT 1.2. EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATIN G THE TAXATION OF TH E STATE INCOME TAX REFUND BY THE STATE WITHOUT THE STATE INCOME TAX REFUND DE DUCTION TAX YEAR 1 TAX YEAR 2 Federal Gross Income (Tax Year 2 Includes State Refund Amount) $1,000 $1,010 - Federal Deduction for State Income Taxes Paid -$50 -$50 = Federal Taxable Income $950 $960 ADD BACK : Federal Deduction for State Income Taxes Paid + $50 +50 = Colorado Taxable Income $1,000 $1,010 State Refund for Amount Overpaid in State Income Taxes in Year 1 $10 TAX PAID ON THE REFUND AMOUNT $0.461 SOURCE: Offic e of the State Auditor analysis of federal and Colorado taxable income calculations 1Calculated a t state income tax rate of 4.63 percent multiplied by the amount of the s tate income tax refund included in federal taxable income. The State Income Tax Refund Deductions allow taxpayers to reconcile this discrepancy . These tax expenditures allow taxpayers to deduct the amount of the state refund or credit included in federal gross income when calculating their Colorado taxable income for the following year (i.e., the year the refund was received) . Specifically, individuals, estates, and trusts may subtract a refund or credit for overpayment of income taxes imposed by Colorado or any other taxing jurisdiction, to the extent it was included in federal taxable income . Corporations may deduct only refunds or credits for overpayment of income taxes imposed by Colorado, to the extent they were included in federal taxable income . Pass- through entities, such as partnerships, limited liability companies, and S -corporations , are not subject to income tax at the entity -level in Colorado. Rather, the partners, members, or shareholders are subject to income tax at the individual -level and can use these deductions on 1116 STATE INCOME TAX REFUND DE DUCTIONS their individual income tax returns. EXHIBIT 1.3 provides a summary of this calculation. EXHIBIT 1.3. CALCULATING COLORADO TAXABLE INCOME WITH A FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION AND STATE INCOME TAX REFUND Federal Gross Income (Includes State Income Tax Refund ) - Itemized Deductions (Including State and Local Tax Deduction) = Federal Taxable Income Federal Taxable Income + All State Income Taxes Deducted on Federal Returns (Individuals, Estates, Trusts) or Colorado Income Taxes Deducted on Federal Returns (Corporations) - Any State Income Tax Refund Included in Federal Taxable Income (Individuals, Estates, Trusts) or Colorado Income Tax Refund Included in Federal Taxable Income (Corporation) = Colorado Taxable Income SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of federal and Colorado taxable income calculations. Individuals claim the State Income Tax Refund Deduction on Line 1 (\"State Income Tax Refund\" ) of the Subtractions from Income Schedule (Form DR 0104AD ). Estates and t rusts claim the deduction on Line 5 (\"Other Subtractions \") of the Colorado Fiduciary Income Tax Return (Form DR 0105) . C-corporations claim the deduction on Line 13 ( \"Other Subtractions \") of the Colorado Corporation Income Tax Return ( Form DR 0112). WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Statute does not explicitly identify th e intended beneficiaries of the State Income Tax Refund Deductions. Based on the statutory language of the deduction and interactions between federal and Colorado tax laws, we 1127 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT inferred that the intended beneficiaries of the deductions are Colorado taxpayers that itemize state income tax deduct ions on their federal tax returns and subsequently receive state income tax refunds or credits for overpayment of income taxes. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute does not explicitly state the purpose of the State Income Tax Refund Deductions. Based on our review of federal and state st atutes, legislative history, Department of Revenue taxpayer guidance documents, and discussions with Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) , we inferred that the purpose of these deductions is to prevent refunds and credits from being taxed by the State because they are included in taxpayers' federal gross income. Furthermore, because these deductions were created with the same legislation [House Bill 64-1003] that transitioned Colorado from calculating its own state income tax base to using the federal income tax base as the starting point for determining Colorado taxable income, we determined that these deductions are structural tax expenditures that reconcile the federal and Colorado tax systems. ARE THE TAX EXPENDITURE S MEETING THEIR PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? We determined that these deductions are generally accomplishing their purpose since taxpayers are aware of them and use them as intended to prevent being taxed on state refunds and credits due to overpayment of income taxes . Statute does not provide quantifiab le performance measures for these deductions . Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the State Income Tax Refund Deductions are meeting their purpose: 1138 STATE INCOME TAX REFUND DE DUCTIONS PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent are Colorado taxpayers using the deductions to prevent state refunds and credits due to overpayment of state income taxes from being taxed? RESULT : We estimate that approximately 94 percent of the individuals eligible for the State Income Tax Refund Deduction claimed it in Tax Year 2015 (the most recent year that data were available) . To prepare our estimate , we used Department of Revenue data showing that about 413,000 full-year resident individual taxpayers claimed the Income Tax Refund Deduction. We co mpared that number to Internal Revenue Service St atistics of Income data, which indicate d that approximately 439,000 individuals in Colorado overpaid their state income taxes and included the refund in their Tax Year 2015 federal gross incom e, and thus, would have likely qualified for the deduction. Furthermore, it appears that eligible individual taxpayers are generally aware of the deduction. According to tax return preparers we contacted, tax return preparers in Colorado are well aware of the deducti ons, so eligible taxpayers who use a tax return preparer are very likely to claim them. Additionally, for individual taxpayers who prepare their own returns, Department of Revenue Form DR 104AD and Revenue Online , the Department of Revenue's electronic tax return filing service, clearly indicate where to claim this deduction. TurboTax, a tax preparation software that taxpayers can use to prepare and file their own taxes, automatically deducts state tax refunds from federal taxable income when preparing a Colorado return if the taxpayer filled out their federal tax return on TurboTax. The Certified Public Accountants ( CPAs ) we spoke with also indicated that tax return preparers for corporations are well aware of the deduction. Although most corporations are unlikely to use the deduction because they use accrual basis accounting and accrue the exact amount of taxes that they owe, those that use cash basis accounting, may overpay their taxes, receive a refund, and therefore use the deduction. However, we were unable to determine the number of corporations that claimed this deduction because the Colorado Corporation Income T ax Return 1149 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT (Form DR 0112) combines the Income Tax Refund Deduction with several other deductions on a line for \"Other Subtractions .\" In Tax Y ear 2015, almost 50,000 corporations filed income tax returns in Colorado, and approximately 2,800 filled out the line for \"Other Subtractions .\" Therefore, up to 6 percent of corporations may have claimed the deduction, although w e lacked the data necessar y to say definitively the proportion of these taxpayers that took it. We were also unable to determine how many estate and trust taxpayers claimed the deduction because the Colorado Fiduciary Income Tax Return (Form DR 0105) combines the State Income Tax Refund Deduction with several other deductions on a line for \"Other Subtractions.\" Additionally, the combined figure from the \"Other Subtractions\" line of the return is not retrievable from GenTax, the Department of Revenue's tax processing system. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? According to Department of Revenue taxpayer data, individual taxpayers claimed approximately $1.0 billion in State Income Tax Refund Deductions in Tax Year 2015, which resulted in a $47.7 million reduction in state revenue. The Department of Revenue was unable to provide specific data on the total amount claimed under the State Income Tax Refund Deductions by corporations and the revenue impact attributable to those cl aims. However , Department of Revenue data indicate that in Tax Year 2015, corporations claimed approximately $1.1 billion on the \"Other Subtractions\" line of the Corporation Income Tax Return (Form DR 0112), which resulted in foregone revenue of $51.4 million to the State . This line includes the State Income Tax Refund Deduction for Corporations plus nine other income tax deductions . Based on our conversations with CPAs regarding how corporations accrue and deduct their taxes and due to the fact that it is likely that the other deductions included on the reporting line have a si gnificant revenue impact as well , 11510 STATE INCOME TAX REFUND DE DUCTIONS we would expect the amount attributable to the State Income Tax Refund Deduction for Corporations to be substantially less than $51.4 million. The Department of Revenue was also unable to provide us with specific data on the total amount claimed under the State Income Tax Refund Deduction by estates and trusts and the revenue impact attributable to those claims. T he Colorado Fiduciary Income Tax Return (Form DR 0105) combines the State Income Tax Refund Deduction with eig ht other deductions on a line for \"Other Subtractions.\" However, the total amount reported on the \"Other Subtractions\" line of the DR 0105 is not retrievable from GenTax. Therefore, we are unable to provide a maximum possible impact for the State Income Ta x Refund Deduction for estate and trust claims. It is likely that the revenue impact of the State Income Tax Refund Deductions will decrease for Tax Years 2018 through 2025 due to r ecent federal tax law changes . Specifically, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act [Pub. L. 115- 97] established a federal $10,000 state and local tax deduction limit for individual , estate, and trust taxpayers and raised the federal standard deduction available to individual taxpayers from $6,350 ($12,700 f or jointly filed returns) to $12,000 ($24,000 for jointly filed returns) , increased annually for inflation, for Tax Years 2018 through 2025. These changes will likely result in fewer indiv idual taxpayers itemizing deductions on their federal income tax ret urns and fewer individuals claiming the state and local tax deduction, which is an itemized deduction for Tax Years 2018 through 2025. As a result, fewer taxpayers will have a need and/or qualify for the State Income Tax Refund Deductions. Although we lacked data to estimate the potential decrease in revenue impact due to changes in federal tax law, it appears that the decrease could be substantial. The Tax Foundation estimated that prior to the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, approximately 30 percent of national filers itemized their deductions and that less than 10 percent are expected to do so under the new law. In Tax Year 2015, 34 percent of Colorado full-year resident individual taxpayers itemized deductions on their federal income tax returns, which was similar to national 11611 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT percentages . If the Tax Foundation's prediction is correct and Colorado's filing patterns generally follow national patterns, the number of taxpayers who itemize their deductions will decrease more than 66 percent . This would mean that 14 percent or less of Colorado individual taxpayers would be expected to itemize their federal deductions. Since individual taxpayers must itemize their federal deductions in order to qualify for the State Income Tax Refund Deduction, it appears likely that there will be a corresponding decrease in its use. The volume of corporations claiming the State Income Tax Refund Deduction should not change significantly due to recent federal tax law changes because the standard deduction increase only applies to individual taxpayers, and the state and local tax deduction limit only applies to individual, estate, and trust taxpayers. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE S HAVE ON BENEFICIARI ES? If these deductions w ere eliminated, it could result in taxpayers incurring a larger Colorado tax liability when they overpay their state income taxes, to the extent that the taxpayers itemize state income tax deductions on their federal returns and refund s or credits are included in federal gross income . E XHIBIT 1.4 shows the state tax liability for a hypothetical individual taxpayer who itemized deductions for federal tax purposes under three scenarios: (1) if overpayment of s tate taxes did not occur, (2) if overpayment occurred and the taxpayer took the State Income Tax Refund Deduction, and (3) if overpayment occurred and the ta xpayer did not take the State Income Tax Refund Deduction. 11712 STATE INCOME TAX REFUND DE DUCTIONS EXHIBIT 1. 4.

As EXHIBIT 1.4 demonstrates, the result of a taxpayer taking the State Income Tax Refund Deduction is the same as if the overpayment of taxes had not occurred. If overpayment of state income taxes occurs, the taxpayer includes the refund amount in their federal gross income, and the State Income Tax Refund Deduction is not taken, the taxpayer in this example would incur a $29 ( less than 1 percent) higher Colorado tax liability . ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES OR THROUGH OTHER PRO GRAMS ? Of the 39 states (excluding Colorado) and the District of Columbia that have a broad- based income tax that use s federal taxable income or adjusted gross income as a starting point for calculating state taxable income for individuals, estates, and trusts , at least 35 states and the 11813 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT District of Columbia ( 90 percent ) have a stat e income tax refund deduction or exclusion for individuals, estates, and trusts . Of the 4 3 states (excluding Colorado) a nd the District of Columbia that have a broad -based corporate income tax that uses federal taxable income as the starting point for ca lculating state taxable income , at least 26 states and the District of Columbia (61 percent) have a similar deduction or income exclusion for state income tax refunds included in federal gross income. We did not identify any other Colorado tax expenditures, federal tax provisions, or programs with a similar purpose. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE S? The Department of Revenue was not able to provide us with data for the estates, trusts, and corporation s that claimed the State Income Tax Refund Deductions. Currently, estate and trust taxpayers claim the deduction on Line 5 ( \"Other Subtractions \") of the Colorado Fiduciary Income Tax Return (Form DR 0105) , which also includes several other deductions. C - corporations claim the deduction on Line 13 ( \"Other Subtractions \") of the Colorado Corporation Income Tax Return ( Form DR 0112) , which also includes several other deductions. In all cases, taxpayers are required to submit explanations for the deductions taken as other subtractions, but these explanations are not captured by GenTax. Due to these limitations, we were unable to determine how many estate, trust, or corporation taxpayers claimed these deductions. Additionally, we were unable to provide a revenue impact attributable to the estates, trusts , and corporations claiming this deduction. To address these limitations, the Department of Revenue would have to create new reporting lines on the DR 0105 and DR 0112 and then capture and house the data collected on those lines in GenTax, which would require additional resources (see the Tax Expenditures Overview 11914 STATE INCOME TAX REFUND DE DUCTIONS Section of the Office of the State Auditor's September 2018 Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations ). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? T HE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO REVIEW THE STATE INCOME TAX ADD-BACK PROVISION FOR I NDIVIDUALS , ESTATES , AND TRUSTS [SECTION 39-22-104(3)( d), C.R.S.] FOR TAX YEARS 2018 TO 2025 TO ADDRESS CHANGES TO FEDERAL TAX LAW. Specifically, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act [Pub. L. 115- 97] established a $10,000 state and local tax deduction limit for individuals, estates, and trusts for Tax Years 2018 to 2025. Prior to Tax Year 2018, there was no limit on the amount of state and local taxes that could be deducted. Federal law [26 USC 164] allows taxpayers to deduct state and local real property taxes, personal property taxes, and income or sales taxes , but does not designate the order in which the deductions must be taken or require that the full amount of taxes incurred be deducted. Colorado statute [Section 39- 22-104(3)(d), C.R.S.] requires that only state income taxes taken as a federal deduction be added back to federal taxable income when calculating Colorado taxable income , but does not address how taxpayers should apportion the state and local taxes for the purposes of determining their s tate tax liability with the federa l $10,000 state and local tax deduction limit in place . If a Colorado taxpayer itemized deductions and chose to deduct only property taxes on their federal i ncome tax return and the taxpayer subsequently receives a state income tax refund, the taxpayer would not be required to include the state income tax refund in their federal gross income in the year the refund is received. Consequently, the taxpayer would not need/qualify for the State Income Tax Refund Deduction. For federal tax purposes, a taxpayer with high property and state income taxes may choose to deduct only property taxes if they have $10,000 or more in property taxes to reach the federal limit . In this case, the taxpayer would have no s tate income tax a dd-back and would 12015 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT have a lower s tate tax liability than, for example , if they chose to deduct their state income tax es on their federal return . EXHIBIT 1.5 illustrates the impact on the Colorado taxable income and tax liability of a hypothetical individual taxpayer who itemized deducti ons for federal tax purposes under three scenarios: (1) prior to the enactment of the federal $10,000 state and local tax deduction limit, (2) current law assuming the taxpayer chooses to deduct only local property taxes on their federal return to reach th e $10,000 deduction limit , and (3) current law assuming the taxpayer choose s to deduct only state income taxes on their federal return to reach the $10,000 deduction limit .

Therefore , the federal limit creates a relative advantage for taxpayers with high local property taxes, for example taxpayers who own large or multiple properties. These taxpayers would also be less likely to qualify for the State Income Ta x Refund Deduction because they would have less in state income taxes deducted from their federal return that could have later been subject to a state income tax refund inclusion on their federal returns. Taxpayers who paid less local property tax es would be at a relative disadvantage because they would need to deduct more in state income taxes to reach the $10,000 federal cap and would then be required to add back more of their federal deduction when calculating their Colorado taxable income. These taxpayers would be more likely to qualify for the State Income Tax Deduction because they are more likely to have deducted state income taxes that were later subject to a state income tax refund inclusion on their federal return. Because the federal cap on state and local tax deductions was not in place when the General Assembly created the State Income Tax Refund Deduction and the State's current law regarding what federal deductions taxpayers must add back to their federal taxable income to calculate their Colorado taxable income, it may want to consider whether to address the potential difference in Colorado taxable income based on how taxpayers choose to deduct state and local taxes when filing their federal returns. For example, the General Assembly could require that taxpayers add back some portion of the state income taxes they could have deducted on their federal return, up to $10,000. It is important to note that this issue is more likely to impact higher - income taxpayers who itemize their deductions and have more than $10,000 in state and local tax liabilities. Most individuals in Colorado would likely not be impacted because they either use the standard deduction on their federal return or because they have less than $10,000 12217 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT in state and local taxes to deduct when itemizing their federal deductions . In addition, under current law, the federal state and local tax deduction limit may increas e taxpayers ' taxable income overall , at both the federal and s tate level. T herefore, some taxpayers may be likely to pay more in taxes under the current law than they would have prior to the federal deduction limit, regardless of how they choo se to structure their state and local tax deduction. 123 124FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORSACRAMENTAL WINES EXCISE TAX EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY SEPTEMBER 2018 2018-TE7 THIS EVALUATION IS INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2018 YEAR ENACTED 1933 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT $2,600 (CALENDAR YEAR 2017) NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine AVERAGE T AXPAYER BENEFIT Could not determine IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? Partially , because it is not applied to all sales WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? This expenditure e xcludes sacramental wines that are used for religious purposes from the liquor excise tax. WHAT DID THE EVALUAT ION FIND? Although the Sacramental Wines Exemption is meeting its purpose for sales of sacramental wine from specialized sacramental wine distributors to religious organizations, it is likely not being applied to sales of sacramental wines from liquor stores. The exemption has a minimal economic impact. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for this tax expenditure. We inferred that the purpose is to exempt wine used for religious purposes from liquor excise taxes to avoid taxing religious organizations. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The General Assembly could consider amending the Sacramental Wines Exemption to accommodate multiple distribution paths for sacramental wines and to ensure that all religious groups are treated equally. 125 1263 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT SACRAMENTAL WINES EXCISE TAX EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? Following the en d of the Prohibition Era (1920-1933), Colorado was one of many states that legalized the production, sale, and use of liquor . With the legalization of liquor for consumption in 1933, Colorado created an excise tax on alcoholic beverages, which included a tax exemption for medicinal and sacramental liquors. Two years later, in 1935, the General Assembly amended the statute [Section 44-3- 106(1), C.R.S.] to remove medicinal liquors and to limit the exemption to\"sacramental wines sold and used for religious purposes.\" Statute has retained t his wording ever since. Excise taxes ar e taxes paid when purchases are made of a specific good and are often included in the price of the product and passed on to consumers. Liquor excise taxes are paid by distributors, manufacturers, and wholesalers the first time alcoholic beverages are sold or transferred within Colorado, which typically occurs when a licensed liquor distributor sells alcoholic beverages to a retailer or when a Colorado - based manufacturer sells alcoholic beverages to a distributor. The distributors , manufacturers , and wholesalers are required to report and remit the liquor excise taxes to the Department of Revenue using F orm DR 0442 on a monthly basis. However, because the Sacramental Wine s Exemption excludes wines used for religious purposes from the liquor excise tax and all related regulations , distributors and manufacturers are not required to apply the excise tax to these sales or report them to the Department of Revenue. 1274 SACRAMENTAL WINES EX CISE TAX EXEMPTION WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not e xplicitly identify the intended beneficiaries of this exemption. We inferred, based on the legislative history and Colorado's tax structure , that the intended beneficiaries are religious organizations, because liquor excise taxes are typically passed on to final consumers in the form of higher prices. Producers of sacramental wine may also indirectly benefit if religious organizations decide to purchase greater quantities or more expensive sacramental wine due to the exemption. However, because the savings most religious organizations realize from the exemption are relatively small, it appears unlikely that the exemption would change their purchasing decisions enough to provide any significant benefit to producers. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute does not e xplicitly state a purpose for this e xemption. We inferred, based on the legislative history, Colorado's tax structure , and language in the exemption that the purpose is to avoid taxing religious organizations. Although statute does not limit the exemption to purchasers who are religious organizations, the excise tax on liquor and the Sacramental Wine s Exemption were created at the end of Prohibition, during which time religious organizations were the only entities authorized to purchase sacramental wine under the Volstead Act, which enforced the 18th Amendment's prohibitions on liquor . IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We determined tha t the Sacramental Wines Exemption is meeting its purpose for most sales of sacramental wine purchased by churches from religious supply stores, but may not be meeting its purpose for sales made through liquor stores. 1285 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this expenditure. Therefore , we created the following performance measure based on the purpose we inferred, publicly available information on the typical practices related to the purchase of sacramental wine, and our discussions with stakeholders. PERFORMANCE MEASURE : Does the expenditure effectively exempt all purchases of wine for religious purposes from liquor excise taxes? RESULT : In practice, only certain purchases of sacramental wine are exempt from the li quor excise tax. According to our discussions with stakeholders, including representatives from religious organizations, sacramental wine producers, and liquor distributors and stores, this occurs because of varying practices for purchasing sacramental win es. Specifically, for Christian churches that use sacramental wine, most purchase the wine from religious supply stores in Colorado. Most of this wine comes from two out-of-state sacramental wine producers and based on discussions with representatives from these producers and the religious supply stores that sell sacramental wines , neither are paying the excise tax on sacramental wine sales made in Colorado. Therefore, Christian churches purchasing wine made by these producers from religious supply stores a re not paying the tax through higher prices. However, there are many smaller producers of sacramental wines that sell directly to churches, religious organizations, and suppliers and we lacked sufficient data to determine the extent to which they also apply the exemption. In contrast, sac ramental wine purchased through liquor stores may include the excise tax. For example, this may occur with purchases of kosher wines, which are used for Jewish religious ceremonies. According to representatives from Jewis h religious organizations, synagogues typically purchase kosher wines from liquor stores because they are not commonly sold through specialized religious supply stores similar to those that supply Christian churches. In addition, Jews who follow a kosher diet purchase kosher wines at liquor stores for home consumption. We contacted two liquor distributor s in the state, who confirmed that, like all the wine they sell, the excise tax is applied to 1296 SACRAMENTAL WINES EX CISE TAX EXEMPTION their kosher wines and it would be difficult to apply the exem ption because to do so they would need to determine which purchases would ultimately be used for religious purposes , as opposed to regular home consumption. They reported that these wines make up a small percentage of their overall sales, making the admini strative costs of attempting to apply the exemption greater than the potential benefit. We could not estim ate the percentage of wine that qualifies for the exemption, but that may nevertheless be taxed, because sales of sacramental wines are not reported to the Department of Revenue and we could not identify a reliable source of information to estimate the amount of wine sold by liquor stores that is used for religious purposes. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The Sacramental Wi nes Exemption has very little impact on state revenue or the State's economy. Based on the limited data available to us, which was provided voluntarily by some wine producers, we estimate that the State lost about $2, 600 in liquor excise taxes in 2017 as a result of the Sacramental Wine s Exemption. Given the relatively small economic impact, it is unlikely that taxpayers are making decisions based on the existence of this expenditure and the economic costs and benefits are likely minimal. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMIN ATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Eliminating this e xemption would likely have a small impact on the current beneficiaries. The excise tax on vinous liquor (i.e., wine) is about $.07 per liter, plus a $.01 surcharge and an additional excise tax of between $.01 and $.05 per liter, depending on the volume sold by the distributor. When all of the excise taxes and surcharges are combined, on average, a typical 750 milliliter bottle of wine is subject to about $.085 in excise tax. Therefore, a church that purchases 100 bottles of wine per year would incur additional expenses of about $8.50 1307 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT if the full cost of the excise tax were transferred to the church through increased prices. In addition, distributors and manufacturers of sacramental wines would have to accommodate additional reporting and collection requirements required by the Department of Revenue. ARE THERE SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? A tax expendit ure for sacramental wine is available in 18 states. However, not all states provide an exemption from taxation at the initial point of sale like Colorado. Instead, some states require religious organizations to seek a refund from the s tate for taxes paid on sacramental wine. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? We identified one othe r tax expenditure or program in the State with a similar purpose \u2014the Sales to Charitable and Religious O rganizations Sales Tax Exemption [Section 39- 26-718(1)(a), C.R.S.], which exempts most religious organizations from paying sales taxes on all types of products normally subject to sales tax, including wine used for religious purposes. While the Sales to Charitable Organization s Exemption is broader than the Sacramental Wine s Exemption and applies to a different type of tax , they both limit the tax burden on religious organizations for purchases of wine used for religious purposes. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMP ACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE ? The Department of Re venue does not collect any data and there is no other central source of data related to this exemption. Although the Department collects monthly reports from licensed liquor distributo rs on excise taxes through F orm DR 0442, this form does not collect any information related to the Sacramental Wines Exemption and manufacturers and distributors of sacramental wine that do not sell other alcoholic beverages are not currently required to f ile excise tax reports with the Department of Revenue. The General Assembly could 1318 SACRAMENTAL WINES EX CISE TAX EXEMPTION amend statute to change the excise tax reporting requirements and direct the Department of Revenue to modify the form , and make changes in GenTax to collect data on the exemption, which would allow us to create a more accurate revenue impact estimate for the exemption and better identify the beneficiaries. However, this type of reporting may not be cost effective because it would impose an additional burden on distributors and manufacturers and would require additional resources at the Department of Revenue to cover programming costs and staff time , which would likely be larger than the exemption's revenue impact to the State (see the Tax Expenditures Overview section of this C ompilation Report for details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing these limitations) . WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? As currently appl ied, the Sacramental Wines Exemption may provide a small benefit to some religious organizations while excluding others based on how the wine is purchased. In addition, because the current exemption only applies to wine, it may treat religious organizations that use non- vinous sacramental liquors for ceremonies differently than those that use wine. Further, although the purpose of the exemption was likely to avoid taxing religious organizations, the statutory language does not limit the exemption to only sacramental wine purchased by religious organizations , and individuals who purchase wine for religious purpose s, such as ceremonies conducted at home, may also pay the excise tax as part of the purchase price. Although we did not conduct a full legal analysis, this difference in treatment could be problematic under the U .S. and Colorado Constitutions, both of which prohibit the State from enacting laws that give preference to one religious denomination over another , and some U .S. Supreme Court rulings, which under some circumstances, have found that governments should not favor a religious purpose over a secular purpose . On the other hand, it is unclear whether taxpayers who do not benefit from the exemption are experiencing a sufficient burden (i.e. , the additional cost of paying the excise tax) to result in a violation of the U .S. or Colorado Constitutions. 1329 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT To address these is sues, the General Assembly could consider amending the Sacramental Wine s Exemption to accommodate the different distribution paths sacramental wines take to get to religious organizations and individuals who conduct religious ceremonies using wine. For example, one option could be to allow for rebates of liquor excise taxes paid on sales of sacramental wine made by liquor stores, as is done in several other states. However, because of the small benefit this would provide to consumers (about $.085 per bottle of wine), there may be few potential beneficiaries who would take advantage of a rebate and the cost of administering the rebate program would likely exceed the benefit. In addition, though the use of non- vinous liquors for religious purposes is uncommon, the General Assembly could also consider expanding the exemption to cover the sacramental use of all alcoholic beverages. Alternatively, the General Assembly could ensure equ al treatment of all religious groups by eliminating the exemption altogether. 133 1341 EXCISE TAX EXEMPTION FOR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ORIGINATING OUTSIDE THE U.S. APRIL 2020 EVALUATION SUMMARY 2020 -TE13 THIS EVALUATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2020 YEAR ENACTED 1969 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT Could not determine NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine AVERAGE TAXPAYER BENE FIT Could not determine IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ?

The Excise Tax Exemption for Alcoholic Beverages Originating Outside the U.S. (Foreign Alcohol Exemption) exempts individuals from paying excise tax on up to 1 gallon (or 4 liters ) of alcoholic beverages in their possession when they arrive in Colorado airports on flights originating outside the United States. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state the purpose of this exemption. We inferred that its purpose is to simplify taxpayer compliance and decrease s tate administrative and enforcement costs associated with collecting the excise tax. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? We determined that the expenditure is meeting its purpose because it is likely being used . WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The General Assembly may want to consider modifying this exemption to align it with Department of Revenue practice, which is to allow the exemption for up to 1 gallon (4 liters) of alcoholic beverages brought into the state, regardless of where they were obtained or how they were brought into Colorado. 1352 EXCISE TAX EXEMPTION FO R ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE S ORIGINATING OUTSID E THE U.S. EXCISE TAX EXEMPTION FOR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ORIGINATING OUTSIDE THE U.S. EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? According to statute [Section 44-3- 503(1), C.R. S.], alcohol ic beverages sold, offered for sale, or used in the state are subject to an excise tax as provided in E XHIBIT 1.1. EXHIBIT 1.1 . EXCISE TAX RATES BY ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE T YPE CALENDAR YEAR 2019 BEVERAGE TYPE TAX RATE Beer, m alt liquors, fermented malt beverages, and hard cider $0.08 per gallon Wine $0.0733 per liter Spirits $0.6026 per liter SOURCE: Section 44 -3-503(1), C.R.S. The Excise Tax Exemption for Alcoholic Beverages Originating Outside of the U .S. (Foreign Alcohol Exemption) [Sec tion 44-3-106(4), C.R.S.] exempts individuals from paying Colorado excise tax on up to 1 gallon (or 4 liters) of alcoholic beverages in their possession when they arrive at any Colorado airport on a flight originating outsi de the United States. This expenditure has remained functionally unchanged since it was enacted in 1969 by House Bill 69-1081, with the exception of House Bill 77 -1176 , which raised the volume limit from the original 1 quart to the current 1 gallon (or 4 liters) in 1977. The Department of Revenue does not require individuals to take any administrative steps to claim this tax expenditure, as long as they do 1363 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT not possess more than 1 gallon ( or 4 liters) of alcohol ic beverages when they arrive in the state . Any individual who brings more than this amount must report and pay excise tax on the volume in excess of the exempt amount using the Department of Revenue's Personal Excise Tax Return for Alcoholic Beverages (Form DR 0 449), which is also used to report beverages shipped into Colorado via mail and beverages brought into Colorado from other states. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly identify the intended beneficiaries of this tax expenditure. Based on statutory language, we inferred that the intended benefi ciaries are adult s arriving at an y airport in Colorado on a flight originating in a foreign country who possess small quantities of alcoholic beverages . In addition, the State appears to benefit from this exemption, since the amount of excise tax that would otherwise be collected, a maximum of $2.41 per person, may not be sufficient to cover the administra tive and enforcement costs associated with collecting the tax . WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for this tax expenditure. Therefore, based on its operation, we inferred that the purpose of the Foreign Alcohol Exemption is to simplify taxpayer compliance and decrease state administrative costs. According to the Tax Policy Handbook for State Legislators, 3rd Edition, published by the National Conference of State Legislatures, \"A quality tax system facili tates taxpayer compliance by minimizing the time and effort necessary to comply with the law. It also minimizes the cost of the state administrative apparatus necessary to collect revenue, enforce the law, and audit to ensure compliance with the law.\" Impo sing an excise tax on small quantities of alcohol, which are intended for personal use, would likely be difficult to enforce and could increase t he State's admini strative costs without a significant enough corresponding increase in tax revenue. Thus, we inferred that the exemption is a 1374 EXCISE TAX EXEMPTION FO R ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE S ORIGINATING OUTSID E THE U.S. structural provision intended to increase the efficiency of the State's tax system. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We determined that the Foreign Alcohol Exemption is likely meeting its purpose, but it is unclear to what extent it is used because we were unable to determine the number of taxpayers claiming the exemption or th e quantity of alcohol that was exempt . Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this tax expenditure. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine if the expenditure is meeting its inferred purpose: P ERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent are eligible individuals utilizing the Foreign Alcohol Exemption? RESULT : Individuals who bring in less than 1 gallon (4 liters) of alcoholic beverages are not required to take any action to receive the exemption, so it is likely that nearly all eligible individuals are able to avoid paying excise tax es, as intended. However, because these individuals are not required to report to the Department of Revenue regarding the alcoholic beverages they bring into the state under the exemption, we wer e unable to determine how many used the exemption or the volume of alcohol they brought into the state. Additionally , taxpayers who bring in more than 1 gallon ( or 4 liters) of alcoholic beverages and file the Personal Excise Tax Return for Alcoholic Beverages ( Form DR 0449), as required , are likely to benefit from the e xemption because the fo rm instructs them to only report and pay excise tax on the amount in excess of 1 gallon (or 4 liters) . However, as shown in E XHIBIT 1.2, it appears that a relatively small number of taxpayers filed this form during Calendar Years 2015 through 2019 . 1385 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT EXHIBIT 1.2 . NUMBER OF PERSONAL EXCISE TAX RETURN FOR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES FORMS FILED CALENDAR YEAR S 2015 THROUGH 2019 YEAR FORMS FILED 2015 126 2016 117 2017 125 2018 144 2019 111 Average (2015-2019) 125 SOURCE: Department of Revenue . WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? We lacked information necessary to estimate the Foreign Alcohol Exemption's revenue impact to the State. However, because the State's excise tax rates are relatively low, the exemption likely reduces state revenue by only a small amount (and saves taxpayers a corresponding amount) . For example, although we did not have data on the percentage of international travelers who have brought alcohol into the state, if 5 percent of the 1.1 million inbound international passengers who travelled through Denver International Airport during Calendar Year 2019 possessed the maximum amount of alcohol allowed under the exemption, the exemption would have reduced state revenue by a maximum of $ 133,000. This hypothetical is based on 55,000 passengers (5 percent of the 1.1 million inbound international travelers above) each receiving the maximum potential value of the exemption, $2.41. However, because it would be difficult for the S tate to enforce the excise tax for alcohol brought into the state for personal use and many passengers likely bring in less than the maximum amount , the amount of tax that the State would have actually collect ed under this scenario would likely be substantially less than this amount. Further, the exemption' s revenue impact to the State is likely offset by a reduction in administrative and enforcement costs that would otherwise be necessary to collect the tax . 1396 EXCISE TAX EXEMPTION FO R ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE S ORIGINATING OUTSID E THE U.S. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? If this expenditure were eliminated and the excise tax was enforced on small quantities of alcohol brought into the state , the State would see increased administrative and enforceme nt costs . In addition, e very person bringing alcoholic beverages into Colorado by air from a foreign country would be required to file the Personal Excise Tax Return for Alcoholic Beverages ( Form DR 0449) and pay the applicable excise tax. These t axpayers, however, woul d only incur a small excise tax liability . For example, a taxpayer bringing 1 liter of wine into Colorado from a foreign country would be required to pay $0.07 . As discussed, t he highest tax rate on alcoholic beverages is on spirits, at $0.6026 per liter, which equates to a tax of $2.41 per person for the maximum amount that qualifies for the exemption. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? Every state in the U.S. and the Distri ct of Columbia lev ies a tax on alcoholic bever ages. We identified 10 states with tax expenditures similar to Colorado's Foreign A lcohol Exemption, as shown in EXHIBIT 1.3. In addition, it is possible that other states that lack an explicit exemption, also provide a similar exemption in practice, because of the difficulty in enforcing an excise tax for small amounts of alcohol for personal use and because some states only apply their excise tax to sales of alcohol that occur in the state. 1407 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT EXHIBIT 1.3 .

WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE? The Department of Revenue does not collect data on this expenditure , and we were unable to locate data sufficient to estimat e its state revenue impact or the number of individuals who claim it . Individuals who bring in 1 gallon ( 4 liters) or less of alcoholic beverages are not required to report their use of the exemption. In addition, the Department of Revenue does not require individuals who bring in more than the exempt amount and file the Personal Excise Tax Return for Alcoholic Beverages ( Form DR 0449) to indicate the volume or type of alcohol 1418 EXCISE TAX EXEMPTION FO R ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE S ORIGINATING OUTSID E THE U.S. that was exempt. Because the excise tax varies based on the type of alcoholic beverage brought in, without this information we were not able to calculate the revenue impact of the exemption for individuals who submitted Form DR 0449. In order to collect this information, the Department of Reven ue would have to require taxpayers to report the amount and type of alcohol that qualified for the Foreign Alcohol Exemption, and would likely have to modify the Personal Excise Tax Return for Alcoholic Beverages ( Form DR 0449) by adding a line on which ta xpayers could report this information. T he Department of Revenue would also have to capture and house the additional data collected in GenTax, the Department of Revenue's tax processing system, which would require additional resources and may not be practi cal given the small size of the exemption for each taxpayer (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER CLARIFYING STATUTE TO SPECIFY WHETHER THE FOREIGN ALCOHOL EXEMPTION SHOULD APPLY TO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES THAT ENTER COLORADO THROU GH MEANS OTHER THAN AIR TRAVEL FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY . Although statute [Section 44 -3-106(4), C.R.S.] limits the exemption to alcoholic beverages that individuals bring into the state by passenger flights originating in another country, Department of Reven ue taxpayer guidance indicates that it current ly allows an exemption for up to 1 gallon (4 liters) of alcoholic beverages regardless of where the al coholic beverages were obtained or how individuals brought them into Colorado (e.g., driven in, brought in o n domestic flights , mailed ). This practice likely aligns with our inferred purpose of the Foreign Alcohol Exemption since it would also be difficult to enforce the state excise tax on small amounts of alcohol ic beverages brought in for personal use through other means of transport . However, clarifying statute to 1429 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT indicate the General Assembly's intent would assist taxpayers in determining when they are required to pay the excise tax . If the General Assembly expanded the Foreign Alcohol E xemption to include a lcohol brought into the state thr ough all forms of travel, it would likely have little additional revenue impact to the State since this is already the Department of Revenue's practice. If the General Assembly instead directed the Department of Revenue to enforce the excise tax on instances that fall outside of current statute, it could increase state revenue; however, we lacked data to quantify this impact and the increased revenue would likely be offset by increased administrative and enforcement costs incurred by the Department of Revenue to enforce the excise tax . 143 1441 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITOR EXCISE TAX CREDIT FO R UNSALABLE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES JULY 2019 EVALUATION SUMMARY 2019 -TE25 THIS EVALUATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2019 YEAR ENACTED 1953 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT $153,000 CALENDAR YEAR 2017 NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS 98 AVERAGE T AXPAYER BENEFIT $1,561 IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? Yes, but it appears to be underutilized WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? The Excise Tax Credit for Unsalable Alcoholic Beverages [Section 44 -3-503(9), C.R.S.] ( Unsalable Alcoholic Beverages Credit) allows manufacturers and distributors of alcohol that have already paid state excise taxes on alcoholic beverages to receive a credit for the amou nt of the tax paid attributable to the alcoholic beverages that later become unfit for sale due to damage or destruction. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explici tly state a purpose for this tax expenditure. We inferred that the purpose is to avoid taxing alcoholic beverage manufacturers and distributors for products that cannot be sold. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? We determined that the Unsalable Alcoholic Beverages Credit is likely meeting its purpose, but may be underutilized by the taxpayers eligible to claim it. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The General Assembly may want to consider amending statute to clarify whether it intended to allow taxpayers to take the credit for alcoholic beverages rendered unsalable due to spoilage. 1452 EXCISE TAX CREDIT FO R UNSALABLE ALCOHOLI C BEVERAGES EXCISE TAX CREDIT FO R UNSALABLE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? The Excise Tax Credit for Unsalable Alcoholic Beverages [Section 44- 3-503(9), C.R.S.] ( Unsalable Alcoholic Beverages Credit) allows manufacturers and distributors of alcohol ic beverages to receive a credit or refund for the amount of excise taxes previously paid for alcoholic beverages that later become unfit for sale due to damage or destruction. This credit was enacted in 1953 and it has operated similarly since that time. Colorado levies an excise tax on alcoholic beverages, which is calculated based on the volume of the beverages and the following tax rates , which vary based on the type of beverage: $0.08 per gallon for malt liquor, beer, and hard cider $0.0833 per liter for wine $0.6026 per liter of spirituous liquor Alcohol excise taxes are due from the seller the first time alcoholic beverages are sold , transferred, or otherwise disposed of within Colorado, which typically occurs when a manufacturer sells Colorado- made alcoholic bevera ges to a distributor or when a distribu tor sells alcoholic beverages shipped from outside the state to a Colorado wholesa ler or retailer. However, for administrative convenience, some manufacturers and distributors pay the excise tax prior to the sale of the alcoholic beverages. Taxpayers are required to report and remit the alcohol excise taxes to the Department of Revenue on a monthly basis using the Department of Revenue's Monthly Report of Excise Tax for Alcohol Beverages (Form DR 0442) . 1463 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT To claim the credit, taxpayers record the amount of alcohol destroyed or damaged and the associated tax on Form DR 0442, effectively offsetting their current tax liability by the amount of excise tax they previously paid on the alcoholic beverages that were destroyed. Alternatively, taxpayers may also claim the c redit as a refund using the Department of Revenue's Claim for Refund F orm ( Form DR 0137. ) To qualify for the credit or refund, taxpayers must also submit evidence to the Department of Revenue sh owing that the tax was paid and provide an affidavit itemizing the products destroyed along with the date of destruction and an authorized signature. In cases where taxpayers plan the destruction in advance , Department of Revenue guidance directs taxpayers to notify the Department of Revenue of their intention to destroy the unsalable beverages at least 4 weeks in advance and a department r epresentative may attend to witness the destruction . However, a ccording to Department of Revenue staff, this does not typically occur in practice. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not directly identify the intended beneficiaries of this tax expenditure . Based on the statutory language, we inferred that the intended beneficiaries are alcoholic beverage manufacturers and distributors because the Unsalable Alcoholic Beverages Credit lowers their overall tax liability when products are no longer salable due to destruction or damage. According to stakeholders, it is common for small amounts of alcoholic beverage products to become destroyed or damaged in the course of normal production, transportation, and storage. For example , bottles may be dropped and broken, underfilled , or mislabeled. Although less common, major accidents and natural disasters such as fires, flooding, and storms can also cause larger scale damage to alcoholic beverages. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statu te does not explici tly state the purpose for this tax expenditure. We inferred that the purpose is to avoid taxing alcoholic beverage 1474 EXCISE TAX CREDIT FO R UNSALABLE ALCOHOLI C BEVERAGES manufacturers and distributors for products that cannot be sold. Although manufacturers and distributors are typically required to pay the excise tax , alcoholic beverage excise taxes are generally intended to be passed through to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since damaged products are unsalable, the taxes already paid on such products cannot be passed through to consumers. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We determined that the Unsalable Alcoholic Beverages Credit is likely meeting its purpose, but may be underutilized by the taxpayers eligible to claim it. Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this expenditure. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to de termine the extent to which the credit is meeting its inferred purpose: P ERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent do eligible taxpayers claim the Unsalable Alcoholic Beverages Credit to avoid pay ing excise taxes on destroyed or damaged products? RESULT : Although the credit is regularly claimed by some taxpayers, especially larger manufacturers, w e found that it is likely that many eligible taxpayers do not claim it. According to Department of Revenue data, 98 taxpayers took the credit during Calendar Year 2017. These 98 taxpayers represent 19 percent of the 525 alcoholic beverage manufacturers (402) and distributors (123) operating in the state. Although we did not have data showing how many manufacturers and distributors were eligible for the credit (i.e., the y paid excise taxes on alcohol that was later unsalable ), it is unlikely that only 19 percent of manufacturers and distributors would have had an eligible loss . This low utilization rate may be due to the relatively small benefit the credit provides. Spe cifically, s ome stakeholders reported that the administrative cost of filing for the credit often exceeds its value. For example, the excise tax on beer is $0 .08 per gallon, so an accident 1485 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT resulting in the loss of a single keg ( about 15.5 gallons of beer ) would only entitle the business to a refund of $1.24. The l oss of an entire pallet of 16 kegs would only result in a refund of $19.84. Since filing for the expenditure requires tracking of losses and the completion of additional paperwork, some businesses may decide not to file for it and instead simply absorb the loss or only use it when large losses occur. The low utilization rate may also be due to the credit having some overlap with the commercial property insurance maintained by businesses, which typically covers most loss of product at retail value. Since the retail price of the products generally passes the excise tax on to consumers, in some cases , an insurance claim might already cover the value of the excise taxes paid, making a refund from the state redundant. However, businesses typically only make insurance claims in cases of ma jor disaster, so the c redit would likely not overlap for the smalle r incidents that stakeholders reported were most common. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? According to the Department of Revenue's 2018 Tax Profile and Expenditure Report , the Unsalable Alcoholic Beverages Credit reduced state revenue by $153,000 in Calendar Year 2017. This figure was based on taxpayers who filed the Monthly Report of Excise Tax for Alcohol Beverages (Form DR 0442) to claim the credit. According to Department of Revenue data, of the 98 businesses that claimed the expenditure, 10 accounted for 95 percent of the total revenue impact. However, because the Department of Revenue 's estimate does not include the amount that taxpayers claimed for a refund using Form DR 0137, the revenue impact it rep orted may understate the total impact. Additionally, the revenue impact of this tax expenditure is subject to fluctuation over time. For example, the Department of Revenue reports that this expenditure reduced state revenue by $708,000 in C alendar Year 2 015. Major accidents and disasters, such as destructive weather events or fires that result in significant loss of product, are unpredictable and will vary from year -to-year. 1496 EXCISE TAX CREDIT FO R UNSALABLE ALCOHOLI C BEVERAGES WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Eliminating the c redit would likely have a small impact on most of the current beneficiaries. Specifically, the Department of Revenue reported that ne t collections under the alcohol ic beverages excise tax totaled $ 47 million in Fiscal Year 2018. In compari son, based on Department of Revenue Data, $15 4,000 in additional excise taxes would have been owed in Fiscal Year 2018 if the credit was not available, which would represent less than a 1 percent increase in the total excise taxes owed on alcoholic beverag es. Further more , a majority of the taxpayers who claimed the credit in Calendar Year 2017 received less than $100 in credits, although several larger producers claimed over $10,000. In our discussions with stakeholders, some reported that although the c redit contribute s to a favorable business climate for the industry, it is less significant due to Colorado's relatively low excise taxes. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? A tax expenditure for unsalable alcoholic bevera ges is available in 20 states (excluding Colorado) and the District of Columbia. While all of th ese tax expenditures allow taxpayers a tax credit for alcoholic beverages that are rendered unsalable due to damage, they differ in their treatment of other reasons f or product loss. For example, 16 other states and the District of Columbia allow a similar credit for alcoholic beverages that cannot be sold due to spoilage. In addition, three other states and the District of Columbia offer a similar tax expenditure for products that have been lost due to theft. Finally, two states , Michigan and North Carolina, restrict the tax expenditure to apply only to major disasters that result in losses over a minimum threshold (e.g., over $250) . ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? There is a federal tax expenditure [26 USC5064] that broadly exempts alcoholic be verages lost due to damage or destruction from federal alcohol excise taxes. However, the federal tax expenditure is restricted 1507 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT to losses where the excise tax paid totals $250 or more, except when the President has declared a major disaster area. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE? The Department of Revenue was unable to provide data from its Claim for Refund Form ( Form DR 0137) , which some taxpayers may use to apply for refunds based on the credit instead of including it on their monthly e xcise tax form (Form DR 0442). DR 0137 combi nes refund requests related to many different tax provisions, and cannot be disaggregated for the purposes of determining the amount of the Unsalable Alcoholic Beverages Credit claimed as a refund. To collect this additional information, the Department of Revenue would need to add a reporting line specifically for the c redit on the DR 0137, although this would require additional resources (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's September 2018 Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING ST ATUTE TO CLARIFY WHETHER IT INTENDED TO ALLOW TAXPAYERS TO TAKE TH E CREDIT FOR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES RENDERED UNSALABLE DUE TO SPOILAGE . According appli es to beverages \"rendered unsalable by reason of destruction or damage.\" However, the terms \"destruction\" and \"damage\" are not further defined. Therefore, it is unclear whether the General Assembly intended to include spoiled alcoholic beverages within the meaning of these terms. The Department of Revenue has interpreted statute to disallow taxpayers from claiming the c redit for beverages that cannot be sold due to spoilage and has issued clear guidance to taxpayers indicating that they should not claim the credit under these circumstances. However, an industry stakeholder reported 1518 EXCISE TAX CREDIT FO R UNSALABLE ALCOHOLI C BEVERAGES that some taxpayers may not make a distinction between different types of losses when claiming the c redit and may include losses due to spoilage in the amount they claim. As discussed, 16 of the 20 states (excluding Colorado) and District of Columbia with a similar tax expenditure, include losses for spoilage as eligible for the credit . 152FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITOROCCASIONAL SALE OF LIQUOR BY PUBLIC AUC TION EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY SEPTEMBER 2018 2018-TE6 THIS EVALUATION IS INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2018 YEAR ENACTED 1935 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT None NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS None AVERAGE T AXPAYER BENEFIT None IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? No WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? This tax expenditure e stablishes an excise tax exemption for liquor, including beer, wine and spirits, sold through a public auction that came into the seller's possession under one of the following circumstances: (1) the seller possesses the liquor and the owner has failed to claim the liquor or furnish instructions for its disposition , (2) the seller obtains the liquor as part of the foreclosure of a lien, (3) the liquor has been salvaged or damaged in transit , or (4) the seller operates a charitable organization and receives the liquor as a donation. Typically, e xcise tax is paid by the entity with a Colorado liquor license at the time of first transfer within the state and this exemption relieves the seller from the requirement to be licensed and to pay the excise tax WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for this tax expenditure. We infer that the purpose is to simplify taxpayer compliance and decrease state administrative costs. WHAT DID THE EVALUAT ION FIND? Our evaluation found that the tax expenditure is likely not being used. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The General Assembly could consider repealing this exemption. 1531543 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT OCCASIONAL SALE OF LIQUOR BY PUBLIC AUCTION EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? The excise tax exempt ion for Occasional Sales of Liquor by Public Auction [Section 44-3- 106(3)(a), C.R.S.] applies to auctions for the disposal of liquor , including beer, wine and spirits, that lawfully came into the possession of the seller under the following circumstances: Failure of the owne r to claim the liquor or furnish instructions for disposition of it (e.g., if a deceased person did not include instructions in their will for who will inherit their wine collection). Foreclosure o f lawful lien (e.g., if liquor is used as collateral on a loan, and the loan is not repaid). Salvage of the liquor or shipments damaged in transit (e.g., if the liquor 's packaging is damaged so it is no longer saleable through retail but still has value). Lawful donation of liquor to a charit y. The Occasional Sa les of Liquor by Public Auction Exemption was enacted in 1935 and it has remained largely unchanged since then, with the exception of expanding it in 1994 to include lawful donation of liquor to a charity. The seller is not required to pay excise taxes and is not subject to liquor licensing requirements for transactions covered by the exemption and likewise does not need to comply with the reporting requirements for licensed liquor distributors or retailers. However, statute [Section 44-3- 106(3)(b), C.R.S .] requires that the \"state 1554 OCCASIONAL SALE OF LIQUOR BY PUBLIC AUCTION EXEMPTION licensing authority\" (i.e., the Division of Enforcement, within the Department of Revenue) \" shall be presented records of all transactions\" subject to the Occasional Sales of Liquor by Public Auction Exemption, though the process for such reporting is not defined by statute or the Department of Revenue. In addition, because the exemption applies to the excise tax but not to State sales tax, sellers and auctioneers who regularly conduct retail sales, and who are required to file sales tax returns, must report the value of the Occasional Sales of Liquor by Public Auction Exemption on Retail S ales Tax Return (Form DR 0100 ). Sellers whose only retail sales are occasional sales of liquor by p ublic auction, may not be required to obtain a sales tax license [Section 39- 26-103(6) C.R.S.] or file a Retail S ales Tax R eturn if their total sales do not exceed $1,000 annually [Section 39- 26-103(9)(d), C.R.S.] but they must file an annual report of cas ual sales with their income tax return. It is important t o note that the Occasional Sales of Liquor by Public Auction Exemption is distinct from other provisions related to the auction of liquor . Specifically, public auctions related to tax compliance (e.g., when a business fails to pay its state or local taxes and its property is sold at auction) are covered under Section 39- 21-114, C.R.S., and the exemption does not apply. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not e xplicitly identify the intended beneficiaries of this exemption. We inferred that the intended beneficiaries are entities or individuals that come into possession of liquor under the specific circumstances identified in the exemption and the public who would purchase liquor through a public auction. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute does not e xplicitly state a purpose for this tax expenditure. Based on our review of tax policy best practices, we inferred that the purpose is to simplify taxpayer compliance and decrease state 1565 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT administrative costs. According to the Tax Policy Handbook for State Legislators, 3rd Edition , published by the National Conference of State Legislatures, \"A quality tax system facilitates taxpayer compliance by minimizing the time and effort necessary to comply with the law. It also minimizes the cost of the state administrative apparatus necessar y to collect revenue, enforce the law, and audit to ensure compliance with the law.\" At the time it was created, the Occasional Sales of Liquor by Public Auction Exemption applied to limited sales by people or entities that did not typically sell liquor. Imposing a n excise tax on these types of sales may have increased the State's administrative costs without a large increase in tax revenue. Thus, we inferred that this exemption was intended to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the State's tax system by easing the compliance burden for taxpayers and decreasing administrative costs for the State. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We determined that the Occasional Sales of Liquor by Public Auction Exemption is not meeting its purpose because we were unable to find evidence that public auctions of liquor covered by the exemption are occurring. Statute does not provi de a quantifiable performance measure for this exemption. Therefore, we evaluated the Occasional Sales of Liquor by Public Auction Exemption using the following performance measure that we inferred based on general principles of an efficient tax system. PERFORMANCE MEASURE : Are taxpayers using this exemption t o ease their administrative burden and avoid the excise tax on liquor ? RESULT : It appears that taxpayers are not using this tax exemption. Because these sales are exempt from excise tax and liquor licensing requirements, there is not currently a Departmen t of Revenue form to capture the amount of foregone excise tax. The sales tax from these sales 1576 OCCASIONAL SALE OF LIQUOR BY PUBLIC AUCTION EXEMPTION may be captured on the Retail S ales Tax Return form (DR 0100) but the sales tax form does not include a separate line for liquor sold at public auction and some sellers may not be required to file a sales tax return, and although there is a Retail Sales Tax Return for Occasional Sales (DR 100A) the data from this form is not captured by GenTax, we were not able to determine if any taxpayers have claimed this exem ption. Therefore, we interviewed Department staff from the Division of Liquor Enforcement, which oversees the sale of liquor in Colorado, and the Division of Taxation, which oversees the State's sales tax system, and learned that the Department has no historic or current record of the exemption being applied to a sale. We also conducted some independent internet research, but were not able to identify any public auctions involving liquor that have occurred where this exemption would apply. Based on this information, it appears that sales that would qualify for the exemption are likely not occurring, or are rare. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? We did not identify any economic costs or benefits to the exemption since it is likely not being used. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? If the exemption was eliminated, there would be little, or no, impact on the beneficiaries. ARE THERE SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES OR THROUGH OTHER PRO GRAMS ? We were unable to i dentify any similar expenditures that apply only to sales of liquor in other states. Ohio, however, has an exemption for occasional sales conducted by an auctioneer. In addition, we di d not identify any similar tax expenditures or 1587 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT programs in the state involving public auctions of liquor . Senate Bill 18 - 067, which went into effect on March 1, 2018, authorized the private auction sale of liquor by charities for fundraising purposes. However, the auctions authorized by the bill are different from those covered by the Occasional Sales of Liquor by Public Auction Exemption because they are private, as opposed to public. Additionally, Senate Bill 18- 067 does not contain a n excise tax exemption, though occasional s ales by charities are exempt from sales tax by Section 39- 26-718(1)(b), C.R.S. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE ? The Department of R evenue does not have a form or other standard mechanism to allow for taxpayers to report the Occasional Sales of Liquor by Public Auction Exemption. Although statute requires taxpayers to report \"records of all transactions\" to which they applied the exemption, it does not specifically require the Department to create a reporting proc ess. If the Department of Revenue created a reporting mechanism, such as a form, to facilitate the required reporting of sales subject to the exemption, some taxpayers may be more likely to report them if any are occurring, which would allow us to more rel iably evaluate how frequently they occur, if at all. However, this may not be a cost -effective use of state resources since the Department of Revenue does not know of any sales that qualify for this exemption and creating a form would require additional st aff time and resources (see the Tax Expenditures Overview section of this Compilation Report for details on the limitations of the Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the se limitation s). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENTIFY? The General Asse mbly could consider repealing this exemption since it does not appear that taxpayers are using it. However, if applicable sales occur in the future, the exemption may ease the administrative burden on buyers and sellers as intended. 159160FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORCROP HAIL INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY SEPTEMBER 2018 2018-TE2 THIS EVALUATION IS INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2018 YEAR ENACTED 1961 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT None NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS None AVERAGE T AXPAYER BENEFIT None IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? No, because it is not being used WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? Insurance companies selling policies in Colorado must pay a premium tax on the amount they collect for insuring in- state property or risks, including crops. Under the Crop Hail Insurance Premium Tax Exemption (Crop Hail Exemption), a portion of the prem iums received on crop hail insurance sold by small -scale, member - owned insurers known as \"mutual protective associations\" is exempt from the premium tax. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for this exemption. Based on statutory language, we inferred that its purpose is to improve the ability of farmers to obtain insurance on damage to their crops from hailstorms through mutual protective associations, which would be able to lower farmers' insurance p remiums due to the tax savings. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? The exemption is not meeting its purpose since no companies are currently eligible to claim it. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The General Assembly may wish to consider either repealing the exemption, since it is not currently being used, or expanding the eligibility requirements for the exemption to increase the companies that may be eligible for it. 161 1623TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT CROP HAIL INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? In 1883, Colorado began l evying a tax on insurance companies' in- state premium revenue, which is the revenue they collect from customers for writing insurance policies covering property or risks in the state. In 1961, Colorado created the Crop Hail Insurance Premium Tax Exemption (Crop Hail Exemption), which exempts certain insurers from paying the premium tax on a portion of the premiums they collect. Specifically, according to Section 10-3- 209(1)(d), C.R.S., to be eligible to claim the exemption, an insurer must meet each of the following conditions: A Be a \"mutual protect ive association,\" which is a small -scale mutual insurance company owned entirely by its policyholders and authorized to sell them insurance policies covering in- state property or damages [Sectio n 10-12-101(1), C.R.S.]. B Sell only crop hail insurance and not offer any other type of insurance to policyholders. C Operate on an \"advan ce premium basis,\" meaning that once the insurer sets the premium amount it cannot change during the policy period regardless of actual losses that may occur. In addition, the exem ption only applies to the \"portion of the premium designated to the loss fund.\" The loss fund is the amount insurers must set aside in a given period in order to cover any payments on clai ms [Sections 10- 12-101(3) and (4), C.R.S.]. Premiums collected and used to pay other expenses of the insurer, such as overhead and salaries, would therefore not be eligible for the exemption. 1634 CROP HAIL INSURANCE PREMIUM T AX EXEMPTION WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not ex plicitly identify intended beneficiaries for th is exemption. Based on the language in statute and reports prepared by Legislative Coun cil staff at the time the exemption was passed, the beneficiaries were intended to be eligible mutual protective associations and their policyholders, who were farmers in the state that would benefit from crop hail insurance. According to the Na tional Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the number of mutual protective associations , which are more commonly known as \"farm mutual s,\" peaked in 1925 at near ly 2,000 nationwide. As in much of the insurance industry, the following decades saw a large degree of consolidation among mutual insurers, leading to the creation of large companies which offer numerous different insurance products, including crop hail insurance. In Colorado, crop hail insurance is often important to farmers because a hailstorm can be disastrous for a farmer's crops and Eastern Colorado lies within a region with frequent hail, known a s \"Hail Alley\" (see E XHIBIT 1.1). EXHIBIT 1.1. TOTAL HAIL REPORTS, 1955 -2002 SOURCE: 2004 National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration report . REPORTS PER DECADE PER 10,000 NAUTICAL MILES 10 50 100 150 200 300 400 500 600 1645 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute does not e xplicitly state a purpose for this exemption . We inferred, based on the language of the statute, and the environment surrounding the passage of the exemption , that its purpose was to improve the ability of farmers to obtain insurance on damage to their crops from hailstorms through mutual protective associations, which would be able to lower farmers' insurance premiums due to the tax savings. Specifically, according to a Legislative Council report prepared in 1960, at the time the exemption passed, high private hail insurance rates had historically been a concern in the state and the State's Crop Hail Insurance Program run by the Department of Agriculture was found to not be sufficiently addressing this issue because of low participation among farmers, and a competitive disadvantage with private insurers . IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We determined that the Crop Hail Exemption is not meeting its purpose because no insurers are currently eligible to claim it. Statute does not contain a quantifiable performance measure for the Crop Hail Exemption. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemption is meeting its infer red purpose: PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent does the Crop Hail Exemption increase the availability of crop hail insurance to farmers in the state? RESULT : The Crop Hail Exemption does not increase the availability of crop hail insurance in the state because no taxpayers are currently eligible to use it. Specifically, despite the continuing sale of crop hail insurance in the state, no insurers licensed in Colorado are mutual protective associations that only issue crop hail insurance, as required by the Crop Hail Exemption. Since 1979, there have not been any active 1656 CROP HAIL INSURANCE PREMIUM T AX EXEMPTION mutual protective associations in the state. Further more , all of the State's 351 providers of crop hail insurance offer other types of insurance, such as flood, lightning, livestock, and auto insurance. Insurance stakeholders we contacted report ed that there are only a handful of insurers nationwide who solely issue crop hail policies, but none of them are located in Colorado. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Since no taxpayers a re currently eligible to claim the Crop Hail Exemption, there is no revenue impact to the State and no economic costs or benefits associated with the exemption. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Eliminating the C rop Hail Exemption would have no impact on beneficiaries because it is not being used and there are no taxpayers eligible to use it. ARE THER E SIMILAR TAX EXPENDI TURES IN OTHER STATE S OR OTHER TAX EXPENDI TURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? We did not identify a ny other states with a tax expenditure for crop hail insurance and there are no other state tax expenditures or programs in Colorado related to stand- alone crop hail insurance issued by a mutual insurance company. Most crop land in Color ado is now covered by federal crop insurance, which may address the lack of affordable crop hail insurance that led the General Assembly to create the exemption. Federal crop insurance, which grew in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, is a partnership between the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency and private insurance companies to offer federally subsidized, 1667 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT regulated, and guaranteed policies that insure against risks to crops, such as from fire, drought, and disease. These policies often provide limited high deductible hail insurance, though we lacked data to specifically quantify the percentage that include hail insurance. According to the National Crop Insurance Services, in 2017 Colorado farmers paid $181 million in federal crop insurance and $14 million in standalone crop hail premium. Colorado does not assess a premium tax on federal crop insurance and states are prohibited from doing so. Farmers are not required to purchase federal crop insurance, but most elect to do so. E XHIBIT 1.2 shows that the percentage of cropland in Colorado covered by federal crop insurance has increased since 200 6, with 6 7 percent of crop land covered in 2017. EXHIBIT 1.2.

The General Assem bly could consider either repealing the Crop Hail Exemption or expanding the eligibility requirements for the exemption. Since there are currently no taxpayers who qualify for the exemption and the original purpose of the exemption may be fulfilled by other insurance products, the General Assembly may wish to consider repealing the Crop Hail Exemption. Alterna tively, if the General Assembly would like to make the exemption available to more taxpayers to help reduce the cost of crop hail insurance in the state, it could change the eligibility requirements to include a broader range of beneficiaries, so that the exemption could be used to lower the overall cost of crop hail insurance. Despite the availability of crop hail insurance, Colorado farmers continue to pay significantly higher premium rates than farmers in most other states due to the higher risk of hail damage in Colorado compared to other states, which may reduce the number of insured farmers. 1681 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITOR IN-STATE INVESTMENT PRE-1959 INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX DEDUCTIO N SEPTEMBER 2019 EVALUATION SUMMARY 2019 -TE28 THIS EVALUATION IS INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2019 YEAR ENACTED 1959 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT None NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS None AVERAGE T AXPAYER BENEFIT None IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? No, because it is likely not being used. WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? The In -State Investment Pre -1959 Insurance Premium Tax Deduction (Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction) allows insurers that are domiciled and maintain their principal place of business in Colorado, and invest at least 30 percent of their assets in -state to deduct pre-1959 policy premiums from their premium tax liability. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for the deduction. We inferred that it was created to maintain tax certainty for certain life insurers pre viously exempt from premium tax, as well as to incentivize them to make in -state investments. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? We determined that the deduction is not providing tax certainty or encouraging in- state investments because it is unlikely that any insurers are using it. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The General Assembly could consider repealing the Pre-1959 Insurance Deduction since it is unlikely that there are insurers that still benefit from it. 1692 IN-STATE INVESTMENT PRE-1959 INSURANCE P REMIUM TAX DEDUCTION IN-STATE INVESTMENT PRE-1959 INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX DEDUCTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Colorado levies a 2 percent premium tax on insurance companies' in - state premiums, which is the revenue insurers collect for writing insurance policies covering property or risks in the state. The In- State Investment Pre- 1959 Insurance Premium Tax Deduction (Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction) [Section 10-3- 209(1)(d)(III), C.R.S.] allows insurers to deduct the value of the premiums they collect from policies established prior to Calendar Year 1959, if the following four conditions are met: 1 They are domiciled in C olorado for regulatory and tax purposes ; 2 They maintain their \"principal place of business\" in Colorado; 3 They invest 30 percent or more of their assets in state/county/municipal /special district bonds, property and mortgages in Colorado, or deposits/stocks/bonds with Colorado organizations, or organizations that invest 50 percent or more of their assets in Colorado (investments in United States government bonds, bonds from any instrumentality of the United States, and deferred or uncollected insurance premiums and annuity considerations are first deducted before the calculation is made); and 4 The premiums are fixed and \"contractually binding upon the company,\" and therefore , not subject to chang e after the policy was originally written. Although the Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction has been amended several 1703 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT times since its creation, it was established in 1959 to substantially maintain the tax treatment of insurance policies that had alre ady been written. From 1959 through 1969, the General Assembly made substantial changes to the tax treatment of in- state insurers for policies written during Calendar Year s 1959 and later. Specifically, since 1913, the State had exempted insurers from premium tax if they invested 50 percent or more of their assets in Colorado property or the bonds of Colorado public sector entities. Beginning in 1959 , the General Assembly made substantial changes to this provision for policies written during 1959 and later, including increasing the tax rate and changing eligibility requirements . To claim the Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction, insurers deduct the amount that they are claiming before they report their gross taxable premiums when they file for their Colorado premium tax with the Division of Insurance , within the Department of Regulatory Agencies . WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly identify the intended beneficiaries of the deduction. Based on statute and interviews with stakeholders, we inferred that the direct beneficiaries of this deduction are life insurers based in Colorado with significant business operations and investments in the s tate. We determined that the primary beneficiaries would be life insurance companies because t he deduction only applies to premiums that are \"fixed and...contractually binding\" [Section 10-3-209(1)(d)(III ), C.R.S.]. O ur research and interviews with insurance industry stakeholders indicate that only life insurance policie s and occasionally annuities \u2014both of which are pro ducts issued by life insurers\u2014typically have fixed , unchanging premiu m amounts written into a long -term insurance contract . Since insurance premium tax expenditures result in a tax savings for insurers, part or all of which is often passed on to policyholders, we inferred that the indirect beneficiaries of the deduction were intended to 1714 IN-STATE INVESTMENT PRE-1959 INSURANCE P REMIUM TAX DEDUCTION be Colorado individuals, businesses, and other entities who purchase policies from eligible insurers. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE ? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for the Pre-1959 Insurance Deduction. Based on statute and legislative history, we inferred that one purpose of the deduction is to main tain tax certainty for certain life insurers. According to the Tax Policy Handbook for State Legislators, 3rd Edition published by the National Conference of State Legislatures \"[c]ertainty means that the number and type of tax changes are kept at a minimum to allow businesses and individuals to plan for the future.\" The same 1959 bill that created the deduction also made certain insurers that were previously exempt from Colorado premium tax, liable for the tax for the first time. Thus, the deduction allowed eligible insurance companies to maintain any life insurance or annuity products in place at the time without reducing their expected profit from them or raising rates for future policyholders, since insurers may not be able to increase the premiums on previously -written life insurance policies an d certain annuity contracts . Additionally, since the Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction applies only to insurers that invest a significant portion of their assets in Colorado, we also inferred that its purpose was to encourage insurers to invest in Colorado-bas ed assets . IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We found that the Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction is no longer meeting its purpose s because few insurers are eligible for it and those who we identified as potentially eligible are already e xempt from insurance premium tax based on other tax expenditure provisions . Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for the deduction. Therefore, we created and applied the following 1725 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT performance measures to determine the extent to which the deduction is meeting its inferred purpose s: PERFORMANCE MEASURE #1: To what extent does the Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction create tax certainty for life insurers and their policyholders? RESULT : The deduction is no longer providing tax certainty for life insurers and their policyholders because there are few potentially eligible insurers, and those insurers are already exempt from insurance premium tax based on other tax expenditure provisions . Althou gh the Division of Insurance did not have data available to confirm t hat no insurance companies have claim ed the deduction, its data show that of the 468 insurers licensed in Calendar Year 2018 to issue life insurance policies and/or annuity contracts in C olorado, only nine met the requirement of being domiciled in Colorado. Of those nine , the American Council of Life Insurers, the main trade body for U .S. life insurers, identified six that might still have active policies that were issued prior to 1959. We examined financial statements for four of these six insurers that are commercial insurance companies . Although we were not able to trace all of their listed investments to individual states of origin, we found that it is unlikely th at they meet the requir ement of invest ing at least 30 percent of their assets in Colorado- based investments (even after deducting \"bonds, notes or other obligations of the United States...or any instrumentality of the United States ,\" per Section 10-3- 209[1][f], C.R.S .). This is consistent with our interviews with stakeholders , which indicated that most insurers' investment portfolio s are now highly diversified and unlikely to concentrate such a high percentage of assets in one state . For the other two Colorado- based insurers , whic h are non- profit fraternal benefit societies, we determined that they may technically qualify for th e deduction because, according to their staff, they do invest at least 30 percent of their assets in Colorado- based investments. In addition, one of the sta ff members estimated that their pre -1959 life insurance policies represent 2 percent of the premiums they collect each year. Therefore, these two insurers may have a small amount of 1736 IN-STATE INVESTMENT PRE-1959 INSURANCE P REMIUM TAX DEDUCTION premiums that are eligible for the deduction. However, as fraternal benefit societies, th ese two insurers are a lready exempt from all insurance premium tax in Colorado due to the Fraternal Society Exemption [Section 10 -3-209(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.]. Moreover, insurance stakeholders we interviewed indicated that a minimal amount of premiums are still being paid on pre-1959 life insurance policies and annuity contracts because such policies would be at least 60 years old in 2019, and it is uncommon for policyholders to continue paying premiums on a policy for that amount of time. For example, if a whole life insurance policy was purchased for an infant in 1958, then the policyholder would have been paying premiums for 61 years and the infant would be at or near retirement age, which, according to stakeholders, is when m any policyholders stop paying their premiums and start receiving payouts. In addition, such policies are less valuable to policyholders because they tend to have low er payout values, since their value does not increase with inflation. However, w e found th at the Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction likely did create a degree of tax certainty for certain life insurers and their policyholders in the past . In the same 1959 bill that created this deduction, these insurers were subject to a 1 percent premium tax for the first time. Without the deduction, t he new tax would have threatened qualifying in -state insurers' expected profits on their life insurance policies and some annuity contracts already in effect . Unlike most other types of insurance policies whose premium rates frequently change and allow insurers to pass on tax increases to policyholders, these policies typically keep the premium amounts fixed once effective and may not allow insurers to pass tax increases on to policy holders . Although we did not have data necessary to quantify the deduction's impact when it was created, it is likely that its impact has gradually diminished since 1959, as the policies it applied to either were paid -out or cancelled. P ERFORMANCE MEASURE #2: To what extent is the Pre-1959 I nsurance Deduction incentivizing insurers to invest in Colorado? 1747 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT RESULT : We found that the deduction is not currently incentivizing investment in Colorado because, as discussed above, we only identified two insurers that potentially meet the deduction's eligibility criteria, and these insurers are already exempt from insurance premium tax under the Fraternal Society Exemption. Further, even if these two insurers were not otherwise exempt from premium taxes, it is unlikely that the Pre-1959 Insurance Deducti on would be necessary to incentivize them to invest in Colorado assets, since they are already doing so without an added incentive . Additionally , because o nly a small percentage of premium collections are fro m policies issued prior to 1959, the value of the deduction would likely be too small to provide a meaningful incentive. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Since the only two insurers that we identified that may be potentially eligible to claim the Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction are already exempt from premium tax through the Fraternal Society Exemption, we estimate that there is no revenue impact to the State and no economic costs or benefits associated with the deduction. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Eliminating the Pre-1959 Insurance Deduction would have little or no impact on beneficiaries because it is likely not being used, and the only two insurers we identified that may be potentially eligible to use it are already exempt from premium tax through the Fraternal Society Exemption. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES ? Of the 48 states (excluding Colorado) and the District of Columbia that levy an insurance premium tax on most types of insurance , the following eight states have insurance premium tax expenditure s similar to the Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction that benefit insurers whose in - state investments reach a certain asset threshold : Alabama, Georgia , Iowa , Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee , and West Virginia . 1758 IN-STATE INVESTMENT PRE-1959 INSURANCE P REMIUM TAX DEDUCTION However, none of these states limit their expenditures to policies that were effective before a certain year, and none are specifically geared towards life insurers, as is the case for the Pre- 1959 Insurance Deduction. ARE THERE TAX EXPEND ITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE IN THE STATE ? The Regional Home Office Rate Reduction [ Section 10-3- 209(1)(b) (I)(B) , C.R.S.] has a similar purpose as the Pre -1959 Insurance Deduction in that it was established to incentivize i nsurers to locate their business and invest in Colorado. The Regional Home Office Rate Reduction allows insurers to reduce their premium tax liability by 50 percent if they maintain a \"home office\" or \"regional home office\" in Colorado. Insurers meet this threshold if they \"substantially perform ,\" within Colorado, actuarial, medical, legal, and other essential functions that cover their Colorado business and often business in sur rounding states . They can also meet this threshold if they maintain \"significant direct insurance operations\" in Colorado that are supported by \"functional operations which are both necessary for and pertinent to\" their in -state business. According to Division of Insurance data , 85 insurers claimed the Regional Home Office Rate Reduction for a total of $89.7 million in reduced premiums in Tax Year 2018 . We will discuss the Regional Home Office Rate Reduction in a separate evaluation. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE ? We were unable to confirm that no taxpayers currently claim the deduction since it is not captured on Division of Insurance tax filing forms . Specifically, if any insurers claimed it , they would have subtracted the deduction amount prior to reporting their premium collections and therefore, the Division of Insurance would have no record of it being claimed . If the Division of Insurance add ed a reporting line to its tax filing forms where insurers could indicate how much they are claiming under the deduction, our analysis could conf irm that the deduction is no longer being used. However, adding an additional 1769 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT question to the premium tax filing forms would result in an additional burden on insurers and the Division of Insurance , which would be impractical given that other information sources indicate that it is likely no longer being used. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY COULD CONSIDER REPEALING THE PRE-1959 INSURANCE DEDUCTION SINCE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT INSURERS ARE ST ILL USING IT AND IT IS NO LONGER MEETING ITS PURPOSE . As discussed, we only identified two insurers that could potentially meet the deduction's eligibility requirements and both are already exempt from insurance premium tax under the Fraternal Society Exemption. Further, few insurers still have policies from prior to 1959 and the minimal number of polices that meet this requirement is likely to continue to decrease. Therefore, the deduction is no longer serving its purposes of creating tax certainty and encouraging in -state investments by insurance companies. 177 1781 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITOR UNAUTHORIZED INSURAN CE PREMIUM TAX EXPENDIT URES JANUARY 2020 EVALUATION SUMMARY 2020 -TE1 THIS EVALUATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMP ILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2020 FEDERAL PREMIUM , EXCISE , AND STAMP TAX DEDUCTION INDEPENDENTLY - PROCURED INSURANCE EXEMPTION EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION LIFE INSURANCE EXEMPTION YEAR ENACTED 1967 1967 1967 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None None None REVENUE IMPACT Could not determine Could not determine $0 NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine Could not determine 0 AVERAGE TAXPAYER BENEFIT Could not determine Could not determine None IS IT MEETING ITS PUR POSE? Could not determine Could not determine No, because it is not being used WHAT DO THESE TAX EXPENDITURES DO? These tax expenditures relate to unauthorized insurance, which is insurance sold by insurers not legally authorized to sell insurance in the state, but for which a limited number of policies are lawfully sold. FEDERAL PREMIUM , EXCISE , AND STAMP TAX DEDUCTION [Section 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.] allows a deduction for the amount of premiums on which certain other federal or non- federal taxes were paid if such taxes were 2.25 percent or more. INDEPENDENTLY -PROCURED INSURANCE EXEMPTION [Section 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.] exempts premiums from unauthorized insurance premium tax if the taxpayer already paid regular or surplus lines premium tax on the unauthorized insurance premiums. EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION LIFE INSURANCE EXEMPTIO N [Section 10-3- 910(3), C.R.S.] exempts premiums paid to non- profit life insurers organized and operated exclusively to assist non -profit educational or scientific institutions (or their employees) from unauthorized insurance premium tax. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? We did not find evidence that any of these tax expenditures are currently meeting their purposes , since they either can only be used under limited circumstances or not at all. 1792 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURES? FEDERAL PREMIUM , EXCISE , [Section 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.] \u2014We inferred that the purpose of this deduction is to exempt industrial insureds from the unauthorized insurance premium tax if they had already paid at least 2.25 percent in taxes on the premiums to at least one government entity (i.e., state, local, federal governments), ther eby demonstrating that they did not purchase unauthorized insurance as a way to avoid paying taxes. INDEPENDENTLY -PROCURED INSURANCE EXEMPTION . [Section 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.] \u2014We inferred that the purpose of this exemption is to avoid double taxing unauthor ized insurance premiums. EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION LIFE INSURANCE EXEMPTION . [Section 10-3- 910(3), C.R.S.] \u2014We inferred that the purpose of this exemption is to prevent insurance purchased by nonprofit, educational and scientific institutions and sold by specialized nonprofit insurers from being treated as unauthorized insurance. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The Gene ral Assembly may want to consider the following: Repealing or modifying the Federal Premium, Excise, and Stamp Tax Deduction because it does not appear to align with other insurance provisions in its treatment of unauthorized insurance. Repealing the Educational and Scientific Life Insurance Deduction because it is not being used and there are currently no eligible insurers. Evaluating whether the unauthorized insurance premium tax rate is accomplishing its purpose, since unauthorized insurance is taxed at a lower rate than other similar forms of insurance. 1803 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT UNAUTHORIZED INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX EXPENDITURES EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT ARE THE SE TAX EXPENDITURE S? This evaluation covers three tax expenditures related to unauthorized insurance. Unauthorized insurance is insurance sold by insurance companies or brokers that are not licensed or otherwise authorized to sell insurance under the State's insurance laws and regulations . Section 10-3- 104, C.R.S., generally prohibits the purchase or sale of unauthorized insurance, stating that \"it is unlawful for any person, company, or corporation in this state to procure, receive, or forward applications for insurance in, or to issue or deliver policies for, any company not legally authorized to do business in this state .\" However, certain types of specialized insurance, typically purchased by businesses, are exempted from this prohibition under the provisions of Title 10, Articles 5 and 15, and part 9 of Article 3, C.R.S. In 1955, the General Assembly pa ssed House Bill 55 -302, the Regulation of Unauthorized Insurance Act (codified at Section 10- 30- 901 et seq., C.R.S.). This legislation created a regulatory framework intended to allow the State, and residents who may have unknowingly purchased unauthorized insurance, to more effectively litigate against insurers issuing fraudulent insurance policies and insurers not operating within the State's insurance regulations. In 1967, House Bill 67- 1491 updated the Regulation of Unauthorized Insurance Act and establ ished the unauthorized insurance premium tax, which was intended to \"[protect] the premium tax revenues of this state\" [Section 10-3- 902, C.R.S.], by levying a 2.25 on unauthorized insurance premiums [Section 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.]. This tax is t o be paid by the policyholder or the broker they use . In addition to unauthorized insurance purchased or sold unlawfully, under Section 10-3-9 10(1), ,\" which are larger companies that ( 1) employ a full time insurance manager, ( 2) have aggregate annual premiums of at least $100,000, and ( 3) employ at least 100 full -time employees, may purchase unauthorized insurance but must also pay the unauthorized insurance premium tax. However, t he insurance they purchase is not otherwise subject to regulation under the Regulation of Unauthorized Insurance Act. Statute provides the following three tax expenditures that reduce taxpayers' unauthorized insurance premium tax liability: 1 FEDERAL PREMIUM , EXCISE , AND STAMP TAX DEDUCTION [SECTION 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.] . Policyholders (or their insurance brokers) can deduct from their taxable unauthorized insurance premiums , the amount of any premiums on which federal premium tax, federal or non-federal excise tax, or federal or non- federal stamp tax was already paid, if such tax was 2.25 percent or more. Stamp taxes are also known as \"examination fees\" and may be charged by some government entities to cover the cost of administering insurance regulations. 2 I NDEPENDENTLY -PROCURED INSURANCE EXEMPTION [SECTI ON 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.] . Policyholders who procure unauthorized insurance directly from an insurer (rather than through a broker) are exempt from unauthorized insurance premium tax if they already paid regular or surplus lines premium tax on the unauthorized insurance premiums. 3 E DUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION LIFE INSURANCE EXEMPTION [SECTION 10-3- 910(3), C.R.S.] . Policyholders (or their insurance brokers) are exempt from unauthorized insurance premium tax on premiums or annuity payments paid to non-profit life insurers organized and operated exclusively to assist non -profit educational or scientific institutions (or their employee s). The 2.25 percent unauthorized insurance premium tax and its related tax expenditures only apply to premiums paid to unauthorized insurers. 1825 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Unauthorized insurers are those that have not been licensed by the Division of Insurance , and that have not met the requirements to be on a list of \"non- admitted\" insurers who are approved by the commissioner of insurance or be included on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) list of eligible foreign insurers (these are also known as \"surplus lines\" insurers, which typically offer specialized , high -risk policies) . Insurance sold by licensed insurers is generally subject to the 2 percent insurance premium tax and surplus lines insurance is subject to a 3 percent surplus lines insurance premium tax. In order to claim any of the unauthorized insurance premium tax expenditures, policyholders or brokers are required t o do the following: F EDERAL PREMIUM , EXCISE , AND STAMP TAX DEDUCTION . The taxpayer decreases their unauthorized insurance premium amount by the amount of any premiums that w ere subject to a federal premium tax, or federal or state excise or stamp tax prior to reporting their premiums to the Division of Insurance on its Unauthorized Insurance Premium Tax Reporting Form . I NDEPENDENTLY -PROCURED INSURANCE EXEMPTION . To qualify for this exemption , the taxpayer must have already paid either the State 's insuran ce premium tax for licensed insurers or the surplus lines insurance premium tax. If the taxpayer has filed and paid one of these taxes, then they are not required to pay the unauthorized insurance premium tax or file the Unauthorized Insurance Premium Tax Reporting Form . E DUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION LIFE INSURANCE EXEMPTION . Non-profit life insurers that wish to qualify for this exemption must pay an annual registration fee of $5,000 and file a cop y of their policies and financial statemen ts with the Division of Insurance . Once they have met these requirements , non-profit life insurers are no longer considered unauthorized insurers and do not have to pay the unauthorized insurance premium tax or file the Unauthorized Insurance Premium Tax Reporting Form . 1836 UNAUTHORIZED INSURAN CE PREMIUM TAX EXPEN DITURES WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Statute does not explicitly identify the intended beneficiaries of the unauthorized i nsurance premium tax e xpenditures. Based on statute, legislative history , and stakeholder input, we inferred that the beneficiaries of the Federal Premium, Excise, and Stamp Tax Deduction and Independently -Procured Insurance Exemption are businesses that can legally purchase unauthorized insurance, such as those that qualify as industrial insureds , who have procured insurance through an unauthorized insurer and who, according to Section 10-3-9 10(1), C.R.S., are liable for paying the unauthorized insurance premium tax. Although the expenditures would also apply to unlawfully purchased insurance, Division of Insurance staff indicated that the unauthorized insurance premiums that are reported , and for which taxes are paid, are likely not for illegal insurance, but are instead, for specialized insurance purchased by large companies , such as those that qualify as industrial insureds and can legally purchase such policies . For the Educational and Scientific Institution Life Insurance Exemption [Section 10-3- 910(3), C.R.S.] , we inferred that the intended beneficiaries include non- profit life insurers organized to assist non- profit, educational or scientific institutions, the institutions themselves, and their employees , who would benefit from the insurance policies . WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITURES? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for any of the unauthorized insurance premium tax e xpenditures. Based on our review of statute, legislative history, and stakeholder input, we inferred the following purposes for each expenditure : FEDERAL PREMIUM , EXCISE , AND STAMP TAX DEDUCTION [Section 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.] . Based on the operation of the statute and discussions with Division of Insurance staff, we inferred that the purpose was to exempt industrial insureds from the unauthorized insurance premium tax if they had already paid at least 2.25 percent in taxes on the 1847 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT premiums to at least one government entity (i.e. , state, local, federal governments) . This appears intended to ensure that unauthorized insurance is subjec t to a tax like other forms of insurance in the state, but to avoid applying the State's unauthorized insurance premium tax to taxpayers who demonstrate that they are not purchasing unauthorized insurance as a way to avoid taxes altogether or to obtain a tax rate lower than the State's. I NDEPENDENTLY -PROCURED INSURANCE EXEMPTION [Section 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.] . We inferred that the purpose of this exemption is to avoid double taxing unauthorized insurance premiums , since to qualify for the exemption, taxpayers must have paid either the State' s insurance premium tax for licensed insurers or surplus lines insurance premium tax. This appears to be a structural provision that helps clarify the application of insurance taxes. EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION LIFE INSURANCE EXEMPTION [Section 10-3- 910(3), C.R.S.] . We inferred that the purpose of this exemption is to prevent insurance purchased by nonprofit , educational and scientific institutions and sold by specialized nonprofit insurers from being tre ated as unauthorized insur ance. Specifically, th e provision exempts this type of insurance from the entire Regulation of Unauthorized Insurance Act [ Section 10-3- 901 et seq. , C.R.S .], which includes provisions related to the State asserting jurisdiction ov er unauthorized insurance , in addition to the unauthorized insurance premium tax. ARE THE TAX EXPENDITURE S MEETING THEIR PURPOSE S AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? We did not find evidence that any of these tax expenditures are meeting their purpose s. Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for these tax expenditures. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the expenditures are meetin g their purpose s. 1858 UNAUTHORIZED INSURAN CE PREMIUM TAX EXPEN DITURES PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent are the U NAUTHORIZED INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX EXPENDITURES being used by taxpayers ? RESULT S: FEDERAL PREMIUM , EXCISE , AND STAMP TAX DEDUCTION [Section 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.] . This deduction is likely only being used under limited circumstances. We found that the onl y tax other than the State's unauthorized insurance premium tax that could potentially apply to unauthorized insurance premiums, thereby qualifying the premiums for the deduction, is the federal foreign insure r excise tax under 26 USC 4731. This provision levies a 4 percent tax on casualty insurance premiums of foreign insurers that are not already exempted from the federal excise tax, either through treaties between the U.S. and the insurer's cou ntry of domicile or through a n agreement between the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the individual foreign insurer. It is possible that the federal excise tax could apply to unauthorized insurance premiums sold in Colorado since unauthorized insurance i s typically procured through a foreign insurer. However, w e could not determine if any unauthorized insurance policyholders are claiming the deduction because the Division of Insurance does not collect the data from taxpayers on its use. I NDEPENDENTLY -PROCURED INSURANCE EXEMPTION [Section 10-3- 909(1), C.R.S.] . We could not determine whether this tax expenditure i s meeting its purpose because the Division of Insurance does not collect data on its use and we lacked information necessary to determine whether it is being used by taxpayers . This exemption is difficult to evaluate because taxpayers who would qualify for it, that is, those taxpayers who procured unauthorized insurance without the use of a broker and filed and paid the insurance premium taxes that are intended to apply to licensed insurers or surplus lines insurers, may have been unaware that they were purchasing unauthorized insurance. According to the Division of Insurance, taxpayers are responsible for determining whether the insurance they are p urchasing is from a licensed insurer or surplus lines insurer authorized to sell insurance in the state. Though it appears that the circumstances to which it would apply would occur infrequently , this structural expenditure may serve its purpose by 1869 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT clarify ing the tax treatment of unauthorized premiums for which regular or surplus lines insurance premium taxes have been paid. EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION LIFE INSURANCE EXEMPTION [Section 10-3- 910(3), C.R.S.] . We found that this tax expenditure is not currently meeting its purpose because it is not being used. The Division of Insurance reported that since at least 2008, no insurers have complied with the statutory regulations required to provide this specific type of life insurance coverage in the s tate. In addition, we spoke with the Colorado Nonp rofit Association and confirmed that they do not currently have an insurance subsidiary that could provide this type of coverage for its constituents and currentl y has no plans to create one. Despite the exemption's current lack of applicability, it was likely intended to serve a function beyond providing a tax exemption since it clarifies the types of insurance that are subject to regulation as unauthorized insurance. Therefore, it may serve t his purpose in the future , but only if qualifying non- profit insurers are established in the state. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? We were not able to estimate the revenue impact of the Federal Premium, Excise , and Stamp Tax Deduction or the Independently - Procured Insurance Exemption because the Division of Insurance does not receive information from taxpayers on their usage . However, i f the tax expenditures are resulting in a revenue impact, it is likely minimal because u nauthorized insurance is used infrequently . Specifically, Division of Insurance data show that, from July 2015 to March 2019, taxpayers reported procuring 58 policies through unauthorized insurers worth about $3.3 million in written premium s. For these pol icies, the Division of Insurance collected just over $79 ,000 in unauthorized insurance premium tax payments. In addition, we were able to confirm that there has been no revenue impact due to the Educational and Scientific Institution Life Insurance 18710 UNAUTHORIZED INSURAN CE PREMIUM TAX EXPEN DITURES Exemption since there are no insurers operating in the state that can provide life insurance policies complying with the requirements of the exemption. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE S HAVE ON BENEFICIARI ES? Eliminating these tax expenditures would have a limited impact on beneficiaries because they are all either no t used or likely only used minimally , and under limited circumstances. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES ? FEDERAL PREMIUM , EXCISE , AND STAMP TAX DEDUCT ION. Of the 49 states (excluding Colorado) and the District of Columbia that levy an insurance premium tax, we identified no other states that provide an expenditure similar to the Federal Premium, Excise, and Stamp Tax Deduction for unauthorized insurance. I NDEPENDENTLY -PROCURED INSURANCE EXEMPTION . Our review found that six other states include an exemption similar to the Independently - Procured Insurance Exemption that limit s taxpayers ' liability for unauthorized insurance tax if they have paid other insurance taxes . EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION LIFE INSURANCE EXEMPTION . We identified 11 states that exempt nonprofit life insurers organized and operated exclusively to assist nonprofit educational or scientific instituti ons from unauthorized insurance regulations in the state, but do not exempt premium s or annuity payments from taxation and require these insurers to pay a separate tax . Only one state ( Alabama ) has a provision exempting insurance purchased by non- profit ed ucational and scientific institutions from premium tax altogether . ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE ? We did not identify any other tax expenditures or other programs with a similar purpose in the state . 18811 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE S? The Division of Insurance does not collect information on the Federal Premium, Excise , and Stamp Tax Deduction or the Independently - Procured Insurance Exemption from taxpayers in their premium tax filings. Specifically, taxpayers subtract the value of both tax expenditures prior to filing their premium taxes with the Division of Insurance. In cases where these provisions completely offset any premiums subject to the unauthorized insurance tax, the taxpayer would not file an unauthorized insurance premium tax reporting form with the Division of Insurance . To collect this information, the Division of Insurance would need to add fields to its unauthorized insurance premium tax reporting form to collect this data from policyholders. However, this may result in a higher administrative burden for taxpayers and the Division of Insurance would incur additional costs to make this administrative change. Further more , for the Independently - Procured Insurance Exemption, taxpayers who qualify may not be aware that they purchased unauthorized insurance and that the provision limits their tax liability; therefore, additional reporting requirements may not provide adequate data to evaluate its use. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER REPEALING OR MODIFYING THE FEDERAL PREMIUM , EXCISE , AND STAMP TAX DEDUCTION . As dis cussed, we could not determine whether this deduction is meeting its purpose, though it likely only appl ies to limited circumstances where unauthorized insurance is purchased from a foreign insurer who is subject to a federal excise tax over 2.25 percent. In addition, this deduction appears to be inconsistent with the tax treatment of other forms of insurance. Specifically, taxpayers who purchase surplus lines insurance, which is a more commonly used form of specialized insurance typically purchased by businesses, cannot deduct the value of premiums that were subject to taxes by other government entities. Instead, taxpayers who purchase surplus lines 18912 UNAUTHORIZED INSURAN CE PREMIUM TAX EXPEN DITURES insurance that is subject to taxes other than the State's premium tax can only deduct the amount of the other taxes (not the entire premiums subject to the other taxes) as provided in Section 10-5- 111, C.R.S. T HE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER REPEALING T HE EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTION LIFE INSURANCE EXEMPTION . As discussed, this exemption i s not currentl y accomplishing its purpose as a tax expenditure because it hasn't been used since at least 2008, and there are currently no non- profit insurers that meet the requirements to claim it. However, despite the exemption's current lack of applicability, it was likely intended to serve a function beyond providing a tax exemption since it clarifies the types of insurance that are subject to regulation as unauthorized insurance. Therefore, the General Assembly may wish to leave it in place to define the types of insurance that are treated as unauthorized insurance in the event that there are eligible insurers in the state in the future. T HE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE UNAUTHORIZED INSURAN CE PREMIUM TAX RATE IS ACCOMPLISHING ITS PURPOSE . In 1967, the year that the 2.25 percent unauthorized insurance premium tax was established, the surplus lines premium tax rate was 2 percent, which could indicate that the General Assembly originally want ed to tax unauthorized insurance at a higher rate than other forms of insurance. However, in 1992 , the General Assembly increased the surplus lines premium tax rate to 3 percent, but made no changes to the unauthorized insurance premium tax rate. Division of Insurance staff indicated that in recent years the taxpayers who have paid unauthorized insurance premium taxes typically have purchased insurance from unauthorized insurance companies domiciled outside the U . S. that operate similarly to surplus lines insurers, but that have not met the requirements to legally sell surplus lines insurance in Colorado. Therefore, it is unclear whether the lower rate for unauthorized insurance is consistent with the General Assembly's intent. To address this uneven treatm ent, the General Assembly could consider increasing the unauthorized insurance tax rate. The District of 19013 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Columbia and 44 other states tax unauthorized and surplus lines insurance at the same rate. 191 192TAX TYPE Sales and use YEAR ENACTED 1979 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE NoneREVENUE IMPACT Could not determine NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS 965 WHAT DOES THIS TAX E XPENDITURE DO? The Construction and Building Materials Sales and Use Tax Exemption [Section 39- 26-708, C.R.S.] (Construction Materials Exemption) exempts contractors and subcontractors from sales and use tax on building and construction materials that are purchased and incorporated into a structure, highway, road, street, or other public work project that is owned and used by certain tax- exempt entities, such as federal, state, and local governments; not -for-profit schools; and charitable organizations. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute and the enacting legislation do not state the exemption's purpose; therefore , we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the exemption and conversations with stakeholders, our evaluation considered a potential purpose: to avoid applying sales and use taxes to contractors' purchases of construction and building materials when completing projects for tax-exempt entities. Since contractors would likely pass the cost of these taxes on, the exemption avoids indirectly taxing tax -exempt entities when they hire contractors to complete construction projects. WHAT POLICY CONSIDER ATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider: Establishing a statutory purpose and performancemeasures for the exemption. Clarifying eligibility requirements for the exemption. CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY | JANUARY 2021 | 2021 -TE4 KEY CONCLUSION: The exemption is generally effective at avoiding applying the sales and use tax to contractors' purchases of construction and building materials when completing projects for tax- exempt organizations. However, we found that the eligibility requirements are not clear for some projects . 1932 CONSTRUCTION AND BUI LDING MATERIALS EXEM PTION CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The Construction and B u ilding Materials Exemption [Section 39- 26- 708, C.R.S.] (Construction Materials Exemption) exempts contractors and subcontractors from sales and use tax on building and construction materials that they purchase and incorporate into a structure, highway, road, street, or public work project that is owned and us ed by certain tax-exempt entit ies. The tax -exempt entities included in this exemption are the United States government, the State of Colorado and it s departments and institutions , and local governments , along with charitable organizations and nonprofit schools. The exemption was created by House Bill 79- 1451 in 1979, and it has remained substantively unchanged since then. To apply for the exempt ion, the contractor must submit the Contractor Application for Exemption Certificate ( Form DR 0172) to the Department of Revenue with both the contractor's business information and the tax-exempt entity's sales tax exemption information. The contractor must also submit a copy of the contract agreement with the tax-exempt entity and a bid amount for the qualifying project. A contractor must apply for a separate certificate for each project it complete s for a tax- exempt organization. Once the Department of Revenue approves the application, it issues an exemption certificate, which the contractor must present to the retailer at the time of sale in order to receive the exemption. Retailers report sales for which the y apply the exemption on Line 4 of Schedule A of the Colorado Retail Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100). 1943 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF TH E TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not directly state the intended beneficiaries of the Construction Materials Exemption. Because contractors typically include the sales and use taxes they pay on building and construction materials in the price they charge custome rs, we considered the intended beneficiaries of the exemption to be tax- exempt entities , such as the United States government, the State of Colorado and its departments and institutions, local governments, charitable organizations, and nonprofit schools , since the exemption prevents them from indirectly paying sales tax on materials incorporated into their projects . To the extent that tax- exempt entities increase the size or number of eligible projects they purchase due to the cost -savings from the exemption, contractors also likely benefit. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute and the enacting legislation for the Construction Materials Exemption do not state its purpose ; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the exemption and conversations with stakeholders , we consider ed a potential purpose: to avoid applying sales and use taxes to contractors' purchases of construction and building materials when completing projects for tax -exempt entities. Since contractors would likely pass the cost of these taxes on, the exemption avoids indirectly taxing tax -exempt entitie s. This exemption aligns with other statutory provisions that exempt entities , such as the U.S. government , the State of Colorado, local governments, charitable organizations and nonprofit schools , from sales and use tax on tangible personal property they purchase directly , and is a common provision in s tates with sales and use taxes. 1954 CONSTRUCTION AND BUI LDING MATERIALS EXEM PTION IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We could not definiti vely determine whether the Construction Materials Exemption is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided for it in statute or its enacting legislation. However, we found that it is meeting the potential purpose we considered in order to conduct this evaluation because contractors and tax -exempt organizations are aware of the exempt ion, and contractors use the exemption when they complete projects for tax- exempt organizations . Statute does not prov ide quantifiable performance measures for this exemption. Therefore, we created and applied th e following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemption is meeting its potential purpose: PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent are contractors aware of the exemption and us ing it when eligible? RESULT : Based on Department of Revenue data and conversations with contractors, we determined that contractors generally know about the exemption and use it when eligible . As shown in EXHIBIT 1, between Calendar Year s 2016 and 2019, the Department of Revenue approved 19,764 applications for the Construction and Building Materials Exemption, indicating that contractors frequently use it. However, we were unable to locate data that would have indicated how many tax-exempt projects contractors undertook in each year in order to determine what percentage of eligible projects received the exemption. 1965 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Additionally, w e spoke with 11 contractors and most were aware of the exemption. Further, staff at both the Colorado Department of Transportation and Colorado Parks and Wildlife stated that the tax exemption is widely used by contractors employed in s tate construction projects. Specifically , during Fiscal Year 2020, the Colorado Department of Transportation hired 66 contractors and Colorado Parks and Wildlife hired 303 contractors , and both agencies stated that all of their contractors appl ied for the exemption while working on their projects. We also spoke with 11 Colorado charitable organizations and schools, and most were aware of the exemption and have their contractors apply for the exemption. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The Construction Mat erials Exemption likely has a significant state revenue impact because contractors use it frequently and apply it to large- scale public works projects. However, we lacked data necessary to determine the revenue impact of the exemption. R etailers report sales that qualify for the exemption on the Colorado Retail Sales Tax Return using a reporting line that aggregates several other sales tax exemptions and cannot be disaggregated for analysis ; therefore, t he Department of Revenue was not able to provide us with data showing the amount EXHIBIT 1. EXEMPTION APPLICATI ONS APPROVED BY DEPARTMENT OF REV ENUE , CALENDAR YEAR S 2016 THROUGH 2019 Year Approved Applications 2016 4,797 2017 4,785 2018 5,028 2019 5,154 Total 19,764 SOURCE : Office of the State Auditor analysis of Department of Revenue exemption application records. 1976 CONSTRUCTION AND BUI LDING MATERIALS EXEM PTION taxpayers claimed for the exemption. Additionally, we were not able to locate a nother source of reliable data to estimate a revenue impact. Additionally, statu te [Section 29 -2-105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.] mandates that statutory municipalities and counties apply most of the State's sales tax exemptions, including the Construction Materials Exemption. Therefore, these local governments may experience an impact to their revenues to the extent that sales eligible for the exemption occur within their jurisdictions. However, we also lacked data necessary to estimate the eligible sales and total amount exempted in these jurisdictions. Home -rule cities established under Article XX of the Colorado Constitution that collect their own sales taxes have the authority to set their own tax policies independent from the State and are not required to exempt purchases of construction materials by contractors from their local sales tax. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Eliminating the expendi ture could have significant financial impacts on tax-exempt organizations that currently benefit from it , such as federal, state, and local government agencies; school s; and charitable organizations . Contractors told us that they would pass on sales and use tax es to the exempt organizations if the exemption was eliminated, which would result in a 2.9 percent increase in the amount tax- exempt organizations pay for materials on construction projects. In addition, because the exemption also applies to statutory and home rule municipalities and counties that have their sales taxes collected by the State under Section 29-2- 105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S., if it were eliminated , materials purchased in those jurisdictions would also be subject to local sales taxes ranging from 0.25 to 7.5 percent , which would further increase project costs for tax exempt entities. A ll not -for-profit schools and charitable organizations that we spoke with stated that they have small operating margins and those that were aware of the exemption stated that without the sales tax exemption being extended to the contractors or sub -contractors they hire, they would have to decide 1987 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT between smaller construction projects or cutting other services they provide . Addit ionally, eliminating the exemption for state projects would create administrative inefficienc ies because the State would have to indirectly pay the sales tax on its own projects. Although the State would eventually get most of these sales taxes back when r etailers remit the sales tax collected on the materials , retailers would be allowed to keep 4 percent - up to $1,000 per filing period - of the sales tax collected because of the Vendor Allowance provided under Section 39 - 26-105(1)( d)(I), C.R.S . ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? We examined the t ax laws of the 44 other states (excluding Colorado) with a sales tax and identified 25 that have a similar exemption for materials purchased by contractors hired to do projects for certain tax - exempt organizations . However, not all organizations that are exempt under Colorado statute are also exempted in all states. Of the 2 5 states with a similar exemption, 19 allow the exemption for f ederal government projects , 19 for state and local government projects , 22 for public not -for-profit school projects, 19 for private not -for-profit school projects , and 16 for charitable organization projects . For example , New York does not extend the exemption to all types of nonprofit schools and Louisiana does not extend the exemption to all types of nonprofit organizations. Other states, like Alabama, do not extend the exemption to governmental road projects like Colorado does. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIM ILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? As discussed, t he Const ruction Materials Exemption is available for contractors that work on projects contracted out by certain tax- exempt entities , including federal , state, and local governments ; not-for-profit schools ; and charitable organizations . All of the se tax- exempt entities are also exempt from sales and/or use tax when they purchase tangible 1998 CONSTRUCTION AND BUI LDING MATERIALS EXEM PTION personal 26-713(2)(d), C.R.S.] . WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURE ? The Department of R evenue was not able to provide us with data on the amount claimed for the Construction Materials Exemption. Retailers are required to report the exempt sales on the Colorado Retail Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100). However, they report the exemption on Line 4 of Schedule A, which is also used to report other exemptions, including sales made directly to exempt entities, and the information reported on that line cannot be disaggregated. For this reason , the Department could not provide us with tax return data on the exemption and we could not determine its revenue impact. If the General Assemb ly wants to know the revenue impact of the exemption, the Department of Revenue would need to add a separate reporting line to F orm DR 0100 and capture the data in GenTax, its tax reporting and information system. However, according to the Department of Revenue, this type of change would require additional resources to change the form and complete the necessary programming in GenTax (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on t he limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATUTOR Y PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS EXEMPTION . As discussed, statute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not state the exemption's purpose or provide performance measures for evaluating its effectiveness. Therefore, for the pu rposes of our evaluation, we 2009 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT considered a potential purpose for the exemption: to avoid passing sales and use taxes on to tax- exempt entities when they hire contractors to complete construction projects. We identified this purpose based on its operation and stakeholder input. We also developed a performance measure to assess the extent to which the exemption is meeting this potential purpose. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the exemption by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure(s) in statute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the exemption's purpose and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the exemption is accomplishing its intended goal(s). THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY COULD CONSIDER CLARI FYING ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS EXEMPTION . Specifically , it could clarify whether it intends for the following types of projects to fall within the exemption: PROJECTS THAT HAVE A PRIVATE PARTNER . Statute does not indicate whether and under what circumstances the exemption would applywhen construction materials are purchased by contracto rs completing projects for partnerships in which a private company that would otherwise not qualify for the exemption partners with agovernmental or nonprofit organization. Further, the Department ofRevenue has not issued regulations or guidance regarding this issue and its staff reported that it can be challenging to determine eligibility for the exemption under these circumstances. For example , the Department does not allow projects for certain nonprofit housingorganizations that partner with private companies to qualify because they are joint owners with the private companies when the project is finishe d. However, because these projects may , at least partially , serve a charitable purpose, it is unclear if the General Assemblyintended for the exemption to apply. PROJECTS CO NDUCTED UNDER \"GOVERNMENTAL CAPACIT C.R.S.] , materials purchased for government projects must be owned and 20110 CONSTRUCTION AND BUI LDING MATERIALS EXEM PTION used by the governments \"in their governmental capacities only\" to be eligible for the exemption. \"Governmental capacity\" is not defined in statute and the Department of Revenue has not established additional regulations or guidance to define it. Department staff reported that , at times , it is difficult to determin e whether certain government projects fall under an entity's governmental capacity. For example, a contractor for a local government might submit an application for the exemption to purchase materials for a recreation center or golf course run by a municipality . It is unclear whether the General Assembly intended for these types of projects to fall u nder \"government al capacity,\" since although governments are offering a public amenity , they typically act similarly to private proprietor s for these operations, charging fees for their use and competing with private companies. PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT ULTIMATELY OWNED BY CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS . Some charitable organizations we spoke with reported that some of their contractors or subcontractors do not qualify for the Construction Materials Exemption because theorganization is not the final intended o wner of the property. For example , if a charitable organization builds a home that is sold to a low-income family, contractors and sub- contractors working on that project would not be eligible for the Construction MaterialsExemption because statute [Section 39- 26-708(1), C.R.S.] requires that the materials be used in a project \"owned and used by\" thecharitable organization in the conduct of its regular charitable functions and activities . In those cases, the organization is acting in its charitable function by providing low -income housing and is exempt from sales tax when it directly purchases materials for thoseprojects; however the Construction Materials Exemption is notextended to contractors or sub- contractors hired by the organization because the ch aritable organization is not the final owner of the project. Therefore, the General Assembly could consider clarifyingwhether it intended for the exemption to apply under thesecircumstances. 202EXPENDITURE SALES TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS EXEMPTION PTA & PTO EXEMPTION SCHOOL RELATED SALES EXEMPTION TAX TYPE Sales Tax Sales Tax Sales Tax YEAR ENACTED 1969 2008 2008 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None None None REVENUE IMPACT (TAX YEAR 2019) $1.7 million $3.2 million combined NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could Not Determine Could Not Determine Could Not Determine WHAT DO THESE TAX EXPENDITURE S DO?

Based on our review of their legislative history and their operation, our evaluation considered these exemptions to have the following potential purposes: SALES TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS EXEMPTION \u2014 Defining the sales tax base to exclude nonprofit , private schools from paying sales tax, similar to the treatment of charitable organizations .PTA & PTO EXEMPTION AND THE SCHOOL RELATED SALES EXEMPTION \u2014We identified two potential purposes for both tax expenditures : (1) reducing eligible organizations' administrativeburden related to collecting and remitting salestax, and (2) increasing eligible organizations'sales revenue and funding available to schools,since individuals may increase their purchases from PTA & PTO fundraisers due to the lower after-tax cost of the items sold. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENTIFY? The General Assembly may want to consider: Amending statute to establish a statutory purpose and performance measures for the three School Sales Exemptions . Clarifying or consolidating eligibility requirements for the PTA & PTO Exemption and the School Related Sales Exemption. Repealing the Private Schools Exemption because it is likely obsolete. SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTIONS EVALUATION SUMMARY | JANUARY 2021 | 2021 -TE5 KEY CONCLUSION : These exempt ions are likely exempting most eligible school -related sales from sales tax. However, the PTA & PTO and School Related Sales Exemptions' eligibility requirements establish different tax treatment for sales made by similar organizations, and the Sales to Private Schools Exemption appears to be obsolete. 2032 SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTI ONS SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTIONS EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT ARE THESE TAX EXPENDITURE S? This evaluation covers three sales tax exemptions related to schools: S ALES TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS EXEMPTION [Section 39- 26-704(4), C.R.S. ]\u2014This provision exempts sales of tangible personal property made to private, nonprofit schools from state sales tax. Statute [Section 39 -26-102(13), C.R.S .] defines \"school s\" qualifying for the exemption as limited to those providing elementary through coll ege level curriculums; preschools and early childhood education providers do not qualify . The exemption was enacted in 1969 and has remained substantially unchanged since. Retaile rs typically apply the exemption at the point of sale and should report it on Schedule A, Line 4 of the ir Retail Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100). PARENT TEACHER ASSOCIATION AND ORGANIZATION (PTA & PTO) EXEMPTION [SECTION 39-26-718(1)( C), C.R.S.] \u2014This provision exempts sales by parent teacher associations and organizations that benefit public schools from sales tax. According to Department of Revenue guidance [FYI Sales 86], sales, including fundraiser items, bake-sale goods, silent auction donations, and booster concession stand food items , are eligible for the exemption when benefitting a public kindergarten through 12th grade (K -12) school. Additionally, under Section 29-2- 105(1) (d)(I)(L), C.R.S ., statutory and home -rule local governments that have their sales taxes collecte d by the S tate may choose whether to apply the exemption to their local sales taxes. The PTA & PTO Exemption was enacted in 2008 and has remained substanti ally unchanged since. PTAs and PTOs that apply the exemption are required to obtain a sales tax licen se [Section 39-26- 103(1)(a) and (9)(a), C.R.S.] and file a Colorado Retail Sales Tax 2043 SCHOOL SALES TAX EXE MPTIONS Return ( Form DR 0100) reporting gross sales and deducting exempt sales. Generally, if these organization s do not m ake any taxable sales at the state or local level, they can file annually. Organizations that collect less than $300 in taxes on sales , subject to state or local sales tax, may file either quarterly or, if they collect less than $15, annually . PTAs and PTOs apply the exemption at the point of sale and should report it on Schedule B, Line 6 of the Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0100). SCHOOL RELATED SALES EXEMPTION [SECTION 39-26-725(2) , C.R.S.]\u2014This exemption broadens the types of school -related organizations whose sales are exempt from sales tax. Specifically, under the School Related Sales Exemption, sales by schools themselves , school booster organizations, or a ny other school organizations that benefit a public or private school are exempt from sales tax . The exemption is limite d to sales by or benefiting public or private, nonprofit, K -12 schools. Sales by preschools, post - secondary, or for -profit schools or school organizations are not eligible for the exemption under Department of Revenue Regulations [1 CCR- statutory and home -rule local governments that have their sales taxes collected by the State may choose whether to apply the exemption to their local sales taxes. The School R elated Sales Exemption was created in 2008 and has remained unchanged since. To apply the exemption, school s and school -related organizations are required to obtain a sales tax license [Sections 39- 26-103(1)(a) and (9)(a), C.R.S.] and report exempt sales on Schedule B, Line 6 of the Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100). In addition to these tax expenditures, sales to public schools are also exempt from sales tax under a broader provision, exempting all government entities from sales tax [Section 39 -26-704(1) , C.R.S.], which is not included in this evaluation. Because the State is precluded from taxing these entities under federal law and the State Constitution, we do not consider this provision to be a tax expendi ture for the purposes of our evaluations . 2054 SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTI ONS WHO A RE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURES? Statute does not directly state the intended beneficiaries of the Sales to Private Schools Exemption, the PTA & PTO Exemption, or the School Related Sales Exemption. Based on the operation of the Sales to Private Schools Exemption and a survey of schools in the state , we considered its intended beneficiaries to be private, non profit schools in Colorado whose after-tax costs for purchases of tangible personal property are reduced as a result of the exem ption. Based on the tax expenditures' operation and legislative testimony , we considered the intended beneficiaries of the PTA & PTO Exemption and t he School R elated Sales Exemption to include PTAs, PTOs, schools, school organizations , and individuals making purchases from these organizations. Specifically, the exemptions may decrease the organizations' administrative burden related to collecting and remitting sales tax and increase the funds they collect , since the organizations can offer their sale items free of sales tax, which may encourage customers to make additional purchases . Individuals making purc hases from the organizations also direct ly benefit by not paying sales tax. Additionally , legislative testimony indicated that privat e and public school students and teachers in K -12 schools were intended to indirect ly benefi t, to the extent that th e exemptions increase sales, because PTA, PTO, and school organization sales are often related to fundraising efforts used to increase schools' total funds , along with educational and extracurricular opportunities for students. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE SE TAX EXPENDITURES? Statute and the enacting legislation for these tax expenditures do not state their purpose s; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. However, o ur evaluation of the tax expenditures considered the following potential purposes: 2065 SCHOOL SALES TAX EXE MPTIONS SALES TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS EXEMPTION \u2014Based on its operation and other states' statutory exemptio ns, we considered a potential purpose : to define the sales tax base to exclude non profit private schools. Specifically, no nprofit schools are commonly exempted from sales tax because they are considered to provide a public benefit. This is consist ent with the State's treatm ent of charitable organizations, which have been exempt from sales tax since the sales tax was established in 1935 . Similarly, other states with a sales tax typically exempt sales to nonprofit organizations and institutions designed to ed ucate the public. PTA & PTO EXEMPTION AND THE SCHOOL RELATED SALES EXEMPTION \u2014Based on our review of statutory language, legislative testimony, discussions with stakeholders, and survey responses, we considered these exemptions to have the following potential purpose s: (1) reduc ing eligible organizations' administrative burden related to collecting and remitting sales tax , and (2) increasing eligible organizations' sales revenue and funding available to schools, since individuals may increase their purch ases from PTA & PTO fundraisers due to the lower after -tax cost of the items sold. The PTA & PTO Exemption and the School R elated Sales Exemption were implemented during the economic downturn in 2008, when public school districts experienced significant budget shortfalls and private school enrollment and tuition declined. ARE THE TAX EXPENDITURE S MEETING THEIR PURPOSE S AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? We could not definitively determine whether these tax expenditures are meeting their purposes because no purpose s are provided for them in statute or their enacting legislation. However, we found that they are meeting the potential purposes we considered in order to conduct this evaluation. 2076 SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTI ONS Statute does not provide quantifiable perform ance measures for these exemptions . Therefore, w e created and applied the following performance measures to determine the extent to which the exemptions are meeting their potential purpose s: PERFORMANCE MEASURE #1: To what extent are sales to private schools and sales by schools, school organizations , and PTAs/PTOs exempted from Colorado sales an d use tax? RESULT : Schools reported that vendors commonly apply the Sales to Private Schools Exemption when making sales to private schools . Although we lacked data to quantify the extent to which the exemption is applied, w e conducted a survey of schools and school districts in the state and received survey responses from seven private schools. While one survey participant commented that some vendors make getting the exemption too difficult, 6 of the 7 schools ( 86 percent ) indicated that vendors typically apply the Sales to Private Schools Exemption when making sales to private schools . We also found that PTAs, schools, and school organizations that benefit public and private schools commonly apply the PTA & PTO Exemption and the School Related Sales Exemption to eligible sales. We received survey responses from eight private schools and 39 public school districts in the state representing 27 0 schools. Of these respondents, s ix private schools and 24 school districts said they had a PTA or PTO and all of them indicated that , to their knowledge, the exemptions were applied to most sales. Further, interviews with two PTAs in the state indicated that they apply the exemptions to eligible sales . P ERFORMANCE MEASURE #2: To what extent do the PTA & PTO Exemption and the School Related Sales Exemption reduce school s' and school organizations ' administrative burden when making sales? RESULT : Based on survey participants' responses, w e found that the exemptions are reducing the administrative burden for schools, school organizations, and PTAs/PTOs. The 22 public school district s and six 2087 SCHOOL SALES TAX EXE MPTIONS private school s that answered the relevant questions generally indicated that the exemptions reduce the number of personnel and resources needed by schools and school organizations to properly collect and remit sales tax. According to respondents, by not having to calculate and collect sales tax at the time of sale , and reporting sales tax information to the Department of Revenue less frequently, they can decrease the workload and number of employees needed for schools and school -related organizations ' fundraising. However, the exemptions do not completely eliminate the administrative burden, since schools and eligible school -related organizations are still required to obtain a retail sales tax license and track and report total sales annually on their sales tax return . PERF ORMANCE MEASURE 3: To what extent do the PTA & PTO Exemption and the School R elated Sales Exemption increase financial support to schools ? RESULT : We found that the PTA & PTO Exemption and School Related Sales Exemption likely provide some financial support to schools, though their impact is small relative to school s' total budgets. Of the 36 respondents to our survey of private schools and public school districts who answered the relevant questions, 17 ( 47 percent) reported that the exemptions were important to the schools and school district s because they provide financial support over and above what would already be coming from the school or eligible organizations' sales. Respondents explained that the funds raised by school -related organizations are used to buy additional supplies for classrooms, fund student activities, provide equipment for school clubs, provide professional development to teachers, and increase funding for in - classroom grants. Although some schools and school districts reported that the exemptions provide important financial support, this support is likely small relative to their overall funding. Based on survey respondents' reported revenue from eligible sales and districts' pupil count data from 2098 SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTI ONS the Colorado Department of Education, we estimate that public school survey respondents received roughly $129 per pupil from sales by schools, school organizations, and PTAs and PTOs in School Year 2019- 2020. Therefore, assumin g that the school organizations increased their fundraising by the 2.9 percent in sales taxes that are not collected due to the exemption s, schools would have seen about a $ 3.64 increase in per pupil funding. Similarly, the five private schools that responded to the applicable questions in our survey reported average eligible sales of about $ 47.50 per pupil, meaning that the exemption would provide a n increase of about $1.34 per pupil. Though these potential increases to public and private school funding could provide important support in some areas, t hey are relatively small in comparison to schools' total budgets. For example, Colorado public school budgets averaged $ 10,280 per pupil in Calendar Year 2017, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Furthermore, the exemptions are likely not providing equal benefit to all students throughout the state . Specifically, discussions with stakeholders and our review of scholarly articles on school financing indicated that the benefit of these exemptions is most likely larger for districts and schools located in wealthier areas because schools in these areas receive more funding through fundraising activities . For example, according to school district survey respon ses, school districts located in counties with a median household income greater than $70,000 received an average of about $45 per pupil in PTA/PTO sales, while areas with a median household income of less than $50,000 received about $4 per pupil in PTA/PTO sales . WHAT ARE THE ECONOMI C COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURE S? We estimate that in Calendar Year 2019, the Sales to Private Schools Exemption resulted in about $1.7 million in forgone state revenue and that the PTA & PTO Exemption and the School Related Sales Exemption had a combined revenue impact of about $3.2 million. 2109 SCHOOL SALES TAX EXE MPTIONS The Department of Revenue could not provide data for the Sales to Private Schools Exemption and lacked complete information for the PTA & PTO Exemption and School Related Sales Exemption. Therefore, we conducted the following analyses to estimate the revenue impact: S ALES TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS EXEMPTION \u2014We estimated that private schools' purchases of exempt items resulted in about $ 1.7 million in foregone revenue by projecting the total exempt sales reported by six private school s that responded to our survey to all private schools in the state. Specifically, these respondents reported an average of $1,411 in annual per pupil exempt purchases in Calendar Year 2019, which we calculated by dividing each resp ondent's total reported exempt purchases by the number of students in each school . We then multiplied the average respondents' per pupil purchases by the 42,600 private K -12 students in the state, as estimated by the NCES , to estimate that private schools made about $60 million in exempt purchases in Calendar Year 2019. We multiplied this amount by the state sales tax rate (2.9 percent) to arrive at our estimate. Although we estimated the Sales to Private Schools Exemption's revenue impact in isolation from other available tax expenditures , when these other expenditures are considered, the exemption likely has had a minimal impact on state revenues. Specifically, as nonprofit organizations, the private schools eligible for this exemption would generally also qualify for a sales tax exemption under Section 39- 26- 718(1)(a), C.R.S., which exempts charitable organizations from paying sales taxes on their purchases. PTA & PTO EXEMPTION AND THE SCHOOL RELATED SALES EXEMPTION \u2014We estimated a total revenue impact of $3. 2 million for these exemptions using information provided by the 28 school districts and six private schools that responded to our survey. Specifically, we calculated the revenue qualifying for the exemptions on a per pupil basis by taking the qualifying revenue reported by survey respondents and dividing this amount by the number of 21110 SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTI ONS students in each school or district. From this calculation we estimated that for public sc hools , there was an average of about $129 in qualifying revenue per pupil and for private schools there was about $47.50 per pupil . We then multiplied these averages by the approximately 832,000 public school students in Colorado , according to data from th e Colorado Department of Education, and 42,600 private school students , according to data from the NCES , to project that there were about $ 109 million in qualifying sales statewide in Calendar Year 2019. We then multiplied this amount by the state sales tax rate of 2.9 percent to arrive at our estimate of $ 3.2 million , which includes $3.1 million for sales by public schools and related organizations and $59,000 for sales by private schools and related orga nizations . Because our survey results might not b e representative of all public and private schools in the state, our revenue impact estimates should be viewed as a general indicator of the scale of these exemptions . Specifically, the schools and districts that responded to our survey serve only about 14 percent of all K-12 private and public students in the state and could use the exemptions to a greater or lesser extent than the average school or school district , which would reduce the accuracy of our projection. Further, although survey responses generally came from school district s and school s' financial staff with knowledge of school budgets and sales, some of the respondents indicated that they do not systematically track the information about sales that we requested , since the revenue would be collected and tracked by the fundraising organizations . As a result, the figures they provided were estimates and likely lack precision. Finally, we did not have data to include higher education institutions in our estimate for the Sales to Private Schools Exemption, which would further increase the estimated impact . In addition, s tatute [Section 29-2- 105(1), C.R.S .] requires statutory and home -rule cities, counties, and districts for which the State collects sales taxes to apply the Sales to Private Schools Exemption and allows them to choose whether to apply the PTA & PTO Exemption and the School Related Sales Exemption. Therefore, we estimate a combined local 21211 SCHOOL SALES TAX EXE MPTIONS government revenue impact of about $ 460,000 for state-collected local jurisdictions that were required to apply the Sales to Private Schools Exemption in Calendar Year 2019. We also estimated an additional local government revenue impact of $160 ,000 for the four cities and eight counties that ch ose to apply the PTA & PTO and School Relate d Sales Exemptions. We estimated these amount s using data from the State Demographer 's Office and local tax rate information from the Department of Revenue. Specifically, we calculated a household income -weighted average local tax rate of 2.3 percent for state -collected local jurisdictions , including count ies, municipal ities, and districts (all of which are required to apply the Sales to Private Schools exemption) and a household income -weighted average combined local tax rate of 1.7 percent in jurisdictions that have opted to apply the PTA & PTO and School Related Sales Exemption. We then multiplied those rates by the total projected sales reported as exempt statewide for sales to private schools ($60 million) and sales by schools and eligible or ganizations ($109 million). We then m ultiplied these figure s by the percentage of the State's population resid ing in state-collected jurisdiction s that apply the Sales to Private Schools Exemption ( 33 percent) and the PTA & PTO and School Related Sales Exemption (8.8 percent) to arrive at our estimate. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURES HAVE ON BENEFICIARI ES? If the Sales to Private Schools Exemption was eliminated, most sales to private schools' would still be tax -exempt and the impact would likely be minimal. Although we estimate that private schools save on average about $4,287 under the exemption each year, because most not -for- profit private schools in the stat e are also tax -exempt charitable organizations, they would likely still qualify for a sales tax exemption under Section 39- 26-718(1)(a) , C.R.S ., which exempts charitable organizations from paying sales tax . 21312 SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTI ONS If the PTA & PTO Exemption and the School Related Sales Exemption were eliminated, individuals purchas ing items from schools or school - related organizations would see at least a 2.9 percent increase in the after-tax cost of their purchases, plus any additional local sales taxes that applied, which can range from 1 to 3.5 percent in state- collected cities and .25 to 3.6 percent in state -collected counties that have opted to apply the exemptions . As discussed above, we estimate that the exemptions likely provide public schools with a relatively small potential benefit of about $4 per pupil , which would not be available if the exemptions were eliminated. However, the schools and school districts that participated in our survey reported that eliminating the exemptions would have a significant impact and would decrease fundrais ing revenues, which would result in less revenue for schools and decrease educational opportunities for students . Moreover, some participants explained that the impact would be exacerbated by current financial circumstances and the Fiscal Year 2021 budget cuts for public schools due to COVID -19. Finally, survey respondents indicated that eliminating the PTA & PTO Exemption and the School Related Sales Exemption would significantly increase the administrative burden associated with collecting and remitting s ales tax. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? Of the 44 states (excluding Colorado) and District of Columbia, that levy a sales tax, we found that the majority of states have exemptions for sales to private schools , though exemptions for sales by schools and PTAs /PTOs are less common. However, many states that do not have a specific exemption for sales by schools or PTAs and PTOs have exemptions for not- for-profit or charitable organizations for which schools and PTAs/PTOs may qualify.

ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? We identified the following tax expenditures and programs designed to supplement school funding and enhance available educational opportunities: FEDERAL EDUCATOR EXPENSES DEDUCTION \u2014Allows eligible educators to claim a deduction of up to $250 for the purchase of school supplies and professional development courses when c alculating their federal taxable income. SALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS SALES TAX EXEMPTION (SECTION 39-26-718, C.R.S.)\u2014Non profit private schools that qualify for the Sales to Private Schools exemption are also eligible for this sales tax exemption, which exempts charitable organizations from paying sales tax on their purchases. Most nonprofit organizations with a charitable, religious, or educational purpose are eligible for the exemption; and, generally, if an organization has qualified for federal tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), it will also qualify for the Sales to Charitable Organizations Sales Tax Exemption. 21514 SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTI ONS COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 'S COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND AWARDS \u2014The C olorado Department of E ducation admini sters a wide variety of federal and state grant opportunities intended to enhance school improvement and student success. RESPONSE , INNOVATION , AND STUDENT EQUITY (RISE) EDUCATION FUND\u2014Administered by the Governor's Office, the fund was established in 2020 to assist schools, school districts , and institutions of higher education in addressing the educational challenges caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. The RISE Education Fund utilizes federal funds from the Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund, inc luded as part of the CARES Act. The fund will provide grants totaling $32.7 million , which will be available for use through September 2022. In addition to these programs, t here are an array of private, community, and corporate foundations that provide financial benefits to public and private schools in the state . WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? The Department of Revenue could not provide data showing the revenue impact for the Sales to Private Schools Exemption. Specifically , vendors report sales to private schools on Schedule A, Line 4 of the Department of Revenue's Colorado Sales and Use Tax Return ( Form DR 0100) , along with sales to other exempt entities like governments and charitable organizations , and this information cannot be disaggregated for analysis . If the General Assembly wants complete information , it could consider instructing the Department of Revenue to add a reporting line for sales to private schools to the Sales Tax Return form . GenTax , the Department's tax processing and information system , would also have to be reconfigured to collect and extract this data; h owever, according to the Department of Revenue, this type of change would require additional resources to develop the form and c omplete the necessary programming in GenTax (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax 21615 SCHOOL SALES TAX EXE MPTIONS Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). Although the Department was able to provide information related to the PTA & PTO Exemption and the School Related Sales Exemption, it did not have complete data showing the use of the exemptions. Specifically, Department staff and our review of taxpayer data indicated that, in some instances, schools and organizations may have reported the exemptions on the wrong line of the ir Sale s Tax Return form. Specifically, schools and organizations may have mistakenly reported the exemptions on Schedule A, Line 2, labeled as \"Sales to governmental agencies, religious or charitable organizations\" or Schedule B, Line 10 labeled as \"Other Exemptions\" on the 2018- 19 Sales Tax Return instead of on Schedule B, Line 6, labeled as \"school related sales.\" Department staff also indicated that school -related organizations may have erroneously thought that their sales are exempt from all state and local sales taxes and have not reported any sales that are exempt from state sales tax, but are subject to local sales tax. For this reason, the revenue impact information the Department could provide , which was based on the amount reported by taxpayers on Schedule B, Line 6 of the form , may not include the full revenue impact of the exemptions. Therefore, using survey data, we estimated the revenue impact to be $3.2 million , which was significantly higher than the $ 983,000 reported by the Department for 2019 sales in its 2020 Tax Profile and Expenditure Report . According to Department staff, the issue was addressed by revising the 2020 Sales Tax Return Form ( Form DR 0100) and creating a supplemental guidance form that provides specific line instructions for remitting sales taxes, which should improve the quality of the available data for future evaluations . 21716 SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTI ONS WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATUTORY PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FO R THE SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTIONS . As discussed, statute and the enacting legislation for these exemptions do not state the exemptions' purposes or provide performance measures for evaluating their effectiveness. Therefore, for the purposes of our evaluation, we considered the following potential purposes: S ALES TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS EXEMPTION \u2014We considered its potential purpose to be defining the tax base to exclude nonprofit private schools from sales tax. We identified this purpose based on the operation of the exemption, which provides tax treatment similar to the exemption the State provides to charitable organizations. Specifically, such organizations, which include nonprofit private schools, have been considered to provide a benefit to the public and have been exempt from sales tax since the sales tax was first established in 1935 . However, as discussed below, this provision is likely duplicative and obsolete and the General Assembly would only need to establish a statutory purpose and performance measures if the General Assembly did not repeal the exemption. PTA & PTO EXEM PTION AND SCHOOL RELATED SALES EXEMPTION \u2014 We identified two purposes for these exemptions: (1) reduce eligible organizations' administrative burden related to collecting and remitting sales tax, and (2) provide financial support to schools, since organizat ions conducting fundraising activities for the benefit of schools often make qualifying sales. We identified these purposes based on our review of the operation of the exemptions, stakeholder input, and their legislative history. Specifically, the sponsors for House Bills 08- 1013 and 08- 1358, which established the exemptions, indicated that they intended for the provisions to reduce the administrative burden on organizations and support schools financially. 21817 SCHOOL SALES TAX EXE MPTIONS We also developed three performance measures to assess the extent to which the exemptions are meeting their potential purposes. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the exemptions by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure(s) in statute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the exemptions' purposes and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the exemptions are accomplishing their intended goal(s). T HE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER C LARIFYING OR CONSOL IDATING THE PTA & PTO EXEMPTION AND THE SCHOOL RELATED SALES EXEMPTION . Based on our review of statute, Department of Revenue regulations , and discussions with Department staff, we found that although the PTA & PTO Exemption overlaps with the broader School Related Sales Exemption , the exemptions provide somewhat different treatment to public school PTAs/ PTOs as compared to private school PTAs/ PTOs and PTAs /PTOs that have not qualified as a \"charitable organization. \" Specifically, all private school PTAs/ PTOs and public school PTAs /PTOs that have not qualified as a charitable organization can only qualify for the School Related Sales Exemption. This exemption requires that all of the ir sale proceeds, except the actual costs incurred for the good or service sold, be donated to a school or school organization. In contrast, public school PTAs/ PTOs that qualify for the PTA & PTO Exemption can exempt sales used to pay the \"reasonable expenses\" of the organization [ 1 CCR 201 -4 39-26-718(8) and (9)]. Thus, although the exemptions are similar, they appear to provide stricter requirements for how a PTA or PTO can use the funds it raises if it benefits a private school or has not qualified as a charitable organization. They also extend this stricter treatment to other types of organizations that are not PTAs and PTOs, such as booster clubs, which only qualify for the School Related Sales Exemption. Based on our review of the legislative history of both exemptions, which were passed during the 2008 legislative session in separate bills (House Bills 08 -1013 and 08 -1358), legislators were aware that the two provisions were similar, but it is unclear whether the General Assembly 21918 SCHOOL SALES EXEMPTI ONS intended to create different benefits based on the criteria outlined above. Further, the diffe rences in these provisions add complexity to the administration of the exemptions and could create confusion for taxpayers. Therefore, the General Assembly may wish to review these exemptions and clarify or consolidate them to the extent that they are not meeting their intent. The G ENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER REPEALING THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS EXEMPTION BECAUSE IT IS LIKELY OBSOLETE . We considered the purpose of the Sales to Private Schools Exemption to be defining the tax base to exclude nonprofi t private schools from sales tax. However, we found in our evaluation that sales to these schools are likely also sales-tax-exempt under the Sales to Charitable Organizations Sales Tax Exemption [Section 39- 26-718(1)(a), C.R.S. ], which exempts sales to charitable organizations qualifying for federal tax -exempt status under Section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code . Based on discussions with Department of Revenue staff, we determined that in 1967 , before the Colorado General Assembly enacted the Sal es to Private Schools Exemption, private schools' federal tax- exempt status was temporarily suspended due to a series of rulings issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Specifically, the IRS determined that some private schools receiving state aid were not entitled to tax -exempt status under Internal Revenue Code 501(c) (3) due to the potential for racially discriminatory admission practices and required that private schools have a racial nondiscrimination policy to qualify . Later expanding this ruling in 1970 to all private schools , regardless of whether or not they received state aid, the IRS also implemented a series of revenue procedures and rulings with the intent of enforcing nondiscrimination requirements . Because under Colorado law , schools are presumed to qualify for the Sales to Charitable Organizations Sales Tax Exemption if they have qualified for federal tax -exempt status under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), these IRS actions may have disqualified some schools from the state level exemption. Therefore, the Sales to Private Schools Exemption would have provided private schools with a sales tax exemption regardless of whether they qualified under Section 501(c)(3). 22019 SCHOOL SALES TAX EXE MPTIONS However, b ecause the IRS has since resumed the tax -exempt status of nonprofit private schools , the Sales to Private Schools Exemption is likely obsolete and has the potential to complicate the tax code, thereby creating confusion for taxpayers reporting and remitting sales tax exemptions. Therefore, the General Assembly co uld consider repealing this exemption. 221 222The Food Service Employer -provided [Sections 39- 26-104(1)(e) and 707(2)(a), C.R.S.] (Employer -provided Meals Exemption) exempts meals provided by food service establishments to their employees at no charge or at a discount from sales and us e tax. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? TAX TYPE YEAR ENACTED REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE REVENUE IMPACT NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Sales and use 1978 None $6.4 million (CALENDAR YEAR 2019) Could not determine WHAT DOES THIS TAX E XPENDITURE DO? Statute s and the enacting legislation for the Employer -provided Meals Exemption do not explicitly state its purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the exemption and feedback from st akeholders, we considered two potential purposes: (1) t o reduce the administrative burden on food -service establishments that provide free and/or discounted meals to their employees and (2) t o prevent the fringe benefit of free or discounted meals from being subject to sales or use tax. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS D ID THE E VALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider: Establishing a statutory purpose andperformance measures for the exemption. Adding language to statute to clarify whichmeals provided to food service employees bytheir employer qualify for the exemption.FOOD SERVICE EMPLOYER - PROVIDED MEALS EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY | APRIL 2021 | 2021-TE 13 KEY CONCLUSION : The exemption is generally effective at avoiding applying the sales and use tax to meals provided by eligible food -service establishments to their employees for no charge or a t a discount. However, we found that a lack of guidance on when and how taxpayers should be applying the exemption may be preventing a portion of food- service establis hments from using it . 2232 EMPLO YER-PROVIDED MEALS E XEMPTION FOOD SERVICE EMPLOYER- PROVIDED MEALS EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? The Food Service Employer -provided Meals 26-104(1)( e) and 707(2)(a), C.R.S.] (Employer -provided Meals Exemption) exempts from sales and use tax meals provided by food- service establishmen ts to their employees at no charge or at a discount . According to statute [Section 39-26- 104(1)(e), C.R.S.], the establi shments eligible to u se the exemption include \"restaurants, cafes, lunch counters, cafeterias, hotels, social clubs, nightclubs, cabarets, resorts, snack bars, caterers, carryout shops, and other like places of business at which prepared food or drink is r egularly sold, including sales from pushcarts, motor vehicles, and other mobile facilities.\" Statute s [Sections 39- 26-104(1)(e) and 202(1)(b) , C.R.S.] impose sales and use tax on prepared food and the exemption applies to either the sales or use tax depe nding on the circumstances under which the eligible meal is provided . Specifically, when employees purchase a discounted meal from their employer , the Employer -provided Meals Exemption exempts food- service employees from sales tax, which would otherwise be due on the retail sale. In the case of an eligible food -service establishment providing free meals for its employees, those meal s are not considered taxable sales, but the ex penditure exempts the establishment from paying use tax on the ingredients removed from its inventory and used for the meals . The exemption would apply to use tax in this circumstance because when a food- service establishment purchases ingredients to use in preparing food for retail sale, its purchases are generally exempt as who lesale sales under Section s 39- 26-102(19) and ( 20), C.R.S ; however, if a food -service establishment 2243 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT later removes ingredients from its inventory for its own use, it would otherwise have to pay use tax on those ingredients because its earlier purchase of the ingredients would no longer qualify as exempt . The exemption was created in 1978 with House Bill 78- 1257 . According to testimony for the bill, prior to 1978, in practice, a sales or use tax had not been levied on these meals; however, in 1977 , the Depa rtment of Revenue (Department) announced its intention to begin collecting sales and/or use tax on these meals as of January 1, 1978 . Therefore, t he exemption generally codified what had been done in practice prior to 1978. However , the language in the enacting legislation and statute only extended the exemption to meals that were considered part of an employee's wages, pay, or compensation. In 2009, with Senate Bill 09 -121, the General Assembly removed the language that stipulated that the meals be part of an employee's compensation to be exempt. The expenditure has remained substantively unchanged since then. Food- service establishments are responsible for determining what meals and materials are tax exempt and report the ir tax ex empt sales under the Employer -provided Meals Sales Tax Exemption on Line 12 of Schedule A of the ir Colorado Retail Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0100). Food- service establishments are not required to report the Employer - provided Meals Exemption when it is appl ied to use taxes. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not directly state the intended beneficiaries of the Employer -provided Meals Exemption. Based on the operation of the exemption, we considered the intended beneficiaries to be the owners of eligible food -service establishments and their employees, since the exemption prevents food- service employees from having to pay sales tax on discounted meals they receive from their employers and prevents restaurants from paying use tax on the ingredients used for free meals they provide to employees. According to industry data, in 2019, there 2254 FOOD SERVICE EMPLO YER-PROVIDED MEALS E XEMPTION were more than 11,000 food- service establishments in Colorado that employed about 285,000 workers across the state, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the State's labor force. According to stakeholders, providing free or discounted meals to employees is a common practice in the food- service industry. F ast- casual restaurants and smaller cafes with a limited menu are more likely to provide employees with a discount, while benefits such as a staff - wide \"family meal; \" allowing an employee to order a free \"shift meal\" before, during, or after their working hours ; or allowing employees to prepare their own meals free of charge are more common practices in full-service restaurants. Additionally, we also spoke to a labor union that represents Colorado food- service workers at venues such as airports, hotels, and stadiums who told us that all of their members a re guaranteed in their contracts one free hot meal per shift provided to them at no cost by their employer. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute and the enacting legislation for the Employer -provided Meals Exemption do not explicitly state its purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the exemption and feedback from stakeholders, we considered two potential purposes: To reduce the administrative burden on food- service establishments that provide free or discounted meals to their employees. When Senate Bill 09 -121 was presented to the Colorado House and Senate Finance committees, sponsors and supporters of the bill, such as trade groups representing restaurant o wners, stated that levying a tax on these meals would place an onerous administrative burden on restaurant owners and would possibly impact their ability and willingness to provide an often expected industry benefit. This is due to the varied, and often casual, nature of how food- service establishments furnish free or discounted meals to their employees. While some employers provide their employees with free or 2265 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT discounted meals that are rung up at the point of sale, others opt for a more casual approach suc h as providing a \"family style\" meal for their staff prior to service or preparing a bulk meal that employees can serve themselves on a break. Therefore, uniformly imposing a sales and use tax on free or discounted employee meals could be difficult for foo d-service establishments to comply with . To prevent the fringe benefit of free or discounted meals from being subject to sales or use tax. According to Internal Revenue Service - issued guidance on fringe benefits, meals provided t o food-service employees for the convenience of the employer are considered a fringe benefit and their value does not need to be included in an employee's taxable wages, this includes both meals provided for free or at a discount. According to stakeholders, t he practice of providing food- service employees with a meal \u2014for free or at a discount \u2014is a widespread and expected practice in the restaurant industry that offers a number of operational benefits for both employees and business owners. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We could not definitively determine whether the Employer -provided Meals Exemption is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided in statute or its enacting leg islation. However, we found that the exemption is likely meeting the potential purposes we considered in order to conduct this evaluation because food- service employers are largely aware of the exemption, and most apply the exemption when they provide free or discounted meals to their employees. Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this exemption. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemption is meeting its pote ntial purpose: 2276 FOOD SERVICE EMPLO YER-PROVIDED MEALS E XEMPTION PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent are food- service employers aware of the Employer -provided Meals Exemption and apply ing it when they provide free or discounted meals to their employees? RESULT : We found that the exemption is likely meeting the potential purposes we considered in order to conduct this evaluation because food- service employers are largely aware of the exemption, and most apply the exemption when they provide free or discounted mea ls to their employees. However, the Department was unable to provide us with data on the number of taxpayers that claimed this exemption or the amount they claimed; therefore, we were unable to quantify the extent to which this exemption is being used. To assess the extent to which the exemption is being used, we spoke with stakeholders, including one trade organization that represent s food- service establishments across Colorado, one labor organization representing a portion of Colorado's food- service wor kers, and the ownership or management of a number of restaurant groups, representing 48 restaurant locations across the state . According to the trade organization we spoke with, most food- service employers in the state provide a discount ed or free meal t o some or all of their employees. Similarly, all of the owners or managers of the 48 restaurant locations said that they provide a discount to their employees and many also provide a free meal to some or all of their employees, depending on the type of est ablishment or the employees' position. The trade group and food- service establishments that we spoke with were aware of the exemption and most food -service establishments indicated that they apply the exemption to their eligible meals . Additionally, most of the stakeholders we spoke to told us that their employee meal benefits were integrated into their point -of-sale systems, making it easy to apply the sales tax exemption, and simplifying the process of e stimating their use tax exempt ingredients . However , the trade group we spoke with noted that , while they do inform food- service establishments about the exemption when the opportunity arises, there are likely some eligible food- service establishments that are unaware of the exemption. They 2287 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT attributed this to the likelihood that smaller restaurants or less experienced restaurateurs may have limited knowledge of Colorado's sales and use tax exemptions and/or do not employ an accountant or accounting service that would be familiar with common exemptions for the food- service industry. However, of those food -service establishments that are unaware, it is possible there may be some establishments that are also unaware that they would need to pay use tax on materials that are not used in sales to customers, thus inadvertently utilizing the use tax exemption for meals they provide to employees. Further, some food- service employers may choose not to apply the benefit even if they are aware of it due to concerns about properly administering it. For example, one stakeholder mentioned that in light of concerns over interpretation of what meals the exemption applied to, they felt that the potential sales and use tax savings were negligible compared to their concerns of being audited by the Department and potentially having to remit unpaid sales and use taxes . An industry trade group also noted that some food- service employers may not apply the exemption because their point -of-sale system or accounting practices may not allow for easy deduction of sales tax from free or dis counted meals or ease of keeping track of use tax exempt food items. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? We estimate that the Employer -provided Meal s Exemption had a revenue impact to the State of about $6.4 million in Calendar Year 2019, with a corresponding sales and use tax savings for food- service establishments and their employees. The Department was not able to provide us with data on the amount claimed for the exemption. Therefore, we estimated the revenue impact of the exemption using information provided by stakeholders and data from food- service industry trade groups . To calculate this estimate, we first evaluated the potential revenue impact related to free meals provided by restaurants to employees. 2298 FOOD SERVICE EMPLO YER-PROVIDED MEALS E XEMPTION Specifically, we used information on the typical cost of employee meals provided to us by five restaurant stakeholders to determine that the average value of an individual free meal provided to employees was $1.93. Because this value represents the cost of ingredients rest aurants purchased at wholesale prices and then used to prepare meals for employees, the value is significantly lower than the typical retail cost of a restaurant meal. We then estimated the number of free meals provided to employees each year assu ming that 60 percent of the s tate's 285,000 restaurant workers received one free meal per shift and worked four shifts per week, which equates to about 35. 6 million free meals per year . We then multiplied this total by the $1.93 per meal, to estimate the t otal value of the meals at about $68.6 million annually. We multiplied this total by the State's use tax rate of 2.9 percent to estimate a revenue impact to the State of about $2 million for these meals. We then estimated the revenue impact related to d iscounted meals purchased by restaurant employees. First, b ased on our review of typical restaurant meal prices in Colorado, which included both fas t-food meals and mid -range , full-service meals, we estimated that the typical retail cost of a restaurant me al provided to employees was $10.24. We then estimated the number of discounted meals purchased, assuming that, on average , the state's 285,000 restaurant workers purchased two discounted meals per week, which equates to about 29.6 million meals annually . We then multiplied this total by $10.24 to estimate a total pre-discount value of the meals of about $304 million. Then, assuming that the typical meal discount i s about 50 percent , we estimated the sales tax exempt , after-discount value of the meals was a bout $152 million. We then multiplied this amount by the State's 2.9 percent sales tax rate, to estimate an annual revenue impact of about $4.4 million related to discounted meals. W e added this to our estimated revenue impact related to free meals to arri ve at our overall estimate of $6.4 million. Although our revenue impact provides a general indicator of the relative scale of the exemption, several data constraints likely reduce the accuracy and reliability of this estimate. First, we made several assum ptions, including the percentage of employees receiving free meals 2309 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT and discounts, the number of eligible meals employees received , and the typical cost of meals based on information we received from stakeholders. Because there was no comprehensive source o f data for these metrics and our assumptions are based on feedback from a limited number of stakeholders, our estimate may not be representative of all food- service employers in the state. Further, because statute offers a broad definition of a qualifying food- service entity, it is possible that the industry data we used in our estimates do not capture all food-service employees who may benefit from the exemption. Additionally, the industry data we used was from 2019 for our estimate. In 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic had a significant impact on the food- service industry in Colorado, including the permanent and temporary closure of restaurants across the state and an estimated loss of 87,000 restaurant industry jobs in Colorado. As such, our revenue impact estimate is not likely reflective of the current state of the Colorado food - service industry. Additionally, s tatute [Section 29 -2-105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.] requires that statutory and home rule municipalities and counties that have their sales taxes collected by the State apply most of the State's sales tax exemptions, including the Employer -provided Meals Exemption. Therefore, the exemption likely reduces local sales and use tax revenue to some extent. However, we lacked the necessary data to estimate the impact of the exemption. Home rule cities and counties established under Article XX of the Colorado Constitution that collect their own sales taxes have the authority to set their own tax policies independent from the State and are not required to exempt employer -provided meals from their local sales and use tax. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? If the Employer -provided Meals Exemption were eliminated, up to 285,000 food- service employees could see at least a 2.9 percent increase (equivalent to the state sales tax rate) in their costs paid for eligible meals, and could see an additional increase if they receive these meals 23110 FOOD SERVICE EMPLO YER-PROVIDED MEALS E XEMPTION in a local jurisdiction for which the State collects sales tax. Additionally, more than 11,000 food-s ervice employers would see at least a 2.9 percent increase (equivalent to the state use tax rate) in the cost of food and ingredients purchased that are used to provide free meals to their employees, and could also see an additional increase if they purchase supplies in a local jurisdiction for which the State collects sales tax. Based on our estimated $6.4 million value of the exemption, these costs would equate to about $22 per year in additional state sales and use taxes per food -service employee. Howev er, employees' out -of- pocket costs are highly variable due to the wide diversity of discounts and models of shift meals provided to food- service employees by their employers , so the impact would similarly vary . Stakeholders told us that eliminating the exemption may make them reevaluate the free or discounted meal benefits they provide to their employees, as profit margins are very slim in the food- service industry and any increase in costs can have an impact on operations. Some said they would likely eliminate free meals but keep employee discounts, while others said they would have to find ways to make up the costs in order to keep providing free or discounted meals for their staff, which could include changes to staffing or menu prices. According to stakeholders and industry guidance, providing free or reduced costs to food- service employees provides a number of operational benefits , including educating employees on the menu, boosting morale and loyalty among the staff, preventing food waste, keeping em ployees on site during a break, and guaranteeing that staff are nourished and not hungry during the work day. Eliminating the exemption could result in potential disruptions in operations for food- service businesses. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? We examined the tax laws of the 44 other states (excluding Colorado) with a sales tax , and the District of Columbia , and identified that at least 1 4 states and the District of Columbia have a similar sales tax exemption for meals provided at no charge to employees, with 12 of these states and the District of Columbia also providing a use tax 23211 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT exemption. In our research, we did not identify any other states that exempt meals provided at a discount to employees from sales or use tax like Color ado does. However, we identified several other states with similar exem ptions that more specifically define the circumstances under which a meal provided to an employee at no cost would be exempt. For example, in Wisconsin , meals must be provided within an employee' s working hours to be exempt. Similarly, some states, such New York, also provide standards for record keeping and reporting tax - exempt meals and other food items. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? Home rule cities established under Article XX of the Colorado Constitution have the authority to set their own tax policies independent from the State and are not required to exempt free or discounted food- service- employer -provided meals from t heir local sales tax. We examined the municipal codes of the five most populated home rule cities in 2010 , accord ing to Colorado State Demography Office data\u2014Aurora, Denver, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, and Lakewood\u2014and found that Colorado Springs, Aurora, and Lakewood exempt meals provided to food- service employees at no charge or at a discount . We did not identify any similar exemptions in Denver or Fort Collins. We did not identify any similar tax expenditures or programs at the state level. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE ? The Department was not able to provide data on the amount of Employer -provided Meals Exemptions claimed or the number of entities that made applicable sales. Therefore, we estimated the revenue impact of the exemption using other sources of data , including information from stakeholders and food- service industry trade groups. As a result, our estimates may vary from the actual revenue impact of 23312 FOOD SERVICE EMPLO YER-PROVIDED MEALS E XEMPTION the exemption, and we could not determine how many taxpayers claimed it. The Department's Retail Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0100) and Retailer's Use Tax Return (Form DR 0173) do not have separate lines where food- service establishments can report exempt sales of discounted meals or free meals furnished to employees. Establishments report the Employer -provided Meals Exemption applied to sales taxes on line 12 of Form DR 0100 for \"Other exempt sales,\" which aggregates several unrelated exemptions and cannot be disaggregated for analysis. Further , they are only expected to report the sales tax exemption made on discounted sales to employees and are not required to report the exemption when it is applied to use tax, so the amount they report is not reflective of all meals provided to employees . If the General Assembly determines that a more accurate figure is necessary, it could direct the Department to add additional reporting lines on its Retail Sales Tax Return and Retailer's Use Tax Return and make changes in GenTax, its tax processing and information system, to capture and extract this additional information. Additionally, taxpayers would need to be required to begin reporting the exemption when applied to use tax. This data would allow us to provide a more accurate and reliable estimate of the revenue impact to the State. However, this requirement could also increase the administrative burden on retail ers utilizing the exemption. Additionally, according to the Department, this type of change would require additional resources to develop the f orm and complete the necessary programming in GenTax (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). 23413 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING ST ATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATU TORY PURPOSE FOR THE EMPLOYER -PROVIDED MEALS EXEMPTION . As discussed, statute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not state the exemption's purpose. Therefore, for the purposes of our evaluation, we considered two potential purposes for the exemption: To relieve the administrative burden on food -service establishments that provide free and/or discounted meals to their employees. Due to the lack of uniformity in how food -service establishments provide free or discounted m eals (e.g., shift meals, family -style meals, discount, punch cards, etc.), it could be burdensome for some restaurants to accurately determine their tax responsibility . To prevent the taxation of a fringe benefit. Providing a meal benefit to food- service employees is a common and often expected practice in the restaurant industry, and is defined as a fringe benefit by federal Internal Revenue Service guidance. We also developed a performance measure to assess the extent to which the exemption is meeting these potential purposes. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify it s intent for the exemption by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure(s) in statute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the exemption's purpose and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the exemption is accomplishing its intended goal(s). T HE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER CLARIFYING WHICH FOOD -SERVICE MEALS QUALIFY FOR THE EXEMPTION . Some of the stakeholders we spoke with expressed uncertainty over the circumstances under which meals qualify for the exemption and which ingredients they had purchased at wholesale and removed from inventory to use for employee meals could be exempt from use tax. 23514 FOOD SERVICE EMPLO YER-PROVIDED MEALS E XEMPTION Specifically, stakeholders were uncertain whether meals provided outside of worki ng hours were exempt (e.g. , employers had sold discounted meals to employees on days off or provided a shift meal after the employee clocked out) and had concerns that they were not exempting the right materials from use tax or that they were estimating their use tax exempt materials incorrectly . Stakeholders felt like this was an issue because they have many employees to whom they provide meals, and mistakes in determining their sales and use tax exemptions could mean either missing out on potential tax savings, or risking non - compliance, which could potentially open their business to an audit and being assessed sales or use taxes by the Department that they did not collect or budget for. Furthermore, the Department does not provide any guidance on the aforementioned concerns that stakeholders could reference. Adding additional language to statute clarifying which meals are exempt and how to determine their tax exempt value may improve stakeholder understanding and use of the exemption. 236EXPENDITURE PREFABRICATED HOMES PARTIAL EXEMPTION MANUFACTURED HOMES EXEMPTION SUBSEQUENT HOME SALES EXEMPTION TAX TYPE Sales and use Sales and use Sales and use YEAR ENACTED 1979 2018 1973 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None None None REVENUE IMPACT $1.4 million (annual average from 2016 to 2020) $5.6 million (Fiscal Year 2020) $252,000 (Fiscal Year 2020) NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine Could not determine Could not determine WHAT DO THESE TAX EX PENDITURE S DO?

SUBSEQUENT HOME SALES EXEMPTION \u2014Treating all subsequent sales of homes the same for salesand use tax purposes since many manufactured homes remain tangible personal property after they are installed at the building site. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENTIFY? The Genera l Assembly may want to consider : Establishing statutory purposes and performance measures for the exemptions. Amending statute to provide a corresponding use tax exemption for the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption. PREFABRICATED HOMES EXEMPTI ONS EVALUATION SUMMARY | APRIL 2021 | 2021-TE8 KEY CONCLUSION : Stakeholders are aware of the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption and Subsequent Home Sales Exemption and indicated that the exemptions are being applied to eligible sales. Additionally, the Manufactured Homes Exemption makes manufactured homes more affordable by reducing the overall cost of purchasing a home. 2372 PREFA BRICATED HOMES EXEMPTION S PREFABRICATED H OMES EXEMPTIONS EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT ARE THE SE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Prefabricated homes are residential structures without motive power that are manufactured in a factory setting and then later transported and installed at the building site. There are two main types of prefabricated homes: MODULAR HOMES are constructed to the same state, local, or regional building codes as traditional s ite-built homes and are transported on trucks, sometimes in multiple sections, to the building site. Modular homes are generally more expensive to purchase than manufactured homes. M ANUFACTURED HOMES are constructed to a federal building code set by the D epartment of Housing and Urban D evelopment (HUD) , which requires that the homes be built on a permanent chassis , bear a certification label (known as a HUD tag), and generally be at least 320 square feet when erected on site. HUD began regulating the construction of manufactured homes on June 15, 1976 ; manufactured homes that were constructed prior to June 15, 1976 , are typically referred to as mobile homes . At the time of their construction and/or transport to the building site, modular and manufactured homes are generally considered tangible personal property a nd are thus , subject to sales or use tax in Colorado. However, statute [Section 39 -26-721, C.R.S.] provides several sales and use tax exemptions related to manufactured and/or modular homes : P REFABRICATED HOMES PARTIAL EXEMPTION [SECTION 39-26-721(1), C.R.S.] \u2014This provision exempts 48 percent of the purchase price of a modular or manufactured home from state sales tax . Statute does 2383 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT not explicitly provide a parallel exemption from use tax; however, because they are exempt from sales tax, it is the Department of Revenue's (Department ) practice to also exempt transactions concerning modular and manufactured homes from use tax in Colorado. Additionally, s tatutory and home rule local governments that have their sales taxes collected by the State are required to apply the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption. This exemption was created in 1979 with House Bill 79 -1451, and it has remained substantively unchanged since its enactment. MANUFACTURED HOMES EXEMPTION [SECTION 39-26-721(3) , C.R.S ]\u2014Beginning July 1, 2019, this provision exempts the sale, storage, usage, or consumption of a manufactured home from s tate sales and use tax. To qualify for th e exemption, the home must be eligible for a certificate of title pursuant to P art 1 of A rticle 29 of Title 38, C.R.S ., and be constructed in compliance with the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Saf ety Standards, which are administered by HUD , and apply to homes built on or after June 15, 1976; homes built prior to this date ar e not eligible for the exemption. Statutory and home rule local governments that have their sales taxes collected by the State may choose to apply the exemption, but must opt in through adoption of a local ordinance. This exemption was created in 2018 with House Bill 18- 1315, and it has remained substantively unchanged since its enactment. S UBSEQUENT HOME SALES EXEMPTION [SECTIONS 39-26-721(1) AND (2), C.R.S. ]\u2014This provision exempt s subsequent sa les of manufactured and modular homes from s tate sales and use tax . This exemption appears to have limited applicability since the Manufactured Homes Exemption went into effect on July 1, 2019. Specifically, sales of manufactured homes constructed on or after June 15, 1976, are exempt from state sales and use tax under the Manufactured Homes Exemption, regardless of whether it is the first or a subsequent sale , and modular homes generally become real property once they are placed at the building site, making their subseque nt sale exempt from sales tax. However, it continues to 2394 PREFA BRICATED HOMES EXEMPTION S apply more broadly to local sales taxes since statutory and home rule local governments that have their sales taxes collected by the S tate are required to apply the exemption. Theref ore, the Subsequent Home Sales E xemption potentially provides an unduplicated exemption for (1) manufactured homes constructed prior to June 15, 1976, (i.e., mobile homes ) and (2) state -collected municipal and county sales ta xes for subsequent sales of manufactured homes in state-collected municipalities and counties that have not adopted the Manufactured Homes Exemption (state -collected municipal and county sales taxes are discussed later in this report; see discussion in performance measure # 2 in the Are the Tax Expenditures Meeting Their Purposes? section ). This exemption was created in 1973 with Senate Bill 73 -365, and it has remained substantively unchanged since its enactment. Retailers report the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption and Manufacture d Homes Exemption on the Other Exempt Sales line (Line 11) of the Schedule B of the Retail Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100). The Subsequent Home Sales Exemption is not required to be reported and is not consistently reported on any Department form, though the Department reported that some taxpayers may report the subsequent sale of a manufactured home on the Standard Sales Tax Receipt for Vehicle Sales form ( Form DR 0024) . WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Statute does not directly state the intended beneficiaries of any of the sales and use tax exemptions for prefabricated homes. Because purchasers of the modular and manufactured homes would pay the sales or use tax, we considered them to be the intended beneficiaries of all of the exemptions . According to the Division of Property Taxation 's (within the Department of Local Affairs) 2019 Annual Report, in Calendar Year 2019, there were more than 87 ,000 manufactured homes located in all 2405 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT counties in the state. EXHIBIT 1 shows the number of manufactured homes in each county throughout the state. EXHIBIT 1 . MAP OF MANUFAC TURED HOMES THROUGHOUT COLORADO BY COUNTY CALENDAR YEAR 2019 SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of manufactured homes data from the Division of Property Taxation's 2019 Annual Report . Additionally, according to data from the Division of Housing within the Depar tment of Local Affairs , in 2020 (through September) , there were 964 manufactured homes certified by HUD and delivered to Colorado. The Division of Housing did not have data on the total number or location of modular homes in Colorado. 2416 PREFA BRICATED HOMES EXEMPTION S WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE SE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Statute and the enacting legi slation for these exemptions do not state their purpose s; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Our evaluation of the tax expenditure s considered th e following potential purposes: PREFABRICATED HOMES PARTIAL EXEMPTION \u2014Based on discussions with Department staff, Department regulations, and the State's process for applying the sales tax to building and construction materials , we considered a potential purpose: to tax only the portion of the p urchase price of a modular or manufactured home that is attributab le to materials, which are tangible personal property and generally subject to sales tax, and to avoid taxing the portion of the purchase price of a modular or manufactured home that is attributable to the labor used to build the home, thereby treating modular and manufactured home sales similarly to traditional site - built homes for sales tax purposes. Building and construction materials are generally subject to sales tax in Colorado because they are tangible personal property. However, these materials typically lose their identity as tangible personal property when they are incorporated or transformed into real property , which is not subject to sales tax. In many instances, these materials are purchased by contractors that build or incorporate the materials into real property, such as a traditional site -built home, which is then sold to another party. To capture the sales tax on those materials before they become real property, the contractor is generally considered the end consumer of the materials and pays sales or use tax on them. When the end product (e.g., a home) is sold, no sales tax is collected because real property is not subject to sales tax . Therefore, no sales tax is applied to the portion of the purchase price that covers the cost of labor used to build the home. In the case of a manufactured or modular home, manufacturers /builders of the homes do not pay sales tax on the materials because of the wholesales exemption [Section 39-26- 102(19)(a) and (20)(a) , C.R.S.] s ince the 2427 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT homes generally remain tangible personal property when they are sold to a home buyer . When the modular or manufactured home is sold to the homebuyer, the purchase price of the home includes some amount that is attributable to labor used to build the home and some amount for the materials. Therefore, to provide similar tax treatment as is provided to purchases of site -built homes, the exemption serves to reduce the amount of the purchase subject to sales tax to account for the portion of the purchase price that is attributable to labor costs. M ANUFACTURED HOMES EXEMPTION \u2014Based on committee hearing testimony from the enacting legislation [House Bill 18- 1315], we considered a potential purpose: to make manufactured homes more affordable by eliminating all of the s tate sales and use tax, which represents an additional cost to homebuyers when purchasing manufactured homes. S UBSEQUENT HOME SALES EXEMPTION \u2014Based on the operation of the exemption and discussions with Department staff , we considered a potential purpose: to treat all subsequent sales of homes the same for sales and use tax purposes. Subsequent sales of traditional site- built and modular homes are not subject to sales or use tax beca use they are real property rather than tangible personal property ; in general, modular homes become real property once they are placed at the building site on a permanent foundation. However, many manufactured homes remain tangible personal property even a fter they are placed at the building site, particularly those home s that are placed in manufactured home parks or communities. T herefore, in cases in which a manufactured home remains tangible personal property, without the Subsequent Home Sales Exemption, the subsequent sale of the home could be subject to sales tax, which would create unequal tax treatment for subsequent sales of different types of homes . 2438 PREFA BRICATED HOMES EXEMPTION S ARE THE TAX EXPENDITURE S MEETING THEIR PURPOSE S AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? We could not definitively determine whether these exemptions are meeting their purpose s becau se no purpose is provided for them in statute or their enacting legislation. However, we found that they are likely meeting the potential purposes we considered in order to conduct this evaluation. Specifically, the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption and Subsequent Home Sales Exemptions are likely meeting their inferred purposes because stakeholders are aware of them and indicated that, to their knowledge, the exemptions are being applied to eligible sales. Additionally, we found that the Manufactured Homes Exemption is meeting its inferred purpose , to some extent , because it makes manufactured homes more affordable by reducing the overall cost of purchasing a home . Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for any of the exemptions . Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measures to determine the extent to which the exemptions are meeting their inferred purposes: P ERFORMANCE MEASURE #1: To what extent is the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption being used to prevent the taxation of labor that was used to build prefabricated homes ? RESULT : The Department was unable to provide us with data on the number of homes sold to which this exemption would apply, and therefore, we were unable to quantify the extent to which this exemption is being used. However, we spoke with stakeholders, including a trade organization for modular and manufactured homes, three modular and manufactured home dealers, and one modular and manufactured home manufacturer , and they were all aware of the exemption and said they apply it when making eligible sales. 2449 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Additionally, we asked stakeholders about the costs of building modular and manufactured homes to try to determine whether the 48 percent amount provided by the exemption accurately exempts the portion of a home attributable to labor. A manufacturer that we spoke with estimated the labor cost for both manufactured and modular homes to be about 45 to 50 percent of the total cost of building a home. One modular and manufactured home dealer we spoke with estimated the labor cost s for manufactured homes to be about 50 percent of the total cost an d 40 percent for modular homes. However, neither of these stakeholders conducted a thorough cost analysis and provided this information to us only as an estima te. These estimates are all close to the exemption amount provided by the Prefabricated Homes Par tial Exemption (48 percent), and i t is reasonable to expect that the ratio of material costs versus labor costs will vary among manufacturers, home floor plans/size, and over time , as material and labor costs fluctuate with the market. P ERFORMANCE MEASURE #2: To what extent does the Manufactured Homes Exemption make manufactured homes more affordable? R ESULT : The Manufactured Homes Exemption reduces the after -tax purchase price of a qualifying home by 2.9 percent and can also reduce the cost of fi nancing the purchase. To calculate the potential savings from the Manufactured Homes Exemption, we considered a hypothetical scenario in which a homebuyer purchases a manufactured home for $98 ,400, which was the average price of a manufactured home in Colorado in 2019 , according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Purchasing a home at this price would result in a direct savings of about $2,900 in s tate sales tax due to the exemption ($9 8,400 x 2.9 percent) when not considering the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exempt ion, which exempts 48 percent of the purchase price from sales tax. When taking th is exemption into account, the direct savings would be about $1,500 in state sales tax ($98,400 x 52 percent x 2.9 percent) . According to stakeholders, m any manufactured homes are placed into manufactured home parks or communities where the homebuyer owns 24510 PREFA BRICATED HOMES EXEMPTION S the home , but rents the land on which the home is placed. Because the home is not financed with the purchase of land, the home is generally financed as a ch attel loan, which is a type of personal property loan that is similar to a loan used to purchase an automobile. Chattel loans generally have higher interest rates and shorter repayment terms than conventional home mortgages that are available for other types of home purchases. Assuming the homebuyer in the previous example financed the home using a chattel loan with an annual interest rate of 6 percent, had a 20 -year repayment term, and provided a 20 percent down payment, we estimated that over the life of the loan, the homebuyer would save about $1, 700 in total interest because of the exemption from state sales taxes, since any sales tax included in the loan as principal would incur interest , when not taking into consideration the Prefabricated Homes Partia l Exemption . The interest savings when considering the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption would be about $900. These loan terms were based on information provided to us by a lender that offers chattel loans on manufactured homes in Colorado. However, the actual terms of a loan are dependent on the credit score of the homebuyer and the amount of down payment they are able to provide. In this example, the homebuyer would save about $1 6 a month, or about $19 8 per year, in principal and interest on the amount financed with the exemption in place as compared to the exemption not being in place when not taking into consideration the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption. Considering this exemption, the homebuyer would save about $9 a month or $103 per year. Thi s scenario does not consider any local sales taxes. Additionally, s tatute [Section 29 -2-105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.] requires that statutory and home rule municipalities and counties that have their sales taxes collected by the State apply most of the State's s ales tax exemptions, but also provides that some of the State's sales tax exemptions are optional, including the Manufactured Homes Exemption under Section 39-26-721(3), C.R.S. Therefore, i f the municipality or county wants to allow the Manufactured Homes Exemption for local sales tax purposes, it must explicitly adopt it. As of February 2021, of all of the municipalities or counties with state - 24611 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT collected local sales taxes , only Ca \u00f1on City had adopted the Manufactured Homes Exemption. Therefore, the exemption does not apply to most local sales taxes and homebuyers are liable for these taxes. PERFORMANCE MEASURE #3: To what extent does the Subsequent Home Sales Exemption prevent the taxation of prefabricated homes that are resold? R ESULT : We found evidence that the exemption is being applied to eligible sales, though we were unable to quantify the extent to which this exemption is being used because the Department was unable to provide us with data on the number of qualifying homes sol d. However, we spoke with several modular and manufactured home dealers, and those that sell used homes stated that they were aware of this exemption and apply it when making eligible sales. Additionally, we spoke with several realtors that sell modular and manufactured homes, and they were all aware of it and believe it is being applied to applicable sales. This exemption appears to have limited applicability due to the Manufactured Homes Exemption, which provides an overlapping exemption for many elig ible sales and went into effect on July 1, 2019. Specifically, t he Subsequent Home Sales Exemption potentially provides an unduplicated exemption from (1) municipal and county sales taxes for subsequent sales of all manufactured homes in jurisdictions tha t have their sales taxes collected by the State, which are not required to apply the Manufactured Homes Exemption, but must apply the Subsequent Sales Exemption, and (2) s tate and state-collected municipal and county sales tax es for subsequent sales of manufactured homes that were constructed prior to June 15, 1976 (i.e., mobile homes) , which are not exempt under the Manufactured Homes Exemption [ Section 39- 26- 721(3), C.R.S. ]. Manufactured homes are generally required to be titled with the Department's Division of Motor Vehicles. The Department was able to provide us with data on the number of manufactured homes titled and the model year of the homes titled. The data indicate that a significant number of homes titled in Fiscal Year 2020 were pre- 1976 24712 PREFA BRICATED HOMES EXEMPTION S manufactured homes. Specifically, 1,460 of the approximately 5,000 manufactured homes (29 percent) titled during Fiscal Year 2020 were pre-1976 manufactured homes , though the data did not include information on whether the exemption was applied. WHAT ARE TH E ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? The Department was not able to provide us with data on the amount claimed f or any of the Prefabricated Homes Exemptions . Therefore, we estimated the revenue impact of these exemptions using other sources of data, i ncluding Department of Local Affairs , Division of Housing data on the number of modular home installation inspections conducted in the state ; Institute of Building and Safety data provided to us by the Division of Housing on new manufactured homes shipped into the state ; U.S. Census Bureau data on manufactured home prices ; Division of Motor Vehicles data on manufactured homes titled in the state ; and information provided to us by stakeholders . P REFABRICATED HOMES PARTIAL EXEMPTION \u2014We es timate that the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption resulted in about $1.4 million in annual foregone revenue to the State between 2016 and 2020. This exemption primarily applies to modular homes since manufactured homes are fully exempt from state sales and use tax under the Manufactured H omes Exemption. For this reason, o ur estimate for the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption only includes the revenue impact attributable to sales of modular homes. To calcu late this estimate, we used information from the Division of Housing that showed the S tate inspected 297 modular homes for installation in Colorado since late 2016. Division of Ho using staff with experience in the industry estimated that its s tate inspectors inspect about 15 percent of all modular homes installed in the state, with other partners (e.g., local building departments, registered independent inspectors) inspecting the remaining 85 percent , though the Division does not maintain data on this. Based on that information , we estimated 24813 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT that there were likely around 1,980 modular homes installed in the state between late 2016 and late 2020. Prices of modular homes can vary substantially depending on the size of the home and the quality of the materials used in the home. For purposes of our e stimate, we used an average price of $200,000 per modular home, which we determined is a typical cost for a modular home based on discussions with stakeholders , as well as publicly available price information from modular home dealers' websites. We multiplied the estimated number of modular homes installed in Colorado since late 2016 (1,980) by the average price ($200,000) to estimate that the total sales price of all modular homes installed in the state since late 2016 was $396 million. We then multiplied that amount by the exemption allowed (48 percent of the purchase pr ice) to estimate that the total purchase price exempted on all modular homes was $190.1 million . We multiplied that total by the 2.9 percent s tate sales tax rate and then divided that amount by 4 years to estimate an annual revenue impact. M ANUFACTURED HOMES EXEMPTION \u2014We estimate that the Manufactured Homes Exemption resulted in about $ 5.6 million in foregone revenue to the State in Fiscal Year 2020 , with $3.4 million attributable to sales of new manufactured homes and $2.2 million attributable to subsequent sales of preowned manufactured homes . This estimate includes sales of new manufactured homes , as well as subsequent sales of preowned manufactured homes, since the exemption covers the sale of a manufactured home regardless of whether it is the first or a subsequent sale of the home. To estimate the revenue impact , we estimated the total potential sales of new manufactured homes in the state using Institute of Building and Safety data provided to us by the Division of Housing on manufactured homes shipped into Colorado and the average sales price of manufactured homes in Colorado as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. Specifically, we multiplied the 1,197 new manufactured homes shipped into Colorado from July 2019 to June 2020 by the $98,400 average sales price of a new manufactured home in 2019 (2020 data on the average sales price was not available) to estimate the total potential 24914 PREFA BRICATED HOMES EXEMPTION S sales. We then multiplied the $117.8 million in total p otential sales by the 2.9 percent s tate sales tax rate to arrive at our estimate of $3.4 million . Since our estimate relies on data for homes shipped into the state rather than homes sold in the state \u2014to the extent that the hom es shipped into the state wer e not immediately sold \u2014our estimate could vary from the actual revenue impact. However, a stakeholder reported that it is reasonable to assume that homes shipped into the state have already been sold or will soon be sold after they are shipped into the state, since sellers do not typically maintain large inventories of unsold manufactured homes in the state . We then estimated the revenue impact of preowned manufactured homes that were sold in the state in Fiscal Year 2020 based on Division of Motor Veh icles data on manufactured homes titled in Fiscal Year 2020, with model years between 1976 and 2017; we assumed homes in the data with model years 2017 and older were preowned homes and not sales of new homes. We calculated our estimate of $2.2 million by multiplying the $74 .1 million total reported purchase price from Department title data for all titled homes in Fiscal Year 2020 by the 2.9 percent state sales tax rate. However, our estimate could underestimate the actual revenue impact because about 1,500 of the approximately 3,500 homes titled (43 percent) did not have purchase price data . Because homes may be included in the titling data because of events other than a sale (e.g. , transfer of ownership due to inheritance) it is likely that the exemption would not have applied to some of these homes , though we were unable to quantify the extent to which this was the case. Additionally, in estimating the revenue impact of the Manufactured Homes Exemption, we did not consider the effects of the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption, or the Subsequent Home Sales Exemption, which both overlap with sales eligible for the Manufactured Homes Exemption and would be available to taxpayers in the absence of the Manufactured Homes Exemption. 25015 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT SUBSEQUENT HOME SALES EXEMPTION \u2014Based on Division of Motor Vehicles data on manufactured homes titled in Fiscal Year 2020, we estimate that the Subsequent Home Sales Exemption may have reduced state revenue by approximately $252,000 in Fiscal Year 2020. This estimate is limited to manufactured homes with model years before 1976 because h omes constructed after that date are covered under the Manufactured Homes Exe mption and included in our estimate for its revenue impact . To e stimate the revenue impact for the Subsequent Home Sales Exemption , we multiplied the $8.7 million in total sales of titled homes with model year dates before 1976 by the 2.9 percent s tate sales tax rate. However, similar to the Manufactured Homes Exemption, this could underestimate the actual revenue impact because 780 of the 1460 pre -1976 homes (53 percent) titled did not have purchase price data, though some of this title data may not repres ent sales of homes . STATE -COLLECTED LOCAL SALES TAXES\u2014Additionally, statute [Section 29-2- 105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.] requires that statutory and home rule municipalities and counties that have their sales taxes collected by the state apply most of the State's sales tax exemptions, including the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption and Subsequent Home Sales Exemption. Therefore, both of these exemptions likely reduce local sales tax revenue to some extent. However, w e lacked the data necessary to estimate this impact. In addition, the Manufactured Home Exemption, which only applies to state -collected local governments that opt in to the exemption, has likely had little to no revenue impact to local governments statewide , because as of February 2021, only Ca\u00f1on City had adopted the exemption. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE S HAVE ON BENEFICIARI ES? If the Prefabri cated Homes Exemptions were repealed, it would result in homebuyers paying sales tax on purchases of new modular and manufactured homes and purchases of preowned manufactured homes. Specifically: 25116 PREFA BRICATED HOMES EXEMPTION S PREFABRICATED HOMES PARTIAL EXEMPTION \u2014Repealing this exemption could result in homebuyers who purchase modular homes paying an additional 48 percent of sales tax on those homes. On average , between late 2016 and 2020, we estimated that this could have increased state sales taxes on new modular homes by about $1.4 million in each year , with hom ebuyers paying additional local sales taxes within local jurisdictions for which the State collects sales tax. Additionally, stakeholders reported that this exemption is very important because it creates parity between the prefabricatedhousing and the traditiona l site -built home industries , since sales taxes are generally only applied to the cost of ma terials used in the construction of site -built homes, with the additional cost of labor not being subject to tax. MANUFACTURED HOMES EXEMPTION \u2014Repealing this exemption would result in homebuyers who purchase manufactured homespaying sales tax on the purchase of the homes. In Fiscal Year 2020,we estimated that this could have increased sales taxes on newmanufactured homes by about $3.4 million and by about $2. 2 million on subsequent sales of preowned manufactured homes,though if the Subsequent Home Sales Exemption was maintained,subsequent sales of the homes would continue to be exempt underthat exemption instead. Likewise, if the Manufactured HomesExemption were repealed and the Prefabricated Homes PartialExemption was maintained, homebuyers would pay sales tax on52 percent of the purchase price of a new home, which would have been an increase of $1.8 million in Fiscal Year 2020. Additionally , if the home s were financed, taxpayers would owe interest on the sales tax that is included in their loan. Most stakeholders that weconsulted reported that this exemption is very important and helpspotential homebuyers, particularly low income Coloradans,purchase manufactured homes. SUBSEQUENT HOME SALES EXEMPTION \u2014Repealing this exemption could result in some preowned manufactured homes being subject to 25217 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT state sales tax and local sales taxes in municipalities and counties with state -collected sales taxes, particularly those homes that are placed into manufactured home parks and generally remain tangible personal property . In Fiscal Year 2020, we estimated that this could have increased sales taxes on pre- 1976 preowned manufactured homes by about $252,000. Repealing this exemption would be unlikely to affect sales of preowned modular homes because modular homes generally become real property once they are installed at the building site. Repealing the Subsequent Home Sales Exemption would result in preowned manufactured homes being treated differently from modular and traditional site -built homes for sales tax purposes. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES ? We examined the state tax laws of the seven states surrounding Colorado (Arizona, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming) to determine whether they have similar exemptions for prefabricated homes. Five of these states (Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming) partially exempt new homes or first -time sales of prefabricated homes from sales tax. The exemptions provided in these states are summarized in E XHIBIT 2. EXHIBIT 2. SURROUNDING STATES WITH A SIMILAR EXEMP TION STATE EXEMPTION DETAILS Arizona 35 percent of the gross proceeds derived from selling manufactured, mobile, and modular homes is exempt from the transaction privilege tax, which is similar to a sales tax . Kansas 40 percent of the gross proceeds derived from selling manufactured, mobile, or modular homes is exempt from sales tax. Oklahoma 45 percent of the sales price of a modular home is exempt from sales tax; new manufactured homes are exempt from sales tax and are instead subject to vehicle excise tax on 50 percent of the retail selling price . Utah 45 percent of the sales price of a manufactured home is exempt from sales tax ; modular homes are fully taxable . Wyoming 30 percent of the sales price of a manufactured, mobile, or modular home is exempt from sales tax . SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of other states' statutes and regulations . 25318 PREFA BRICATED HOMES EXEMPTION S Most of the surrounding states provide exemptions for subsequent sales and/or sales of used manufactured and modular homes. However, in Oklahoma, used manufactured homes are exempt from sales tax, but are subject to vehicle excise tax on 32.5 percent of the retail selling price. Additionally, in Nebraska, sales of new and used manufactured and modular homes delivered into the state are subject to sales tax. ARE THERE TAX EXPEND ITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE IN T HE STATE? Home rule cities established under Article XX of the Colorado Constitution have the authority to set their own tax policies independent from the State and are not required to exempt sales of modular or manufactured homes from their local sales tax. We examined the municipal codes of the five most populated home rule cities in 2010 , according to Colorado State Demography Office data \u2014 Aurora, Denver, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, and Lakewood\u2014and found that Aurora, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, and Lakewood exempt subsequent sales of modular and manufactured homes from their local sales tax ; Aurora and Lakewood exempt 48 percent of the purchase price of new modular and manufactured homes; and Fort Collins exempts 50 percent of the purchase price of new modular and manufactured homes. Denver fully taxes sales of new prefabricated homes , as well as subsequent sales of manufactured homes. We did not identify any similar tax expenditures or programs at the state level other than the overlapping of the exemptions included in this evaluation. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE S? The Department was not able to provide data on the amount of exemptions claimed related to prefabricated homes . Therefore, we estimate d the revenue impact of the exemption s using other sources of data, including Division of Housing information on modular home installation inspections ; U.S. Census Bureau data on manufactured 25419 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT home prices ; Institute of Building and Safety data provided to us by the Division of Housing on shipments of manufactured homes into the state; Division of Motor Vehicles data on manufactured homes titled in the state ; and information from stakeholders . As a result, our estimate s may vary from the actual revenue impact of the exemptions , and we could not determine how many taxpayers claimed them . The Department's Retail Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100) does not have separate lines where retailers can report partially exempt sales of modular homes and fully exempt sales of manufactured homes. Retailers report the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption and Manufactured Homes Exemption on the Other Exempt Sales line (Line 11) of the Schedule B of the Retail Sales Tax Return, which aggregates several unrelated exemptions and cannot be disaggregated for analysis. Additionally, according to Department staff, the Subsequent Home Sales Exemption is not consistently reported on any Department forms, though the Department reported that some taxpayers may report the subsequent sale of a home on the Standard Sales Tax Receipt f or Vehicle Sales form ( Form DR 0024); however, this form is designed for sales of motor vehicles rather than manufactured homes. If the General Assembly determines that more accurate figures are necessary, it could direct the Department to add additional reporting lines on i ts Retail Sales Tax Return and make changes in GenTax, its tax processing and information system, to capture and extract this additional information. However, this would incre ase retailers' reporting requirements and, according to the Department, this type of change would require additional resources to develop the form and complete the necessary programming in GenTax (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). 25520 PREFA BRICATED HOMES EXEMPTION S WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING ST ATUTE TO ESTABLISH STATUTO RY PURPOSES AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE PREFABRICATED HOMES EXEMPTIONS . As discussed, statute and the enacting legislation for the Prefabricated Homes Exemptions do not state the exemptions' purposes or provide performance measures for evaluating their effectiveness. Therefore, for the purposes of our evaluation, we considered the following potential purposes for the exemptions: PREFABRICATED HOMES PARTIAL EXEMPTION \u2014We considered its potential purpose to be only taxing the portion of the purchase price of a modular or manufactured home that is attributable to materials, thereby treating modular and manufactured home sales similarly to traditional site -built homes for sales tax purposes. We identified this purpose based on the operation of the exemption, our review of the process used to tax the construction of site -built homes, and discussions with Department staff and stakeholders. M ANUFACTURED HOMES EXEMPTION \u2014We considered its potential purpose to be making manufactured homes more affordable by eliminating all of the s tate sales and use tax, which represents an additional cost to homebuyers when purchasing manufactured homes. We identified this purpose based on our review of its legislative history, including the legislative committee discussions on the enacting legislation for the Manufactured Homes Exemption [House Bill 18 -1315] . S UBSEQUENT HOME SALES EXEMPTION \u2014We considered its potential purpose to be treating all subsequent sales of all types of homes the same for sales and use tax purposes since many manufactured homes remain tangible personal property after they are placed at the building site , whereas preowned modular and traditional site -built homes become real property not subject to sales tax. We identified 25621 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT this purpose based on discussions with Department staff who indicated that the purposes of the Subsequent Home Sales Exemption is to treat modular and manufactured homes similar to traditional site-built homes. We also developed three performance measure s to assess the extent to which the exemptions are meeting their potential purpose s. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the exemptions by providing purpose statement s and corresponding performance measure(s) in statute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the exemptions' purpose s and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the exemptions are accomplishing their intended goal (s). T HE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO INCLUDE A CORRESPONDING USE TAX EXEMPTION FOR T HE PREFABRICATED HOMES PARTIAL EXEMPTION . Statute [Section 39 -26- 721(1), C.R.S.] currently provides only a sales tax exemption for the Prefabricated Homes Partial Exemption. Therefore, it is not clear that purchasers of qualifying prefabricated homes are exempt from use tax. It appears that the General Assembly may not have intended that use tax apply to this circumstance because this would effective ly nullify the tax benefit provided by the sales tax exemption. In practice, Department of Revenue staff indicated that the Department has not enforced use tax under this circumstance due to general principles of taxation and Colorado Supreme Court c ases that provide that use tax is a complement to sales tax and should not be viewed in isolation. However, the General Assembly m ay want to amend statute to clarify whether purchases of prefabricated homes should be exempt from both sales and use tax. 257 258FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORFARM CLOSE -OUT SALES TAX EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY SEPTEMBER 2018 2018-TE3 THIS EVALUATION IS INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2018 YEAR ENACTED 1945 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT Could not determine NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine AVERAGE T AXPAYER BENEFIT Could not determine IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? Yes, but with variable impact based on local taxes WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? Sales of property used for farming or ranching by Colorado agricultural producers who are abandoning operations and holding a farm close -out sale, either by auction or private sale, are not subject to state sales tax and some local sales taxes under this exemption. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? The exemp tion appears to be meeting its purpose, primarily because it eliminates the local sales taxes that would otherwise apply to farm close -out sales in many local jurisdictions, although this impact varies widely depending on local tax policies. The exemption has a limited impact on state sales tax liability for most buyers because most of the transactions at farm close -out sales are now exempt from state sales tax under other tax provisions enacted since the Farm Close - Out Sales Tax Exemption was created. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF T HIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption. Based on statutory language, we inferred that the purpose was to encourage the purchase and transfer of used agricultural equipment and supplies from agricultural producers who are abandoning operations to new and ongoing agricultural producers by reducing the cost to buyers. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? The General Assembly may wish to review this expenditure's exemption of on- road motor vehicles sold at farm close -out sales from sales tax, because this appears inconsistent with other tax expenditures that are intended to reduce the sales tax liability of farmers and ranchers. 2591 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT FARM CLOSE -OUT SALES TAX EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? The Farm Close -Out Sa les Tax Exemption [Section 39- 26-716(4)(a), C.R.S.] was enacted in 1945 and exempts from sales tax all purchases made at \"farm close -out sales,\" which are sales of an outgoing farmer's or rancher's tangible personal property, including equipment, vehicles, and other physical property, that is used to carry out agricultural operati ons [Section 39 -26-102(4), C.R.S.]. The exemption applies to state sales and use tax and local sales and use taxes for localgovernments , such as cities and counties, for which the state collects sales tax . Home-rule jurisdiction s established under Article XX, Section 6 of the Colorado Constitution that collect their own sales taxes have the authority to enact their own tax policies and are not required toprovide the exemption. To qualify for the exemption, the farmer orrancher must be attempting to dispose of all property used in theiragricultural operation, which could include tractors, combines, grainhandling equipment, sprayers, motor vehicles, or livestock, andabandoning the operation. Farmers and ranchers may retain their realand tangible nonagricultural property, such as their home and personalproperty, and still have the sale qualify for the exemption. Farm close - out sales can be made through auctions, estate sales or, beginning in1964, private sales between farmers or ranchers and buyers. The Farm Close -Out S ales Tax Exemption is typically applied at the point of sale and provides an exemption from the general requirement that sellers of tangible personal property collect and remit state sales tax from buyers. In most cases, sellers holding a farm close -out sale, which are typically the farmers or ranchers who own the property or auction firms that they hire to conduct the sale, are required to obtain a sales tax license and report the value of exempt sales to the Department of 2602 FARM CLOSE -OUT SALES TAX EXEMPTION Revenue using its Retail Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0100). The amount sellers report on this form is aggregated with several other sales tax exemptions and sellers are not required to report how much is attributable to this specific exemption. Outgoing farmers and ranchers privately disposing of agricultural items worth $1,000 or less in a given year are not required to obtain a sales tax license, but must still report state sales and use tax on Department of Revenue tax form DR 0 100A. This form, which is used to report and remit state sales and use tax from occasional sales of $1,000 or less each year, also does not require the seller to specifically report the amount applied to the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not ex plicitly identify the intended beneficiaries of this exemption. Based on the statutory language, we infer that the intended beneficiaries of this exemption are farmers and ranchers who are abandoning their agricultural operations, and purchasers \u2014primarily other farmers and ranchers\u2014of ta ngible personal property from farm close- out sales. We could not identify statistics regarding the number and size of farm close -out sales that occur in the State. However, agricultural industry representatives and respondents to our survey of farmers and ranchers indicated that farm close -out sales are common within the agricultural industry , and the auction firms we spoke with reported that their practice is to apply the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption when they hold farm close -out auctions. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute does not expl icitly state the purpose of this exemption. Based on the statutory language and its historical context, we inferred that the purpose was to encourage the sale and transfer of used agricultural equipment and supplies from farms and ranches that were closing to those with new and ongoing agricultural operations by reducing the cost to buyers purchasing such equipment and supplies. At the time of the 2613 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT exemption's enactment in 1945, which was during the final months of World War II, the supply of new farm machinery could not keep up with the large demand for U.S. agricultural products from domestic and international buyers. Farm close -out auctions were likely an affordable means for farmers and ra nchers to procure such equipment from those leaving the sector. Therefore, the General Assembly may have intended the expenditure to encourage these sales by reducing the after -tax cost of the equipment. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURE S WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? We determined tha t the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption is meeting its purpose, although its impact is primarily limited to taxing jurisdictions that apply a sales tax on farm equipment. Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this expenditure. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemption is meeting its inferred purpose: PERFORMANCE MEASURE : Does the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption reduce the cost of purchasing agricultural equipment and supplies through farm close- out sales? RESULT : The Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption likely provides a cost-savings to some farmers and ranchers who purchase agricultural equipment and supplies at farm close -out sales. However, most of the potential cost savings are due to a reduction in local, as opposed to state, sales and use taxes and the cost savings vary considerably based on the interplay between the applicable state and local tax provisions. Most of the potentia l cost savings from the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption do not come from a reduction in state sales taxes because most purchases of equipment and supplies at farm close -out sales that 2624 FARM CLOSE -OUT SALES TAX EXEMPTION are to be used for agricultural purposes are also exempt from state sales tax under other state tax expenditure provisions. Specifically, Sections 39-26- 102(19) and 716, C.R.S., provide broader exemptions from sales and use tax for purchases of most farm equipment and supplies,regardless of whether they occur at a farm close- out sale, at retail, or between individuals outside of a farm close -out sale. W ith the exception of sales tax exemptions for the sale of livestock, feed, seed, and orchardtrees that were enacted along with the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption, these broader exemptions did not exist in 1945, when theFarm Close -Out Sales Tax Exempt ion was created. However, with the establishment of these broader sales tax exemptions for agriculturalpurchases, the impact of the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption, as it relates to the state sales tax paid by farmers and ranchers, has beensignificant ly reduced. Instead, the unduplicated state sales tax cost savings provided by the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption is mainly limited to purchasers who do not intend to use the items for anagricultural purpose under Section 39- 26-716, C.R.S., and purcha sers of on- road motor vehicles, because such purchases do not fall under the other agricultural exemptions and would otherwise be taxed. Despite its li mited impact on farm close -out buyers' state sales tax costs, the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption ma y provide a significant cost savings in some local taxing jurisdictions. This is because under Section 29-2- 105(1)(d), C.R.S., although the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption applies to the calculation of local sales taxes in all local jurisdictions for wh ich the state collects sales taxes, the broader exemption for sales of farm equipment under Section 39- 26-716, C.R.S., only applies to the local sales tax in these jurisdictions if they have specifically ratified a local provision to exempt farm equipment. Therefore, in state -collected jurisdictions that do not exempt farm equipment from sales and use tax, the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption continues to provide a significant cost savings on purchases of such equipment. Based on our review of tax rate information published by the Department of Revenue, only 19 of the S tate's 64 counties have enacted the farm equipment sales tax exemption. An additional 10 counties do not have 2635 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT any sales tax and two more are home -rule counties that are not administered by the State, leaving 33 counties where the Farm Close- Out Sales Tax Exemption provides an unduplicated cost savings on purchases of farm equipment. Similarly, 8 municipalities and 19 special districts that have their sales taxes collected by the State have farm equipment exemptions in place, leaving 1 43 municipalities and 12 special districts where the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption would provide an additional cost savings. These jurisdictions are distributed across the state and include many locations w ith significant agricultural economies. Based on our review of local sales tax rates, the population- weighted, average combined local tax rate in Colorado is 1. 8 percent, excluding self-collected home -rule jurisdictions. Therefore, for some large purchases that would otherwise be taxed at the local level, the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption can provide a significant benefit to buyers. This benefit can vary widely based on the local tax rates, which can be as high as 7.5 percent or as low as 0. 25 percent for the relevant locations. Overall, these tax benefits could provide a strong enough incentive to encourage some farmers and ranchers to participate in farm close- out sales, especially if they plan to purchase more expensive equipment. For example, a farmer purchasing a $50,000 used tractor at a farm close -out sale would save $900, based on the 1.8 percent average population- weighted local tax rate for state -collected local governments . It is also impor tant to note that neither the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption, nor any other exemption that may apply to a purchase at a farm close -out sale, necessarily applies to the local sales tax in home - rule taxing jurisdictions established under Article XX, Section 6 of the Colorado Constitution that collect their own sales taxes. These 71 jurisdictions, which include all of the State's most- populated cities , set their own sales tax ordinances independent of state control. While some exempt purcha ses at farm close -out sales from sales tax, such provisions operate outside of the State's authority. 2646 FARM CLOSE -OUT SALES TAX EXEMPTION WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The Farm Clos e-Out S ales Tax Exemption has a relatively small impact on state revenu e because most of the transactions that occur through farm close -out sales would likely be exempt from state sales tax because of other sales tax exemptions. However, the exemption likely results in some lost state revenue, in particular for motor vehicles and items that are sold to buyers who intend to use the items for a non- agricultural purpose. In addition, the exemption probably reduces the revenue of state-collected local taxing jurisdictions that do not otherwise exempt sales of farm equipment from s ales taxes. This local impact is likely greatest in jurisdictions where agricultural operations make up a substantial part of the local economy. Further more , the exemption likely provides a financial benefit to buyers, in particular those making purchase s in local taxing jurisdictions that would otherwise levy a sales tax on the purchase, those who purchase motor vehicles, and those who do not intend to use the items purchased for an agricultural purpose. Overall, this financial benefit may increase interest and participation in farm close -out sales from these buyers, which would help sellers conducting farm close -out sales to find buyers and ease the process of winding down their agricultural operations. As discussed further below, we could not identify a reliable data source to quantify the sales volume and number of farm close -out sales that occur in Colorado, the types of items sold, or the buyers' intended use (i.e., agricultural vs. non-agricultural). Therefore, we were not able to quantify the potent ial economic costs and benefits. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Eliminating the F arm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption would increase taxes for some buyers at farm close- out sales. It appears that buyers in certain local taxing jurisdictions that do not exempt farm equipment sales from tax, non -agricultural buyers, and motor vehicle buyers would 2657 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT pay most of this additional tax, since the purchases of most agricultural buyers would otherwise already be exempt under other sales tax exemptions. Eliminating the exemption might also have a modest financial impact on farmers and ranchers who are closing out their operations, since the additional tax on buyers could reduce the number of participants at auctions or decrease the price buyers at private sales are willing to pay. Eliminating the exemption would also change the administrative requirements for sellers. For example, auctioneers facilitating close -out sales would no longer need to verify and collect written declarations from outgoing farmers and ranchers that the items they sell were previously used as part of an agricultural operation and are therefore, exempt under the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption. On the other hand, sellers, including both auctioneers and farmers and ranchers making private sales, would need to verify that buyers intend to use the items purchased for an agricultural purpose in order to apply other available state sales tax exemptions. Further, some f armers and ranchers may face the additional requirement to obtain sales tax licenses if some items they sell at the farm close- out sale become taxable (e.g., equipment that will not be used for agriculture). However, it is unclear how much of an additional burden this would create since some farmers and ranchers conducting farm close -out sales already fall under this requirement if they sell some items as part of the sale that do not qualify for the exemption, such as personal property that was not used for their agricultural operation. ARE THERE SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? Of the 44 other states and the District of Columbia that impose a sales tax, we identified five states that have a tax expenditure similar to the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption. These other states' expenditures are listed in E XHIBIT 1.1, along with comparisons to Colorado's exemption. 2668 FARM CLOSE -OUT SALES TAX EXEMPTION EXHIBIT 1.1. COMPARI SON OF COLORADO'S FA RM CLOSE -OUT SALES TAX EXEMPTION AND OTHER STATES' SI MILAR EXEMPTIONS STATE TYPE OF SALES TAX EXPENDITURE PRIVATE SALES COVERED ?

One reason that mos t other states do not have a farm close -out sales tax exemption is that other, broader exemptions for occasional or isolated sales like ly cover the same transactions in those states, making such an exemption unnecessary. Specifically, 4 2 states and the District of Columbia exempt occasional sales and purchases from sales tax, which typically includes nonrecurring and infrequent sales of tangible personal property by an individual who is not in the business of selling that type of property. Many of the items sold through a farm close -out sale would likely fall under this type of exemption. However, Colorado does not 2679 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT have a similar exemption for occasional sales, though, as mentioned above, it does not require a sales tax license for seller s that make occasional sales of $1,000 or less per year. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROG RAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPO SE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? There are several ot her state tax expenditures that potentially exempt property sold through a farm close -out sale from sales tax. Unlike the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption, these expenditures require the purchaser to be engaged in an agricultural business and to use the property purchased for an agricultural purpose. Together, these expenditures exempt much of the equipment and supplies purchased by farmers and ranchers and likely overlap with most of the items sold at farm close -out sales. Specifically , the following sales tax exemptions could apply to property sold at a farm close -out sale: LIVESTOCK EXEMPTION [Section 39- 26-716(4)(a), C.R.S .]. Established in 1943, this exempts most sales of livestock from state sales tax. The exemption includes most animals raised forcommercial purposes, other than those being raised to be sold as pets. FEED FOR LIVESTOCK , SEEDS, AND ORCHARD TREES EXEMPTION [Section 39- 26-716(4 )(b), C.R.S .]. Established in 1945, along with the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption, this exempts sales of feed, seeds, and orchard trees used for agricultural purposes. STRAW FOR LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY BEDDING EXEMPTION [Section 39-26-716(4)(c), C.R.S .]. Established in 1961, this exempts agricultural purchases of straw used for animal bedding. FARM AND DAIRY EQUIPMENT AND PARTS EXEMPTION [Sections 39- 26-716(2)(b) and (3)(b), C.R.S .]. Established in 1999 and expanded in 2001, this exempts most purchases of equipment used for agricultural p urposes from sales tax. However, it does not apply to 26810 FARM CLOSE -OUT SALES TAX EXEMPTION on-road motor vehicles which must be registered in the state, regardless of whether they are used for an agricultural purpose. WHOLESALE ADJUVANTS , SEMEN FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES , AGRICULTURAL COMPO UNDS, AND PESTICIDES EXEMPTION [Section 39-26-102(19)(c) and (d), C.R.S.]. Originally, e stablished in 1999 and expanded in 2012, this includes the sale of adjuvants, semen, agricultural compounds, and pesticides within the definition of wholesale sales, whic h are exempt from sales tax. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE ? The Department o f Revenue does not track farm close -out sales revenue, the amount of Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption claimed, or the taxpayers who claim it, and we could not identify any other reliable source to obtain this information. Specifically, the Department of Revenue's Retail Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0 100) does not contain a specific line for the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption and taxpayers must lump this expenditure's total into a line that includes all exemptions not specifically listed on the form . Since this line can encompass several different exemptions, the Department of Revenue does not capture this data point in GenTax, its tax processing and information system . If the General Assembly wants to know how many taxpayers claim the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption and how much they claim, it could require the Departm ent of Revenue to add a specific line to the DR 0 100 where taxpayers would be required to report this information and direct the Department of Revenue to capture the data in GenTax. However, this change would require resources for the Department of Revenue to update the form, provide new instructions, and make programming changes in GenTax to capture the information. (See the Tax Expenditures Overview section of this Compilation Report for details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing these limitations.) Additionally, the change would increase the administrative burden on sellers who would be required to separately track and report exempt farm close -out sales. 26911 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? Because the Farm C lose-Out Sales Tax Exemption's exemption of on- road motor vehicles from state and local sales tax is inconsistent with the State's treatment of most other motor vehicle purchases, the General Assembly may wish to review this aspec t of the expenditure. Although the language of the exemption does not specifically list motor vehicles as an item exempted from sales tax, it defines the items that can be exempted as \"all tangible personal property of a farmer or rancher previously used by him in carrying on his farming or ranching operations.\" Therefore, if an on- road motor vehicle was used for farming and ranching operations, its sale falls within the exemption. However, in 1999 w hen the General Assembly enacted the Farm Equipment Sales Exemption [ Section 39- 26-716(2)(b), C.R.S .], which is also intended to reduce the sales tax liabilities of farmers and ranchers, it specifically included on -road motor vehicles (i. e., those subject to the State's vehicle registration requirements) \"regardless of the purpose for which such vehicles are used\" in a list of items that do not qualify as \"Farm Equipment\" for the purposes of qualifying for the exemption [Section 39- 26-716(1)(d), C.R.S .]. Because it is not clear whether the General Assembly intended to include on- road motor vehicles within the items exempted from sales tax when the Farm Close -Out Sales Tax Exemption was enacted in 194 5, it may wish to review and, if necessar y, amend the language of the exemption to reflect its tax policy preferences. Although we could not quantify the potential revenue impact of this aspect of the exemption during this review, the Department of Revenue reported that in Calendar Year 2018 it plans to begin tracking data related to taxpayers who purchased used vehicles at farm close -out sales who claimed the exemption, so in the future there may be better data regarding the potential revenue impact to the State. 270FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORSALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY SEPTEMBER 2018 2018-TE10 THIS EVALUATION IS INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2018 YEAR ENACTED 1935 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT $45.5 million (CALENDAR YEAR 2016) NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine AVERAGE T AXPAYER BENEFIT Could not determine IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ? Yes WHAT DOES THIS TAX EXPENDITURE DO? This tax expenditure exempts charitable organizations from paying state sales tax on purchases related to their charitable activities and functions. Before claiming the exemption, a charitable organization must apply for a certificate of exemption from the Department of Reven ue and present this certificate to retailers when making purchases for the sale to be exempt from tax. The exemption is typically applied at the time of sale, but an organization can also pay the sales tax and later apply for a refund from the Department o f Revenue. WHAT DID THE EVALUAT ION FIND? The exemption is meeting its purpose and is likely used widely by charitable organizations in the state. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for this tax expenditure. We inferred that the purpose is to exempt charitable organizations from taxation because historically, governments, including the State of Colorado, have considered charitable organizations to be beneficial to the public and to reduce the need for government services. Because the expenditure was created concurrently with the establishment of the State's sales tax, it appears that the exemption was not intended to provide new tax benefits for charitable organizations, but instead to define which enti ties and individuals would be subject to the sales tax. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION I DENTIFY? Charitable organizations we surveyed reported some administrative difficulty in claiming the exemption due to some retailers refusing to apply the exemption and differences between state and home rule city local sales tax requirements. 2712723 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT SALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPE NDITURE? In 1935, the Gen eral Assembly enacted the Emergency Retail Sales Tax Act, which established Colorado's retail sales tax and created the Sales to Charitable Organizations Exemption. The General Assembly made the sales tax and this exemption permanent in 1937, and the exemption has remained largely unchanged since that time. According to Sec tion 39- 26-718(1)(a), C.R.S., charitable organizations are not required to pay state sales and use tax on purchases related to their charitable activities and functions. In addition, charitable organizations are not required to pay local sales taxes for purchases made in local taxing jurisdictions, such as statutory cities and counties, which have their local sales taxes collected by the State on their behalf, because sta tute [Section 29-2- 105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.] mandates that these local governments apply most of the State's sales tax exemptions, including the Sales to Charitable Organizations Exemption. Home rule cities established under Article XX , Section 6 of the Colora do Constitution that collect their own sales taxes, have the authority to set their own tax policies independent from the State and are not required to exempt charitable organizations from their local sales tax, although many choose to do so. A charitable orga nization is defined in statute [Section 39- 26-102(2.5), C.R.S.] as \"any entity organized and operated exclusively for religious,charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educationalpurposes, or to foster national or international sports competition..., orfor the prevention of cruelty to children or animals,\" and new legislation,House Bill 18 -1218, includes veterans ' organizations in this definition as 2734 SALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS EXEMPTION well. Additionally, to qualify as a charitable organization, none of the organ ization's income may benefit a private individual directly, nor can the organization substantially participate in lobbying activities, or intervene in the campaigns of political candidates. The State's definition of a charitable organization substantially follows the federal definition provided in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. To claim this exem ption, an organization must apply to the Department of Revenue to verify its eligibility and receive a certificate of exemption (Form DR 0715). The organization must present the exemption certificate to retailers to claim the exemption when making purchases. Retailers are responsible for verifying an organization's tax exempt status and maintaining records of sales to charitable organizati ons, including the organizations' Colorado certificate of exemption numbers, the dates of the sale, descriptions of the items purchased, and the organizations' names and addresses. In addition to the certificate of exemption, charitable organizations may p rovide retailers with a Standard Colorado Affidavit of Exempt Sale Form (DR 5002) that contains these details about the organization and transaction as a courtesy to retailers. This form is intended to help retailers accurately calculate their monthly or q uarterly sales tax remittance, but retailers are not required to submit this form to the Department with their Retail Sales Tax R eturns (Form DR 0100). Retailers are required to report exempt sales to charitable organizations on their Retail S ales Tax Returns; these sales are combined on a single line with sales to government entities, which are also exempt from sales tax. If a retailer is unsure whether a transaction qualifies for the exemption or questions the authenticity of an organization's documents, the retailer may refuse to accept the certificate of exemption and collect and remit sales tax on the transaction. If this occurs, charitable organizations have to pay the tax in order to complete the sale, but may submit a claim for a refund to the Department of Revenue (Form DR 0137B). 2745 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not expl icitly identify the intended beneficiaries of this exemption. We infer that the main beneficiaries of this exemption are charitable organizations and Coloradans that utilize the services, products, or experiences that charitable organizations provide. According to I nternal Revenue Service data, there are more than 21,000 charitable organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code in Colorado. Charitable organizations serve many groups in the state and exist for a wide variety of purposes, including religion, arts, education, health care, human services, research, emergency relief, animal welfare, and the env ironment. As a result, the benefit these organizations receive from the exemption can vary based on the volume and type of retail purchases they make. According to our survey of charitable organizations, the items most frequently purchased using the exemption are office supplies and equipment, items consumed in the course of providing direct programming, and catering for programs and events. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute does not e x plicitly state a purpose for this tax expenditure. We inferred based on the enactment date and statutory language that the purpose is to exempt charitable organizations from taxation. Because the expenditure was created concurrently with the establishment of the State's sales tax, it appears that the exem ption was not intended to provide a new tax benefit for charitable organizations, but instead to define which entities and individuals would be subject to the sales tax. In the United St ates, there is a well -established history of providing preferential tax treatment to charitable organizations because governments, including the State of Colorado, have considered them to be beneficial to the public and to help reduce the need for government services and resources. Therefore, tax exemptions for charitable organizations are a common structural element within many states' tax codes. 2756 SALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS EXEMPTION IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We determined tha t the exemption is meeting its purpose because charitable organizations are widely using it to avoid paying sales taxes. Statute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this tax expenditure. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemption is meeting its inferred purpose. PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent has the Sales to Charitable Organizations T ax Exemption been used by charitable organizations? RESULT : We found that the exemption is likely being used by most charitable organizations who make otherwise taxable purchases. Although data constraints prevented us from quantifying how many organizations benefited from the exemption and by how much, we conducted a survey of a non- statistical sample of charitable organizations based in Colorado to assess the extent it is being used and obtain input from those organization s using it on its impact on their organizations and its overall administration. Of the 152 survey respondents that answered the question in our survey, 124 (82 percent) reported that their organization uses this exemption approximately 75 percent or more of the time that it makes otherwise sales -taxable purchases. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF TH E TAX EXPENDITURE? We estimate t hat this tax expenditure resulted in $45.5 million of forgone state revenue in Calendar Year 2016 and a corresponding tax savings to charitable organizations. In addition, because the local governments that rely on the Stat e to collect their sales taxes must also apply the exemption to their local sales taxes, we estimated the revenue impact to local jurisdictions. Home rule jurisdictions that self- collect their sales taxes are not included in this estimate because they set their 2767 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT tax policies independently from the State. The revenue impact estimates are summarized in E XHIBIT 1.1. EXHIBIT 1 .1. REVENUE IMPACT ESTIM ATES FOR THE SALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANI ZATIONS EXEMPTION FOR STATE AND LOCAL JURI SDICTIONS CALENDAR YEAR 2016 (IN MILLIONS) REVENUE IMPACT State $45.5 Local Jurisdictions $28.4 TOTAL $73.9 SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of Secretary of State, Internal Revenue Service, Guidestar, Department of Revenue, and survey data. Because the Depart ment of Revenue was unable to provide data specific to the amount claimed for this exemption, we used publicly -available IRS financial data for charitable organizations registered with the Colorado Secretary of State and survey responses from eligible organizations to estimate these figures. First, we estimated total expenses for charitable organizations for 2016 using expenses they reported on their IRS Form 990 for Calendar Years 2009 through 2016, which is publicly available for active organizations, adjusting 2009 through 2015 to 2016 dollars using the Consumer P rice Index for the Denver -Aurora -Lakewood metropolitan area, prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Because we had less information for the smallest organizations and relig ious places of worship, we excluded them from our IRS Form 990 analysis, but made a small (about 2 percent) adjustment to our estimate to account for them, using a subset of IRS data on charitable organizations with gross receipts of less than $25,000 from Form 990- N filers, which is for charitable organizations with gross receipts of $50,000 or less, and Department of Revenue data on registered places of worship to estimate their expenses. Using this inform ation, we estimated that charitable organizations in Colorado had $15.1 billion in expenses for Calendar Year 2016. Because the reported expenses include many expenses, such as staff salaries and overhead costs that would not be subject to sales tax regardless of the exemption, we used information provided by our survey respondents to estimate that, on average, 10.4 percent of 2778 SALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS EXEMPTION charitable organizations' expenses would be subject to sales tax without the exemption. We then used this rate to estimate that without the exemption, $1.6 billion of the organizations' expenses would be subject to sales tax. We applied Colorado's 2.9 percent sales tax rate to these otherwise taxable expenses to calculate the total forgone state sales tax revenue. For the local government revenue impact estimate, we used the same method, but applied an average local sales tax rate (combining city and county tax rates and excluding home rule jurisdictions with self-collected sales taxes ) of 1. 8 percent, which we weighted based on the population of each local government. With the p assage o f House Bill 18 -1218, which expanded the definition of a \"charitable organization\" to include veterans' organizations, the revenue impact to the State for the Sales to Charitable Organizations Exemption is expected to increase slightly after July 1, 2018, when this law takes effect. Legislative Council staff estimated the annual revenue impact specifically related to the inclusion of veterans' organizations as charitable organizations under the exemption to be approximately $60,000 per year. In addition to the dir ect impact of the exemption on state revenue, we estimate that the exemption reduces the tax burden on charitable organizations by about $73.9 million per year, including both state and local tax reductions and using the same analysis as above. There are several economic benefits that may result from this reduction in costs. For example, although we lacked data to quantify the number of jobs and wages supported by the savings realized by charitable organizations, 16 percent of organizations responding to our survey indicated that the exemption helps them retain additional paid staff. Therefore, the exemption may increase personal income in the st ate and state income tax collections, potentially offsetting some of the reduction in sales tax collections. In addition, about 60 percent of our survey respondents indicated that the exemption helps them sustain the quantity of services they provide. These services overlap with a number of state programs, including those aimed at providing food, housing, education, and recreation. Therefore, the exemption may also decrease the need for or 2789 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT supplement government services, although we lacked data to reliably estimate this impact. Further more , the exemption may encourage charitable organizations to make additional retail purchases due to the lower after -tax cost, although this impact is likely limited by the organizations' need for goods and supplies to support their activities. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? If this exemption w as eliminated, it would increase operating costs for many charitable organizations and could cause some of them to compensate by providing fewe r services, products, and experiences; increasing fundraising; or decreasing staffing . Based on our analysis of charitable organizations' expenses, we estimate that including the impact of both the state and local sales tax reduction, on average, the exemp tion provides a less than 1 percent reduction in the organizations' total expenses ($73.9 million compared to total expenses of $15.1 billion). However, for specific organizations, the impact can vary, depending on the proportion of the organization's expe nses that come from otherwise taxable purchases. The organizations responding to our survey indicated that the exemption is significant to them. Specifically, 86 percent stated that the sales and use tax exemption was moderately or extremely important to their organization, and 97 percent stated that they believe the exemption is moderately or extremely important to the nonprofit sector in Colorado. The survey respondents provided a variety of comments explaining the impact that eliminating the exemption could have on their operations, which we categorized and summarize in E XHIBIT 1.2. 27910 SALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS EXEMPTION EXHIBIT 1.2. REPORTE D IMPACT OF REMOVING THE SALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANI ZATIONS EXEMPTION SOURCE: Office of the State Auditor analysis of responses to survey of Colorado charitable organizations conducted by the Office of the State Auditor in March 2018. Although most organi zations indicated that the exemption provides them with an important benefit, approximately 11 percent of the organizations that participated in our survey reported that this exemption does not have a substantial impact on their operations. Specifically, some organizations reported that they do not regularly purchase large amounts of tangible personal property because they are service- based organizations, or they mostly purchase items that are already exempt from sales tax under other provisions of statutes. For example, many human services organizations reported that they frequent ly purchase food that is classified as food for home consumption, which is already exempt from state sales and use tax [Section 39- 26-707(1)(e), C.R.S.]. ARE THERE SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? Of the 44 other stat es that impose a sales and use tax, 2 7 offer a broad 0102030405060708090NUMBER OFRESPONSES (OF134 RESPONSES TO THIS QUESTION ) PERCENTAGE OFRESPONDENTS INCREASE FUNDRAISING REDUCE SERVICES ORINCREASE NOSUBSTANTIAL IMPACT60% 35% 16% 11% 28011 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT sales and use tax exemption for charitable organizations that is similar to Colorado's exemption. Eight additional states offer a limited sales tax exemption for some charitable organizations; in these states, the exemption is typically limited to a few statutorily -listed organizations or specific types of organizations (e.g., nonprofit hospitals, relief organizations, churches). Nine states and the District of Columbia do not have a general sales tax exemption for charitable organ izations, though some of these jurisdictions allow for minor exceptions. Aside from North Carolina and Utah, which require taxpayers to claim the exemption through a refund, all of the states that have a broad exemption apply it at the point of sale. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? There are sever al other tax expenditures in Colorado that reduce the amount of taxes a charitable organization may pay. For example, Colorado does not impose an income tax on most income earned by charitable organizations [Section 39- 22-112(1), C.R.S.], and occasional sales by charitable organizations are not subject to sales tax under certain circumstances [Section 39 -26-718(1)(b), C.R.S.]. The Colorado Constitution [A rticle X, Section 5] also exempts real and personal property used exclusively by charitable organizations from local property taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations may benefit from other more specific sales and use tax exemptions, such as: Food for home consumpti on [Section 3 9-26-707(1)(e), C.R.S.]. Prescription drugs and certain medical equipment, devices, and supplies [Section 39- 26-717, C.R.S]. Sales of tangibl e personal property that becomes an ingredient or component part of a product or se rvice being manufactured, compounded, or furnished [Section 39- 26-102(20)(a), C.R.S.]. Tangible persona l property for use in food manufacturing when the 28112 SALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS EXEMPTION property becomes an integral part or constituent part of the food product [Sectio n 39- 26-102(20)(b), C.R.S.]. Sales from whol esalers to retailers or other wholesalers (if an organization makes purchases of items for resale) [Section 39- 26- 102(19)(a), C.R.S.]. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE ? We lacked sales ta x return data necessary to precisely calculate the amount of the exemption claimed and the number of organizations claiming it. Although the Department of Revenue collects data on retail sales made to charitable organizations and governments on its Retail Sales Tax Return form DR 0100, the form includes a single line to report these sales , and retailers must combine the total sales from each category when filing. This information cannot be disaggregated and is not captured by GenTax, the Department of Revenue's tax processing system. In addition, the Department of Revenue does not capture the amount of refunds issued specifically under the exemption. If the Department of Revenue modifies its Retail S ales Tax R eturn form DR 0100 to include a separate reporting line for sales to charitable organizations, programs GenTax to capture this information from the return, and begins tracking refunds issued under the exemption, we would be able to more reliably report the revenue impact to the State. However, this would require additional resources and staff time for the Department of Revenue and would create additional tracking and reporting requirements for retailers (see the Tax Expenditures Overview section of this Compilation Report for details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and potential costs for addressing them) . WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? Although most char itable organizations reported that they use the exemption, they also reported that administrative issues can make it 28213 TAX EXPENDITURE S REPORT difficult to claim under certain circumstances. Specifically, almost one - third of the respondents to our survey reported that they find this exemption to be very or somewhat difficult to claim. Respondent comments suggest that the difficulty arise s during the retail transaction process, specifically because: There is not a consis tent process applied by all retailers regarding which documents need to be provided by the charitable organization and whether the retailer stores the organization's information forfuture use or if the organization has to provide its documentation oneach separate occasion. Some retailer s do not understand how the exemption works and who is eligible for it. Many checkout staf f have not been trained by retail management on how to apply the exemption during a transaction. It is time -consuming and difficult for some retailers to verify in advance of a purchase that an organization is eligible for theexemption. Some retailers d e cline to apply the exemption, though the y do not always provide a reason. Some retailer s are not aware of the exemption. Further, these i ssues are complicated by Colorado's laws regarding local government taxes, which may result in confusion for retailers in applying the exemption. Specifically, the State's 71 home rule , self - collected municipalities have the authority [Colorado Constitution, Article XX, Section 6] to decide whether to exempt purchases made by charitable organizations from their local sales and use taxes and to create a separate local charitable organization exemption certificate application process. We reviewed the tax regulations for the fifteen most populous home rule , self-collected cities and found that they all provide 28314 SALES TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS EXEMPTION some type of sales tax exemption for charitable organizations, but the requirements vary among cities and are not always the same as those for the state sales tax exemption. For example, seven home rule , self- collected cities provide a blanket exemption for charitable organizations without a separate application process, eight require a separate application and certificate, and one limits which charitable organizations qualify for the exemption based on their annual gross revenue. In addition, organizations located, or making purchases, in some home rule cities must often present two charitable certificates, one for the State and one for the city, when making purchases. Although the state exemption should be applied to the state sales tax regardless of local tax laws, the variation between locations can create uncertainty among retailers and charitable organizations regarding which documents are required in order to apply the exemption, and some charitable organizations reported difficulty using the exemption under these circumstances. When a retailer r efuses to apply the sales tax exemption, the charitable organizations holding a certificate of exemption can apply for a refund of the sales taxes paid from the Department of Revenue. However, while 24 percent of our survey re spondents reported that retailers hav e refused to honor their exemption, 6 percent reported applying for a refund, which may indicate that charitable organizations do not have the resources to apply for refunds or that applying for refunds is not a cost-effective use of staff time , especially if they must apply separately for a state refund and a city refund in the case of a home rule , self - collected municipality . Additionally, this can be a financial burden on charitable organizations since, according to Department of Revenue staff, refunds typically take between 6 and 9 months to process. Having to issue refunds also places additional administrative burden on the Department of Revenue. 2841 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS REPORT, CONTACT THE OFFICE OF THE STATE AUDITOR 303.869.2800 - WWW.COLORADO.GOV/AUDITORCOMP LIMENTARY MARKETING PROPERTY TO OUT-OF-STATE VENDEES EXEMPTIONS JULY 2020 EVALUATION SUMMARY 2020-TE21 THIS EVALUATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN COMPILATION REPORT SEPTEMBER 2020 SALES TAX EXEMPTION USETAX EXEMPTION YEAR ENACTED 1977 1977 REPEAL / EXPIRATION DATE None None REVENUE IMPACT None Minimal, if any NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS None Could not determine AVERAGE TAXPAYER BENEFIT None Could not determine IS IT MEETING ITS PURPOSE ?

The Complimentary Marketing Property to Out-of-State Vendees Exemptions (Marketing Property Exemptions) [Section 39-26-713 (1)(b) and (2)(i), C.R.S.] provide a sales and a use tax exemption available to businesses that transfer items to an out-of- state vendee to use in selling the businesses' products and do not receive any payment from the vendee for these items.WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURES? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for the Marketing Property Exemptions. We inferred that the purpose was to clarify the application of the State's sales and use tax for out-of- state transfers of marketing property. In particular, it may not have been clear to businesses whether they should pay use tax when transferring marketing property to vendees free of charge and the ex emptions serve to clarify that the transfers are not subject to the tax. WHAT DID THE EVALUATION FIND? We determined that the sales tax exemption covers transactions that would already be considered exempt and so taxpayers do not have a need to use it. In addition, the use tax exemption is likely used by few taxpayers, if at all, with Department of Revenue staff and CPAs we contacted being unaware of any taxpayers who use it.WHAT POLICY CONSIDER ATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENTIFY? The General Assembly could consider repealing the Marketing Property Exemptions since they appear to be rarely, if ever used. However, because they may add clarity to the application of the State's sales and use taxe s, the General Assembly may want to keep them in place. 2852 COMPLIMENTARY MARKET ING PROPERTY TO OUT -OF-STATE VENDEES EXE MPTION SCOMPLIMENTARY MARKETING PROPERTY TO OUT-OF-STATE VENDEES EXEMPTIONS EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT ARE THE TAX EXPENDITURES? The Complimentary Marketing Property to Out-of-State Vendees Exemptions (Marketing Property Exemptions) [Section 39-26-713 (1)(b) and (2)(i), C.R.S.] provide two parallel exemptions, one for sales and one for use tax. These exemptions are available to businesses that transfer items to an out-of-state vendee to use in selling the businesses' products when the businesses do not receive any payment or \"consideration, other than the purchase, sale, or promotion\" of their products [Section 39-26-713(1)(b), C.R.S.]. One example would be a Colorado manufacturer of air freshener canisters that delivers air freshener dispensers (which only work with the canisters) to customers outside the state free of charge. When the manufacturer removes from inventory, stores, and then ships the dispensers for the purpose of selling the manufacturer's air freshener canisters, the transfer of the dispensers qualifies for the use tax exemption. Another example would be a Colorado tire manufacturer that also manufactures marketing items, such as tire display racks. The manufacturer sends the racks to out-of-state retailers in order to display its tires for sale. When the manufacturer removes the racks from its inventory for this purpose, it qualifies for this exemption and does not have to pay Colorado sales or use tax on those racks. House Bill 77-1535 created these exemptions, which have remained substantially unchanged since 1977. According to the Department of Revenue, it does not have an established process for taxpayers to claim the Marketing Property Exemptions. Businesses are still able to use the exemptions, but they do not report their use or take any administrative action other than excluding the value of the transferred property from the amounts they report as sales or taxable use. 2863 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly identify the intended beneficiaries of the Marketing Property Exemptions. Based on our review of statute, regulations, applicable case law, Department of Revenue taxpayer guidance documents, and discussions with CPAs and Department of Revenue staff, we inferred that the intended beneficiaries are Colorado businesses that remove items, such as displays, dispensers, and signs, from their inventory to send, free of charge, to out-of-state vendees, which can include individual customers, in order to market the products they sell. Therefore, although we lacked data on the types of businesses that use them, the exemptions could potentially benefit a wide range of Colorado manufacturers and wholesalers that sell products outside the state. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not explicitly state a purpose for the Marketing Property Exemptions. We inferred that the purpose was to clarify the application of the State's sales and use tax for out-of-state transfers of marketing property. In particular, it may not have been clear to businesses whether they should pay use tax when transferring marketing property to vendees free of charge and the exemptions serve to clarify that the transfers are not subject to the tax. Generally, if a business purchases tangible personal property with the intent to resell it or incorporate it into a product for sale, the sale is exempt from sales tax under the Wholesale Sales Tax Exemption [Sections 39-26-102(18)-(20), and 39-26-713(2), C.R.S.]. However, if after receiving the property, the wholesaler or manufacturer does not sell it, but instead removes it from its inventory and uses it for its own purposes, it is required to pay use tax on the value of the property. Therefore, in the case of marketing property transferred out-of-state, it may have been unclear to businesses whether they needed to pay use tax on the transfers if they remove the marketing property from inventory and transfer it to a vendee, to facilitate a sale of other products, but without selling the marketing property itself. We inferred this purpose based on our review of legislative history and statutory language, discussions with CPAs, and Department of Revenue guidance. 2874 COMPLIMENTARY MARKET ING PROPERTY TO OUT -OF-STATE VENDEES EXE MPTION SARE THE TAX EXPENDITURES MEETING THEIR PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? We found that the Marketing Property Exemptions are meeting their purpose, but only to a limited extent, because they appear to be used by few taxpayers, if at all. However, they may continue to serve their purpose of clarifying that the transfers of marketing property that they cover are exempt from sales and use tax. Statute does not provide a quantifiable performance measure for this exemption. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemptions are meeting their purpose: PERFORMANCE MEASURE :To what extent are Colorado companies using the exemptions to avoid paying sales and use tax on complimentary items they provide to out-of-state retailers or consumers in order to sell the companies' products? RESULTS :We found that the Marketing Property Exemptions appear to be used by few taxpayers or not at all. Sales tax exemption. Although we lacked data to confirm that no taxpayers have used the sales tax exemption, based on our review of statute and regulations, and discussions with Department of Revenue staff, we could not identify a situation where a taxpayer would need to use it. Specifically, the delivery of personal property outside the state is not subject to Colorado sales tax, since Colorado only imposes a sales tax on retail sales made in Colorado [Sections 39-26-102(9) and 104, C.R.S.]. Because the marketing property must be delivered outside the state in order to qualify for the Marketing Property Exemptions, it would already be exempt from Colorado sales tax under these broader provisions. Furthermore, according to Section 39-26-102(10), C.R.S., there must be a corresponding exchange of consideration (i.e., monetary payment, property or services) for a transfer of personal property to be considered a sale subject to sales tax. According to Department of Revenue staff, it is unlikely that the transfers covered under the exemption would be considered sales because businesses transfer the property free of charge and thus, the transfers lack the necessary exchange of consideration. 2885 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT Use tax exemption. Although we lacked data to confirm that no taxpayers have used the use tax exemption, Department of Revenue staff told us that they consider this to be an obscure exemption that is rarely, if ever used. Additionally, Department of Revenue staff indicated that they have not collected information on the exemption's use and have not interacted with any taxpayers regarding the exemption, such as discussing how to take the exemption or what circumstances qualify, which indicates few taxpayers are aware of it. Further, we consulted with several CPAs practicing in Colorado and they were not familiar with the exemption. None of the CPAs had heard of a taxpayer using it. One CPA told us that the taxpayers that could potentially use the exemption are companies with sophisticated tax law knowledge that operate on a large-scale over numerous states or countries. Although it appears that few taxpayers use these exemptions, because some businesses likely engage in the types of transactions they cover, the Marketing Property Exemptions may continue to serve their purpose of clarifying statute even though the intended beneficiaries likely apply other exemptions to avoid paying sales and use tax. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURES? Although we lacked data to determine the actual cost of the Marketing Property Exemptions to the State, we determined that any revenue forgone by the State from these tax expenditures is likely minimal. Specifically, we determined the sales tax exemption has no cost to the State because eligible transfers of property would have already been exempted from sales tax without the expenditure. Because the use tax exemption is likely used by few taxpayers if at all, we determined that it likely has little or no revenue impact to the State. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURES HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Because it appears that the tax expenditures are either not used, or used only by a small number of taxpayers, we determined that the overall impact of eliminating the Marketing Property Exemptions would likely be minimal. As discussed, it appears that the sales tax exemption is not being used and so there 2896 COMPLIMENTARY MARKET ING PROPERTY TO OUT -OF-STATE VENDEES EXE MPTION Swould be no impact to beneficiaries if it were eliminated. To the extent it is used, eliminating the use tax exemption could result in current beneficiaries potentially having to pay use tax on all items they removed from inventory to send out-of-state to help sell their product. However, as discussed, it was not necessarily clear at the time that the exemptions were created that the transactions they cover were taxable, so some current beneficiaries might determine that they can continue to exempt these transfers from use tax even if the exemption were eliminated. Alternatively, companies might choose to charge money for these items instead of giving them away on a complimentary basis. ARE THERE SIMILAR TAX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? We did not identify any similar tax expenditures in other states. ARE THERE TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE IN THE STATE? We did not identify any tax expenditures or programs with a similar purpose available in the state. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURES? The Department of Revenue was not able to provide us with data for the Marketing Property Exemptions because taxpayers are not required to report their use on any form. To obtain data on the extent to which the exemptions are being used, the Department of Revenue would have to create new reporting lines on its sales and use tax reporting forms (Forms DR 0100, DR 0173, and DR 0137B) and then capture and house the data collected on those lines in GenTax, its tax processing and information system, which would require programing changes and additional resources. These changes may not be cost- effective since the exemptions appears to be rarely used (See the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing these limitations). 2907 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENTIFY? THEGENERAL ASSEMBLY COULD CONSIDER REPEALING THE MARKETING PROPERTY EXEMPTIONS SINCE THEY APPEAR TO BE USED BY FEW TAXPAYERS ,IF AT ALL .Specifically, we could not identify a circumstance under which a taxpayer would need to use the sales tax exemption. Because property must be transferred outside the state to qualify, this type of transaction would already be exempt because only in-state sales are subject to sales tax. Further, such transactions likely do not qualify as taxable sales because they are made free of charge. In addition, although some taxpayers could potentially claim the use tax exemption, we could not find evidence that taxpayers are claiming it, with neither the Department of Revenue nor CPAs we contacted being aware of any such taxpayers. However, the General Assembly may want to keep the exemptions in place in order to clarify that the qualifying transactions are not taxable. 291292TAX TYPE Sales and use YEAR ENACTED 1982 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT Could not determine NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine WHAT DOES THIS TAX E XPENDITURE DO? The Materials Used in Iron, Steel, and Vanadium - Uranium Ore Manufacturing and Processing Exemption (Materials Exemption) [Section 39-26- 706(3), C.R.S.] exempts from sales and use tax the purchases, sales, storage, use, or consumption of refractory materials and carbon electrodes used in manufacturing iron and steel for profit and inorganic chemicals used in the processing of vanadium -uranium ores. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not explicitly state its purpose; therefore, we could not definitiv ely determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the exemption, a Colorado Supreme Court decision prior to its enactment, a long with recordings of legislative hearings , we considered a potential purpose: to ensure that sales tax is only applied to purchases made by final metal products consumers instead of at multiple steps through the iron, steel and vanadium- uranium production process. WHAT POLICY CONSIDER ATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider: Establishing a statutory purpose and performancemeasures for the exemption . Repealing the exemption for inorganic materials used in vanadium -uranium ore processing, since there are no longer any facilities in the state that process vanadium -uranium ore.MATERIALS USED IN IRON, STEEL, AND VANADIUM -URANIUM ORE MANUFACTURING AND PROCESSING EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY | JULY 2021 | 2021 -TE17 KEY CONCLUSION: We could not determine if any taxpayers continue to use this exemption, though it appears that there are only a few companies in the state that produce iron or steel and could potentially use it. Additionally, because vanadium -uranium ore is no longer processed in the state, the exemption, as it relates to these materials, is obsolete . 2932 MATERIALS USED IN IR ON, STEEL, AND VANAD IUM-URANIUM ORE MANU FACTURING AND PROCES SING EXEMPTION MATERIALS USED IN IRON, STEEL, AND VANADIUM -URANIUM ORE MANUFACTURING AND PROCESSING EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE? T he Materials Used in Iron, Steel, and Vanadium -Uranium Ore Manufacturing and Processing Exemption (Materials Exemption) [Section 39-26-706(3), C.R.S.] exempts from sales and use tax purchases, sales, storage, use , or consumption of refractory materials and carbon electrodes used in manufacturing iron and steel for profit and inorganic chemicals used in the processing of vanadium -uranium ores. The exemption was created in 1982 by House Bill 82- 1168 and applies to manufacturers who use, rather than resell , refractory materials and carbon electrodes they purchase. Manufacturers use the eligible materials as follows: REFRACTORY MATERIALS are used in the lining and construction of furnaces and other equipment used in the steelmaking proce ss. Examples of these materials include brick, clay, and plastic. The principal function of refractory materials is to protect the furnacesand other steelmaking equipment from the heat generated in thesteelmaking process. When these materials are exposed to molten metal, they are slowly consumed and small amounts can be found in the finished steel products. The refractory materials that do not comeinto direct contact wi th the molten metal deteriorate and must be replaced periodically. 2943 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT CARBON ELECTRODES are used in the production of steel in an electric arc furnace. The electrodes, which are typically graphite rods, are lowered into this furnace and cause an electric arc that generates ahigh degree of heat. Some electrodes are also dipped into the molte n metal to increase its carbon content. INORGANIC CHEMICALS used in vanadium -uranium ore processing include sulphuric acid and liquid solvents . The ore is treated with sulphuric acid to dissolve the vanadium and uranium. A liquid solvent is then used to separate the uranium , leaving the vanadium in an acid solution. The vanadium is used in steel production. P urchasers, typically processors and manufacturer s, claim the exemption at the time of the sale and the sell er then report s the exemption on the Department of Revenue 's Retail Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0100) , Line 12 of Schedule A. If a seller does not apply the exemption to an eligible sale, purchasers may submit a Claim for Refund of Tax Paid to Vendors (Form DR 0137B) to the Department to request a refund. Statute [Section 29-2- 105(1)(d)( I), C.R.S.] requires all local governments that have their sales taxes collected by the S tate to apply the Materials Exemption. However, Article XX, Section 6 of the Colorado Constitution gives self -collected home -rule cities and counties the authority to create their own tax policies. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF TH E TAX EXPENDITURE? S tatute does not directly state the intended beneficiaries of the exemption. Based on a Colorado Supreme C ourt case immediately prior to its enactment, legislative testimony, and its operation, we inferred the intended beneficiaries are iron and steel manufacturers and uranium - vanadium or e processors that purchase the required inorganic chemicals, refractory materials, and carbon electrodes. Steel and iron final consumers may be indirect beneficiaries of this exemption to the extent that processors and manufacturers pass their tax savings on in the form of lower prices. 2954 MATERIALS USED IN IR ON, STEEL, AND VANAD IUM-URANIUM ORE MANU FACTURING AND PROCES SING EXEMPTION The U.S. Census Bureau 2018 Econ omic Survey indicate s that there are currently six companies in Colorado that manufacture steel and could potentially benefit from the exemption, though we lacked information necessary to determine whether they use the applicable materials as part of their production process. Additionally, although we identified at least one company that processed vanadium and uranium at the time the exemption was created, a ccording to the Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety within the Department of Natural Resources , Colorado no longer has any operating facilities that process vanadium or uranium. Processing requires a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission license and the only licensed mill in the U .S. is at the White Mesa near Blanding, Utah. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? S tatute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not explicitly state its purpose; therefore, we could not definit ively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the exemption, a Colorado Supreme Court decision prior to its enactment, and recordings of legislative hearings for House Bill 82- 1168, we considered a potential purpose: to ensure that sales tax is only applied to purchases made by final metal products consumers instead of at multiple steps through the iron, steel , and vanadium -uranium production process . I n the year prior to the enactment of the Materials Exemption, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in CF&I Steel Corp. v. Charnes, 637 P.2d 324 (Colo. 1981) that refractory materials and carbon electrodes did not qualify for the broader Wholesales E xemption [Section 39-26- 102(20) and 39- 26-713(2)(e), C.R.S.], which exempts ingredients and component parts incorporated into manufactured goods from sales and use tax. The court stated that since refractory materials and carbon electrodes are only found in trace amounts in finished steel, they are not a constituent part of the process and not an essential ingredient in thefinished product . 2965 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT According to legislative hearings, the Materials E xemption was a direct response to this decision. Further more , during the hearing s, the bill sponsor added an amendment to the bill, including inorganic chemicals used in the processing of vanadium -uranium ore into the exemption, due to an administrative case brought by the Department of Revenue against Union Carbide . In that case, the Department determined Union Carbide owed use tax on inorganic chemicals since they were determined not to be component parts in the process. The bill sponsor stated that their intent was to ensure that sales and use tax is only applied to purchases made by final consumers instead of at multiple steps through the processing and manufacturing of vanadium -uranium ores, iron, and steel. Similar structural provisions are common in states with a sales tax to prevent tax pyramiding, which refers to a process that increas es the effective sales tax rate on a good by taxing its inputs and the transactions that occur prior to its final sale to a consumer. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? W e could not determine whether the Materials Exemption is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided in statute or its enacting legislation . Further more , due to a lack of information, we could not determine if it is meeting the purpose we considered in or der to conduct the evaluation. S tatute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this tax expenditure. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemption is meeting its potential purpose. PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent is the exemption applied to eligible purchases of inorganic chemicals, refractory materials, and carbon electrodes for iron and steel manufacturing and vanadium - uranium processing ? 2976 MATERIALS USED IN IR ON, STEEL, AND VANAD IUM-URANIUM ORE MANU FACTURING AND PROCES SING EXEMPTION RESULT : We were unable to determine whether potential beneficiaries apply this exemption. Because the Department of Revenue does not collect data necessary to measure its use, we contacted stakeholders, including six metal fabricators and manufacturers in the state, to determin e whether they are aware of and use the exemption. Out of the six, only one of the companies uses these materials and it was not aware of the exemption. The company stated that it pays sales tax on the refractory materials and carbon electrodes it purchase s. According to industry stakeholders , electric arc furnaces, which use carbon rods eligible for the exemption, are less commonly used in steel production than in prior years, though they indicated that at least one steel - producing facility in the state might still use one. We attempted to contact the company that owns this facility , but did not receive a response. However, because this facility was owned by CF&I Steel, which challenged the taxation of these materials, leading to the Colorado Supreme Court decision that was the impetus for the creation of the exemption, it is likely that the facility claimed the exemption in the past and it is possible that it continues to do so. The re are currently no vanadium -uranium processors in Colorado, so the exem ption for inorganic chemicals is not currently being used or meeting its purpose. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? D ue to the Department not collecting data on the Materials Exemption (see Data Constraints section below) and a lack of information from potential beneficiaries that would confirm that it is still used , we are not able to estimate th e exemption's revenue impact to the State or the potential economic benefits it provides. However, b ecause there are only a few iron and steel producers in the state that may qualify, and vanadium and uranium are no longer produced in the state, it appears that this exemption has a limited economic impact. 2987 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? T he elimination of the Materials Exemption would cause any businesses currently using the exemption to be required to pay an additional 2.9 percent in sales tax for their purchases of eligible materials. Although we were not able to determine how many bus inesses use the exemption, as discussed, the U.S. Census Bureau 2018 Economic Survey data indicate there are only about six companies in Colorado that manufacture steel, which could potentially be users of the exemption. Further more , according to an industry group, the use of furnaces that require carbon electrodes is not widespread among the existing iron and steel fabricators and manufacturers in Colorado. Therefore, though we could not quantify the overall impact eliminating the exemption would have on i ntended beneficiaries, it would likely be limited to a small number of taxpayers. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? W e did not identify any other states that have an exemption explicitly for refractory materials, carbon electrodes, or inorganic chemicals used in vanadium -uranium ore processing. However, o f the 44 states (excluding Colorado) that levy a sales tax, we identified 24 that have sales tax exemptions that appear to exempt the use of inorganic chemicals used in processing and manufacturing. Further more , the five principal steel-producing states (Indiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Alabama and Michigan) , all have broader sales and use tax exempt ions for materials used in processing that appear to allow an exemption similar to Colorado's Materials Exemption . ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? C olorado provides several other sales and use tax exemptions that aim to prevent sales tax from being applied at multiple steps in the manufacturing and processing of goods . Specifically, ingredients and component parts used to manufacture goods are exempt from sales tax 2998 MATERIALS USED IN IR ON, STEEL, AND VANAD IUM-URANIUM ORE MANU FACTURING AND SING Wholesales Exemption [Section 39- 26-102(20) (a), C.R.S.]. Energy used for industrial and manufacturing purposes is also exempt from sales and use tax [Section 39- 26-102(21)(a), C.R.S.], as are purchases of [Section 39- 26- 709(1)(a)(II) and (1)(a)(IV), C.R.S.]. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURE ? The Department of Revenue could not provide data on the number of taxpayers that use this exemption or the amount they claimed. Specifically, this exemption is usually claimed by the purchaser at the time of the sale and then reported by the seller on the seller's sales tax return using the Department's Retail Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0100) . There is no dedicated line for the exemption on the sales tax return and it is included on a line of the return for other exemptions, which combines reporting of se veral unrelated exemptions and cannot be disaggregated for analysis . Additionally, the information reported is not stored in a format that GenTax, the Department's tax processing and information system, can readily pull data from. If the General Assembly determined that more information on this tax expenditure is necessary, it could direct the Department of Revenue to collect information specifically for the M aterials Exemption on the Retail Sales Tax Return and make changes in GenTax to allow it to pull this data. However, according to the Department of Revenue, this would require additional resources to make change s to the form and complete the necessary programming in GenTax (see the Tax Expenditures Overview s ection of th e Office of the State Auditor 's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). 3009 TAX EXPENDITURES REPORT WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATUTORY PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FO R THE MATERIALS EXEMPTION . As discussed, statute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not state the exemption's purpose or provide performance measures for evaluating its effectiveness. Therefore, for the purposes of our evaluation, we considered a potential purpose for the exemption: to ensure that sales and use tax is only applied to purchases made by final consumers instead of at multiple steps through the manufacturing and processing of iron, steel, and vanadium -uranium ores. We identified this purpose based on our review of a Colorado Supreme Court decision at the time the exemption was established, and its leg islative history , including recordings of the hearing s for its enacting legislation [House Bill 82-1168] . However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the exemption by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure( s) in statute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the exemption's purpose and allow our office to assess the extent to which the exemption is accomplishing its intended goal(s). THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY COULD CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO REMOVE MATERIALS USED IN VANADIUM -URANIUM ORE PROCESSI NG FROM THE EXEMPTION . As discussed , there are no longer any vanadium - uranium ore processors located in Colorado. Therefore, th e exemption for inorganic chemicals used in vanadium -uranium ore processing c ould be repealed since it is no t being used by any businesses in the s tate. 301302TAX TYPE Sales and use YEAR ENACTED 1984 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT Could not determine NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine WHAT DOES THIS TAX E XPENDITURE DO?

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statutes and the enacting legislation for the Intersta te Aircraft Exemption do not explicitly state its purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the expenditure we considered a potential purpose : to be to prevent the taxation of transportation equipment used in interstate commerce, which may be administratively difficult to tax . WHAT POLICY CONSIDER ATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider establishing a st atutory purpose and performance measures for the exemption. AIRCRAFT USED IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY | JULY 2021 | 2021 -TE23 KEY CONCLUSION: The exemption appears to be commonly used to exempt purchases of aircraft used in interstate commerce from sales and use tax . 3032 AIRCRAFT USED IN INT ERSTATE COMMERC E EXEMPTION AIRCRAFT USED IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE? I n 1984, House Bill 84- 1016 created t he Aircraft Used in Interstate Commerce Sales and Use Tax E xemption (Interstate Aircraft Exemption) [Section 39- 26-711(1)(a) and (2)(a) C.R.S. ], which provides commercial airlines with a sales and use tax exemption for the purchase, storage, use, and consumption of aircraft used in interstate commerce. V endors apply the Interstate Aircraft Exemption by not charging sales or use tax at the time of sale. Vendors are required to report the value of exempt sales to the Department of Revenue (Department) on their Colorado Retail Sales Tax Return Form (For m DR 0100) or Retailer's Use Tax Return Form (Form DR 0173), if applicable. If a commercial airline is charged tax by a vendor at the time of sale, the y can file a Claim for Refund Form (Form DR 0137B) with the Department to apply for a refund of the sales taxes they paid . WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF TH E TAX EXPENDITURE? S tatute does not explicitly state the intended beneficiaries of the Interstate Air craft Exemption. Based on the operation of the exemption, we inferred that the intended direct beneficiaries are commercial airlines that operate in interstate commerce. \"Commercial airlines \" is not defined in statute, but the Department classifies a commercial airline as an airline carrying freight or passengers on regularly scheduled flight s for a fee. 3043 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? S tatute and the enacting legislation do not explicitly state the purpose for the Interstate Aircraft Exemption; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent . Based on the operation of the exemption and similar tax expenditures in the state, we considered the following potential purpose : to prevent the taxation of transportation equipment used in interstate commerce, which may be administratively difficult to tax. Equipment used to ship goods and provide transportation, such as trains, trucks, and aircraft, are often used in many states, and companies in the transportation industry often maintain physical locations in multiple states . Further more , sales and use taxes are generally used in coordination to tax the consumption of tangible property used within a state's taxing jurisdiction, but for equipment used in interstate transportation, most of its use tends to be outside of the state or in multiple states . Therefore, administering and enforcing sales and use taxes on this type of equipment can be difficult and such exemptions are common in other states. This is also consistent with other sales tax exemptions in Colorado for purchases of transportat ion property used in interstate commerce, such as commercial truck s [Section IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We could not definitively determine whether the I nterstate Aircraft Exemption is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided for it in statute or its enacting legislation. However, we found that it is meeting the potential purpose we considered in order to conduct this evaluation because commercial airlines are aware of the exemption and use it to exempt their eligible purchases from sales and/or use tax. S tatute does not provide quantifiable performa nce measures for the exemption. Therefore, we created and applied the following 3054 AIRCRAFT USED IN INT ERSTATE COMMERC E EXEMPTION performance measure to determine if the expenditure is meeting the potential purpose we used for the purposes of this evaluation. PER FORMANCE MEASURE: To what extent are taxpa yers using the Interstate Aircraft Exemption to avoid paying sales and use tax on eligible purchases? R ESULTS: Based on feedback from stakeholders, including commercial airlines that operate in interstate commerce, we determined that industry members are aware of and use the Interstate Aircraft Exemption. However, we lacked the data from the Department to quantify its use. Stakeholder s did not identify any issues with the exemption's administration and indicated that all purchases are exempt ed at the point of sale. Lastly, stakeholders indicated that a similar exemption is available in most states and that knowledge and use of the se exemptions is wide spread, as many commercial airlines seek out states with an exemption when considering their operation s and making purchasing decisions. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? W e lack ed the information from the Department necessary to quantify the revenue impact to the State for the exemption. However, the exemption may p rovide a relatively large benefit to taxpayers, since aircraft are often high- cost and the exemption is for both sales and use tax. For example, based on stakeholder feedback and research on the airline industry, a typical new passenger aircraft can cost around $50 million or more . Thus, the revenue impact to the State based on the 2.9 percent sales or use tax would be $1.5 million per purchase of a typical new aircraft . A dditionally, statute [Section 29 -2-105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.] mandates that local governments for which the State collects sales taxes apply most of the State's sales tax exemptions, including the Interstate Aircraft Exemption. As a result , the exemption may r educe local tax revenues and provide a corresponding savings to aircraft operators if they make 3065 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT purchases or take delivery of aircraft in these areas of the state . Home rule cities established under Article XX of the Colorado Constitution have the authority to set their own tax policies independent from the State and 11 of the 14 commercial airports in the state are located in home rule cit ies. Of the f ive most populated home rule cities\u2014 Aurora, Colorado Springs, Denver, Fort Collins, and Lakewood\u2014 only Aurora does not have a similar exemption. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? E liminating the Interstate Aircraft Exemption would result in the State's 2.9 percent sales or use tax being applied to purchases of commercial aircraft . Commercial airlines would also pay additional local taxes for purchases made in local jurisdictions for which the State collects sales taxes. Our discussions with stakeholders indicat e that this could make commercial airlines less likely to make purchases in Colorado, since most other states provide a similar exemption. Stakeholders told us that they are aware of which states have s imilar tax expenditures and try to make purchases in states such as Colorado that have an exemption in place , when possible. Re peal of the Interstate Aircraft Exemption could also pose an administrative burden to the State and purchasers. Specifically, the removal of the exemption may make it difficult for taxpayers to comply with and for the Department to enfor ce the sales or use tax on such purchases. For example, if aircraft are purchased from an out -of-state vendor and then immediately put into use in inte rstate commerce, it may be difficult to determine the correct apportioned use th at occurred in Colorado versus other states, which is generally necessary under the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause [U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8] to enforce sales and use tax on purchases of transportation equipment used in interstate commerce. Further, because t he Commerc e Clause generally restricts states from applying discriminatory or burdensome taxation on interstate commerce, a repeal of the exemption may require further legal analysis to ensure the State's tax is constitutionally permitted. 3076 AIRCRAFT USED IN INT ERSTATE COMMERC E EXEMPTION ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? W e examined the tax laws of the 44 states (excluding Colorado) with a sales tax and identified 3 6 states that provide a general exemption for purchases of aircraft used in interstate commerce from sales and use tax, including all of the states bordering Colorado. Of the states that apply a tax , North Carolina and South Carolina levy a maximum sales tax on aircraft sales of $2,500 and $500 , respectively ; Mississippi provides a reduced tax rate; and Nevada only exempt s aircraft from tax if it is first used in interstate commerce outside the state. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? The NON-RESIDENT NEW AND USED AIRCRAFT SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTION [Section 39 -26-711.5, C.R.S] \u2014Exempts non- residents' purchases of new or used aircra ft from sales and use tax if the aircraft is removed from the state within 120 days from the date of sale or 30 days after the completion of maintenance , repair, or refurbishment of the aircraft associated with its sale. THE AIRCRAFT COMPONENT PARTS SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTION - [Section 39- 26-711(1)(b) and (2)(b), C.R.S.] \u2014Exempts the purchase, storage, use, and consumption of component parts permanently affixed to aircraft from tax. The exempt ion applies to all aircraft component parts, not just those used in interstate commerce. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURE ? The Department does not collect specific information regarding the use of the exemption and was unable to provide data for our analysis. For this reason, we were unable to quantify its use and revenue impact . As discussed , although vendors are required to re port the exemption, the y must use a line for \"other exemptions\" on both forms used to report it (Forms DR 0100 or 0173) and t he amounts listed on these lines is 3087 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT combined with several other tax expenditures and cannot be disaggregated for analysis . I f the General Assembly wants infor mation on the revenue impact of the exemption, the Departme nt would need to add separate reporting lines to Forms DR 0100 and 0173 and capture the data in GenTax, its tax processing and information system. However, according to the Department , this type of change would require additional resources to change the form and complete the necessary programming in GenTax (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additiona l details on the limitations of Department data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATUTORY PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FO R THE INTERSTATE AIRCRAFT EXEMPTION . Statute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not state the exemption' s purpose or provide performance measures for evaluating its effectiveness. Therefore, for the purposes of this evaluation we considered a pote ntial purpose for the exemption: to prevent the taxation of transportation equipment used in interstate commerce, which may be administratively difficult to tax. We identified this purpose based on the operation of the exemption and similar tax expenditures in Colorado and other states. We also developed a performance measure to assess the extent to wh ich the exemption is meeting this potential purpose. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the exemption by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measur e(s) in statute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the exemption' s purpose and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the exemption is accomplishing its intended goal(s). 309310TAX TYPE Sales and use YEAR ENACTED 1990 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE None REVENUE IMPACT Could not determine NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine WHAT DOES THE TAX EX PENDITURE DO?

The General Assembly may want to consider amending statute to establish a statutory purpose and performance measures for the Bullion and Coin Exemption. PRECIOUS METAL BULLION AND COIN EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY | JULY 2021 | 2021 -TE22 KEY CONCLUSION : The exemption is commonly applied by bullion and coin dealers to provide similar tax treatment to purchases of bullion and coins as other investments, such as stocks and bonds, which are also not subject to sales and use tax . The exemption also helps the State's bullion and coin retail industry to remain competitive with retailers in other states, most of which have a similar exemption. 3112 PRECIOUS METAL BULLI ON AND COIN EXEMPTIO N PRECIOUS METAL BULLION AND COIN EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The Precious Metal Bullion and Coin Exemption (Bullion and Coin Exemption) exempts all sales, storage, use, or consumption of precious metal bullion and coins from state sales and use tax [Section 39- 26- 706(4), C.R.S .]. Precious metal bullion is defined in statute as \"any precious metal...that has been put through a process of refining and is in such a state or condition that its value depends upon its precious metal content and not its form\" [Section 39- 26-102(6.5), C.R.S.]. Coins are defined in statute as \"monetized bullion or other forms of money manufactured from gold, silver, platinum, palladium, or other such metals now, in the future, or heretofore designated as a medium of exchange under the laws of this state, the United States, or any foreign nation\" [Section 39- 26-102(2.6), C.R.S.]. Other numismatic m oney, tokens, checks, and wampum, are not eligible for the exemption. Further more , the exemption only applies to sales and use tax, and individuals may be liable for income tax on any capital gains they realize through acquiring and selling bullion and coi ns. Th e Bullion and Coin Exemption was originally enacted in 1990 with House Bill 90-1124 and, at that time , was limited to transactions that were \"substantially equivalent to transactions in securities or commodities through a national securities or commodities exchange\" or \"through any person who is registered pursuant to the federal 'Commodity Exchange Act' .\" The original exemption expired in 1995; however, in 1999, H ouse Bill 99-1009 reintroduced the exemption and expanded it to include all transactions of precious metal bullion and coins , removing the requirement that the transaction be equivalent to a transaction in securi ties or commodities . As a result, bullion and coin 3123 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT retailers and purchasers who were not securities or exchange traders could claim the exemption as well. R etailers apply the Bullion and Coin Exemption at the point of sale and report exempt sales on schedule A, Line 12 of the Department of Revenue's (Department) Retail Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0100) . Retailers selling items that qualify for exemption are responsible for determining whether purchases are exempt based on statutory and regulatory requirements. Statute [Section 29-2- 105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.] requires local governments that have their sales and use taxes collected by the State to provide the exemption for their local sales taxes; however, home -rule cities and counties that collect their own sa les and use tax can choose whether to allow the exemption. Only three (Aurora, Broomfield, and Centennial) of Colorado's 15 most populous home - rule cities and counties have exempted bullion and coins from their jurisdiction's sales and use taxes. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? S tatute does not directly state the intended benef iciaries of the Bullion and Coin Exemption. Based on the statutory language of the exemption, conversations with stakeholders, and testimony provided to the General Assembly when this exemption was first enacted and then reintroduced , we inferred that the intended beneficiaries are investors in precious metal bullion and coins, as well as the Colorado precious metal bullion and coin industry . Committee testimony indicated that the General Assembly intended this exemption to benefit the precious metal bullion and coin industry in Colorado by making the state a more attractive location for investors, dealers, and coin shows and exhi bitions. According to an industry association, Colorado has approximately 50 coin dealers and , in 2017, hosted a national coin show in Denver. Addi tionally, t he U.S. Mint (Mint) is the largest producer of bullion and coins in the world. As a federal agenc y, the Mint does not collect sales and use tax on its sales regardless of state law governing sales of bullion and coins. However, t he Mint does not sell bullion to the public directly. 3134 PRECIOUS METAL BULLI ON AND COIN EXEMPTIO N Instead, it sells bullion to authorized dealers who apply the exemption when they sell to the general public. The Mint also sells commemorative coins directly to the public, which are considered legal tender in the United States , but might be worth more than their face value due to their rarity, appearance, or historical sig nificance . WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? S tatute does not state a purpose of the Bullion and Coin Exemption; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on our review of statute, legislative history, and legislative testimony, we considered the following potential purposes: 1) Pr ovide purchases of precious metal bullion and coins similar tax treatment as purchases of other assets, s uch as stocks and bonds, that are used as investmen ts. During legislative committee hearings when the exemption was established, s ome legislators and stakeholders raised concerns about Colorado's tax code treatinginvestments in bullion and coins differently than other investmentassets. Other investments, such as stocks and bonds, are considered capital assets, which are not subject to sales and use tax under Colorado law [ Section 39- 26-104, C.R.S. ] and investors are generally only taxed on capital gains they realize when they sell theassets . Further more , a sales tax can discourage investments in tangible property , such as metal bullion and coins , since buyer s often intend to resell the property in the future and may be required to collect sales tax on subsequent sales. 2) S upport Colorado's precious metal bullion and coin industry. At the time the exemption was established, legislators and stakeholdersalso raised concerns about the negative impact on the industry fromsales and use tax. Stakeholders reported that purchasers can easilybuy items from sellers in states that have a sales tax exemption.Therefore, legislators were concerned that imposing a sales tax onpurchases made in Colorado was resulting in consumers choosing tobuy bullion and coins from out -of-state sellers. 3145 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? W e could not definitively determine whether the Bullion and Coin Exemption is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided in statute or the enacting legislation. However, we found that it is meeting the potential purposes we considered in order to conduct this evaluation. S tatute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for the exemption. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measures to determine th e extent to which the exemption is meeting its potential purposes: PER FORMANCE MEASURE # 1: To what extent is the exemption applied to eligible purchases of precious metal bullion and coins? R ESULT: Although we could not quantify the extent to which t he exemption is used due to a lack of data, w e spoke with five dealers and one national business association that confirmed the exemption is applied to transactions of bullion and coins , and retailers and purchasers are widely aware of the exemption. Stakeholders reported that the exemption is applied both when purchases are made from coin dealers and when purchases are made from private parties , such as at coins shows . Therefore, it appears that in practice bullion and coin purchases are exempt from sales and use tax like purchases of other investment assets. PERFORMANCE MEASURE #2: To what extent has the exemption supported Colorado's precious metal bullion and coin industry ? RESULT: We found the expenditure supports the bullion and coin industry in the state . Although we lacked data necessary to quantify the overall impact of the exemption on the industry, the exemption reduces the after -tax cost of bullion and coins by 2.9 percent, which equates to about $29 dollars on a $1,000 sale. W hile purchasers directly benefit 3156 PRECIOUS METAL BULLI ON AND COIN EXEMPTIO N by not having to pay sales tax, the exemption likely benefits both dealers and purchasers to some extent. Specifically, because 3 3 of the 44 other states with a sales tax provide a similar exempt ion, including six of the seven states bordering Colorado, individuals might otherwise avoid making purchases from dealers in Colorado due to the increased after - tax cost. To avoid this, dealers would likely face pressure to absorb some or all of the cost of the sales tax by lowering their prices. This could be the case for precious metal bullion in particular because its value is largely driven by commodity prices for metals and it is fungible and readily available to investors . According to industry stakeholders, the exemption is an important support because coin and bullion dealers typically operate on small margins and w ould have difficulty absorbing the additional sales tax cost. Further more , according to data provided by an industry association, dealer s in st ates without an exemption have significantly lower sales than in states with an exemption. The dealers believe that sales taxes resulted in customers making fewer purchases and for lower amounts. D espite the exemption providing some support to the industry , bullion and coin dealers are still required to collect and remit local sales taxes if they sell bullion or coins in a self-collected home -rule jurisdiction that does not provide the exemption. Approximately half of the Colorado dealers listed on a national association's website are lo cated in a self - collected, home -rule jurisdiction without an exemption. The municipal sales tax rates of these jurisdictions range from 3 to 4.81 percent. Therefore, dealers in these jurisdictions likely have to colle ct and remit sales tax on some of their sales. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? B ecause the Department does not collect data on the Bullion and Coin Exemption, we were not able to estimate the exemption's revenue impact to the State or the potential economic benefits it provides. However, according to data provided by an industry association, the average coin and bullion dealer in states with an exemption has about 3167 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT $1 million in annual sales in their state. Without the exemption, a dealer with $1 million in annual sales in Colorado would otherwise be required to collect $29,000 in sales taxes. Further, according to stakeholders , the exemption is also an important factor in determining where t o hold coin shows and conventions, which provide indirect economic benefits such as increased retail, food, and lodging sales (and sales tax collections) from the visitors they attract to the state . WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? R emoving the exemption would increase the after -tax cost for purchases of bullion and coins in Colorado, equivalent to the state sales and use tax rate of 2.9 percent. For example, at the time of this evaluation one troy ounce of silver bullion cost approximately $20 . If the exemption was repealed, purchasers would be required to pay $0. 58 in sales tax on the purchase of one troy ounce of silver bullion. All five of the dealers and the national business association we spoke to reported that the exemption is critical to the industry and that its repeal would have a substantial impact on their business. Specifically, they stated that their customers are price- sensitive and without the exemption would likely make purchases from dealers in other states. In addition, the Mint is the largest coin producer in the country and, as a federal agency, does not collect sales tax regardless of state laws. Dealers felt the exemption allowed them to remain competitive in a national market where many other dealers do not collect sales tax. For this reason , they reported that without the exemption , Colorado business es would be significantly smaller and, in some cases, would not be profitable enough to continue or would need to move to another state that maintains a sales tax exemption. Additionally, a national industry association that has held trade shows in Colorado in the past and plans to do so in the future reported that removing the exemption would result in them moving their events to another state that provides an exemption. Al though eliminating the exemption could reduce industry sales in the state, about half of the dealers in the state and at least one recent large convention were located in home -rule jurisdictions that do not provide 3178 PRECIOUS METAL BULLI ON AND COIN EXEMPTIO N a Bullion and Coin Exemption. The sales taxes in these locations ranged from 3 to 4.81 percent. Thus, it appears that some dealers' are less sensitive to sales taxes and choose to operate in jurisdictions that collect sales taxes, though we were unable to quantify the sales volume of the dealers in these areas or determine the specific types of products they sell. If the exemption were eliminated , Colorado residents would also be required to remit use tax to the State if they make a purchase of bullion or coins from an out -of-state vendor that does not collect and remit Colorado sales tax. However, compliance with use tax remittance is typically lower than sales tax remittance, so the State is unlikely to collect as much in use tax as it would in sales tax on purchases made within Colorado. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? T here are 45 states, including Colorado, that levy sales and use taxes. Of these states, 3 3 have a similar exemption . However, 13 states limit the exemption to transactions that are more than a minimum amount, such as $1,000, or are substantially equivalent to a commodities investment transaction. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? W e did not identify an y tax expenditures or programs with a similar purpose available in the state. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURE ? The Department of Revenue was not able to provide us with data for the Bullion and Coin Exemption because this information is not itemized on the Department's Retail Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100) or the Retailer's Use Return ( Form DR 0173). Instead, the exemption is claimed on the same line as several other exemptions which cannot be separated for analysis. Finally, transactions between private sellers who are not required to obtain a sales tax license are not typically reported 3189 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT to the Department, so it does not have any information on the extent or value of these sales. If the General Assembly determined that more information on this tax expenditure is necessary, it could direct the Department to collect information specifically for the Bullion and Coins Exemption on the Retail Sales Tax Return, require private parties to report sales, and make changes in GenTax, its tax processing and information system, to allow it to pull this data. However, according to the Department, this would require additional resources to make changes t o the form and complete the necessary programming in GenTax (see the Tax Expenditures Overview section of th e Office of the State Auditor 's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department data and the potential c osts of addressing the limitations). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATUTORY PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FO R THE BULLION AND COIN EXEMPTION . Statute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not state the exemption's purpose or provide performance measures for evaluating its effectiveness. Therefore, for the purposes of our evaluation, we considered two potential purpose s for the exemption: 1) provide purchases of precious metal bullion and coins similar tax treatment as purchases of other assets, s uch as stocks and bonds, that are used as investment s; and 2) support Colorado's precious metal bullion and coin industry. We identified this purpose based on our review of statute, the legislative history, and legislative testimony. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the exemption by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure(s) in statute. Thi s would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the exemption's purpose and allow our office to assess the extent to which the exemption is accomplishing its intended goal(s). 319320TAX TYPE Sales and use YEAR ENACTED 1979 and 2016 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE NoneREVENUE IMPACT $333.6 million (TAX YEAR 2019) - combined NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine WHAT DO THE TAX EXPENDITURE S DO?

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Statute and the enacting legislation for the Food for Home Consumption Exemption do not state its purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent.

The legislative declaration for the Food for Retirement Communities Exe mption states that its intended purpose \"is to clarify that food purchased and provided as part of a meal plan to residents of a retirement community is exempt from sales and use tax as food for domestic home consumption, and clarifying that the packaging used in presenting that food to a resident of a retirement community is exempt from sales and use tax under the existing exemption for food packaging.\" WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider establishing a statutory purpose and performance measures for the Food for Home Consumption exemption. FOOD FOR HOME CONSUMPTION & RETIREMENT COMMUNITI ES EXEMPTION S EVALUATION SUMMARY | APRIL 2021 | 2021-TE 11 KEY CONCLUSION : The exemption s appear to be effective at exempting food for home consumption and food sold to residents of retirement communities from sales and use tax. 3212 FOOD FOR HOME CONSUM PTION & RETIREMENT COMMUNITI ES EXEMPTIONS FOOD FOR HOME CONSUMPTION & RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES EXEMPTIONS EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT ARE THE SE TAX EXPENDITURE S? This evaluation covers two sales tax provisions related to food sold to consumers, as follow s: FOOD FOR HOME CONSUMPTION EXEMPTION [SECTIONS 39-26- 707(1)( e) AND (2)(d) AND 714(2), C.R.S.] \u2014Statut e exempts from sales and use tax most food that is purchased for home consumption and consumed off the premises where the purchase was made. Although food sold at restaurants is not eligible for the exemption regardless of where it is to be consumed, food sold by all other types of vendors, such as grocery stores, convenience stores, gas stations, and vending machines, is exempt if it falls within the statutory definition of exempt food, specified in Sections 39 -26-102(4.5), 707(1)(e) and 707(2)(d), C.R.S ., which ties to items eligible for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but makes a number of exclusions forstate sales tax purposes. E XHIBIT 1 provides a summary of items that are exempt an d non- exempt , according to statute and Departme nt of Revenue guidance . 3223 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT EXHIBIT 1.

Additionally, unde r Section 29-2- 105(1) (d)(I)(C) , C.R.S., statutory and home -rule local governments that have their sales taxes collected by the State may choose whether to apply the exemption to their local sales taxes, which most have chosen to do. The Colorado Constitution [Article XX, Section 6] allows home -rule cities and counties to set their own tax policy. Of the 10 most populous home -rule cities and counties , six have adopted an exemption for food for home consumption and one taxes food at a lower rate than other types of items. In addition, one of the six home -rule cities also exempts food sold through vending machines from local sales and use tax. The exemption was ena cted in 1979 by House Bill 79 -1611. Starting in 2000, House Bill 99 -1015 established that sales of food from vending machines are eligible for the exemption, using the same definition of food, and in 2010 , House Bill 10 -1191 excluded candy and soft drinks from the list of eligible food , regardless of where they are sold . The exemption is typi cally applied by vendors at the time food is sold. Food vendors report the exemption on their Retail Sa les Tax Return (Form DR 0100) using L ine 1 of Schedule B . FOOD FOR RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES EXEMPTION [SECTION 39-26- 707(1)( (2)(e)(I)(A), C.R.S FOOD FOR HOME CONSUM PTION & RETIREMENT COMMUNITI ES EXEMPTIONS food packaging from sales and use tax if it is consumed by residents on the premises of a retirement community , which includes assisted- living residences, nursing -care facilities, and independent -living facilities that serve as the primary residence for people age 55 and older . In this context , exempt food includes prepared foods, such as salads and sandwiches, in addition to the foods exempted by the Food for H ome Consumption Exemption. The Food for Retirement Communities Exemption was enacted in 2016 with H ouse Bill 16-1187 and has remained unchanged since. Statute [Section 2 9-2-105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.] requires local governments whose sales taxes are collected by the State to also exempt food for retirement communities from their sales and use taxes. Article XX, Section 6 of the Colorado Constitution allows self -collected home- rule cities and counties to set their own tax policy. Of the 10 most populous home -rule cities and counties, none have adopted an exemption that specifically excludes food sold to residents of retirement hom es from local sales and use tax; however, it is possible that some of these local government s interpret an exemption for food sold for home consumption to include food sold to residents of retirement home s as well. Food vendors, typi cally operators of el igible retirement communities, claim the exemption on their Retail Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100) using Line 12 of Schedule A. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Statute does not directly state the intended beneficiaries of either exemption. Based on its operation and eligible food items, we considered the intended beneficiaries of the Food for Home Consumption Exemption to be individuals who purchase food from retailers, such as grocery stores, to consume at home . In addition, we determined that indirect beneficiaries are the retailers that sell food for 3245 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT home consumption , since consumers ma y purchase additional food due to the reduced after -tax cost of food provided by the exemption. Based on i ts operation and le gislative testimony at the time it was established , we considered the intended beneficiaries of the Food for Retirement Communities Exemption to be individuals who reside in eligible retirement communities . In addition, we determined that indirect benefici aries are the facilities in which eligible elderly individuals reside. These facilities benefit administratively by not having to collect and remit state sales tax on sales of food to their residents. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE SE TAX EXPENDITURE S? Statute and the enacti ng legislation for the Food for Home Consumption Exemption do not state its purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. B ased on the operation of the Food for Home Consumption Exemption, we considered a potential purpose: to avoid applying sales and use tax on purchases of basic necessities, which are commonly exempted in Colorado and other states. Other necessities , such as energy used at a residence and prescription drugs , are also exempt from sales tax. Further, based on our review of tax policy literature, s ales tax exemptions for basic necessities are commonly intended to avoid placing a disproportionate sales tax burden on individuals with lower incomes, since these ind ividuals tend to spend a larger share of their income on these items . The legislativ e declaration for the Food for Retirement Communitie s Exemption states that its intended purpose \"is to clarify that food purchased and provided as part of a meal plan to residents of a retirement community is exempt from sales and use tax as food for domestic home consumption, and clarifying that the packaging us ed in presenting that food to a resident of a retirement community is exempt from sales and use tax under the existing exemption for food packaging.\" According to the legislative declaration, at the time the bill was enacted, retirement communities had not typically been charging 3256 FOOD FOR HOME CONSUM PTION & RETIREMENT COMMUNITI ES EXEMPTIONS sales tax on the food they provided to residents, but the Department of Revenue had issued a private letter ruling indicating that the items were subject to sales tax. ARE THE TAX EXPENDITURE S MEETING THEIR PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? W e could not definitively determine whether the Food fo r Home Consumption Exemption is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided for it in statute or its enacting legislation. However, we found that it is meeting the potential purpose we considered in order to conduct this evaluation because food vendors are aware of the exemption and apply it to eligible sales . In addition, we found that the Food for Retirement Communities Exemption is meeting its purpose because it is likely applied as intended to treat eligible sales in retirement communities the same as food purchased for home consumption. S tatute does not provide quantifiable perform ance measures for these exemptions . Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemptions are meeting t heir potential purpose: PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent are sales of food purchased for home consumption and sales of food provided to by retirement communities to their residents exempt from state sales and use tax? RESULT : Department of Revenue da ta indicate that the Food for Home Consumption Exemption was applied to about $11.5 billion in food sold by eligible taxpayers, including grocery and convenience stores, in Calendar Year 2019. Although we lacked data to estimate the proportion of all eligible sales made in the state to which the exemption was applied , stakeholders indicated that food retailers are generally aware of the exemption and apply it to most eligible sales. Specifically, we spoke with a food industry association representative who had contacted four grocers of different sizes as part of their preparation for our interview. We also spoke with a representative for a 3267 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT gas/convenience store association that represents approximately 1,700 stores in Colorado. The representatives repor ted that grocers, convenience stores, and gas stations are aware of the exemptions and rely on their point -of-sale systems to ensure the correct items are exempt. Larger retailers typically have staff who are responsible for programming the ir systems to no t collect s tate and /or local sales tax es, when applicable . Smaller grocery stores will typically contract with a point -of-sale provider who is responsible for ensuring the grocer is compliant with s tate and local sales tax laws as part of their contract. We also spoke with a vending machine association that represents vending machines operators and a large wholesaler of vending machine products in the state that reported its members are aware of the exemption and apply it to eligible items that they sell. I n addition, we spoke to a stakeholder representing most of the retirement communities in the state who indicated that retirement communities exempt eligible sales from tax as intended. Although we could not determine that all retirement communities are a ware of the exemption, it appears likely that most eligible beneficiaries receive the exemption, as intended , because the legislative history and declaration for the exemption indicate that , at the time the exemption was created , it was not a common practi ce to collect sales tax on meals (and packaging included with meals) provided to residents of retirement communities. WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE S? The Department of Revenue reported that in Tax Year 2019 the Food for Home Consumption Exemption resulted in about $333.6 million in foregone revenue to the State. Although, the Department of Revenue reported that a portion of this revenue impact , which is drawn from the amount taxpayers reported on their Sales and Use Tax R eturn, is likely attributable to the Food for Retirement Communities Exemption, it was not able to provide data necessary to separate out the revenue impact for the two exemptions . However, b ased on information provided by 3278 FOOD FOR HOME CONSUM PTION & RETIREMENT COMMUNITI ES EXEMPTIONS stakeholders , we estimate about $ 2.9 million of the $333.6 million (0.9 percent) of foregone revenue was due to the Food for Retirement Communities Exemption. Specifically, stakeholders estimated that nursing homes and assisted living facilities spent about $100 million annually on food for their residents, which we multiplied by the 2.9 percent state sales tax rate. I n addition, home -rule and statutory c ities and counties that have their sales taxes collected by the State have the option of taxing food that is exempt from state sales tax. According to the Department of Revenue, 76 counties, municipalities, and special districts have adopted the F ood for Home Consumption Exemption, though only 37 exempt vending machine sales . We estimated that the local governments that have adopted the Food for Home Consumption Exemption collected $31.9 million less in sales taxes in Tax Year 2019 as result of the exemption . We developed this estimate by multiplying the estimated $11.5 billi on of food sales eligible for the Food for Home Consumption Exemption by the 1.32 percent average population- weighted sales tax rate of local governments that had adopted the exemptions. However, the actual impact is probably slight ly less because the amount includes food sold through vending machines, which , as noted above, not all local government s exempt, and food sold in retirement communities. However, we did not have data to determine what portion is attributable to eac h of these types of food sales. F urther, home -rule cities and counties that collect their own sales tax are not required to apply the Food for Home Consumption Exemption and Food for Retirement Communities Exemption. We reviewed the sales taxes of the 10 largest h ome rule cities and counties and found that six exempt food from sales tax, one taxes food at a lower rate, and three do not provide a similar exemption. We also found that none of the home -rule cities and counties explicitly exempt meals that retirement communities provide to residents ; however, it is possible that some local government s consider food sold to residents of retirement communities as food for home consumption. Sales tax rates in the cities that tax food for home consumption ranged from 2.25 percent to 8.6 percent , 3289 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT indicating that consumers in some areas of the state pay sales taxes on food purchases despite the State's exemption . WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE S HAVE ON BENEFICIARI ES? FOOD FOR HOME CONSUMPTION EXEMPTION \u2014If this exemption were eliminat ed, it would result in an increase of 2.9 percent in the after -tax price of eligible food products for consumers. Since food for home consumption is a necessity, the increase would impact most Coloradans. However, according t o U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates , households in the lowest 20 percent income group spend 3 6 percent of their income on food compared to 8 percent for households in the highest 20 percent income group. Therefore, eliminating the exemption would likely have a more significant impact on households with lower income. The average low -income household spends about $4, 400 on food per year, which would increase by about $12 8, to $4, 528, if the State eliminated the exemption. FOOD FOR RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES EXEMPTION \u2014If th is exemption were eliminated, nursing facilities, assisted -living centers , and facilities serving as a permanent residence for people 55 and older that provide food for their residents would be required to assess and remit the state sales tax of 2.9 percent on the sales of prepared and unprepared food. According to an association that represents these facilities, elderly residents who pay for their own care would likely see a corresponding increase in the amount they are charged for food. However, facilities would have to absorb the additional cost for residents whose care is paid for by Medicaid, which accounts for about 65 percent of residents, since Medicaid pays a pre- determined , fixed amount for each resident's care. Similar to the Food for Home Consumption Exemption, the impact of eliminating the exemption would likely be more significant for residents of retirement communities that have lower incomes. 32910 FOOD FOR HOME CONSUM PTION & RETIREMENT COMMUNITI ES EXEMPTIONS ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES ? F orty-five states, including Colorado, have sales and use tax. Of these 45 states, 32 have an exemption for food for home consumption. Other states ' statutes are not always explicit about whether food from vending machines are part of food for home consumption exemptions , but w e identified 16 states that specifically exempt sales of food f rom vending machines . In addition, similar to Colorado, 26 stat es with a sales tax exempt food sold by retirement communities . ARE THERE TAX EXPEND ITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE IN THE STATE ? FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP) AND WOMEN , INFANTS , AND CHILDREN (WIC) PROGRAM \u2014SNAP and W IC provide beneficiaries with food stamps/vouchers they can use to purchase food for home consumption from food retailers, such as grocery or convenience stores, or at assisted living communities, such as retirement homes and drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers, where they are residents. According to the Colorado Department of Human Services, Coloradans were issued $1.05 billion in SNAP benefits in Calendar Year 2020 and, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Coloradans spent $48.2 million in WIC benefits in Calendar Year 2020. Federal law requires all sales of food made under these programs to be exempt from sales tax and Colorado has codified this requirement in Section 39- 26-707(1) , C.R.S. We estimate that the exemption of SNAP/WIC from state sales taxes reduced food costs for program recipients in 2020 by about $31.9 million, which we estimated by multiplying the $1.1 billion in total SNAP/WIC benefits in Colorado by the State's sales tax rate of 2.9 percent. Although this exemption generally overlaps with the Food for Home Consumption Exemption, SNAP/WIC allow program recipients to purchase some food items, such as prepared sandwiches, salads, soft drinks, and candy, which would not be exempt from sales tax under the Food for Home Consumption Exemption, but that must be exempted under the federal law and Section 39- 26-707(1), C.R.S. 33011 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT A lthough this provision is similar to the Food for Home Consumption Exemption, because federal law require s the State to exempt these purchases, we did not consider this provision to be a tax expenditure for the purposes of our evaluations ( see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on how we determined which provisions are tax expenditures) . FOOD & BEVERAGE PACKAGING EXEMPTION -Section 39- 26-707(1)(c) and (2)(b) , C.R.S., provides a sales and use tax exemption for essential food packaging that is provided to the cons umer as part of the sale of food, so long as the purchase is subject to sales tax and the seller does not separately charge for the food packaging. Essential packaging includes items such as plates, cups, bowls, vending machine cups, disposable containers (i.e. pizza boxes), and clamshells for carry out. Nonessential items are assessed sales tax , with retailers paying the tax if they provide the items to the customers free of charge, and include utensils, skewers, napkins, serving trays, grocery bags, straw s, cup sleeves, and single serving condiments offered at convenience counters. FOOD SERVICE EMPLOYER -PROVIDED MEALS SALES TAX EXEMPTION - Section 39- 26-707(2)(a), C.R.S. , provides a sales tax exemption for restaurant meals when the meal is provided to an employee of the restaurant or is provided to the employee at a discount. INGREDIENTS AND COMPONENT PARTS FOR FOOD MANUFACTURING EXEMPTION -Section 39- 26-102(20) (b), C.R.S., exempts ingredients and other ma terials, such as molds, casings, and chemicals, used in processing or manufacturing food products , which will later be sold to consumers , from state sales and use tax. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINT S IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXP ENDITURE S? The Department of Revenue could not provide data showing the revenue impact for the Food for Retirement Communities Exemption 33112 FOOD FOR HOME CONSUM PTION & RETIREMENT COMMUNITI ES EXEMPTIONS because retirement communit ies typically report the sales that qualify for the exemption on the same line as other sales and use t ax exemptions. Specifically, they report these sales on Schedule A, Line 12 of the Department of Revenue's Retail Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100) . This line is also where retailers report over a dozen other exempt sales and this information cannot be disaggregated for analysis. Further, according to the Department of Revenue, some taxpayers may have reported qualifying sales on Line 1 of Schedule B of Form DR 0100 , which is the same line used to report the Food for Home Consumption Exemption and these amounts cannot be disaggregated for the purposes of analysis. If the General Assembly wants additional information on the exemption, it could consider instructing the Department of Revenue to add a reporting line for the expenditure to the Retail Sales Tax Return form. GenTax , the Department's tax processing and information system , would also have to be reconfigured to collect and extract this data; h owever, according to the Department of Revenue, this type of change would require additional resources to develop the form and complete the necessary programming in GenTax (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING ST ATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATU TORY PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FO R THE FOOD FOR HOME CONSUMPTION EXEMPTION . As discussed, statute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not state the exemptio n's purpose or provide performance measures for evaluating its effectiveness. Therefore, for the purposes of our evaluation, we considered the following potential purpose: to avoid applying sales and use tax on purchases of basic necessities, which are commonly exempted in Colorado and other states. For example , other necessities , such as energy used at a residence and prescription drugs , are also exempt from 33213 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT sales tax. Further, base d on our review of tax policy literature , sale tax exemptions for basic necessities are commonly intended to avoid placing a disproportionate sales tax burden on individuals with lower incomes since these individuals tend to spend a larger share of their income on these items. We also developed one performance measure to assess t he extent to which the exemption is meeting its potential purpose. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the exemption by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure(s) in statute. This would eliminate pot ential uncertainty regarding the exemption' s purpose and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the exemption is accomplishing its intended goal(s). 333334TAX TYPE Sales and use YEAR ENACTED 1982 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE NoneREVENUE IMPACT $238 million (CALENDAR YEAR 2016) NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine WHAT DOES THIS TAX E XPENDITURE DO? The Food Ingredients Exemption (Ingredients Exemption) [Section s 39-26-102(20)(b) (I) and 39-26-713(2)(b) and (e), C.R.S.] exempts purchases of food ingredients from sales and use tax when the ingredients will be used to prepare or manufacture food products that will ultimately be sold for human consumption. WHAT IS THE PURPOS E OF THIS TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute and the ena cting legislation for the Ingredients Exemption do not explicitly state its purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the exemption, conversations with stake holders, and legislative history, we considered a potential purpose : to ensure that sales tax is only applied to purchases made by final consumers instead of at multiple steps through a food product's production and distribution. WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Ass embly may want to consider establishing a statutory purpose and performance measures for the exemption. FOOD INGREDIENTS EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY | APRIL 2021 | 2021 -TE10 KEY CONCLUSION: The exemption appea rs to be effective at exempting purchases of food ingredients used to prepare or manufacture food sold to consumers from sales and use tax. 3352 FOOD INGREDIENTS EXE MPTION FOOD INGREDIENTS EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The Food Ingredients Exemption (Ingredients Exemption) [Section s 39- 26-102(20)(b) (I) and 39- 26-713(2)(b) and (e) , C.R.S.] exempts purchases of food ingredients from sales and use tax, when the ingredients will be used to prepare or manufacture food products that will ultimately be sold for human consumption . To be eligible for the exemption, the ingredient s must either become an \"integral or constituent \" part of the food or be \"a chemical, solvent, agent, mold skin casing, or other material\" that is unfit for further use after the food is processed . For example , when a bakery buys flour from a flour mill, the bakery does not pay taxes on the purchased flour. Instead, sales taxwould be collected at the time the baker y item is sold at retail. Both food manufacturers and restaurants that make eligible purchases canclaim the exemption. The Ingredients Exemption was created in 1982 when House Bill 82 - 1168 explicitly made sales of ingredients used in food manufacturing and preparation eligible for the broader Wholesales Exemption [Section 39-26-102(19)(a), C.R.S .], which exempts goods that are purchased for resale or to be incorporated into a final product , which will later be sold to consumers. There have been no amendments to the Ingredients Exemption since it was created . U nder the exemption, food ingredients are also exempt from local sales and use taxes in statutory and home rule cities and counties that have their sales taxes collected by the State. Statute [Section 29 -2- 105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.] requires local governments that have their sales taxes collected by the State to apply most of the State's tax exemptions, including the Ingredients Exemption . Conversely, h ome-rule cities 3363 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT established under Article XX, Section 6 of the Colorado Constitution that collect their own sales and use tax have the authority to set their own tax policies independent from the State and ar e not required to exempt food ingredients from their local sales and use tax. However, the 15 most populous cities in Colorado, which are all self -collected home rule cities, also exempt wholesale sales, including food ingredients, from local sales tax. V endors apply the exemption at the time of sale and use the Department of Revenue's Retail Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100) , Line 1 of Schedule A , to report all wholesale transactions that have been exempted from retail sales tax , including those for food ingredients . If a vendor does not apply the exemption to an eligible sale, purchasers may submit a Claim for Refund of Tax Paid to Vendors ( Form DR 0137B) to the Departmen t to request a refund. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? S tatute does not directly state the intended beneficiaries of th e Ingredients Exemption. Based on the operation of the tax expenditure and discussions with stakeholders , we considered the intended beneficiaries of this exemption to be food manufactur ers and dining establishments like restaurants and snack bars, because it reduces the after-tax cost of the ingredients they use in the food manufacturing and preparation proces s. We also consider ed food consumers to be indirect beneficiaries of t his exemption because it may reduce food prices to the extent food manufacturers pass the ir tax savings on to consumers in the form of lower prices . A ccording to data from the U.S. Census Bureau' s Economic Census , Colorado had about 830 food manufacturers in Calendar Year 2017. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Manufacturer s, the food manufacturing industry contribute d about $2.4 billion to the State's economy , about 0.7 percent of the statewide Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in Calendar Year 2016, the most recent 3374 FOOD INGREDIENTS EXE MPTION year with data available . Further, according to data from the Department of Labor and Employment , the State's food manufacturing industry employ ed about 23,000 people in Calendar Year 2018 , representing about 16 percent of all manufacturing employees in Colorado and about 1 percent of the S tate's entire workforce. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Economic Census, dining establishments made about $12.1 billion in sales in Colorado in Calendar Year 2017 and, according to the Colorado Restaurant Association, dining establishments employed about 285,000 people, about 10 percent of the state's workforce. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE ? S tatute and the enacting legislation for the Ingredients Exemption do not explicitly state its purpose ; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the exemption, conversations with stakeholders, and legislative history , we considered a potential purpose : to ensure that sales tax is only applied to purchases made by final consumers instead of at multiple steps through a food product's production and distribution. Similar structural provisions are common in states with a sales tax to prevent \"tax pyramiding ,\" which refers to a process that increases the effective sales tax rate on a good by taxing its inputs and the transactions that occur prior to its final sale to a consumer. In addition to increasing the effective sales tax on a good, tax pyramiding can create economic distortions, for example favoring manufacturers with smaller supply chains . It can also hide the full cost of sales taxes from consumers if businesses increase prices to account for sales taxes at earlier steps in the production chain. At the time the Ingredients Exemption was created , most purchases of food ingredients appear to have already been exempt under the broader Wholesales Exemption, which exempts purchases of component parts incorporated into a final product from sales tax. Therefore, the Ingredients Exemption may have been intended to cla rify that certain goods, such as chemicals and molds or casings, which are consumed by 3385 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT manufacturers during t he manufacturing process and not physically incorporated into the final food product, are also exempt. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? W e could not defi nitively determine whe ther the Ingredients Exemption is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided in statute or its enacting legislation. However, we found that it is likely meeting the purpose we considered in order to conduct this evaluation. S tatute does not provide quantifiable performance measures for this tax expenditure . Therefore, w e created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemption is meeting its potential purpose. PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent is the Ingredients Exemption applied to eligible purchases of foo d ingredients ? RESULT : Overall, we found evidence that vendors commonly apply the Ingredients Exemption to eligible sales. The Department of Revenue was not able to provide data on the quantity of food ingredients exempted from sales tax or how frequently the exemption is taken because vendors report exempt sales using the same reporting line as the broader Wholesales Exemption, which cannot be disaggregated for analysis . How ever, we spoke with three large food manufacturers in the state, who all reported that they were aware of the exemption, that their vendors regularly apply it to their purchases of food ingre dients , and that it is critical to their businesses. They also reported that it is widely used in food manufacturing in Colorado , so it is likely that other manufacturers are also using the exemption as well. Further, we contacted a Colorado restaurant industry trade group , which indicated that restaurants' purchases of ingredients are commonly exempt from sales tax. 3396 FOOD INGREDIENTS EXE MPTION WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE ? Ba sed on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, we estimate that about $238 million in state revenue and about $ 177 million in local government revenue wa s foregone under this exemption in Calendar Year 2016, with food manufacturers and restaurants receiving a corresponding benefit. We arrived at the se estimates using the U.S. Census Bureau's 2016 Annual Survey of Manufactu rers, which indicate s that Colorado's food manufacturing industry, excluding animal food manufacturing (e.g., Purina dog and cat food) , expended $ 6.64 billion on materials in 2016. However, this amount includes costs for food ingredients as well as other costs, such as contract work, fuel and electricity, machinery, and packaging and component parts , which are not in cluded in the Ingredients E xemption (though exempt under other provisions) . For this reason, we used U.S. Census Bureau data on Colorado manufacturers' costs for the items not included in the exemption and information from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the cost of food packaging to estimate that approximately 71 percent of the materials costs for Colorado food manufacturers are for food ingredients. We then multiplied this percentage by food manufacturers ' $6.64 billion in materials costs to estimate that food ingredient s made up about $ 4.7 billion of these costs. We estimated the amount of food ingredients that dining establishments purchased in 2017 at $3.5 billion. We determined this by multiplying the U.S. Census Bureau's 2017 Economic Census estimate of about $12.1 billion for Colorado's dining establishments ' sales by an industry benchmark, provided in a 2020 restaurant industry study published by Baker Tilly, that food ingredients make up about 29 percent of restaurants' total sales . W e added the estimated $4.7 billion of food ingredients purchased by food manufacturers and the estimate d $3.5 billion of food ingredients purchased by dining establishments to arrive at a total of $8.2 billion. We multiplied th is amount by the state tax rate of 2.9 percent to 3407 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT estimate the state revenue impact and by the average population - weighted local tax rate for state -collected local governments of 2.16 percent to estimate the revenue impact to local governments . D ue to data constraints, our revenue impact estimate should be considered as an approximation showing the relative scale of the exemption as opposed to showing the amount of revenue the State would receive if it was not in place. As discussed, due to a lack of data, we estimated the exemption's revenue impact using several data sources . These sources use somewhat different definitions of the relevant terms and la ck the specificity necessary for a precise estimate. In addition, the U.S. Census Bureau reports data based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, which categorize all U.S. businesses according to their function. Because b usinesse s self-select their NAICS codes, it is unclear whether businesses have selected the best or most accurate code to describe their activities. Therefore, the estimate might contain some businesses that should not be included or might not include some food manufacturers who reported under a different NAICS code. I n addition, we calculated our revenue impact for the Ingredients Exemption without taking into account the impact of other tax expenditures. Because the Wholesales Exemption significantly overlaps with the Ingredients E xemption, most of the purchases included in our estimate would still be exempt even if the Ingredients Exemption was no longer in place . Therefore, the unduplicated revenue impact for the Ingredients Exemption is likely much smaller than our estimate above, though we lacked data to quantify this. Further, we calculated our estimate using economic data from Calendar Year 2016. In 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic had a significant impact on the restaurant industry in Colorado, including the permanent and temporary closure of many restaurants across the state. As such, our revenue impact estimate is not likely reflective of the current state of the Colorado restaurant industry. 3418 FOOD INGREDIENTS EXE MPTION WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIA RIES? E liminating the Ingredients Exemption would likely have a limited impact, since most sales of food ingredients are also covered by the Wholesales Exemption. However, if the Ingredients Exemption was not in place, it may not be clear whether some goods, like chemicals and mold casings that are consumed by manufacturers as part of the food manufa cturing process, but which are not physically incorporated into the final product, are eligible for a sales tax exemption. If these purchases were subject to sales tax, it would increase the sales and use taxes paid by food manufacturers and restaurants to the extent that they use these products when processing food. Under these circumstances, all the stakeholders we spoke with sa id businesses would pass the ir increased costs due to taxes on to consumer s. ARE THERE SIMILAR TAX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES ? O f the 44 states (excluding Colorado) that le vy a sales tax, we found that 43 have tax expenditures that appear to exempt sales of food ingredients. However, we did not identify any other states that have an exemption explicitly for ingredients used in food prepared for retail sale ; instead all have general exemptions or deductions for ingredients and component parts used in manufacturing (similar to Colorado's treatment of such sales under the Wholesales Exemption). We only identified one state, Hawaii, which taxes these transaction s, though it does so at a reduced rate. ARE THERE TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE? C olorado provides several other sales and use tax exemptions t hat, like the Ingredients Exemption, aim to prevent tax pyramiding in the manufacturing industry. Specifically, ingredients and component parts used to manufacture goods are exempt from sales tax under the Wholesales Exemption [Section 39- 26-102(20(a), C.R.S.]. E nergy used for industrial and manufacturing purposes is also exempt from sales and 3429 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT use tax [Section 39- 26-102(21)(a), C.R.S.], as are purchases of manufacturing [Section 39- 26-709(1)(a)(II) and (1)(a)(IV), C.R.S.]. Similarly, certain materials used in the manufacturing or processing of iron, steel, and uranium -vanadium ores are exempt from sales and use 26-706(3), C.R.S.] . A dditionally, s everal other sales and use tax exemptions specifically relate to food. Colorado exempts purchases of food for home consumption [Section 39 -26-707(1)(e), C.R.S.] and food and beverage packaging from sales and tax [Section 39- C.R.S.] exempts food and food packaging consumed by residents on t he premises of a retirement community from sales and use tax. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURES? The Department of Revenue could not provide data on the use of the Ingredients Exemption. Specifically, vendors report sales that qualify for the exemption on the De partment's R etail Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0100) using the same line that they use to report all types of sales that qualify for the W holesale Sales Exemption, which covers a wide- variety of purchases, not just food ingredients. Additionally, the wholesale transaction information is not stored in a format that GenTax, the Department's tax processing and information system, can readily pull data from. Although we estimated the exemptions' revenue impact using U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Agriculture data, limitations in the data likely impact the accuracy of our estimate. If the General Assembly determined that a more accurate estimate is necessary, it could direct the Department of Revenue to collect information specifically on exempt food ingredients transactions as part of the Retail Sales Tax Return and make changes in GenTax to allow it to pull this data. However, according to the Department of Re venue, this would require additional resources to complete the necessary 34310 FOOD INGREDIENTS EXE MPTION programming in GenTax (see the Tax Expenditures Overview section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING ST ATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATUTORY PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE INGREDIENTS EXEMPTION . As discussed, statute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not state the exemption's purpose or provide performance measures for evaluating its effectiveness. Therefore, for the purposes of our evaluation, we considered a potential purpose for the exemption: to ensure that sales tax is only applied to purchases made by final consumers instead of at multiple steps through a food product's production and distribution. Further, because it appears that when the exemption was established , most sales that are eligible for this exemption were already eligible for the broader Wholesales Exemption, the Ingredients Exemption may have been intended to clarify that purchases of certain goods, such as chemical agents, molds, and casings, which are consumed during the manufacturing process, but not incorporated in the final product, are also exempt. We identified this purpose based on the operation of the exemption, conversations with stakeholders, and its legislative history . We also developed a performance measure to assess the extent to which the exemption is meeting this potential purpose. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the exemption by providin g a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure(s) in statute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the exemption's purpose and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the exemption is accomplishing its intended goal(s). 344TAX TYPE Sales and Use Tax YEAR ENACTED 1979 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE NoneREVENUE (TAX YEAR 2017) $45 million maximum NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine WHAT DOES THE TAX EX PENDITURE DO? The Machinery Used in Manufacturing Sales and Use Tax Exemption allows purchases greater than $500 of machinery used predominantly and directly in manufacturing to be exempt from taxation. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute and the enacting legislation do not state the exemption's purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on our review of legislative history and the current operation of the expenditure, our evaluation considered a potential purpose: to prevent the taxation of machinery purchased for direct use in manufacturing goods, since consumers must typically pay sales taxes on the finished goods. WHAT POLICY CONSIDER ATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider establishing a statutory purpose and performance measures for the exemption . MACHINERY USED IN MANUFACTURING EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY | JANUARY 2021 | 2021 -TE6 KEY CONCLUSION : The exemption is effective at preventing the taxation of machinery purchased for direct use in manufacturi ng goods . 3452 MACHINERY USED IN MA NUFACTURING EXEMPTIO N MACHINERY USED IN MANUFACTURING EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The Machinery Use d in Manufacturing Exemption (Machinery Exemption) [Section 39-26- 709(1)(II) and (2) , C.R.S. ] exempts purchase s of machinery, machine tools, and parts , directly and predominately used for manufacturing tangible personal property, from sales and use tax . Additionally , the purchase must be in excess of $500 and the items must be depreciable and have a useful life of at least one year. Purchases of used equipment are limited to $150,000 per year . The expenditure was created by House Bill 79- 1611 in 1979 and, through several amendments, was expanded to increase the benefit it provides manufacturers and the types of purchases that are eligible: House Bill 87- 1331 elim inated a $500,000 per year , per-taxpayer cap on the exemption that was included in the original provision. House Bill 88- 1201 ch anged the minimum eligible purchase amount from $1,000 in a calendar year to the current $500 per purchase. House Bill 96- 1333 expa nded the exemption, which had originally required the items to be used \"exclusively in manufacturing ,\" to allow items used \"predominately in manufacturing .\" Senate Bill 16 -124 adde d solid waste processing and diversion facilities that process recovered materials for remanufacturing, recycling , or reuse as eligible beneficiaries. 3463 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT House Bill 18- 1350 added scrap metal processors as eligible beneficiaries. To claim the exem ption, eligible beneficiaries must first file a declaration of e ntitlement (Form DR 1191 or DR 1192) with the Department of Revenue. Vendors then typically apply the exemption at the time of the sale. V endor s are generally required to report the amount they exempted using the Colorado Retail Sales Tax Return ( Form DR 0100) , which includes a line to enter exempt sales of machinery. If a manufacturer pays sales tax to a vendor for an eligible sale , the manufacturer can receive a refund for the sales tax paid by fil ing a Claim for Refund ( Form DR 0137B) with the Department. If a manufacturer makes an exempt purchase in another state and brings the equipment into Colorado, they are not required to report the amount exempt from use tax under the Machinery Exemption. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF TH E TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute does not dire ctly state the intended beneficiaries of the Machinery E xemption. B ased on its operation, we considered the intended beneficiarie s to be manufacture rs of tangible personal property , including those that process recovered materials for remanufacturing, recycling , or reuse . The m anufacturing industry is significant within the State's economy , including aerospace, medical supplies, ele ctronics, and food and beverage manufacturing. As of June 2019, Colorado's m anufactur ers employed about 148, 600 individuals, which is nearly 6 percent of all jobs in the state, and account ed for about $27 billion, or 7 percent, of the S tate's gross domestic product (GDP) in Calendar Year 2019. Vendors of eligibl e machinery and consumers of manufacture d goods may also be indirect beneficiaries of the exemption to the extent that it allows manufacturers to make additional purchases of machinery from vendors and offer their products to consumers at lower prices . 3474 MACHINERY USED IN MA NUFACTURING EXEMPTIO N WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? Statute and the e nacting legislation for the Manufacturing Exem ption do not state its purpose; therefore , we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on our analysis of the expenditure's legislative history and the current operation of the expenditure, we considered a potential purpose : to prevent the taxation of items purchased for direct use in manufacturing goods, s ince consumers typically must pay sales tax on the finished goods. This is consistent with other sales tax exemptions in the state, which exempt manufacturers' purchases of raw materials that they incorporate into a final product. Similar structura l provisions are common in states with a sales tax to prevent the tax from being applied at multiple stages of a good's manufacturing and distribution process, which is referred to as \"tax pyramiding .\" Tax pyramiding can increase the effe ctive tax on a consumer good to the extent that taxes on manufacturers' inputs are passed on to the final consumers of the ir products. IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO M AKE THIS DETERMINATION? We could not defini tively determine whether the Machinery Exemption is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided in statute or its enacting legislation. However, we found that it is likely meeting the potential purpose we considered in order to conduct this evaluation because purchases of eligible machinery are commonly exempt from sales and use tax . Statute does not prov ide quantifiable performance measures for the exemption. Therefore, we created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemption is meeting its potential purpose: 3485 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent are manufacturers using the Machinery Exemption to avoid paying sales and use tax on eligible purchases? RESULTS : We found that the exemption is widely applied to sales of manufacturing equipment in the state. Department of Revenue sales tax data show that 350 vendors applied the exemption to a total of $124 million in sales of eligible equipment in Calendar Year 2017. Because manufacturers may also claim a refund if a vendor collects sales tax on an eligible purchase and are not required to report the amount they claim as a consumer use tax exemption, the Department 's sales tax data do not include all eligible purchases. However, we spoke t o nine stakeholders who represent manufacture rs, manufacturing trade organizations , or vendors of machinery in the state and they indicated that most manufacturers are aware of and use the Machinery Exemption and vendors routinely apply it at the point of sale . WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDI TURE We estimate that the Machinery Exemption had a maximum revenue impact to the State of about $45 million in Calendar Year 2017 and provided a corresponding benefit to manufacturers . The Department of Revenue lacked the data necessary for us to determine the exemption's full revenue impact ; therefore, w e used economic data from the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate the potential impact . Specifically, the Census Bureau e stimates that in Calendar Year 2017, Colorado manufacturers spent a total of $1.56 billion on capital expenditures for machinery used in manufacturing in the state . We multiplied this amount by the State's 2.9 percent sales tax rate to arrive at a potential impact of $4 5 million. However, this amount likely overstates the true impact of the exemption to some degree because some of the capital expenditures included in the Census Bureau data are ineligible for the exemption. F or example , sales under $500 are included in the Census Bureau data, but do not qualify for the exemption, and 3496 MACHINERY USED IN MA NUFACTURING EXEMPTIO N manufacturers' capital expenditures could include items, such as office equipment, that are not directly used i n manufacturing and are thus, ineligible for the exemption. Further, the Census Bureau groups businesses in its data based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, which businesses self -select when they report to the Census Bureau and might be misreported . Additionally , the NAICS code for manufacturing is more comprehensive than the State's statutory definition of manufacturing , meaning that some businesses that would not qualify for the exemption may be included in the capital cost data we used . In addition to its im pact on state revenue, we also estimate that the Machinery Exemption had a maximum revenue impact of about $7.8 million in counties that had opted to apply it in Calendar Year 2017. Specifically, under Section 29-2- 105(1)(d)(I)(A) and (A.5), C.R.S., statutory and home -rule municipalities and counties that have their sales and use taxes collected by the State may choose to provide the Machinery Exemption, though they must explicitly adopt it. According to the Department, 20 state -collected counties and 28 municipalities have adopted the exemption. To estimate the revenue impact to the 20 counties that have adopted the exemption, we first estimated the amount of eligible sales in each by multiplying the $1.56 billion in statewide manufacturing capital expenditures reported by the Census Bureau by the percentage of the state's manufacturing jobs located in each county, based on data from the State Demographer's Office. We then multiplied the estimated eligible sales in each county by each county's sales and use tax rate. Because this estimate also relies on Census Bureau data, as was the case for our estimate for the exemption's state revenue impact, this total likely overstates the revenue impact to local governments to some degree. Further , we lacked data necessary to estimate the impact to the 28 municipalities that have adopted the exemption; however, because these are relatively small municipalities , the additional revenue impact from the exemption in these areas is likely small as well. 3507 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Despite the exemption providing a significant tax benefit to manufacturers, we found that most manufacturers must still pay local sales taxes, which could be limiting the exemption's economic impact. As of Ju ly 2020, only 20 of 51 state-collected counties and 28 state- collected municipalities had adopted the exemption. Further, b ased on our review of Calendar Year 2017 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, most manufacturing jobs in the state are likely located within home -rule cities that collect their own sales taxes and that do not provide a similar exemption. Therefore, most purchases of manufacturing equipm ent in the state are subject to local sales taxes , which may reduce the economic impact of the Machinery Exemption and reduce its ability to avoid tax being applied to equipment that is part of the manufacturing process. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Eliminating the Machinery Exemption would result in manufacturers having t o pay an additional 2.9 percent on their purchases of machinery that currently qualify for the exemption. In the 20 state-collected counties that have adopted the exemption, on average , manufacturers would also have to pay an additional 1.23 percent in cou nty sales tax. Because most states w ith a sales tax have a similar exem ption, eliminating the Machinery Exemption could also make Colorado a less attractive location for manufacturing businesses. Overall, most stakeholder s we contacted indicated that the removal of the exemption would have some impact on their operations in the state. Although manufacturers could potentially pass some of the additional costs from taxes on to customers in the form of higher prices, s takeholders noted a variety of actions they might take to cover the additional costs that could not be passed on, such as buying used equipment , reassessing future expansion in the state, or expanding automation. Stakeholders reported that automation of the manufacturing sector is inevitable to compete i nternationally, and the exemption allows manufactures to reinvest their savings on machinery purchases into a smaller skilled - 3518 MACHINERY USED IN MA NUFACTURING EXEMPTIO N labor force to operate automated machinery, which is eligib le under the exemption. However, stakehol ders reported that sales and use taxes are one factor among many when they make investment decisions and eliminating the exemption may have a relatively limited impact. Further, as discussed, most machinery purchases by manuf acturers in the state are subject to local sales taxes and we found that manufacturing businesses are concentrated in several home -rule cities, such as Denver, Lakewood, Aurora, and Boulder . These areas have higher than average local tax rates and do not exempt sales of manufacturing equipment, indicating that sales taxe s are not the primary driver of manufacturers' location decisions. Manufacturing comprised about $27 billion of the s tate's GDP in Calendar Year 2019 and so the e stimated $4 5 million tax benefit , which is equivalent to less than 0.2 percent of the industry's share of state GDP, is relatively small in comparison to the size of the industry. ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? Of the 45 states, incl uding Colorado, which levy sales and use tax , 41 provide a tax expenditure for machinery used in manufacturing . Of these, 3 8 provide a sales and use tax exemption and three provide a reduced sales and use tax rate for purchases of machinery used in manufacturing. Similar to Colorado, we identified 2 5 other states with provisions that expressly include recycling or scrap metal processing industries as eligible manufacturers. Additionally, we found three states\u2014Missouri, Kentucky, and North Da kota\u2014that require the qualifying machinery to be used to establish new or expanded manufacturing capabilities , which i s narrow er than Colorado's eligibility requirements . 3529 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? The Wholesale s Exemption [Section 39- 26-102(20), C.R.S] exempts inputs, such as ingredients and component parts that are incorporated into consumer goods , and non- retail sales of tangible personal property , from sales and use tax . The Wholesale s Exemption applies to a broad range of industries, including manufacturers, and similar to the Manufacturing Exemption, appears to be intended to avoid taxing inputs necessary to the production of consumer goods, which are typically subject to sales tax when sold by retailers . Another similar expenditure is the Enterprise Zone Manufacturing Machinery Sales Tax Exemption [Section 39- 30-106, C.R.S.], which is linked to the statewide Machinery Exemption, and thus has the same administration criteria , but with its own definition of manufacturing. The enterprise zone exemption has a more comprehensive definition of manufacturing , which include s activities such as processing , than the Machinery Exemption. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURE? The Department of Revenue was not able to provide data on the amount of the exemption claimed as a refund or as a use tax exemption. Specifically, manufacturers that pay sales taxes on eligible purchases may claim the exemption using the Claim for Refund (Form DR 0137B). This form does not include a separate line for reporting the Machinery Exemption, and taxpayers use the same reporting line on the form to claim refunds for multiple exemptions. Therefore, the Department cannot provide data on the amount claimed as a refund under the exemption. Further, manufactures who claim it as a consumer use tax exemption, because for example, they made an exempt purchase in another state before bringing the items purchased back into Colorado, are generally not required to report the amount exempted to the Department. Additionally, although some vendors may report the 35310 MACHINERY USED IN MA NUFACTURING EXEMPTIO N information on the exemption using the Retailer's Use Tax Return (Form DR 0173), which includes a line to report the Machinery Exemption, GenTax, the Department's tax processing and information system is not programmed to extract this information. The Department wa s able to provide data on the use of the e xemption for sales that vendors reported on the Colorado Retail Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0100) and reported a revenue impact of about $6.4 million in Calendar Year 2019 for these sales in its 2020 Tax Profile and Expenditures Report ; however, Department staff indicated that this amount likely underrepresents the full revenue impact d ue to the data limitations discussed above . For this reason, we estimated the statewide and local revenue impact using U.S. Census Bureau data, which could overestimate the true impact since this data likely includes some sales that would not qualify for the exemption. If the General Assem bly wants complete information on the use and revenue impact of the Machinery E xemption, the Department of Revenue would need to program GenTax to extract data on the exemption reported on the Retailer's Use Tax Return ( Form DR 0173) . In addition, the Department would need to add an additional reporting line for the exemption on its Claim for Refund form ( Form DR 0137B) and program GenTax to capture and retrieve this information. However, according to the Department of Revenue, these types of change s would require additional resources to change the necessary programming in GenTax and add a reporting line to the form (see the Tax Expenditures Overview Section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department of Revenue data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). 35411 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATUTO RY PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE MACHINERY EXEMPTION . As discussed, statute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not state the exemption's purpose or provide performance measures for evaluating its effectiveness. Therefore, for the purposes of our evaluation, we considered a pote ntial purpose for the exemption: to prevent the taxation of items purchased for direct use in manufacturing goods since consumers typically must pay sales tax on the finished goods. We identified this purpose based on its operation and our review of similar tax expenditures in Colorado and other states. Specifically, the exemption is consistent with other sales tax exemptions in Colorado, which exempt manufacturers' purchases of raw materia ls that they incorporate into a final product. Similar structural provisions are also common in other states with a sales tax to prevent the tax from being applied at multiple stages of a good's manufacturing and distribution process. We also developed a performance measure to assess the extent to which the exemption is meeting this potential purpose. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the exemption by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure(s) in st atute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the exemption's purpose and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the exemption is accomplishing its intend ed goal(s). 355356TAX TYPE Sales and u se YEAR ENACTED 1992 REPEAL /EXPIRATION DATE NoneREVENUE IMPACT Could not determine NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS Could not determine WHAT DOES THE TAX EX PENDITURE DO? The Pre -Press Printing Exemption exempts from sales and use tax printers' purchases of eligible pre - press materials, such as film proofs and plates, used to print product s sold at retail. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Statute and the enacting legislation do not state the exemption's purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on our review of legislative history and the current operation of the expenditure, our evaluation considered a potential purpose: to ensure that sales tax is only applied to purchases made by final consumers instead of at multiple steps through print jobs ' production and distribution.WHAT POLICY CONSIDER ATIONS DID THE EVALUATION IDENT IFY? The General Assembly may want to consider establishing a statutory purpose and performance measures for the exemption . PRE- PRESS PRINTING EXEMPTION EVALUATION SUMMARY | JULY 2021 | 2021-T E14 KEY CONCLUSION : The exemption is effective at preventing the taxation of printers' purchases of pre -press materials used in print ing product s sold to customers. 3572 PRE-PRESS PRINTING E XEMPTION PRE- PRESS PRINTI NG EXEMPTION EVALUATION RESULTS WHAT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE? Pre-Press Printing Exemption (Pre-Press Exemption) [Section 39- 26-102(19)(b), C.R.S.] exempts purchases of pre-press preparation printing materials from sales and use tax. Pre-press is the term used by the printing industry to describe the process a document must go through before it can be printed, such as camera -ready work, color separat ing, platemaking, scanning, or other pre -press functions, and occurs between the creation of a print layout and the final printing . For example, a business requesting a print order of brochures, letterheads,or greeting cards would submit a print order to a printing company inColorado. The printing company would then purchase the generalmanufacturing pre -press materials such as aluminum plates, sheets, and other proofing materials from a wholesale distributor to createcustomized plates and engravings. Eligible pre -press preparation printing materials include tangible products such as \"light s ensitive film, plates, and proofing materials ,\" used for a specific print job and a specific customer, which are reusable, and for which ownership passes to the cus tomer as part of the total sale [1 CCR 201- 5, Special Rule 35 and Section 39- 26-102(6.7), C.R.S. ]. The Pre-Press Exemption was created in 199 2 by House Bill 92- 1248. Although purchases of materials incorporated into final tangible goods were generally exempt under the broader Wholesales Exemption [Section 39- 26-102(19)(a), C.R.S .], the bill clarified that sales and use of pre -press printing materials, which are a necessary input to the printing process, but not typically incorporated into a final printed product and not necessarily delivered to the customer , are also exempt as wholesale transactions. There have been no amendments to the Pre- Press E xemption since it was created . 3583 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT Under the exemption, pre -press printing materials are also exempt from local s ales and use taxes in statutory and home rule cities and counties that have their sales taxes collected by the State. Statute [Section 29 -2- 105(1)(d)(I), C.R.S.] requires local governments that have their sales taxes collected by the State to apply most of the State's tax exemptions, including the Pre -Press Exemption. Conversely, home rule cities and counties established under Article XX, Section 6 of the Colorado Constitution that collect their own sales and use tax have the authority to set their own tax policies independent from the State , and are not required to exempt pre -press printing materials from their local sales and use tax . V endors apply the exemption at the time of sale and use the Department of Revenue's (Department) Retail Sales Tax Return (F orm DR 0100) , Line 1 of Schedule A, to report all wholesale transactions that have been exempted from retail sales tax, including those for pre -press printing materials . If a vendor does not apply the exemption to an eligible sale, printing companies may submit a Claim for Refund of Tax Paid to Vendors ( Form DR 0137B) to the Department to request a refund. WHO ARE THE INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF TH E TAX EXPENDITURE? S tatute does not directly state the intended beneficiaries of the Pre -Press Exemption. Based on the oper ation of the tax expenditure and discussions with stakeholders, we considered the intended beneficiaries of this exemption to be printing companies and retailers because it reduces the cost of the materials they use in the pre -press printi ng process for specific jobs in which they cannot reuse the materials. Furthermore, w e also considered consumers of print jobs to be indirect beneficiaries of this exemption because it may reduce printing prices to the extent printing companies pass their tax savings on to consumers in the form of lower prices. S takeholder s reported that there are approximately 900 printing companies in Colorado, most of which perform pre -press in -house. Of the three types of printing companies , including commercial offset, 3594 PRE-PRESS PRINTING E XEMPTION screen, and digital printers , commercial offset and screen printers typically conduct more rigorous print jobs and therefore require pre - press materials. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE TAX EXPENDITU RE? S tatute and the enacti ng legislation for the Pre-Press Exemption do not explicitly state its purpose; therefore, we could not definitively determine the General Assembly's original intent. Based on the operation of the exemption, conversations with stakeholders, and Department regulations , we considered a potential purpose : to ensure that sales tax is only applied to purchases made by final consumers instea d of at multiple steps through print jobs ' production and distribution. Similar structural provisions are common in states with a sales tax to prevent \"tax pyramiding,\" which refers to a process that increases the effective sales tax rate on a good by taxing its inputs and the transactions that occur prior to its final sale to a consumer. In addition to increasing the effective sales tax on a good, tax pyramiding can create economic distortions, for example favoring manufacturers with smaller supply chains. It can also hide the full cost of sales taxes from consumers if businesses increase prices to account for sales taxes at earlier steps in the production chain. A s discussed , the Wholesales E xemption generally exempts purchases of materials that are incorporated into good s that will later be sold at retail; however, the materials exempt under the Pre- Press Exemption may have not been included in the Wholesales Exemption because materials used in pre -press are not incorporated into the final product sold to customers . Therefore, the Pre -Press Exemption may have been intended to clarify that certain materials , such as proofing materials for pre-press printing , that are utilized for the production of a specific product sold to the customer but retained by the printing company , are also exempt. 3605 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT IS THE TAX EXPENDITURE MEETING ITS PURPOSE AND WHAT PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE USED TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION? W e could not definitively determine whether the Pre -Press Exemption is meeting its purpose because no purpose is provided for it in statute or its enacting legislation. However, we found that it is likely meeting the purpose we considered in order to conduct this evaluation because wholesale distributors and printing companies are likely applying the exemption to tax exempt sales of pre -press printing materials. S tatute does not provide quantifiable performance meas ures for this tax expenditure . Therefore, w e created and applied the following performance measure to determine the extent to which the exemption is meeting its potential purpose : PERFORMANCE MEASURE : To what extent is the Pre-Press Exemption applied to eligible purchases of pre-press printing materials? RESULT : Overall, we found evidence that vendors commonly apply the Pre-Press Exemption to eligible sales. The Department was not able to provide data on the amount of pre -press materials reported exempt from sales tax or how frequently the exemption is taken because vendors report exempt sales using the same reporting line as the broader Wholesales Exemption, which cannot be disaggregated for analysis. However, we spoke to a printing association and a wholesale distributor of printing materials located in the state who reported that they were aware of the exemption, that they or their vendors regularly apply it to their purchases of eligible pre-press materials , and that it is important to printing compani es. They also reported that it is widely used in the printing industry in Colorado, so it is likely that other printers are using the exemption as well . 3616 PRE-PRESS PRINTING E XEMPTION WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE? W e lacked the necessary information to estimate the revenue impact to the State for the Pre -Press Exemption. However, based on information we received from stakeholders, it appears that the revenue impact to the State and benefit it provides to taxpayers is relatively small. For example, one printing materials distributor we identified in the state indicated that it sold about $280,000 in exempt materials in Calendar Year 2019. Based on the State's 2.9 percent sales tax rate, this equates to about $8,120 in sales tax exempted. Further more , because the exempt materials the distributor reported to us also include items such as paper and ink, which are covered by other exemptions, the amount exempted under the Pre -Press Exemption is likely lower than this amount. WHAT IMPACT WOULD ELIMINATING THE TAX EXPENDITURE HAVE ON BENEFICIARIES? Elim inating the Pre -Press Exemption would impact printing companies in Colorado by adding additional costs to the printing process. Specifically, printing companies would see a 2.9 percent increase on eligible p re-press printing materials purchased from wholesale distributors . For example, a typical cost for a pre -press aluminum print plate is about $215, which would be subject to about $6 in additional sales taxes if the exemption was not in place. In comparison, a print job that uses a print plate could cost about $2,000 to $4,000, though these costs are highly variable based on the specific job. Printers would either have to absorb this additional cost or pass the cost on to customers in the form of higher pric es. According to stakeholders, eliminating the exemption would negatively impact the printing industry in the state and some printers, particularly those with smaller operations, would not be able to absorb the additional cost and would likely pass the costs on to customers. 3627 TAX EXPENDITURES REP ORT ARE THER E SIMILAR T AX EXPENDITURES IN OTHER STATES? Ba sed on our review of the seven states surrounding Colorado, we determined that none of the states' statutes explicitly exempt pre -press printing materials in the same manner as Colorado; however , all of them may exempt pre -press materials under other statutory exemptions. We reviewed statutes, legislation , and case law within Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Kansas, and found that each state has statutory exemptions such as machinery equipment or component part exemptions that appear to exempt purchases of pre- press printing materials. Additionally, we found that Kansas likely exempts pre -press materials based on case law , indicating that Kansas provides an exemption for pre -press materials consumed in the manufacturing process. Further more , stakeholders indicated that many other states' codes exempt purchases of pre- press materials from sales and use tax. ARE THERE OTHER TAX EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAMS WITH A SIMILAR PURPOSE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE? C olorado provides other sales and use tax exemptions with a similar potential purpose as the Pre -Press Exemption intended to prevent tax pyramiding . For example, i ngredients and component parts used to manufacture goods are exempt from sales tax under the Wholesales Exemption [Section 39- 26-102(20) (a), C.R.S.]. Similarly, p urchases of machinery used in manufacturing are exempt from sales tax under the Manufacturing Exemption [Section 39- 26-709(1)(a)(II) and (IV), C.R.S.]. WHAT DATA CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE TAX EXPENDITURE ? The Department could not provide data on the use of the Pre -Press Exemption. Specifically, vendors report sales that qualify for the exemption on the De partment's Retail Sales Tax Return (Form DR 0100) using the same line that they use to report all types of sales that 3638 PRE-PRESS PRINTING E XEMPTION qualify for the W holesale Sales Exemption, which covers a wide -variety of purchases, not just pre -press printing materials. If th e General Assembly determined that a more accurate estimate is necessary, it could direct the Department to collect information specifically on exempt pre- press materials transactions as part of the Retail Sales Tax Return and make changes in GenTax to allow it to pull this data. However, according to the Department, this would require additional resources to complete the necessary programming in GenTax (see the Tax Expenditures Overview section of the Office of the State Auditor's Tax Expenditures Compilation Report for additional details on the limitations of Department data and the potential costs of addressing the limitations). WHAT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS DID THE EVALU ATION IDENTIFY? THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO ESTABLISH A STATUTORY PURPOSE AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES FO R THE PRE-PRESS EXEMPTION . Statute and the enacting legislation for the exemption do not state the exemption's purpose or provide performance measures for evaluating its effectiv eness. Therefore, for the purposes of our evaluation, we considered a potential purpose for the exemption: to ensure that sales tax is only applied to purchases made by final consumers instead of at multiple steps through print jobs ' production and distribution. We identified this purpose based on the operation of the exemption, conversations with stakeholders, and its legislative history . We also developed a performance measure to assess the extent to which the exemption is meeting this potential purpose. However, the General Assembly may want to clarify its intent for the exemption by providing a purpose statement and corresponding performance measure(s) in statute. This would eliminate potential uncertainty regarding the exemption's purpose and allow our office to more definitively assess the extent to which the exemption is accomplishing its "}
