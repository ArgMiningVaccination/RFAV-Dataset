There are initiatives, activities and organisations working out of Anthroposophy in all regions across New Zealand. Anthroposophy Two threads work together within Anthroposophy: an expansion of perception and knowledge (spiritual realism); and, the development of individual responsibility for actions (ethical individualism). Anthroposophy provides an individual path of spiritual development, visible in the arts, in social forms and practical initiatives. Dr Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) was a philosopher, scientist, artist, social reformer, writer, architect and scholar. His thinking and teaching informs activities, organisations, initiatives and individuals all over the world working in diverse disciplines. In New Zealand this includes Waldorf Schools, biodynamic farming, Hohepa Homes, Weleda and Anthroposophical medicine, eurythmy practice and the adult education programmes run from Taruna College. The Christchurch branch of the Anthroposophical Society meets weekly and is open to members and friends to who wish to further their knowledge and understanding of Rudolf Steiner's works in a shared setting through the study and discussion of Steiner's work. There is no specific requirement to join, but some prior knowledge of Rudolf Steiner's basic works would facilitate initial orientation towards the group's activity. When: Wednesday evenings at 7:30 - 9:00 pm (except during school holidays) "}
