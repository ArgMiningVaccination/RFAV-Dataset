I just got Teddy lab work back and his PCV is now 80%, from 76 in January, and platelets down from 90 to 52! His thyroid panel turned out with a slight low TSC.07. Teddy has been on phosphorus for almost 2 yrs and if I slowly decrease the phosphorus and increase the herb my question is have you ever worked with both entities at the same time. I don't know that much but my fear is that somehow using both may cause his immune system to turn on itself? Is that possible. Of course I will discuss with Dr Judy but until I do, I wanted to know your experience on this.
