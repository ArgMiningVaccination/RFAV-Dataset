Homeopathy is a very popular form of complementary medicine, it has been around for over two hundred years and it is used all over the world. Sadly, there are people that negate its use and are very scathing in their detraction calling it quackery, snake oil or witchcraft. Homeopathy is nothing to do with Wicca or witchcraft and the accusations aimed at the profession and users of this medicine are incorrect. Many witches today or those that follow an esoteric tradition know and understand something called \"sympathetic magic\". The idea is to align oneself with something similar to the required result, thereby encouraging the desired outcome. Although perhaps unknown to some devotees, this is referred to by those of a rationalist approach as \"The Law of Similars\". Therein lies the fly in the ointment as The Law of Similars is often referred to in Homeopathy. Those that have studied Herbalism or Homeopathy will also have come across this term \"Doctrine of Signatures\". The Doctrine of Signatures was an age old way of looking at herbs and medicine. It was believed that if a plant resembled a certain part of the body, it could be used to treat an illness of that particular organ. It was perhaps a na\u00efve but interesting beginning to the study of medicine. The Doctrine of Signatures and The Law of Similars are often ridiculed in debate within the media and used to vilify those that practice natural healing. When studying or practising the art of Homeopathic medicine, one might give a nod to the herbalists of yesteryear; I am sure that Mother Nature still has a plethora of healing substances that we have still not yet utilised. Fungi and moss are currently in focus as they have useful qualitities of absorption and help to re-establish natural balance in the environment, so why not in medicine? Research need not necessarily take place in laboratories but in back gardens, parks and grass verges across the country. Science is for everyone after all. So why, when and how did this ancient herb craft get mixed up with the Homeopathic remedies that we buy today from pharmacies and health food outlets? Many Homeopathic remedies are made from compounds or elements from the periodic table and some plant remedies are made from the tinctures of plants used in the herbal Materia Medica. Calendula officinalis and Valeriana officinalis are just two of the herbs known to have been used medicinally and remedies such as Kali sulphuricum and Ferrum phosphoricum are used both as tissue salts and as constitutional Homeopathic prescriptions. Understandably, the whole notion of a serial dilution that strengthens the efficacy of a Homeopathic remedy sounds preposterous but when the remedies are potentiated by vigorous shaking and agitation, this to me, is no more miraculous than the potency of our brackish oceans, or the wonder of whale song or indeed the murmuration of starlings. An occurrence that cannot truly be explained is a phenomena; phenomena exists in nature, so why not in medicine? Homeopathy reveres the law of nature and the natural rhythm of life; it does not however, require faith. Witchcraft inspires devotion but Homeopathy does not. Homeopathy has a set of principals but it is not a religion or belief system. In fact the Homeopathic community is comprised of many people from around the world of varied faith or no faith at all. There are people of faith that accuse Homeopathy of blasphemy, as to them the practice is seen as interfering with God's work. The activation of an invisible essence that questions all science and known theories can challenge even the most broadest of minds and some say that it leads us into the arena of quantum physics and further controversy. Therefore, not seeming to have a viable or recognisable standard of testing other than clinical practice and anecdotal evidence, Homeopathy is left side-lined along with UFO sightings and crop circle enthusiasts. There is much research being undertaken but not notably published it seems. Some argue that Homeopathy is far from a science but the method of observation and reference is essential to the success of prescription. The Homeopath during consultation collates and prioritises information on mental and physical symptoms in order to find a remedy that matches the individual condition of the patient. The effect of the remedy on the patient is noted, recorded and adjusted accordingly; faith is not needed either by the patient or practitioner. Other than the accuracy and conscientiousness of the practitioner, there is no ceremony. Homeopathy does not necessitate ritual, whereas witchcraft highly embraces it. Homeopathy allows the freedom of natural occurrence; it is the Law of Nature, not the will that is employed. I know a few witches and I know a few Homeopaths; I have affection for both. Both have a preference for all things natural but are discerning enough to understand when to approprate rationale. The lines drawn are very clear to me, it's a shame that the detractors of any personal or professional practice strive to ridicule a life choice or vocation of another human being. Godspeed the merry healers whichever "}
