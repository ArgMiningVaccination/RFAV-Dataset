Nights weregrowing longer and colder, and the cabin dependedon wood for its heat. We set aside a sunny weekendto put up fuel for the winter. My job was splitting thesawn lengths into a size that would fit in the wood-burning stove.It was a fine weekendgoodweather, good friends, good exercisebut Mondaymorning I awoke with an aching right elbow, and anattempt to flip a pancake brought astab of hot-knife pain to the outsideof the problem tendinitis, specifi-cally (in my case) \"tennis elbow,\" and Ihaven't lifted a tennis racket for twenty-five years.VOLUME 10, NUMBER 1 The sheath secretes synovial fluid, the same viscous,slimy fluid that keeps joints lubricated and keeps yourlungs stuck effortlessly to your chest wall while allowingthe lungs to move freely when the chest wall moves.When you've split hundreds of chunks of wood, orcast your bait hundreds of times on a day of fishing, orpulled your paddle through the water hundreds of times, atendon may get overworked. The sheath tries to keepthings running smoothly and secretes more fluid, but thesheath can't expand to hold the increase in fluid, so thetendon gets compressed. The tendon andthe sheath swell and inflammation begins.Now the tendon calls for more lubrication,and the sheath responds with more fluid,and the problem multiplies each time thatparticular tendon is used. Almost all. voluntary movement in the human bodyinvolves tendons moving across joints. Look at the insideof your wrist and make a fist. The stringy cords that yousee shifting under the skin are tendons. These particularones connect the muscles of your forearm to your wristand fingers, allowing them to work.Tendons are attached to muscles on one end and tobones at an insertion point on the other. On the way frommuscle to bone, the tendon passes through a tendon sheathwhich is attached to the underlying bone. When themuscle flexes, it contracts, shortens, drawing the tendonback toward the muscle. The sheath stabilizes the tendonand acts like a pulley. Without the tendon sheath thetendon would straighten as a rope does when it is tied to aweight and pulled on by someone who wants the weight tomove. The tendon sheath keeps the tendon near the bone,increasing the efficiency of the system and Preventing usfrom looking funny when we flex a muscle.Tendinitis! What a pain! Even thoughno tendon is immune to trouble, some parts of your bodyare more susceptible than othersshoulders, wrists, andelbows, for example.In my case, the muscles of the forearm that allow thewrist to be cocked up, the muscles of wrist extension, hadbegun to microscopically tear loose from the outside of myelbow where the muscle attaches to the bone. This placewhere muscle attaches to bone is not technically a tendonsince it does not run through a sheath, but the pain issimilar and referred to by the same term of \"tendinitis.\"Another insidious form of tendinitis attacks the ten-dons that hold the upper arm bone to the shoulder, usuallywhen the shoulder has been overworked in some kind ofoverhead activity. The tendons at the back of the shoulderrub against the underside of the shoulder blade until theyare rubbed raw. You can get essentially the same resultfrom a sudden, violent movement such as falling on anoutstretched arm. A more severe type of tendinitis can be had if youignore the developing problem until calcium salts grow inan inflamed area. The sharp pieces of calcium irritate thebursa sac, the tough bag that surrounds all joints to keepthe lubricating synovial fluid from running away. The irri-tated bursa starts to overproduce fluid. Eventually, theentire sac becomes inflamed and tense, and the whole jointbecomes an agonizing burden to bear. At this point thestandard treatment of tendinitis may not work.The standard treatment is simple: Don't use the jointuntil it gets better. There is little chance it will hurt if youdo not move the inflamed tendon. And, without use, thetendon will finally heal. Application of cold packs severaltimes a day for about 20 minutes will help speed the heal-ing by reducing the swelling, and a regimen of an over-the-counter, anti-inflammatory drug will also reduce pain andimprove the rate of mending. You can also benefit frommassaging the offending tendon, but rub it one way onlysince back and forth rubbing can cause further damage.Like most people, I found the need to use my elbowfar outweighed any chance of letting it rest. The pain anddisability got worse over the next couple of months, and,in the end, my doctor was able to earn some more moneyoff me. I received a painful cortisone injection in the joint,an injection which begins to knock doWn the inflammationin a few hours. For six weeks I wore a removable splint onmy lower arm that prevented me from moving my wrist. Itook 800 mg. of the OTC, anti-inflammatory drug, ibupro-fen, three times each day. I got better.This is what you should do. If it hurts to use a joint,especially after using it a lot, you should consider the pos-sibility that you have tendinitis. If you probe the joint andfind a point that hurts when pressed, you should know youhave tendinitis. Make every effort to not use that joint forthe next few days. Put a cold pack on the painful spot threeor four times a day.Use the cold treatment for two or \u00b0threedays.After the days of cold treatment, start using thejoint, but not to the point of pain. Pain-free use stimulateshealthy, healing circulation while keeping the joint fromstiffening. Start daily doses of an anti-inflammatant suchas ibuprofen or aspirin. If the problem persists for twoweeks, consult your physician. Good times are even betterwhen you CouncilBy Peter Crane, WEMTAnyone who hikes, climbs, or skis in. New Hamp-shire's backcountry will want to obtain some free informa-tional material offered by the New Hampshire OutdoorCouncil. The material, which focuses on the potential haz-ards of avalanches and how to avoid them, is being madeavailable by the NHOC as a public service to outdoor en-thusiasts. The information is designed to help make back-country visitors more aware of some of the dangers of fall,winter, and spring travel in the wild mountain areas of theGranite State and of how proper preparation can lessenthose dangers.According to the Council, \"The free informationpacket includes a great brochure published by the Cana-dian Avalanche Association which covers many topicswhich are as important to travelers in New Hampshire'smountain backcountry as they are to travelers to peaksnorth of the border. Many people who visit the WhiteMountains in fall, winter, and spring aren't aware of thereal possibility of avalanches, especially on steep openslopes and gullies. Mount Washington, for instance, hasseen ten avalanche fatalities and numerous avalanche-related accidents, which have affected hikers, technicalclimbers, and spring skiers.\" While Mount Washingtonmay be most notorious for its hazards, the Council notesthat avalanche accidents can and have occurred elsewherein the White Mountains, too.Along with the brochure, the Council includes ahandy wallet-sized card with information provided by theUnited States Forest Service - White Mountain NationalForest, whichliststhe standard classifications foravalanche hazard. The classifications are used from coastto coast in both Canada and the United States and shouldbe recognized and understood by all who leave lowlandtrails and developed slopes and travel into potentialavalanche terrain.The card also includes a listing ofavalanche safety basics furnished by the Snow Rangers ofthe White Mountain National Forest, who operate anavalanche forecasting program on Mount Washington- -the only such program in the eastern United States.(Avalanche forecasts for the Mount Washingtonarea can be obtained from 603-466-2713 ext. 4and at www.tuckerman.org.) JANUARY/FEBRUARY 19994 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER Realizing that one of the most often visited of New Hamp-shire's backcountry locations, Tuckerman Ravine, canalso be prime avalanche terrain, the Council will include aU.S. Forest Service brochure on Tuckerman with theavalanche material. \"Whether folks come to Tuckermanto hike, climb, glide, ride, or slide, they really need to beaware of the special characteristics of the Ravine, and theyneed to plan their trip so that it can be accomplished withenjoyment and safety,\" notes the Council. While mostskiers wisely wait until spring for their visits to Tucker-man, as avalanche hazard in winter is often high or ex-treme, they should be aware that avalanche hazard can ex-ist even in April and May.Organizations such as schools, outing clubs, churchgroups, and scout troops which may include group excur-sions in their activities are encouraged to request multiplecopies of the brochures and cards (appropriate postageshould be included with such requests). The avalanche in-formation card is also available at many outdoor outfittersin the White Mountain region.The New Hampshire Outdoor Council is a private,non-profit organization which works with state, federal,and non-profit agencies in the state to support search andrescue activities in New Hampshire, and to promote safetyand responsibility among outdoor enthusiasts in the back-country of the Granite State so that search and rescue mis-sions can be avoided.

BEST COPY AVAILABLE 5SPOT 7 FOR 1THE SEASONRebecca S.,Newton, W-EMT Featured in this issue:Trail RunningSnow and ice fade into the warmth of lingering springafternoons. For months, you've worn your old runningshoes around town with a growing nostalgia for last sum-mer's clear trails. Soon you'll be itching to get into a newseason of trailexploration, toput away the skis and snow-shoes for a while, to recapture the freedom that only run-ning shoes and an unencumbered path through the woodscan offer.Whether you're a veteran off-road runner returningafter a long winter away or a novice to the, trail, most ofyour concerns will fall into four categories: breathing trou-bles; soft-tissue injuries; muscle, bone, and tendon prob-lems; and environmental issues. A few basic principleswill help to address these concerns before they become realproblems.A good pair of shoes, appropriate for the tyjie of ter-rain you expect to run on, is crucial for preventing manyof the injuries discussed below. Many companies are nowspecifically making-7-4nd aggressively marketing7-trail-running shoes..While you, don't necessarily need tosplurge on a separate pair of shoes for off-road running ifyou've got numing shoes, already, be .sure that any shoesyou'll be using on the trail have good stability, traction,and durability.Consult running magazines, Web sites,and retailers for advice, but use your own judgement andbudget to determine what kind of shoe will best match yourrunning habits.Perhaps the most importantand one of the most fre-quently neglecteddefenses against running injuries isdedication to good warm-up and cool-down routines.Thorough stretching before and after a run keeps muscleslimber, enabling them to handle more demand with greaterfinesse in future workouts. Stretching can minimizeoveruse pains and help to heal minor injuries. Ice and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also helpreduce swelling and pain after a tough run. Of course,good judgement regarding one's own physical abilities aswell as one's environment is as crucial to preventing trou-bles in trail running as in any other backcountry sport.But even fit athletes with good judgement and greatshoes can suffer. What kinds of problems are common totrail runners, and what can be done about them? 3 JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1999 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER BREL:\\ITFIDR98 4ROUDLESSIDE STITCHESSide stitches are common ailments, particularlyamong newer runners. They cause pain in the side, gener-ally just below the rib cage, and are the result of a spasmor cramp in the diaphragm muscle or of gas in the in-testines. What many veterans of the sport have learned isthat these annoyances can be prevented by a few simplemeasures of foresight: Perhaps most important is to avoideating for at least 'one to two hours before a run. Deepbreathing can also discourage side stitches by stretchingthe diaphragm, as can a particular technique recominendalby Runner's World magazine: exhale forcefully as the footopposite the stitch strikes the ground. For example, if thestitch is on your right sidethe side more commonly af-flicted, incidentallyexhale with a quick, strong breatheach time you come down on your left foot. Yon may alsofind that stretching and massaging the affected area willhelp relieve the pain. If all else fails, ease off and walk orjog slowly for a bit until the stitch goes away. ASTHMAAnother hindrance to healthy breathing is asthma, acommon chronic airway disease estimated to be sufferedby at least ten percent of the United States' population. Anasthma attack causes contraction of the muscles surround-ing air passages, narrowing of the passages themselves,andthecommonbreathingpatternknownas\"wheezing\"not to mention intense anxiety in the personsuffering the attack. Acute attacks can be exacerbated bydry air, cold temperature, and high altitude, and may bebrought on by exercise and allergies.In the broader view, however, exercise can be excel-lent for lessening the impact of asthma on your everydaylife and foi improving youi capacity for sustained-exer-tion. Good habits of warming up before an intense work-out or race, inhaling primarily through the nose, and wear-ing a scarf or mask over the mouth in cold or allergy-provoking weather should help discourage attacks.Stretching or meditation sessions may help you to be ableto relax quickly when an attack comes on. Many effectivemedications that will allow you to exercise with less inter-ruption by illness are currently available. However, if youhave asthma, you should consult your doctor for advicebefore beginning or modifying your exercise routine or ifyou notice a change in your symptoms or illness patterns.SOFT-MISSUE ONJUREIES BLISTERSBlisters on the feet, caused by a fluid buildup underthe skin at a site that has been subjected to excess friction,are a common ailment among, athletes of all types. If pos-sible, you should leave a blister alone for 24 hours to seeif it disappears by itself before taking any action to heal it.If it does not go away on its own, or if you need to treat itbecause it cropped up halfway through your travels, you'llneed to lance it.First, clean the skin on and around theaffected area. With a needle or pin (sterilized by a flame,boiling water, or sterile wipe, if possible), pierce the skinat two points on opposite edges of the blister. Gently pressdown on the blister site with a clean tissue or gauze, slowlydraining the fluid. Do not remove the overlying skin. Ap-ply antibacterial ointment and cover the blister with a ster-ile bandage. If you're headed out again in the same shoesbefore healing is complete, cut a piece of molefoam to en-circle the blister site. This will relieve pressure on the areaand encourage healing by diminishing friction.To prevent blisters, try synthetic socksparticularlythe newer two-layered modelsthat wick moisture awayfrom the feet. Moleskin, talcum powder, or petroleum jellyapplied to the feet before a run can help discourage fric-tion.If blisters recur, evaluate the fit of your runningshoes and make sure that the shoes themselves aren't thesource of your troubles. BLACK TOENAILSAnother injury caused by contact trauma of the footwith the footwear is a black toenail, signaling bloodtrapped underneath the nail.This injury is the result ofrepeated hitting or rubbing against the top or front of theshoe as the foot strikes the ground in each stride. It iscommon among tong-distance runners and may particu-larly plague trail runners who train on hilly terrain. Toavoid such harmful contact, be sure to wear shoes withplenty of room in the toe box for feet to slide forward with-out hitting against the shoe. Make sure shoes are, lacedtightly enough to discourage feet from slipping forwardduring steep downhill strc:ches, but be careful not to laceshoes so tightly that they cause pain on the top of the foot.Pain associated with a black toenail indicates thatthe pressure needs to be relieved by draining pooled bloodfrom underneath the nail. If you have sustained this injuryin the past, you may know how to make a hole in the nailyourself to treat the condition.

If the blacktoenail isn't painful or throbbing, there's no need to drainthe blood. The nail will probably loosen and fall off overthe course of the next few months. As a new nail comes into replace the damaged one, guard against its becoming in-grown. Even after the loss of the original nail, though, aperfect new nail will usually return over several months'time, leaving few, if any, indications of the trauma that hasoccurred.Just be sure to keep the area clean as healingprogresses, replacing bandages often and using antibacte-rial and antifungal creams to prevent infection. CHAFINGThough injury to the foot may cause the most dis-tress and irritation to runners, problems caused by the fric-tion of repeated contact can occur on other parts of thebody as well. Chafing is a common complaint of distancerunners. Drug-store products that can diminish the effectsof chafing include petroleum jelly and talcum powder,which should be applied to sensitive areas before you headout to the trail.Band-Aids or Dr. Scholl's corn cushionscan also help prevent nipples from rubbing raw against ashirt during a long run. Chafing can be particularly irk-some during humid summer days when clothes seem to feelcontinually damp. To minimize chafing, experiment withdifferent styles and combinations of clothing. Lycra tightsor shorts, worn alone or under other gear, can reduce fric-tion on thighs. Seek out sports bras with flat or coveredseams. In all seasons, choose clothing made of syntheticswhenever possible. USW-LE, 131\\91E9i TEMGENERAL SORENESS(4,RS LOlLEr,AS One of the most common ailments after some timeaway from the trail is general soreness following a particu-larly hard workout or a run with many downhill stretches.Even if you've stayed in shape with winter sports, somenew soreness is inevitable. Once you start pushing yourlimits to increase your fitness and to improve your abilityto navigate tough trails, you reawaken different musclegroups from those you used skiing, snowboarding, andsnowshoeing during the winter months. In your new springtrail-running routine, never neglect the cool-down phase ofyour workout. When you're done with your run, walk forseveral minutes before heading back to the trailhead. Ifthere's a stream near the trail, sit and cool your legs in thewater.Stretch and massage your legs, both immediately8before and after your run as well as regularly on days youdon't run. Add gentle icing to your post-run stretches.You may also use NSAIDs to reduce soreness. Justbe cautious when using drugs to diminish sensation, aspain signals both damage and healing. Don't rely so heav-ily on NSAIDs that you can't heed your body's input aboutyour exertionsor so heavily that you miss out on thatsatisfying soreness that comes from a hard-earned hill run.After a very long run (that is, in the range of 20 or moremiles), take a few days off for cross-training. Cycle, swim,take a light hike. To relieve stress on the quadriceps and todecrease soreness, add downhill segments if you commonlyrun on flat trails and find flat stretches if too much up-and-down negotiation is what's making your muscles ache. SHINSPLINTS AND STRESS FRACTURES\"Shinsplints\" is a common name than runners give tosoreness in the lower leg. It can be a hazy term, sometimestoo catch-all to provide a useful evaluation of the problem,as it tends to connote a group of related but distinct lower-leg injuries. Most commonly, however, a runner complain-ing of shinsplints is feeling the pain associated with an in-flammation of the tendons on the inside front of the lowerleg. The cause of this overuse injury is straining and tear-ing of the tendons, brought on by the stresses of tired orinflexible calf muscles.Overpronation (see below) canalso exacerbate tendon damage, as inward twisting of thefoot places excess strain on the shin and knee.Treatment for shinsplints aims to reduce the inflam-mation that's causing pain.Ice should be rubbed slowlyalong the lower leg, following the contour where musclemeets bone. NSAIDs can reduce pain and swelling. Pre-vention, as in most cases, is the best way to deal with theproblem. Trail running itself is a preventative measure forrunners who are used to road running since dirt and sand aremore forgiving than asphalt and cement, easing poundingon joints and shins. Thorough calf stretches, both beforeand after a run, will also help prevent and treat shinsplints.If shinsplints are too painful to run through, you may needto cut back on your mileage or to take some time off tocross-train in lower-impact sports such as swimming andbiking.Though the two injuries may look deceptively similar,stress fractures are generally more serious than shinsplints.A few things can help you differentiate between shinsplintsand a stress fracture of the lower leg. While the pain asso-ciated with shinsplints may fade once you've warmed upthe leg muscles, the pain of a stress fracture will continue 5 JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1999 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER to nag you throughout your run. Diffuse pain, sensitive tothe touch and radiating down the inside of the calves alongthe long bone, tends to indicate shinsplints. If the pain canbe pinpointed to an exact locationwhen you press di-rectly on a spot, it hurts intensely, but pressing around itcauses no painyou have probably sustained a stress frac-ture.Stress fractures, tiny cracks disrupting the integrityof the bone surface, may radiate in the leg as your footstrikes the ground, but are generally located in the lowerleg or metatarsal bones.Stress fractures often develop as runners increase in-tensity and volume of training over the course of severalweeks or months. You may be able to continue to runorat least to cross-trainwith a stress fracture, especially ifyou commit yourself to routine icing and NSAID use, butconsult a sports physician for advice, and get an x-ray toconfirm the diagnosis. SPRAINSWhile trail running is less likely to lead to the overuseinjuries so commonly caused by pavement pounding, it'smuch easier to sprain an ankle or tweak a knee on an un-even trail than on a roadside. Sprains can be excruciat-ingly painful and debilitating, but most can be walked on,at least immediately after the injury and before majorswelling occurs. Examine the site of the injury. Is the jointswelling quickly?Is it discolored? Try to evaluate theseverity of the damage. If you can't walk out, your optionsmay be limited to crawling or waiting for someone else tocome along to help. If the injury really is a sprain, you willprobably be able to walk on it. Look around for a thicktree branch to use as a cane or crutch to support you. Ifyou have a water source (water bottle or nearby stream orpuddle), wet a bandanna or other piece of fabric to fashiona quick cooling device, and wrap it around the injury. Ifyou have an Ace bandage or other fabric wrap (you caneven use your thermal tee or extra pair of socks or someduct tape from around your water bottle), make a compres-sion bandage.Once you're home or able to get to some defmitivesource of cold, ice the injury in the initial healing phase.The goal at this point is to calm the rampant bleeding intothe site that's causing swelling and impeding healthy circu-lation. Most sources estimate the need for treatment withice to span the initial 72 hours following injury. After thistime, you should switch to heat-based treatment, such ashot packs or a heating pad. Once the bleeding has stopped,the goal is to increase the circulation to the site in order topromote healing. Of course, throughout treatment, never 6apply the source or cold or heat directly to the skin. Wrapa chunk of ice in a plastic bag and towel, for example, orapply a heating pad over two layers of socks.ACHILLES TENDINITIS ANDOTHER COMMON PROBLEMSAchilles tendinitis, an inflammation along the back ofthis lower-leg tendon, is characterized by pain, which maybe dull or sharp, and by tightness and stiffness in the calf,which may be worst when you first get up in the morning.To soothe the pain, treat with ice and NSAIDs and repeatgentle calf stretches at least five times a day. Heel lifts inyour running shoes may help, as may wearing runningshoes all the time while you're suffering from a bout ofAchilles tendinitis.Many other particularly common problems amongrunners, as would be expected, affect the lower body, espe-cially the feet (plantar fasciitis, heel spurs, Morton's neu-roma), knees (such as runner's knee, chondromalacia, ili-otibial band syndrome), and backside or backs of legs(sciatica, hamstring pain).As with so many running-related maladies, some combination of stretches, icing,rest, and NSAIDs generally represents good therapy forthese sorts of problems.Such chronic injuries are often caused or exacerbatedby overpronation, an excessive rolling inward of the footafter landing, or by underpronation (also known as supina-tion), an insufficient rolling inward of the foot upon land-ing. For more information on these and other similar in-juries not discussed here, talk to a physician, physical ther-apist, or trainer who is knowledgeable about running-related injuries, or consult any of the numerous runningtexts written since the sport gained popularity in the 1970sand '80s. An especially popular and informative classictext is Jim Fives The Complete Book of Running, firstpublished in 1977. EGAVORONNIERIML OSSUIESMany of the crucial differences between first aid intrail running and first aid in most other wilderness activi-ties can be accounted for by the fact that trail running isunlikely to be part of an overnight trip. This means that,while the sport will less often lead you deep into truewilderness than will, say, backpacking, you also tend to befar less well-prepared for emergencies while on a run thanwhile on a longer journey. JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1999A trail run may fill a long spring afternoon and bring9WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER you five or more miles into the woods before you turn back.You tend to feel relatively safeperhaps you've justparked your car at the trailhead, or perhaps you're just afew miles from home.Still, many of the environmentalthreats posed to all outdoorspeople face trail runners aswell.The lack of equipment carried by most trail runnerscan be a hazard. Vulnerability to quick changes in weatheris heightened without extra clothing or shelter. A waist-pack or pocket of a windbreaker, tied around your waist ona warm spring day, can hold a hat and mittens. If you'reheaded out on a long run, it's best to bring a small ,daypackwith an extra layer of synthetics and a Mylar rescue blan-ket in case of emergency. Remember that prime hypother-mia weatherin the 40s to 50s (degrees Fahrenheit) anddrizzlingis also common spring and summer weather inmuch of the North American woods. Still,, your best de-fense against hypothermia is water: staying well-hydratedis the best way to maintain sound judgement and healthybody temperature, whether in hot weather or cold. Ofcourse, bring at least one water bottle if you're headed outfor a run of any substantial distance. And don't forget aflashlight and a trail map.Watch your step: the roughness of trails is whatcauses so many twistings of ankles and knees that could beprevented; underbrush and overhanging branches are easyto run into, poking eyes or scratching skin. If there's asubstantial population of poisonous snakes where you'rerunning, be aware of proper snakebite management andkeep alert, especially when hopping logs and rocks. When-ever possible, try to see where you're about to step beforeyou put your foot there.As with all backcountry adventures, there's safety innumbers. Run with a friend whenever possible. Trail run-ning is becoming a very popular activity in communitieswith nearby wooded areas. Check out local sports associa-tions and running clubs where you can meet others whoshare your interest in off-road running. If you must runalonewhether based on your schedule or based on yourdesires for solitudeunderstand the risks you are taking,know how to take care of yourself, and let someone knowwhere you're going and when you expect to be back. Thenlace up those shoes you've been longing to wear since win-ter first began to fade, and get out to seek your own pathonce again.This article is the second column in the new series \"ASport for the Season.\" Watch for upcoming installmentson mountain biking and boating.SUGGESTIONS FOR READING:* Amby Burfoot (editor).

Knees, el-bows, and shoulders have the most important bursae,and that's where you're most likely to develop bursitis,an inflammation of a bursa with, what else, pain andswelling. It's usually the result of unusual pressure orfriction, or perhaps a slight injury to the site. Pro-longed kneeling on a hard surface can give it to you inthe knee. The infamous problem of water-on-the-knee is almost always bursitis.

If some-one on a wilderness trip complains of joint pain, espe-cially in one of the major bursae areas, you might con-sider bursitis as part of your differential diagnoses ifnothing else appears to be the cause.RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevatiOn)helps most of the time, with cooling the site especiallybeneficial for easing the pain (as well as many others).With a few days of rest, most patients will reabsorbthe excess fluid from the inflammation back into theirbloodstream. A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug(NSAID) such as ibuprofen can shorten the durationof the pain and swelling. Piroxicam, a strongerNSAID, is often prescribed for the pain. If the bursagrows boggy and infected, antibiotics and sometimesdrainage of the fluid is required. In rare, persistent,repetitive cases, a doc might perform a relatively mi-nor surgery to remove the bursa.107 JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1999 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER WILDERNESS FIRST AID & MEDICAL TRAINING OPTIONSSOLOPO Box 3150, Conway, New Hampshire 03818Telephone: (603) WEMT andwilderness leadership skills, survival, rescue and more,this is ideal for the professional outdoor leader.June 14 - July 23 Conway, NH (603-447-6711)Wilderness EMTMar. 15 - Apr. 9 Conway, NH (603-447-6711)Apr. 12 - May 7 Conway, NH (603-447-6711)May 17 - June 11 Conway, NH (603-447-6711)July 26 - Aug 20 Conway, NH (603-447-6711)Sept. 13 - Oct. 8 Conway, NH (603-447-6711)Wilderness First Sargent Camp, NH (603-525-3311)Mar. 15-26 Conway, NH (603-447-6711)Mar. - Apr. 4 Harvard U, MA (617-495-7935)Apr. 1--9 Outward ME 27-28 Pine Ridge 9-11 Horizons for (781-828-7550)Apr. 10-11 of 7-11 2Mar. 1-12 Conway, NH (603-447-6711)Mar. 29- Apr. 9 Conway, NH (603-447-6711)Apr. 26 - May 7 Conway, NH (603-447-6711)Wilderness First Responder 10-11 Outward Bound, (603-447-6711) WILDERNESS 81241Telephone: 15 - 9 CA (970-641-3572)May 24 - June 18 Pitkin, CO (970-641-3572)July 26 - Aug 20 Pitkin, CO (970-641-3572)July 26 - Aug 20 Pitkin, CO (970-641-3572)Wilderness First ResponderMar.

Thesun is high and the days are long. For mostbackcountry travelers thisisa time when outdooradventuring becomes verysimplified.The weight ofthe backpack gets cut inhalf as the winter equipmentis retired for a season.We are able to travel muchlighter on our feet.The winds of change bring asomewhat less hostile Mother Nature, and the perils ofbeing in wild places seem non-existent. For a few,unfortunately, this is not the case. Instead, summerarrives with an anxiety over an attack by a stinginginsect and the possibility of anaphylaxis.BFrank Hubbell, DO & W Karla is one of those who worries. Last summer, Karlaand her friend Andrew were out on a week-longcanoeing trip in northern Maine. The weather was fineand the paddling, spectacular. But in mid-afternoon ofthe fourth day, while stopping for a lunch break on theshore, they set their packs on a ground hornets' nest.Before they realized their mistake, both had been stung.Andrew and Karla had been stung before. Andrew hadthe typical reaction: a painful, raised welt that clearedup over approximately 24 hours. Karla, on the otherhand, knew that she was now in a life-threateningsituation.She was allergic to the venom. When shehad been exposed to proteins in the venom in the past,she developed a \"hypersensitivity reaction\" to them.Karla ran into the woods to avoid more stings. Andrewgrabbed her pack and dug out the \"bee sting kit\" fromCD a handy side pocket. Andrew could see that Karla wasalready breathing fast.She was agitated and veryanxious.He pulled theantihistamine out ofthe kit and immediately hadher swallow them.In themoments that followed, itwasobviousthattheanaphylactic reaction was going to full crisis. Karla'sbreathing was becoming very difficult and her heartrate was increasing. Her face, neck, lips, and tonguewere swelling.She was becoming cyanotic. Andrewhad to assist her with the epinephrine right away.illiam Kane, (W)EMT Although some kits are spring-loaded, Karla's requiresa manual injection. Inside are a complete set of printedinstructions (read before a crisis--no time for readingnow!) Removing the rubber cover from the needle,Andrew grasped the back of Karla's upper arm near theshoulder. He darted the needle in at a 45-degree angleas far as it would go.Pulling back slightly on theplunger, he checked to see if blood was drawn into thesyringe, indicating he had hit a vein. (If he hit a vein,he would withdraw the needle and insert it again.) Hepushed down on the plunger as far as it would go. Ashe withdrew the needle, he massaged Karla's arm tospeed the drug into circulation.In moments, Karla could breathe easier.Theepinephrine would last about 20-30 minutes. Theantihistamines would take 30-40 minutes to beabsorbed into the body, so they would serve as \"back-up\" medication. She was safe for now. Occasionallythe anaphylactic state will return before the tablets takeWilderness Medicine Newsletter 112 March/April 1999 effect.Karla's kit had a second injection ofepinephrine should she need it.What Exactly Is Anaphylaxis andHow Does It Happen?Anaphylaxis is an overwhelming allergic reaction to aprotein introduced into the body. One of the mostcommon allergens in the wilderness is bee or waspvenom; however, anaphylaxis can also result frommedications, contact with food, or other forms of bitesand stings.Within our bodies are a series of whiteblood cells (WBCs) that are constantly on the lookoutfor these foreign protein invaders. In order to do this,these cells must be able to distinguish between \"self'and \"non-self,\" so our own WBCs don't attack us.WBCs attack and destroy invading foreign protein. Inthe process they develop a \"memory\" of the invader sothey can mobilize defense forces more quickly in thefuture.These additional forces are called in throughthe release of a chemical called histamine, releasedfrom our mast cells.Normally, just enough histamine is released and alocalized reaction occurs. Hypersensitive peoplerelease far too much histamine. Their immunologicalsystems over-react. But why is this a threat to life?Histamine not only helps call in reinforcements, it alsocauses itching, and sometimes, hives. A very powerfulvasodilator, it opens blood vessels up wide all over thebody and produces the risk of shock. Histamine is anequally powerful bronchoconstrictor, causing airwaysto close down which increases the risk of inadequatebreathing.Why Does Anaphylaxis Happen and WhatDoes It Look Like?It is still a mystery why some individuals develop anincreased sensitivity to certain foreign proteins. Ananaphylactic reaction turns skin red within minutes andcauses the face and tongue to swell. Itchy hivesdevelop. The patient experiences difficulty breathing,which gets progressively worse. The heart rate andrespiratory rate increase, and the level of consciousnessdrops. As the reaction progresses, the patient's skinbecomes pale or ashen. Eventually hypotension (lowblood pressure) develops resulting in true anaphylacticshock. Without immediate care, the airway may shutcompletely, and the patient will die of asphyxiation.How Is Anaphylaxis Treated?The treatment of a potentially anaphylactic reactionbegins by quickly determining any previous history ofsensitivity to this type of exposure and follows withclose, ongoing monitoring. Remember, the potentialanaphylactic patient may have never had this level ofextreme allergic response before.SUMMARY OF ALLERGIC REACTIONSSigns and SymptomsTreatmentLocal Systemic AnaphylacticRedness; Minor Swelling at Site;Pain and/or ItchineSs. Itchy, Red Skin; Hives, appearing onbody parts other than at the site ofthe sting signaling the reaction hasbecome systemic; and increasedcapillary permeability (runny noseand eyes).Signs and symptoms of local andsystemic reactions persist withswelling of face, lips, neck, andtongue; Increased heart rate andrespiratory rate; Cyanosis; Hypoten-sion; Altered Level Conscious-ness; and topical anesthesia or \"sting-stick.\"Administer an oral antihistamine for additionalrelief from itching & swelling.If an oral antihistamine has not yet been ad-ministered, it should be given immediately andclose monitoring of the patient should con-tinue.If the patient is advancing quicklythrough the sequence of signs and symptoms,the epinephrine syringe should be prepared.If the patient has becoming hypoxic (low oxygen) administerepinephrine antihistamine tablets. Monitor patientfor relapse or change. Administer seconddose if signs and symptoms deteriorate priorto the anti-histamines taking effect. Continueto give 2 antihistamine tablets every 4 hours.Evacuate all patients with anaphylactic reac-tions.Wilderness Medicine Newsletter 213March/April 1999 The best compound known that will reverse the effectof the histamine is epinephrine (adrenaline). It isavailable, by prescription only ,in pre-loaded syringes.The EpiPen (Center Laboratories) is spring-poweredand requires pressing the tip against the thigh or upperarm until the spring releases, and for 10 seconds morewhile the epinephrine flows into the patient. The Ana-Kit (Holister-Stier) is manually operated --dart in theneedle and depress the plunger.Keep in mind that once the first dose of epinephrine hasbeen administered, the patient isn't \"out of the the epinephrine is the immediate- -stop -gap --treatment for the anaphylactic emergency, it needs to bebacked-up by a longer lasting solution antihistamines.Though theAna-Kit comes pre-packaged withantihistamine tablets, the EpiPen does not; itis wise carry antihistamine tablets separately.Once the epinephrine and antihistamine administrationhas taken place, the patient must be monitored closelyfor a recurrent episode.Patients who have receivedthese drugs need to be evacuated to a medical facilitywhere they can be observed and evaluated by aphysician.What Kind of Precautions Can e TakenAgainst Anaphylaxis? Anaphylaxis is not uncommon, and ground hornets are,obviously, not the only danger. Almost anything eaten,injected into, absorbed by, or breathed in by a personcan cause'an allergic reaction. People are often severelyallergic to bees, wasps, yellow jackets, ants, black flies,and some food and drugs.ANAPHYLAXIS IS aTRUE EMERGENCY., As a result, hypersensitivepeople generally carry either an Ana-Kit or an EpiPen(both sometimes called bee sting kits).One concern often voiced: Is it legal to give someone aninjection? Yes, if the epinephrine is from their kit. Butif it's your kit, and you recognize the inability tobreathe indicating a severe anaphylactic reaction insomeone else, err on the side of conservation of life.Leaders responsible for others in remote areas shouldconsider attending a training session led by a physicianso they can carry injectable epinephrine. Epinephrineis temperature sensitive so extreme heat and coldshould be avoided. Consult your physician or medicaldirector.When it comes to epinephrine, knowledge is key.Before heading out on a backcountry tip, find out ifanyone in the group is hypersensitive to any knownsubstances.Learn if a group member carriesepinephrine, where they carry it, and how to administerit.If a known hypersensitive person contacts theallergen to which they are hypersensitive, ready theirkit.Keep all patients calm.Be thorough aboutchecking the area where you are camping, lunching, orclimbing for nests, hives, or any other trouble-inducingcritters. And by all means, know what kinds of nutsand berries are lurking in that bag of gorp! a SPORT' FOE itzmazomRebecca S. Newton,W-EMTFeatured in this issue:Mountain BikingMountain biking injuries tend to be creatures ofextremes. Among the most frequent troubles are thecommon scrapes and bruises that are expected in anywilderness activity. Most mountain bikers welcome theopportunity to get a little muddy, and most expect anoccasional minor injury.Muscle pulls and overuseproblems, too, can occur just as in any other sport. Anunlucky few mountain biking trips, though, will lead toserious injury. While mountain biking tends to be fasterpaced than backcountry activities such as hiking andtrail running, it is often done on narrower trails and onrougher terrain.These factors, combined with arisk-taking attitude sometimes caught up in mountainbiking, mean that crashes, when they come, can havesevere consequences.It is wise, then, for mountainbiking enthusiasts to be capable of caring for their ownminor injuries as well as taking care of fellow ridersWith\" potentially life-threatening problems; such 'asinternal bleeding and central nervous system (CNS)injury.SOFT-TISSUE INJURIESSoft-tissue injuries--including all forms of scratches,abrasions, and tears from the trail's projecting branchesand from minor falls on rough spots--are among themost common mountain biking injuries. Care forvarioussoft-tissueinjuriesfollows a few basicprinciples: in the short term, control the bleeding; in thelonger term, avoid infection. Your initial approachshould be to manage the bleeding with direct pressureWilderness Medicine Newsletter 314March/April 1999 and elevation; these two actions combined will beeffective in the majority of cases. Use of pressurepoints and digital pressure may also supplement yourfirst-line care for superficial injuries. Of course, scenesafety is an important consideration when skin isbroken. As a caregiver, you should always implementbody-substance isolation precautions, particularlygloves, if the blood is not your own. As another pointof scene safety, try to stay out of the way of any nearbyenvironmental agents that could cause new troubleeither for yourself or for your patient, such as thornybranches or poison ivy.The primary goals in longer-term care for soft tissueinjuries include preventing infection and encouragingproper healing.Once bleeding has stopped, allsuperficial wounds should be irrigated with water.Creating a pressurized water source, by forcing waterfrom a squeeze bottle or out of a small hole in a cleanplastic bag, makes irrigation more effective. Makesure to use drinking-quality water in any treatmentinvolving open wounds!Dirty injuries need carefuldebridement before covering. Careful monitoring,including keeping bandages clean and dry and changingdressings at least every 24 hours, will help discourageinfection. A few signs and symptoms of infection,caused by increased blood flow and collection of whiteblood cells in the damaged area, are recalled by theacronym \"SHARP\"--swelling, heat, aching, redness,purulence (pus formation)--and will help you monitorthe patient's condition. Watch also for fever, swollenlymph nodes, or streaking, all of which may indicate aspreading of infection beyond the local injury site.Backcountry treatment for infection includes gentlyopening a closed wound to allow drainage, encouraginguse of heat .packs and hot salt-water soaks, andadministering antibiotics, if available. Patients withany sign of progressing infection shOuld be brought todefinitive care.Although control of bleeding and infection are theparamount concerns, a few kinds of injuries requirespecific measures. Before being bandaged, puncturesshould be irritated to encourage slight bleeding, whichwill help to flush contaminants that may have beentransmitted deep into the injury on the penetratingobject's surface.Flap avulsions may be returned totheir proper place. Impaled objects should generally bestabilized for immediate transport, though you maydecide to remove the object if it compromises theairway by its location in the cheek, if it is metal andyou're in a cold environment, if its presence interfereswith your ability to transport the patient, or if it's in anextremity.Abrasions may be soothed by antibioticointment, though keeping the area clean and dry duringyour time in the backcountry will usually suffice todiscourage infection.Bruises should be watchedcarefully in cold weather, since they will tend to freezemore easily than surrounding tissue. Amputated partsshould be wrapped in a moist, sterile dressing, andsealed in a plastic bag, which should be immersed incold water while your patient is transported to ahospital as quickly as possible. You should considerevacuating your patient for stitches if the injury is onthe face or hands or over a joint, if the cut is long andgaping, or if there seems to be an injury to a ligament,tendon, or major blood vessel.POISON IVY IRRITATIONSince even the naked buds on early spring's leaflessbranches can induce contact dermatitis, poison ivyshould be on your mind year-round when you step --orstumbleoff the trail. The surest way to avoid this bitof flora is by learning to recognize it; the tried and truemnemonic \"leaves of three, let it be\" should chime inyour head as you enter a wooded glade. Sticking to thetrail and wearing long pants will also help you defendagainst irritation. If your skin contacts the plant, washimmediately with cool water and mild soap. Lotions,such as Calamine, will help calm the itch. Althougheven irritated skin, once cleaned, is not contagious, oilsfromtheplant--onclothes,backpacks,bikeframes --can linger for months, reafflicting you whenyou pull your favorite gear out of the closet for yournext trip. Though most reactions to the poison ivy toxintend to be mild, some people will have an allergicreaction so violent that they need additionahlrugs tocalm their immune system (anaphylaxis). Thesepatientswill,naturally,requireevacuation andfollow-up attention.SHOCKWhile many common mountain biking injuries aresuperficial, injuries that occur at high speeds can haveserious consequences. A collision with a trailside tree,for example, can cause internal injury leading tosubstantial bleeding and, potentially, to shock.Shock occurs when the cardiovascular system, as aresult of illness or injury, cannot adequately perfuse theWilderness Medicine Newsletter 415March/April 9 999 tissue with oxygen. Shock is one of the body's defensesagainst brain damage: in times of crisis, shock keepsoxygen flowing to the brain by diverting it from the restof the body. The trouble with this survival mechanism,however, is that it quickly threatens the well-being ofthe extremities and the body core.Any person who has undergone a high-speed impactshould be monitored carefully for hints of such animpending crisis. Internal bleeding will be signaled bydiscoloration and, in the torso, by increasing abdominalrigidity and tenderness. To recognize shock, keep inmind the reasons for what the body is trying to do, andthe signs and symptoms will be apparent. As with somany illnesses and injuries, a change in the patient'slevel of consciousness is one of the earliest signs ofdanger.The person may quickly become restless,anxious, and disoriented and will become unconsciousin more advanced stages of shock. As: the brainattempts to maintainits own blood supply, aharder-working heart will be signaled by tachycardia,while the brain's attempt to maximize the concentrationof oxygen in the bloodstream will cause tachypnea.Through the effort to concentrate blood in the body'score, vasoconstriction of peripheral circulation willmake the skin pale, sweaty, and cool. The patient mayvomit, since the diversion of blood away from bodyfunctions that are not immediately vital won't permitdigestion of stomach contents. While blood pressurewill be maintained by these compensatory mechanismsfor a time, an abrupt shift to hypotension indicatesfailingsystemmaintenanceandimpendingdecompensation.Shock is one of the most potentially dangerous resultsof an injury.In the backcountry, there are severalthings that caregivers can do to keep the patient asstable as can be hoped with limited resources and tobuy some time to get the patient to definitive care. Ofcourse, your first approach should be to target thesource of the trouble. In the case of mountain bikinginjuries, that will most likely translate into an attemptto stop the bleeding.For external bleeding, directpressure, elevation, and use of pressure points shouldbe your first line of attack. However, for injuries thatcan potentially cause shock, these techniques may notbe enough.If you must consider using a tourniquet,remember that it is a last resort; once applied, it shouldnot be removed until the patient has reached definitivecare, and the person is very likely to lose the affectedbody part to amputation. Remember that when youapply a tourniquet, you are making a decision of lifeover limb; it is as simple--and as dramatic--as that.Apply any tourniquet distal to the involved joint, ifpossible, to preserve use of the joint. Note the date andtime the tourniquet is applied and make this clear forthe patient's subsequent caregivers, as by a messageacross the patient's forehead stating, for example, \"TK4/18 11:45 AM.\"Don't forget that, whatever the injury, you must striveto maintain an open airway in your patient. This maymean checking an unconscious or disoriented patientfrequently to assure that the patient has not vomited,and, if he has, to clear the airway and preventaspiration of vomited material. Keeping the patientwarm and dry is crucial, since externally assistedmaintenance of body temperature will help the brainmaintain adequate blood pressure. During transport,keep the patient as flat as possible with the legselevated.If you are transporting the patient on anincline and must tilt her, keep her head downhill fromher feet in order to maintain blood flow to the brain.CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INJURYA crash on the trail may also lead to injury of theCNS--specifically, to head or spinal cord injury.Suspicion of injury to the spine should be raised whenan injury is sustained at high speed, or when thedamage occurs as a result of a fallfrom aheightneither of which is an uncommon mechanism ofinjury in mountain biking. If your patient is consciousand coherent, get him to tell you his story, to explain hisown perception of what happened. Write it down,making notes of any suspicious mechanism-of-injuryfactors. Consider whether any distracting injury, suchas a broken bone or dislocation, may be detracting fromhis ability to evaluate other pain or to recall-the eventsthat led up to his crash. Your patient must be reliablein order for his account of events to help you rule outspinal injury.Signs and symptoms of spinal injury are numerous, andpatients may present with different combinations ofproblems.Guarding is a common result of spinalinjury, as is pain. Pain may begin immediately as thepatient moves to get up from her fall, or it may occurlater as you palpate the spine in an attempt to assess theextent of injury.It may be diffuse, constant, orradiating. The patient may feel numbness, parasthesia(\"pinsand needles\"),or a \"locked\"sensation.Wilderness ilfledicine Newsletter 516March/April 1999 Paralysis, full or partial, is an obvious sign of seriousdamage, and such a patient must be carefullytransported out of the backcountry.The spinal cord, as a transmitting pathway for theCNS, links the communication systems of the body andrelays information between the brain and the rest of thebody. Damage to the head, however, can interfere withthis pathway just as effectively as damage to the corditself.Headinjuryisanotherpotentiallylife-threatening consequence of a mountain bikingcrash. Whether you're biking in traffic or among trees,always wear a properly-fitting helmet to protect you.Head injury is tough to deal with in the baciccountry.The primary danger in head injury is an increase inintracranial pressure caused by swelling as a byproductof trauma to the brain.. The first sign of disturbance inintracranial pressure is a change in the patient's level ofconsciousness.This may mean that your patient'sresponsiveness actually decreases or disappears, or itmay mean a change in mannerisms and affect, such asincreasing irritability or combativeness.Patients with brain injury tend to exhibit an alteredrespiratory rate (including the classic Kussmaul's orCheyne-Stokesbreathingpatterns)aswellasbradycardia and widening pulse pressure. Headache,vomiting, and increased susceptibility to hyperthermiaor hypothermia are other common indications oftrouble.Finally, unequal pupils, though generallyrecognized as a classic indicator of head injury, are alate sign, and the absence of this sign should notencourage you to rule out such an injury. Signs andsymptoms of a skull fracture, aside from an obviousdepression of the skull or penetrating wound, includeraccoon eyes, Battle's sign, and cerebrospinal fluidleaking from the nose or ears.Treatment of a head injury will focus on transporting,monitoring, and ensuring the comfort of the patient. It'sgenerally safest to assume that a head-injured patienthas a spinal injury, too. Remember that, regardless ofthe suspected injury, you should always organize yourtreatment plan based on the vital signs that the patientis exhibiting.For example, a severe, bleeding injurycausing shock may be concurrent with a head injury. Ifthe patient's pulse is quick and his blood pressure isdroppingeven if a head injury is apparent aswell--your primary concern should be treating theshock.EXTREMITY INJURIESNot all mountain biking injuries fall into the categoriesof necessitating a Band-Aid or a body bag. Someafflictions come as a result of being stronger of willthan of body, especially early in the season.Overuse injuries in mountain bikers are particularlycommon in the upper extremities. Much of thepotential for injury rests in the nature of the sport.Wrists, for example, are bound to become sore whenthe trail is rough and incessant pounding plagues yourride. Many overuse problems, however, can be avoidedby being sure that your equipment, is sized properlybefore you head out on the trail. Good front suspensionand padded gloves will also help protect bikers fromsuch injuries, as such equipment will =reduce jarring, on,the wrists and arms, a very real concern if you want topreventupper-bodypainanddiscouragethedevelopment of degenerative arthritis.Unwise training schedules that push you too quicklycan also cause trouble. As in other distance sports,such as running, increasing mileage suddenly ortraining hard without proper preseason conditioningcan cause trauma. The excitement of getting out on thetrails after a long, snowy winter can easily tempt you toride beyond your abilities.Riding in too high a gearand relying too heavily on your large chain ring canalso cause injury. Build intensity gradually early in theseason, and add hill rides sparingly until you're back toyour peak performance level.Like overuse injuries,the majority of fracturessustained by mountain bikers affect the upper body.An attempt to break a forward fall can lead to adislocated shoulder or a clavicle fracture. (See nextissue's \"A Sport for the Season\" column on boating formore information concerning dislocations.) A collisionwith a tree may cause a broken wrist or finger. In allcases of suspected fracture, stabilize the injury, providenon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ifappropriate (and if not contraindicated by allergy), andtransport the patient for definitive care. In the case ofa broken wrist or finger, you may be fortunate in thatthe patient may be able to assist in the rescue. Proceedwith caution if allowing the injured person to bike outunder her own power.If any sections of the trailbecome steep or rough, your group should walk until arelativelyflatandobstacle-freepathcan bereestablished.Wilderness Medicine Newsletter 6 March/April 1999 GENERAL SAFETYMany of mountain biking's safety concerns are thesame as those of any outdoor activity. In all sports,keeping well hydrated should be a key priority, sinceneglecting fluid intake can make it hard to maintainstable body temperature and good judgment. You'llalso need to consider exposure and to guard againstsunburn, frostbite, hypothermia, or hyperthermia,depending on the weather in which you're riding. Asalways, dress in layers of synthetic fabrics wheneverpossible.Specific to biking, of course, is the need toknow basic bike repair and safety. Keep your bike wellmaintained to discourage sudden equipment failuresthat can cause injury. Carry spares of essential parts,such as inner tubes, along with the tools and theknowledge that will allow you,to make quick repairs onthe trail.Most important to general safety, as is so often the casein the backcountry, is having a keen sense of yoursurroundings and your place within them. Mountainbikers are commonly accused of being careless aroundother trail users. This criticism is too often justified.Do your part to avoid perpetuating this stereotype byknowing your environment and by being considerate ofother users. Before you head out, determine what typeof trail you'll be riding on so you'll know what range ofencounters to expect.Will there be hikers, joggers,people walking dogs? Should you expect to see riderson motorized vehicles or on horseback? Keep in mindthat horses, in particular, can spook easily, and youneed to pass them carefully and with warning. Ifpossible, avoid trails heavily traveled by hikers orhorseback riders.Maintain control of your bike ondownhills, especially around blind corners, and ride ata safe speed.Proceed with extra caution when youcan't see clearly where you're headed.Respect the trail, too, and avoid riding right after aheavy rainfall or in the early spring, when the groundmay be excessively muddy. Loss of traction on wetground will increase your chances of having anaccident, and your bike's knobby tires can wreak havocon the trail.The latter consideration is especiallyimportant in multi-use areas, since mountain biking isa higher-impact sport than most other trail activities,and hikers and joggers may resent not only yourpresence on the trail but also the scars your bike leavesbehind. A little mud can be a lot of funand you'recertainly not expected to stay clean on a good ride. Justtry to keep your activity in a range that won't inflictunnecessary environmental damage and that won'tdiminish anyone else's enjoyment of the trail.For your two-wheeled trips through local woodlandsand on remote backroads, a little preparation can makeall the difference. You'll enjoy your time so much moreif you feel confident in your abilities to treat your ownbumps and bruises, as well as to care for a fellow riderwho might have sustained a more serious injury, if theneed arises. More importantly, though, you'll be wellprepared if you ride with control, keep up withpreventative maintenance on your bike equipment, andleave any excess \"attitude\" at home when hitting thetrail.Don't lose sight of the thrill of that downhillwinda little risk, after all, is part of the fun. Just beaware of your limits, and consider. the impact .of youractions on the others in the backcountry. Then get outthere and get muddy.CLEARING THE S ME.A BRIEF REFRESHE ByBuckTiltonFirst, a disclaimer. There is always a slim chanceyou'll miss a spine injury and cause harm to thepatient. If you always want to be certain, everypatient with an MOI for spinal injury should beimmobilized on a backboard or litter. Wildernessmedical training offers a way to clear the spine,i.e., decide to not take spinal precautions, that isextremely accurate, approved by the WildernessMedical Society (WMS), and adopted by the Stateof Maine for urban EMTs. It gives all thosepatients who don't have a spine injury freedomfrom hours or even days of spinal immobilization,and all those rescuers freedom from carrying apatient miles and miles to have him or her clearedfive minutes after arrival at the hospital.Thepatientshouldreceiveafullpatientassessment withhisor her spine manuallyimmobilized prior to considering the patient as onewho can have his or her spine cleared. Do notallow your wish to clear the spine interrupt thepatient's need for a full assessment.

CLEARING THE SPINE...A BRIEF REFRESHER By Buck TiltonFirst, a disclaimer. There is always a slim chanceyou'll miss a spine injury and cause harm to thepatient. If you always want to be certain, everypatient with an MO1 for spinal injury should beimmobilized on a backboard or litter. Wildernessmedical training offers a way to clear the spine,i.e., decide to not take spinal precautions, that isextremely accurate, approved by the WildernessMedical Society (WMS), and adopted by the Stateof Maine for urban EMTs. It gives all thosepatients who don't have a spine injury freedomfrom hours or even days of spinal immobilization,and all those rescuers freedom from carrying apatient miles and miles to have him or her clearedfive minutes after arrival at the hospital.Thepatientshouldreceiveafullpatientassessment withhisor herspinemanuallyimmobilized prior to considering the patient as onewho can have his or her spine cleared. Do notallow your wish to clear the spine interrupt thepatient's need for a full assessment. Wilderness Medicine Newsletter 71 6March/April 1999 patients will experience some pain soon after theinjury. To wait too long to clear the spine, evenless than one hour, is to risk being fooled by thedeveloping pain of muscular stiffness, a result ofmuscle strain and not an indication of spinaldamage.SmoothEase Announces New, Patented,Blister Guard SocksFeaturing Dupont Teflon) FiberNEW YORK, NY - Smooth Ease recently presentednew,patentedBlisterGuard\u00ae socksthroughnumerous running and sports publications around thecountry.

And itcan happen to the most experienced professional. BillWilson is a seasoned veteran of wilderness instruction.For ten years, he has led 21-day three-season andfive-day winter expeditions with youth at risk. In thisarticle, Bill talks about a trauma he experienced, and weexamine the management of the resultant critical inci-dent stress.\"It was a cold day,\" he recalls. \"I had been out for fourdays with a group of inner-city youth. We were on atypical winter course, a follow-up to a 21-day course I'ddone with these kids the summer before. We had gonethrough all of the precautions that one usually takesduring the course to keep people warm and safe: Sorels,foot and hand checks.Everything was by the book.Except for the ambient temperature, maybe. I mean itwas bitterly cold that day. We started out for the longhike after breaking camp around 10:30 a.m. Like I said,I thought I'd taken the right precautions. But by the endof the day, one of the 14-year-old girls began com-plaining of pain in her feet.\"I'll never forget it,\" he con-cludes. His voice suddenly becomes very quiet. \"WhenI put her foot in my hands and tried to hold it, her toescrunched like frozen meat.\"Although Bill was cleared of negligence upon reviewof the incident by a national peer practices team of out-door leaders, he felt totally responsible. Even now, know-ing that the girl healed fully, Bill can get emotional aboutwhat happened.He imagines the face of his youngpatient. He has \"conversations\" with her family. He isunable to get the girl and the incident out of his mind.Questions like \"What if?\" and \"How could this have hap-pened?\" continue to haunt him. At the outset, Bill wasplagued with a feeling of sadness that lasted for weeks.It is important to understand the emotional conse-quences that result from a situation like this. Afterdoing everything in his power to protect the teenagersfrom the cold, Bill is shocked to find out that an injuryhas occurred.His assumption of providing safety hasbeen shattered. Harm has come to a girl under his care.As a first responder, Bill knows what to do with a frost-bite injury. He can provide first aid and proceed withthe evacuation of the patient. He can manage thewilderness crisis.But as a caregiver, he has emotionalconsequences to cope with as well. Bill is plagued byunresolved feelings. He can't seem to forget the sight ofthe girl's frostbitten skin, the sound of her toes crunch-ing, the way her frozen foot felt in his hands. Thoughtsof responsibility trouble him. He knows that he did thebest he could and that he followed protocol. Butthoughts of \"What if?\" go on for days. He continues towork but there is no closure to this incident.When a person presumes everything to be okay andit turns out not to be, the thought process that followscan be overwhelming. Self-doubt, second-guessing, andan inability to concentrate commonly result. Whensomeone bears witness to an injury of this magnitudeand feels connected in some way to the injured person,there often is an imprinting of sights, sounds, and tac-tile sensations for some time after the incident. Futuresituations may remind the witness of the upsetting inci-dent. The witness may choose to avoid the incidentlocation and similar circumstances. Depending on theseriousness of the situation or the resulting actions ofthose involved, such an event may be defined as a crit-ical incident. Search and rescue efforts are defined ascritical incidents when they result in high levels of emo-tional reaction by the responders. These reactions can22 be the result of circumstances surrounding the situationor of duration or intensity of the rescue effort. Extremefrustration can also result in an emotional response thatneeds to be addressed as a critical incident.Critical incident stress (CIS) is an emotional reactionto a situation that has the potential to overwhelm a per-son's coping mechanism and to impact his or her abili-ty to function at full capacity. Wilderness group leadersand search and rescue personnel can define potentialcritical incidents for themselves and can then work withcritical incident stress management (CISM) instructors todevelopappropriateresponses and servic-es.To date, mosttrainingprogramshavenotpreparedwilderness trip leadersor search rescuepersonnelforthepotentialemotionalconsequences of criti-cal incidents, but witha strong CISM pro-gram, the impact ofCIS can be minimized.One veryexperi-enced rescuer, whohasparticipatedinover250rescues,recounts details of atrip he led to recoverthe body of an eight-year-old child killed inthebackcountry:\"Iwas anxious when Ireturned home.Wehad to carry the vic-tim, a young boy, sev-eral miles out of thewoods without a bodybag. The boy was thesame age as my son.Once home, Istartedto get worried, think-ing that a similar situa-tion happen tomy child.\" The rescuerexpressed how how vulnerable wecan be to \"bad situations\" and how he would feel dev-astated if it were his child.Emotions can run high during a crisis, and the physi-cal demands on rescuers can be extreme. Every searchand rescue effort is a response to a crisis. People whowork in search and rescue must remember that they areare susceptible to the emotional consequences of theirwork.Even experienced responders can suffer emo-tional consequences following the recovery of a child.During any crisis, there are \"normal\" reactions thatneed to be understood. (See \"Reactions to Critical Inci-dent Stress\" insert.) After a critical incident, participantsmay feel like withdrawing from family or friends andcoworkers.' Participants frequently experience sadness,anger, and a range of other emotions. There may be aperiod of time during which concentration is impaired,sleep isdifficult, andthe person feels agitat-ed. Following a criticalincident,itis to that second-guessingofone'sactionswilloccur for at least a fewdays.Ithelpstounderstand reac-tions predictableand a are defined.The goal hereistoeducatepeoplebygiving them the toolsthat will allow them tobe more resilient aftera crisis.Training should alsofocus on the specificinterventions available after a critical incident. (See\"Seven Interventions for Critical Incidents\"insert.)These interventions are part of a CISM program. Possi-ble interventions include one-to-one peer support or agroup defusing soon after the DNITERVENUDONSFOR CROTICAL MODEM'SPre-incident educationIndividual/peer supportDefusingDebriefingDemobilizationFamily supportFollow-up that have significant emotional impact on a group, adebriefing should be led by experienced CISM person-nel, including mental health professionals, any timefrom 24 to 72 hours after the incident. Other interven-tions include family support and long-term follow-up.The final crucial component of this plan requires thedevelopment of a CISM support team. This teamshould consist of CISM-trained peers who are able torespond to wilderness groups and search and rescueparties after critical incidents. The team should haveconsulting mental health professionals available fordebriefings and supervision as needed. Currently, veryfew CISM support teams are available to search andrescue teams in most states.Crisis intervention techniques and CISM training arenow standard in most first responder training programsfor emergency medical services teams and for policeand fire departments.It is now time to include CISMeducation with all wilderness leaders' and search andrescue teams' training.It is also time to have supportavailable for responders when the emotional conse-quences of a situation or rescue effort become extreme.The goal is to educate about CIS first, then to provideCISM services when critical incidents occur.

Newton, WEMT Featured issue:KayakingPerhaps you dream of drifting along the Mainecoast in your graceful sea kayak, silently watchingthe late-autumn sky burn into shades of orange asthe sun goes down. Or maybe your fantasies runfaster, filled with adrenaline, focused on Coloradowhitewater and dodging rocks as wave after wavecools your hot summer skin. Whatever your pleas-ure, kayaking is a wonderful sport for all seasons.Though kayakers tend to avoid many of the stressinjuries that plague the leg bones and joints ofland-bound athletes, kayaking has its own set ofrisks and frequent injuries.Acute injuries to thejoints of the upper body are common, as are over-use injuries to the arm and lower back. Threats ofthe environment must be guarded against, as inany outdoor activity. Water itself creates a uniqueenvironment, and care must be taken to protectpaddlers from drowning and near-drowning, two ofthe greatest life-threats in any water sport.ACUTE INJURIESDislocationsShoulder dislocation is one of the most commonserious injuries suffered by kayakers. The white-water runner's high brace is a common cause ofshoulder dislocations, as is a paddle raised againststrong ocean surf. Even the most informed boater,knowing that she shouldn't lift her arm above aninety-degree angle to her torso, can be knockedinto a high brace by a sudden wave of swift water.A lift of the paddle combined with a twist of thearm can knock the humerus out of its socket, forc-ingitforwardanddownward,intotheanterior/inferior dislocation position. In this kindof injury, accounting for over ninety percent ofshoulder dislocations, the patient cannot bring theextremity to rest across the chest. Often, thepatient will be found supporting the obvious defor-mity in the most comfortable position, which willnecessarily be angled away from the body in somefashion. This feature will help differentiate it froma fracture of the humerus, in which the patient willgenerally be found supporting the arm in a slingposition across the chest. In addition to the typicalBEST COPY AVAILABLEWilderness Medicine Newsletter324 y/June 11999 postures of the shoulder dislocation, extreme painand a pronounced loss in range of motion will helpyou to identify this injury.In an urban environment, a person with a dislo-cated extremity would be splinted as found andbrought quickly to a hospital for reduction of theinjury. In the wilderness, the luxury of the hospitaldoes not exist.Reduction must be attempted onthe scene, as a prolonged dislocation can compro-mise circulatory and neurological function andcause permanent disability.Dislocations are mosteasily reduced soon after they occur, beforeswelling and muscle spasm set in. You should workquickly but calmly to assess the injury and toattempt reduction.Before beginning an attempt at reduction, assessbaseline circulation, sensation, and motion in theextremity distal to the injury site. Gather a quick his-tory from the patient, both about the events that ledto the current dislocation and about any past perti-nent injuries.Reduction of a dislocation shouldalways include communication with the patient,both to gain his trust and to enlist his help in theprocess.Many people who dislocate a shoulderhave done so in the past; this is a common recurrentinjury.If your patient has been through this before,he will likely know what works best to reduce theinjury. Ask his advice, and follow it. Whether thepatient offers advice from experience or just fromwhat feels best, be sure to talk him through theprocess and to get feedback continually.There are several ways to reduce a shoulder dis-location. One of the most commonly successful andleast painful methods requires the patient to lie onhis back.If possible, provide countertraction bysecuring the patient's torso to a point opposite theinjury, using a wide band of fabric tied to a station-ary_ object or held by a second caregiver. Start bypulling from the bend of the elbow, applying gentlebut firm traction along the line of the current orien-tation of the upper arm. As you maintain traction,you may try moving the arm carefully and gradual-ly toward the normal position. Do not use jerkingmotions and stop immediately if the pain increasessignificantly. Another favored method of shoulderreduction encourages the patient to stand, keepinghis legs straight while bending forward from thewaist. He then rests his head on his uninjured arm,which is bent at the elbow and comes across theforehead for support.His injured arm will hangstraight down, perpendicular to the ground, andgentle traction can be applied to it by grasping justabove the elbow and supplementing gravity's pull.This second method is probably the best way toattempt reduction if you find yourself alone with adislocated shoulder.Remember, while the reduc-tion should be attempted as soon as possible afteran injury, reduction is not usually quick. Take yourtime while maintaining gentle, steady pressure andexpect the process to take at least several minutes.Regardless of the method used for reduction, theshoulder should always be supported with a slingand swathe after reduction has been completed.Finger and thumb dislocations are another com-mon result of a paddle suddenly encounteringresistance. The best means for simple relocation ofa finger is generally a quick but controlled pushback into place, exerted from above, along withtraction in line. The thumb can be resistant to relo-cation, especially at the joint where it meets thehand. Attempt relocation /once. If your, effort fails,splint the injury in the position found. With thiskind of dislocation, an associated fracture of thewrist is common and may be assumed. The injuryshould be splinted as a wrist fracture, taking care toimmobilize both the thumb and the wrist. If thethumb has been successfully reduced, it may besplinted directly against the hand. If the patientmust continue to paddle, a well-padded splint, suchas a cut foam pad contraption forming a sort of cupin the palm of the hand, may help to minimize pain.Long-term care tactics of reduced dislocationsshould focus on two basic goals: prevention of fur-ther injury and promotion of healing. Most patientswill appreciate having the injured part splinted in aposition of comfort. Coupled with immobilization,a combination of rest,ice, and non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will help to mini-mize pain.The patient should be encouraged tomove the injured joint through a careful series ofnormal range-of-motion activities. As a caregiver,you should continue to assess the state of theinjury after reduction has been carried out success-fully.Specifically, take care to monitor circulationby checking the pulse beyond .the affected jointfrequently and by assessing skin color and sensa-tion.Again, the patient can participate in herown care.Ask her to notify you if she noticesa change in her condition or an impending prob-lem. Remember that the advantages of an earlyreturn to normal position include not only a lessen-ing of pain and damage to the patient, but also agreater ease of transport and a correspondingdecrease in risk to group safety. Upon return tothe frontcountry, have all dislocations assessed bya physician to check for associated fractures or Wilderness Medicine Newsletter 4I4bay/June 1999 compromises in the circulatory and motor systems.Abdominal TraumaTaking a swim in waves or in whitewater cancause any number of traumatic injuries. Collisionwith a large rock or with a boat or paddle goneastray may cause blunt trauma to the abdomen.Closed injuries incurred by abdominal trauma canbe very serious, particularly in the backcountrywhere the injured person is far from definitive careand cannot be offered surgical intervention.The abdomen is the region of the body best atconcealing major blood loss. For a period after theincident, the patient may seem in no great distressand the injury may appear minor. This is a result ofthe body's compensation immediately followinginternal injury.If the mechanism of injury suggestsmajor abdominal trauma, however, correspondingdamage should be assumed even if the patient ini-tially presents as fairly stable.When ruptured, hollow organs such as the stom-ach, intestines, and bladder may release such harshsubstances as acid or bacteria into the abdominalcavity.Solid organs, including the liver, pancreas,kidneys, and spleen, will bleed when ruptured, lead-ing to shock and its related complications. Any ofthese foreign substances will cause intense pain,tenderness on palpationpossibly indicated byguardingand a life-threat to the patient. Swelling,rigidity, and discoloration will increase as bloodand other misplaced fluids continue to invade theabdominal cavity.Expect vomiting, and take careto maintain the airway. Blood in the vomitus, withthe characteristic \"coffee grounds\" appearance, is asure sign of damage, as is blood in the urine tintingit pink or in the stool coloring it dark and tarry.Decreasing bowel sounds over time should because for concern, as this sign may indicate ensuingparalysis of the intestine.Since the patient is increasingly likely to vomit asshock diverts blood from the digestive system,avoid giving anything by mouth, unless small sipsof water are required to prevent dehydration duringa long evacuation. Keep her warm and dry, allow-ing a position of comfortwhich will generallyinvolve flexion of the kneesif no other injuriescontraindicate the chosen position. A good prog-nosis for the patient depends largely on the care-giver's ability to recognize the seriousness of theinjury and to coordinate rapid transport to defini-tive care.The best care that you can give thispatient will involve evacuating her from the back-country as quickly and as comfortably as possible.CHRONIC INJURIESOveruse InjuriesRepetitive motion injuries of the tendons, a threatto all those who depend on their arms for coordina-tion and for strength in action, are the frequentbane of kayakers. Among the afflictions are ten-dinitis, tenosynovitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome.Tendinitis is a general term for the inflammation oftendons that comes along with repetitive move-ments and stems from a weakening of the tendonsas a result of overuse.Similarly, tenosynovitis isbrought on by the swelling of the tendons thatresults from repeated forceful strain on the hands.Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by the inflamma-tion of a specific group of tendons, those that passfrom the wrist into the hand. When these tendonsswell as a result of overuse, they generate pressureon the median nerve, causing pain and numbnessto spread through the arm. Kayaker's elbow, asport-specific variation on the classic tennis elbow,is the upper limbs' version of water on the knee andcan also be a painful and debilitating injury.You can avoid repetitive strain injuries and relat-ed tendon irritation by minimizing the motions thatmost often cause such damage. The most effectiveway to do this is to master solid basic skills and tomake a conscious effort to use good technique. Interms of equipment, you can also minimize repeti-tive strain by choosing your paddle well. Someexperienced distance paddlers recommend anunfeathered paddle, while others tout the forty-fivedegree offset as the ideal compromise. All recom-mend that you avoid grasping your paddle tootightly and build your strength gradually, workingup to longer distances and wilder waters only onceyou've mastered easier passages.If you feel numbness or pain in your arms as aresult of too much paddling, the best relief willcome from rest, NSAIDs, and the support of firmelastic bandages.Kayaker's elbow, in particular,should mandate a week's rest, as the seriousness ofthe injury is compounded by decreased healing ofwounds or infections in the arm during the afflic-tion. Damage from carpal tunnel syndrome, moreso than from generalized tendinitis, tends to belong-lasting and may require surgical intervention.Lower-back painStrain on the lower back as a result of incorrectlifting of boats and gear or of prolonged sittingwhile on the water can be remarkably incapacitat-ing. Even with rest, days to weeks may pass beforethe pain completely vanishes. However, you may Wilderness Medicine Newsletter 5 26 May/June 1999 be able to make yourself functional, if not fullyhealed, within a few days using a combination ofrest, focused exercise, and ice. Begin resting first onyour side or on your back with stiff padding behindyour knees. With too much rest, your muscles willbegin to weaken, so you should try to incorporatesome light exercise, such as easy walking, into yourroutine as soon as pain will allow. As you begin tofeel stronger, include gentle abdominal crunches.Stop if you feel any increase in pain. Massage andicing will also decrease healing time, and NSAIDscan help bring down swelling. The best treatmentfor lower-back pain, though, is clearly preventative.Back pain can be difficult to quell once you sustainan injury and may recur over the course of monthsor years if not treated adequately at its outset. Pre-vent strain to your back by stopping every hour orso, when possible, to stretch or by frequentlystretching your legs inside the boat when you can'tget to shore.ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMSSunburnLong days on the water can lead to heat-relatedinjury, as in any outdoor sport. Paddlers are partic-ularly susceptible to sunburn, whether from directexposure or from sunlight bounced off the reflectedsurface of the water or refracted through clouds.Sunscreen, protective clothing and headwear, andcommon sense can all help decrease sun damage toskin and avoid the pain that goes along with abad sunburn.If a sunburn is suffered in spite of your bestattempts to avoid too much exposure, do what youcan to soothe the skin.Cooling with clean watercan provide relief, as can topical analgesic creamsor sprays. Keep' in mind that sunburn increases therisk of dehydration, as well as susceptibility to bothhypothermia and hyperthermia, and encourage thesufferer to drink extra liquids. If blisters form, donot pop them, as this will facilitate infection. Avoidfurther sun exposure to already-damaged skin.DehydrationDehydration is another prominent concern foranyone in the wilderness, increasing. susceptibilityto hypothermia, hyperthermia, and a whole host ofother environmental concerns and accidents. (See\"A Sport for the Season\" Nov/Dec 1998 column fordiscussion of and \"A Summer Heat Illnesses\" in the Jul/Aug 1998 issue for cov-erage of hyperthermia.) Boaters are not immune todehydration, in spite of spending their days sur-rounded by water. Be sure to plan a means of waterdisinfection or desalination for your trips, as mostnatural sources, untreated, do not provide reliablysafe drinking water. The hassle of needing to uri-nate frequently can discourage adequate hydrationduring boat trips.If you neglect to take in adequatefluids while paddling, be sure to drink plenty ofextra water or decaffeinated hot drinks eachevening to catch up.It's generally easier to crawlout of your sleeping bag at night than to get toshore during the day. A constant dampness and thecooling effects of splashing waves can lull you intocomplacency.Butbeingmoistisnotequivalent to being hydrated. Be sure to drink aminimum of several liters each day, even in cool,damp conditions.Dampness if Hygiene IssuesWhile keeping diligent watch for dehydration,boaters should not neglect to guard against trou-bles brought on by continual dampness. A widerange of problems, from superficial skin irritationsto the serious threat of trenchfoot, can be precipi-tated or exacerbated by excessive moisture.Chafing and rashes are common side effects ofspending long hours in a small boat, as sand andsea debris can cause irritation when trapped in wet-suits or drysuits. Pressure sores may arise after longhours of sitting in one position. Treat the conditionfound. Clean and bandage any wounds, taking careto keep bandages dry. You may choose to sootheskin with topical anti-itch ointment or other reliefcreams or gels.Longer-term care should includepreventing and monitoring for signs of infection. Toprevent these irritations, keep skin dry and clean,consider using powders if they tend to work well foryou, and get out of your boat to stretch and tochange position when possible.Dampness can also cause hygiene troubles, par-ticularly tract infectionsin women.(See Nov/Dec 1998 issue.) Again, keeping clean anddry will go a long way toward preventing problems.Treat the cause of the trouble, and provide an envi-ronment in which it can heal.Most serious of allthe injuries caused bydampness may be trenchfoot, a non-freezing coldinjury that can lead damage.(See\"AFewWordsofWisdomonTrenchfoot/Immersion Foot\" in the Sep/Oct 1998issue.)Prevent trenchfoot by keeping feet dry, bychanging socks regularly, and by never sleeping inwet socks at night. Wilderness Medicine Newsletter 627May/June 1999 IMMERSION Et SUBMERSION INJURIES.The difference between immersion and submer-sion is a matter of a few millimeters, at mostand so,accordingly, is the difference between breathing airand taking water into the lungs. The most commonimmersion-related concerns have to do with theeffects of cold on the body. Hypothermia can comeon quickly, even within a few minutes of falling intofrigid waters. When hypothermia is acute, handlethe person very gently, and be sure he is dry and wellinsulated before exposing him to external warmingsources, is a sudden change in temperature maysend a shock to the system drastic enough to causecardiac failure in extreme situations.While the immersion victim can be in great dis-tress and in grave danger, it is the submersion vic-tim who will most likely be at extremeseither pan-icked or unconscious. To assist a struggling swim-mer, follow these rules of rescue: reach, throw, row,tow, go.If you can reach the person from a stablepoint on shore, offer a hand or an outstretchedbranch, or throw a buoyant object to give supportand flotation. If you're throwing something, be sureto aim upstream from the person so he will be ableto reach the object as it moves toward him ratherthan be forced to watch helplessly as it floats awayfrom his grasp. You may row if you have a raft, aboat, or another means of venturing out to help.Alternately, you may choose to throw a flotationdevice on a tow rope and to pull the swimmer intosafety. Swimming out to the person is always a lastresort. Remember that to get into the water with astruggling swimmer is to risk your own life. Drown-ing people have incredible strength, inspired bypanic, and will pull you down with them. Only con-sider swimming out if you are an experienced waterrescuer and are fully willing to risk your life to help.Once safely on shore, assess your patient. If heis unconscious, check respirations and pulse andperform rescue breathing or CPR as necessary.Expect him to vomit as water is forced out of thelungs, and be sure to keep the airway clear and toavoid allowing aspiration of vomitus. In any sub-mersion victim for whom the mechanism of injuryinvolves flipping a boat in whitewater or for whomthe mechanism of injury is unknown, assume aspinal injury and treat with caution, including use ofa modified jaw thrust during artificial respiration,until such an injury can be ruled out by a thoroughhistory taking and patient assessment. All immer- sion and submersion patients should be treatedfor hypothermia once primary life-threats havebeen addressed.BEST COPY AVAILABLEProblems caused by submersion will generally bemore complicated than those caused by immersion.Even near-drowning patients who are part of a suc-cessful rescue may not survive the injuries incuiredin the submersion.Having taken water' into thelungs, some submersion victims will die hours, days,or even months after the rescue from related pfob-lems, including complications of pneumonia orother lung ailments. Even after a successful rescue,always bring a near-drowning patient to definitivecare for evaluation and follow-up treatment as soonas you're out of the backcoUntry.As in so many backcountry maladies, preventionis keywhen,it comes to paddling injuries. In thecase of chronic and environmental problems, inparticular, maintaining awareness of your comfortlevel and of threats in your environment can keepyou alert to impending problems before they esca-late to the point at which they can ruin a trip.Water-based environments are full of inherent dan-gers.Your best defense is to anticipate problemsand to keep your skills sharp. For sea kayaking,practice rolling, towing, and re-entry positions. Forwhitewater boating, focus on swift-water rescuetechniques and develop a strong low and highbrace. Learn to be a confident swimmer, but neverlet a healthy confidence in your own strength over-shadow respect for the power of the water. If youkeep your skills current and your equipment ingood shape, you'll never let a lack of preparednesskeep you from enjoying that shimmering sunset orthat classic big wave.This article concludes the column \"A Sport for the Sea-son.\" Look to the past three issues of the WMN for install-ments on backcountry skiing (Nov/Dec 1998), trail running(Jan/Feb 1999), and mountain biking (Mar/Apr 1999).Thanks for reading!

Walking, climbing, or skiing in themountains must be a pleasure for the child. It is importantto adapt the length of the activities to the age and fitnessof the child and to respect rest times. In general, since eachchild develops individually, the advice given below shouldbe adapted individually. As long as the parents do not takethe children along with them in the mountains, but, rather,the other way around-the parents (teachers or youth lead-ers) accompany the children-adventure and fun are notfar away. Specific AttitudeRisksChildren are not under more restrictions to acute expo-sure to altitude than adults, at least not below 3000 m atsea level. Above 3000 m, data are lacking, and only cau-tion can be recommended. Children may not be able toexpress the symptoms of altitude sickness, and the parentsshould, therefore, be alert to recognize headache, nausea,vomiting, or difficulty in breathing. These symptomsshould not be attributed to childhood illnesses. They maybe the result of altitude illness and must be evaluated by amedical professional.If medical attention is not immedi-ately available, every effort should be made to descend.Medications preventing Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) inchildren are not recommended, and it is imperative torespect acclimatization rules.Infants with any knownhealth risks should not be taken to altitude.Ear, Nose, and Throat RisksRisk of otalgia or otitis is greater with rapid changes inaltitude and barometric pressure. Do not take sick childrenon cable cars or chair lifts.In case of rapid pressurechanges, let babies suck frequently. If the infant has a cold,it is better to cancel the trip; if impossible (to cancel thetrip), clean the infant's nose as much as possible with salinesolution to avoid blocked nose.ColidThe risk of frostbite and hypothermia is higher for chil-dren because of less subcutaneous fat for insulation, lowerenergy reserves, and higher body surface-to-weight ratioswhich lead to higher heat losses. Clothing and shelter mustbe adapted and should be regulated during the day byresponsible adults. Since children lose a great deal of heatthrough their head, it is important to keep their heads cov-ered to protect them from the cold. A backpack baby-car-rier in cold weather can be dangerous, since the baby maycool down very fast due to impaired blood circulation.SamMore than for adults, protection from UV-rays is essentialfor children. Walk and rest in shady places. Protect theskin with adapted clothes and the naked skin with ahighly protective sunscreen.Protect the eyes with sun-glasses of good quality.It is recommended that childrenwear sun hats. ikkMelonAs with adults, children should drink plenty to reduce thehigher risk of dehydration, which can lead to: frostbite inwinter, heat stroke in summer, and tendon and cartilagelesions. Children must eat regularly to prevent low energyreserves. Do not allow children to skip a meal.Carrying a RaticksackChildren's backbones and joints are not yet fully devel-oped, and overloading (heavy backpack, long steepdescents) in the youth may result in damage for life.Accordingly, heavy backpacks should be avoided. A rule ofthumb for the weight of the child's rucksack is not more than1 kg before age 5, less than 3 kg before age 8, and less than5 kg before age 12. Let the child carry the water bottle.Taking a RestChildren get tired quickly, but recover fast as well,even while playing during a rest. So frequent breaksare important. (continued next page) REST COPY AVAILABLE30 Ante Noantatin Lticitnez(6A5)A diagnosis of AMS is based on a recent gain in alti-tude, at least several hours at the new altitude, and thepresence of headache and at least one of the followingsymptoms: gastrointestinal upset (anorexia, nausea, orvomiting), fatigue or weakness, dizziness or light-head-edness, and difficulty sleeping.FRIEW[ENTIMIRIAbove 2500m prevention must be the same as for adults:O Progressive ascent (300m verticaldistance of sleeping altitudes)O Moderate activity on arrivalO Descent if symptoms of AMS persist KEDKICkL CONOODIERATOON5FOR FAITHENU TIT-EIR5By Keith Conover, MD, FACEPTake a minute of your time to read this, and to think aboutthe medical aspects of how you tie patients into a litter. I'mnot thinking about security: you don't want your patient tofall out of the litter, even on a nontechnical evacuation, soevery patient needs to be secure in the litter. I'm not thinkingabout packaging for hypothermia, or rigging the tie-ins tosecure a patient with a broken leg, broken rib, whatever. I'mthinking about the medical effects of your tying the patientinto the litter. What effects will this have?Well, first, the patient can't move. Immobilization has sev-eral medical effects. For someone with a broken spine, immo-bilization may prevent neurological injury to the spinal cordor the nerve roots coming out of it. For other broken bones,immobilization is good, too, at least up to a point. Actually,for certain fractures, too much immobilization can be bad.For instance, assume someone has a small fracture of thehead of the radius (just beyond the elbow, on the outside ofthe arm). How long should it be immobilized? Only for aboutthree days, and only using a sling. After this, you need to getit moving again to prevent permanent stiffness in the joint.It'll be rare that you care for someone with a radial head frac-ture for more than three days, but the point is that immobi-lization is not always good.Immobilization also tends to make bones weaker, but thiseffect occurs over weeks, and is not likely to be a problemduring the average backcountry rescue. Immobilizationmeans that blood doesn't get pumped back to the heart verywell. The veins pump blood back to the heart by way of one-way valves. They work when the surrounding muscles alter-nately contract and relax, squeezing different parts of thevein. If the legs and arms aren't moving, there is no pumpingaction, and the blood tends to stagnate in the arms and legs.This means there is less blood return to the heart, and thearms and legs may even get puffy (edema) from the extrafluid there. For this reason, immobilization is a significant riskfactor for a clot in the leg (a deep venous thrombosis or DVT).Children Going to the Mountains continued About the Authors: The Union Internationale Des AssociationsD'Alpinisme (UIAA) is an International organization of moun-taineers, physicians, and backcountry experts who set world-widestandards in mountaineering and climbing. The MedicalCommission of the UIAA works to record, consider, discuss, and pub-lish all health and medical affairs in the entire area of mountaineer-ing and climbing within the framework of the assignments andgoals of the UlAA. This article is reprinted by the permission of FranzBerghold, MD, (University of Salzburg, Austria) past president of theUIAA Medical Commission. 'A piece may break off the clot and travel to the lung (a pul-monary embolism or PE). When it reaches the lung, it pre-vents blood from getting through the lung. This usually pro-duces chest pain, shortness of breath, and, if large enough,immediate death. Another important risk factor for DVT andPE is dehydration.Backcountry rescue patients are almostinvariably dehydrated, from cold exposure and hypothermia ifnothing else. A third risk factor, quite relevant to all types ofbackcountry rescue, is local trauma to the legs.So, you see, by tying the patient into the litter, you're takinga patient who is at high risk for DVT and PE and immobilizinghim or her, making DVT and PE even more likely. Is thereanything you can do?If the patient is conscious, you canprompt the patient to alternately tighten and relax the legs. Ifyou have a long wait because some of the rigging isn't ready,and the patient doesn't have a suspected spine injury, untiethe patient and let him or her move around a little. Try tohydrate the patient as best you can: IV fluids if available,Gatorade or something similar if it's okay for the patient totake oral fluids (a whole separate article). There are medica-tions that may help: blood thinners will help prevent clots.However, if your patient is bleeding, or may be bleeding,blood thinners are not a good idea. (For instance, if someonesuffered a blow to the head with decreased level of con-sciousness, then you would worry about bleeding in the brain,and not give blood thinners.) One blood thinner that youprobably have in your pack is aspirin. A single small dose ofaspirin is all it takes. (The dose is about 40 mg., which is halfa \"baby aspirin, or a small fraction of a 325 mg. regular adultaspirin.)Larger doses don't have any more effect and mayactually have less of a blood-thinner effect. Heparin is a bloodthinner that is more potent than aspirin, but must be given asan injection into muscle or through an IV. However, heparinis not a standard prehospital drug even for paramedics, andshould only be given on a doctors order.There is one final thing that you can do. Be careful of yourleg tie-in. Anything tight around the leg or ankle will decreasevenous flow and promote clotting. If you can leave room forthe patient to wiggle his or her legs, that's even better.The next time you package a patient, think about venousflow, DVTs, and PEs. Wilderness Medicine aftr-ume X01 uoun zreNTBy Jeff Backer, Jr., DMA, NREMTEvery day you take care of your children, love them, andpray they stay out of harm's way but you probably don'tknow that every day you dowse them and yourself with thesame harmful corrosive ingredients found in brake fluid,degreaser, and antifreeze. Soaps, shampoos, bubble baths,and cosmetics are loaded with several dangerous chemi-cals. For instance, in 1993, an FDA survey found the high-ly toxic 1,4 dioxane, a cancer-causing deadly chemical, inall but three of thirty children's shampoo and bubble bathproducts that were analyzed.Cosmetics, skin creams, all bar soaps (clear or white),body lotions, shampoos, and deodorants are the least reg-ulated products under the Federal Food, Drug Et CosmeticAct (FFDCA). Disturbingly, the FFDCA does not require pre-market safety testing, review, or approval for these prod-ucts. Cosmetic manufacturers are not required to registertheir companies, products, ingredients, or adverse reactionsreportedbyconsumerswiththeFood8rDrugAdministration (FDA).Except for a handful of bannedchemicals, manufacturers can add almost any ingredient topersonal care products. \"You know more about the ingre-dients in your dog's flea collar than you know about toxic-ity of whatever you're putting on your skin,\" argues DavidWallinga, a senior scientist with the Natural ResourcesDefense Council in Washington, D.C. *Even if the [Food andDrug Administration] suspects that serious adverse healtheffects are caused by a cosmetic product, they can't requirethe manufacturer to provide test data to prove the prod-uct's safety,' says Oregon Senator Ron Wyden.\"Every day we use products that we think are safe weassume the product has been tested and any dangerousingredients labeled. The truth is, products are not alwayssafe and manufacturers don't have to tell us so,\" writesDavid Steinman, consumer advocate who has investigatedthe safety of thousands of products over the past fifteenyears. \"You cannot be completely healthy if your skin is nothealthy,' says Linda Chae, a world-renowned expert in cos-mecuticals and nutrition for the skin. The skin is the largestorgan of the body and considered the 'third kidneybecause it assists in releasing toxins from the blood. \"Whenwe apply products, even with minute amounts of toxins,they enter our internal system and build up in our organsand this is not limited to children only; says Ms. Chae.The word non-toxic appearing on many consumer prod-ucts is misleading. \"According to the federal definition, non-toxic doesn't necessarily mean \"not at alltoxic\" or\"absolutely safe,\" but can mean that up to half of the labo-ratory animals exposed to the product through ingestion orinhalation die within two weeks,\" states Ms. Chae. As forpossible long-term effects of exposure, says John Bailey,director of the FDA's office of cosmetics, 'Those kind ofissues are not addressed very well.\" According to Mr. BenFuchs, a pharmacist and leading cosmetic chemist, \"Themost notable and long-term side effects would be dermati-tis,itching, eczema, psoriasis, scaling conditions, excessgrowth, plus cancer is not unheard of from long-term use.\"Sodium Lauryle Sulfate (SLS) is the most harmful ingredi-ent in personal care products, but is widely used because itis a cheap detergent and foaming agent. SLS is a harshindustrial detergent used in garage floor cleaners, enginedegreasers, and carwash soaps. Research has shown thatSLS and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) may cause poten-tially carcinogenic nitrates and dioxins to form in the bot-tles of shampoos and cleansers by reacting with the otheringredients found in these products. Large amounts ofnitrates can enter the blood stream through the skin fromjust one use. SLS causes eye irritation, is linked to cataracts,and delays healing of corneal tissue. The Journal of theAmerican College of Toxicology writes that SLS impairsproper structural formation of young eyes and causes per-manent damage.Dr. Keith Green, Ph.D., D. Sc. of theMedical College of Georgia reports, that SLS denatures pro-teins of the eye tissues, impairing development perma-nently. Because it is absorbed through the skin, it does nothave to enter the eye directly. This toxin is often disguisedin so-called natural products as \"derived from coconut,\" butremains a toxic substance, capable of all the above effects.Another harmful ingredient found in most personal careproducts is Propylene Glycol. Commonly abbreviated asPEG, propylene glycol serves as a humectant (it makes theskin feel moist), but is really \"industrial antifreeze\" and themajor ingredient in, brake and hydraulic fluid. MaterialSafety Data Sheets (MSDS) warn to avoid skin contact as ithas systemic consequences and exposure can cause brainand liver abnormalities, kidney damage, gastro-intestinaldisturbances, nausea, headaches, and vomiting, as well ascentral nervous system depression. The AmericanAcademy of Dermatologists reported, from a publishedclinical review, that propylene glycol causes a significantnumber of reactions and was a primary irritant to the skineven in low levels of concentrations.Industry critics, such as Ms. Linda Chae, suggest reformslike establishing industry-wide standards for safety testingand reviewing data from countries that have banned theseparticular ingredients.

In light of this news, many people havewondered howor ifthis would affect SOLOsince WMI \"sister schools.\u00b0 Well, here's the story...In the mid-80s, Frank Hubbell Et Lee Frizzell (ownersand founders of SOLO since 1976) worked with PeterGoth (then owner of the newly organized WildernessMedical Associates) to develop the Wilderness FirstResponder course. The first WFR course was held inFlorida in 1985 where Frank met Buck Tilton andMelissa \"Bugg Gray, who at that time were OutwardBound instructors and students in that first WFR pro-gram. Several months after the course, SOLO was con-tacted by Buck and Bugg who asked if they could jointhe SOLO staff and train to become wilderness medicineinstructors.For the next five years, Buck and Buggworked hard to help manage the explosive growth ofSOLO.-In those days SOLO was offering programsthroughout the United States, and quite a few contractshad been established in the West, NOLS among them. Early on, Buck and Bugg had expressed an interest ineventually locating in the West. This desire meshedwell with Frank's and Lee's vision of having a western-based SOLO. So, due to the tremendous investment intime and effort Buck and Bugg had put into SOLO, Frankand Lee offered them SOLO'S western contracts and theunrestricted rights to offer programs with SOLO certifi-cations in the West as a way of recognizing and reward-ing their contributions.When Buck and Bugg moved to Pitkin, Colorado andincorporated as the Wilderness Medicine Institute, theydid so free and clear of any legal ties to SOLO. Theywere considered a \"sister schools because they offeredSOLO-developed and SOLO-certified programs. Therecent sale of WMI is the sale of Buck and Buggs ser-vices and company; it is not the sale of SOLO programs.Certifications for WMI courses will now be WMI ofNOLS, not SOLO.

The program is oriented toward professional leadersand outdoor enthusiasts who are looking for more information. At the request of our stu-dents, we have extracted the leadership component of the renowned ALEC program andtailored it for students that already have the WFR or WEMT background. We derived theleadership principles from many years of contact with thousands of trip leaders whoshared their assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of their training and also fromthe trip-leading experiences of our own staff. Although we will not be teaching more med-ical information than the WFR or WEMT class that students have completed, those skillswill be practiced and reinforced. At the end of two weeks, students will receive OWLS certificates acknowledging that theholders have been thoroughly exposed to and has actively practiced the leadership andemergency prevention skills for which SOLO is known. The OWLS certification is award-ed to individuals who have met the minimum classroom and field requirements. The OWLS program will introduce hard skills such as navigation, weather forecasting,group cooking and hygiene, and evacuation. Students will also examine leadership con-cepts such as differing leadership styles and their applications, client and co-leader con-frontation, and wilderness use ethics. Each student will give at least one presentation tothe class and will critique each others presentations. As part of a team, students will cookmeals for the class, examine case studies, and navigate orienteering courses. There willalso be a number of practical scenarios involving both leadership and medical issues. This ten-day, ninety+ hour curriculum takes place over a two-week period. A typical dayconsists of a mixture of didactic lecture sections and hands-on skills practice. To optimizelearning potentials, OWLS complements these sessions with a variety of mock scenariosand case studies for students to evaluate their own leadership skills. As an extension ofthese exercises, the class will spend several days outdoors and have one overnight trip.Known for their \"open-learning\" environments, SOLO courses are taught to audiences witha variety of learning styles. The only prerequisite for participation in OWLS is a current WFR or WEMT certification.SOLO recognizes both WMA and WMI of NOLS certifications. Bring your medical skills andan eagerness for new ideas and more practice. The premiere OWLS course will run from October 11-22, 1999. To register, contact SOLOat 603-447-6711 or 888-SOLO-MED.

How many of us con-sider the pedal abuse that we inflict regularly when we cramour feet into too-tight boots and hike over bone-jarring terrainfor miles on end or kick steps into hard-packed snow withfrozen feet in plastic boots. Other than to whine occasionallyabout our aching feet, we seem to be totally oblivious to theirtitanic effort. And the effort is enormous. Did you know, forinstance, that you take about 8-10,000 steps in a single day?(That's if you're averagedouble or triple that statistic if youhave an active lifestyle.)

When you consider thatthose 8-10,000 steps every day add up after awhile (about115,000 miles in your lifetime or, in practical terms, a strollaround the globe not once but four times) and those poundsof pressure increase as you gain weight, add a heavy pack, orrun instead of walk (running increases the force to 3-8 timesyour body weight), you may start to realize what gems you'vetruly got squeezed into those old trallrunners.Our feet are extremely complex and intricate structures.Each one is made up of 26 bones, 33 joints, 107 ligaments, 19muscles and associated tendons. They are ingeniouslydesigned to transfer our body weight from our legs to theground. The arch, with its many bones and joints, provides anelastic, springy connection so that the jar of weight-bearing ismostly dissipated before it reaches the long bones of the legand thigh; the arch also functions to improve locomotion byadding speed and agility to the gait. The foot itself is capableof rolling from side to side when it contacts Irregular surfaces.This capacity allows the leg to remain vertical throughout themotion thus helping us to avoid injury and allowing us toremain upright. The toes enable us to \"grip\" the surface onwhich we walk, again, keeping us upright and helping us tomove about. When you think about it, feet are quite amazing7)feats of accomplishment. So why do we take them so muchfor granted? Probably because, in the grand scheme of things,injuries to our feet are not tragic affairs. Few people actuallydie from sprained ankles, tendinitis, fallen arches, or blisters.The sucking chest wounds, fractured femurs, and head injuriesDget all the press because they are life-threatening . .. they'reTAt App Volume 10, Number 5 dramatic! How many of us actually rush to the scene of a vic-tim of Achilles tendinitis?A sprained ankle?In reality,although those foot-injured patients may not be on death'sdoor, their injuries (as most any injury to the foot) can put anend to a trip just as quicklyalbeit not as dramaticallyas moresevere injuries to other body parts.Like everything in life, the key to keeping your feet healthyis to pay attention to them. Some of the most common mal-adies of the feetand the not-so-commonare also the easiestto prevent:-Blisters-- it shouldn't need to be said, but . .. stop thembefore they start. We all understand this intellectually. But howmany experienced outdoors people still get blisters? Everyoneknows the basics: keep feet dry, avoid cotton socks (they keepfeet wet) in favor of a synthetic which wicks moisture away,wear two layers of socks (a thin liner under a thicker pair) totransfer the friction, and make sure that boots fit wellnot tootight, not too loose. The thing is we just get lazy. We ignorehot spots that tell us that blisters are on their way, or we don'ttake prophylactic measures (like duct-taping heels or smearingpetroleum jelly on feet) even though we know we're prone toblisters. Though we may spend countless hours in the field lec-turing clients or friends on how to prevent blisters, we oftenignore this advice ourselves and end up having to make thatage-old decision--to pop or not to pop. (Pop, of coursewith asterile needle at the base, drain the fluid, clean, and dress.) Doyourself a favor and heed your own advice.-Aching arches-- can be caused by pounding when youwalk. A heavy pack or walking down a steep hill can add tothe pounding, especially if boots are not supportive. Accordingto the experts, the first thing you should check is your form.Although most of us think we know how to walk properlyit'sinnate, right?there is a correct form: Lead with your heel andpush off with your toe. This sounds simple enough, but if youfind your arches are frequently hurting, have someoneobserve the way you walk. Obviously, if your form is correctand the problem persists, you should see a podiatrist . .. youmay need orthotics.-Blackened toenails-- caused by your big toe hitting thefront of your shoe or boot, usually because of improper fit (atoo-short shoe or pressure from the toe box). Toenails thataren't trimmed back can also cause blackened toenails; how-ever, don't cut them too short, or you may end up with(continued on next comfortably loose when worn with soft,absorbent socks.*Be shaped like the foot; broad and wedge shapeis best; avoid high heels.Be made of breathable material like canvas orleather; no plastic.*Be comfortable the moment you put them on. (Oh, My Aching Feet!continued)ingrown toenails. Remember that most people have one footthat's larger than the other. When shopping for shoes andboots, buy them to fit the larger foot and don't forget to trythem on with the socks that you'll be wearing with them. Buyshoes in the afternoon If you can as your feet tend to swell abit during the day, and it's best to have shoes that will fit then.Have your feet measured (while standing) every time you shopto insure getting the proper size. Feet change over time.- Skin problems-- sweaty feet can cause rashes andeczema at best, trench foot at worst. Wearing cotton socks,plastic shoes/boots, or tightly fitting shoes/boots may notallow sweaty feet to dry properly. You've got about 250,000sweat glands in your feet that can excrete as much as half apint of moisture each day, so, chances are, if your body'sworking hard, your feet are probably going to be wet. Changewet socks as soon as you can and allow feet to dry out com-pletely (this can also help eliminate smelly feet). More seriousconsequences can develop when feet are exposed to cold andwet over a longer period of time (12+ hours). Trench foot is theresult of decreased circulation to the feet which causes actualtissue damage. Signs and symptoms include pale or mottledskin, numbness and/or tingling, swelling and, if bad enough,blisters and lesions. Trench foot is easily avoidable by makingsure that feet get dry at least once during the day. Keeping aspare pair of socks in your pack so that you can always sleepwith dry feet is a good way to help prevent trench foot. A lessserious but more common foot problem is athlete's foot, arash, often between the toes, caused by a fungal infection.Again, good foot hygienekeeping feet clean and drywillgenerally prevent it while anti-fungal creams can help treat.Soft Tissue Injuries-- cuts and scrapes of the foot, like anysoft tissue Injury, should be cleaned thoroughly and dressed.A laceration of the sole, particularly, should be watched as thepressure put on it from weight-bearing and walking may causethe wound to widena problem that may require stitches.Puncture wounds can be a serious matter because of the riskof tetanus, although any infection is possible as these woundsare hard to clean andby the nature of their locationhard tokeep clean. It's a good idea to get a tetanus booster shot every3-7 years. A good preventative measure is to avoid goingbarefoot. Even beachcombers and swimmers should wear pro-tective footwear as mollusk shells (or beer cans) can be razorsharp and can easily slice open the soles of feet, despite thefact that the soles are covered with an unusually heavy cuta-neous layer. A deep cut that requires stitches can keep you offyour feet for awhile. Ideally, going barefoot should be kept toan Indoor activity.Musculoskeletal injuries-- stubbing a toe can be morethan just a minor nuisance. If swelling, bruising, or pain per-sists beyond a few days, you may have fractured a toe.Fractures that aren't taken care of-- especially of the big (great)toe--can cause long-term foot problems. Stress fractures (alsocalled fatigue or march fractures) of the foot are not uncom-mon injuries for people that carry big packs over long dis-tances in heavy boots when they are not accustomed to thisactivity or bump up their running mileage too quickly. (Thistype of fracture was first identified in the feet of soldiers mobi-lized during WWII who were required to march many milesunder the load of heavy packs.) Feetlike any part of thebody respond to overuse with a breakdown in the system. Inthis case, metatarsals that are not used to that kind of stresssimply break under the strain. Pain along the forepart of thearch that increases with weight-bearing and is relieved by restmay Indicate a stress fracture. Stretching of the arch may causepain as well. There is usually no history of an injury-causingmechanism other than overuse. Though fractures can certain-ly be a problem, they are less common than strains andsprains. Remember, there are lots of muscles, ligaments, andtendons in the foot and ankle, and a misplaced step or chron-ic overuse can cause damage. Any strain or sprain should betreated with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) andshould be seen by a doctor to prevent on-going problems.Achilles Tendinitis-- inflammation of the Achilles tendonwhich attaches to the back of the heel bone is a fairly commonfoot/ankle injury in active outdoors people--especially run-ners. Irritation to the tendon and its sheath results in pain andpossible swelling. The cause may be anything from chronicoveruse, improper footwear, running on hills or over uneventerrain, or a direct blow. Ice and gentle stretching (a bent-kneestretch) should help minor inflammations; note that trying torun through Achilles tendinitis can convert a minor injury intoa severe one that requires surgery.Heel pain (Plantar Fasciitis)-- pain that runs both belowand behind the heel often results from an irritation of the tis-sues, nerves, or bones of the heel. These irritations usuallyindicate an inflammation of the plantar fascia where it insertsinto the heel bone (in more severe cases, a spur may developon the heel). Runners and other athletes who subject the archto strain, may develop plantar fasciitis or heel spurs. A directblow to the heel can also cause spurs as will poorly fittingshoes. For plantar fasciitis, try heel pads or cups and arch sup-port along with RICE, bent-knee stretching and a change ofshoewear. Although rare, surgery may be necessary to removea spur. According to one physician source, donning cowboyboots may alleviate the problem.Neuromas-- swelling caused by irritation to a nerve canhappen anywhere in the body. The most common neuroma--Morton's neuroma--occurs on the bottom of the foot betweenthe toes. A small nerve to the toe becomes pinched betweenthe toe joints, toe knuckles, and the shoe and can result inpain, burning, tingling or numbness. Treatment may be assimple as a change in footwear, using pads to help alleviatepressure, and avoiding irritating activities. In severe cases,surgery to release or remove the nerve may be required.Plantar warts-- the skin's reaction to a chronic virus infec- Wilderness Medicine Newsletter 239September/October 1999 (Oh, My Aching Feet!continued)tion that invades the sole of the foot through cuts and otherbreaks in the skin. (Another reason not to go barefoot outside.)Pressure from shoes may cause plantar warts to be painful.Plantar warts can be removed by way of one of several meth-ods: over-the-counter medications (limited effectiveness),physician-prescribed medication (very effective, but slow), orby a physician directly (very quick and effective). Your physicanor podiatrist should be consulted for the best method ofremoval for your foot based on the location, size, and depth ofthe plantar wart.Activity-Specific problems-- Additionally, certain activitiescarry their own inherent risks for feet Winter sports, forinstance, can put feet at risk for frostbite. The cold tempera-tures combined with wet feet (either from sweat or snow soak-ing through inadequate footwear) and often too-tight and con-strictive boots cause a decrease in circulation that promotesfreezing of tissues. Make sure your boots fit well and that theyare well-insulated and waterproof. Keeping your entire bodywarm will also help to keep your feet warm, so be sure to wearhats, gloves, and lots of layers. Socks should be woven with anacrylic fiber that wicks away moisture. In extreme tempera-tures, you may want to consider vapor barrier liners for yourfeet. Below are other considerations for specific activities:DOWNHILL SKIING AND SKATINGProperly fitted ski boots and skates are the single mostimportant factor in safe and successful skiing and ,skating,according to podiatrists specializing in sports medicine. Asnug (but not too tight) fit helps to ensure that the pressureexerted by the constant forward motion and lateral movementof skiing and quick turns of skating will not end in injury.Proper ankle support will also guard against sprains, strains,and fractures.CROSS-COUNTRY SKIINGCross-country skiing uses different maneuvers than down-hill, so it requires different footwear. The cross-country boot ismore like a bicycle shoe than a downhill boot. It is bound tothe ski only at the ball of the foot and allows up-and-downmovement at the heel. Precisely because the heel is constant-ly moving up and down, it's important to stretchfirst.Otherwise, you may end up with Achilles tendinitis. The bootitself should not irritate the ball of your foot while skiing; itshould fit snugly enough that your heel doesn't slip in the bootbut not so tight that it compromises circulation.WINTER RUNNINGRunning on hard-packed snow or icy surfaces may causerunners to change their foot-strike pattern or to land on sur-faces with the whole foot (rather than the normal heel-to-toestrike) to increase traction. Both can lead to muscle strain oroveruse injuries. There's always the risk, too, of slipping on anicy surface and twisting an ankle. Some runners choose to usespikes slipped over running shoes to increase traction but thatcan be problematic as well if runners aren't accustomed tousing them. Another potential risk with winter running is yourfeet's susceptibility to frostbite. Many people think that sinceyour feet are constantly in motion while you're running thatthey can't get frostbite. But feet still sweat (remember those125,000 sweat glands per foot?), and cold will quickly perme-ate the thin material of which most running shoes are made.Also, remember that cold muscles take longer to warm up, soalways stretch first.BEST COPY AVAILABLEWilderness Medicine NewsletterCYCLINGNext to selecting the appropriate bicycle, proper footwearin cycling should be your most important consideration. Shoesneed to have a stable shank to efficiently transfer power fromyour feet to the pedals. The lack of shank support in sneakers,for instance, allows the foot to collapse through the arch whilepedaling. This can cause arch pain, tendon problems, or burn-ing under the bottom of the foot A rigid shank protects yourfeet from the stress of pedaling. For most efficient pedaling,shoe shanks should extend fully under the ball of the foot. Theuse of toe clips on pedals or a clipless system allows feet andpedals to work as a unit to achieve maximum efficiency intransferring power generated by the hips to the foot Faultyfoot positioning on the pedals can also lead to problemsspecifically, knee pain. Shoes that limit side-to-side motion cancause knee pain, too, if the knees, feet, and pedals are mis-aligned.

Often, we may feel compelledto incinerate them after our foray into the woods.Actually, our socks or sock system is integralwith our boots and vital to the well-being of ourfeet. As our feet are our transportation in thebackcountry, the sock choice we make can meanthe difference between a pleasant or a miserabletrip, and in certain circumstances can lead to a lit-ter evacuation.Socks serve these primary functions: to insulatethe foot from heat and cold; to move moistureaway from the foot and, thus, keep it dry; to pre-vent the \"shear forces\" which cause blisters; andprotecting the foot by keeping it a distance fromthe boot material, known as \"stand off.\"The different materials from which they aremanufactured give socks a variety of properties,some beneficial, some neutral, and some evendetrimental. Wool has excellent \"stand ofr andmoisture absorbency, but dries slowly. Nylon isgood for strength and form, but can be too hot;often, nylon is woven with wool to add strength.Polypropylene is strong and has well-known mois-ture transfer properties, known as \u00b0wicking.'Polyester, too, is a good wicker. Acrylic, on theother hand (or foot), breaks down too easily. Orlonis too soft, reducing the stand off space. Cottonthe most popular choice in socks is usually theworst choice for hiking, as itis too hydrophilic(water-absorbent), and causes the most blister-pro-ducing friction.Blister prevention is perhaps the most impor-tant function of our socks. When dry, socks pre-vent shearing, the friction between the foot andthe sock. However, as the sock gets wet, this forceincreases and causes the spreading of connectivetissue. To protect itself, the body pads the areawith a secretion of water underneath the skin,which we call a blister.Another cause of blisters is excessive heel lift; asthe laces over the arch loosen with walking, thereis effectively more room in the boot, allowing theheel to lift with each step. The foot can slide back-ward in the boot, causing pressure and friction inthe forward part, resulting in blisters on the ball ofthe foot. Also, as the heel is lifted past the trans-verse folds above it,the Achilles tendon willabrade and blister as well.Heel lift can be prevented by \"differential lac-ing;\" lace the boots tightly for four or five eyeletsand tie, then lace the remaining eyelets moreloosely to accommodate for calf expansion. Withthe forefoot laced down, the heel should notlift. Boots too long or large can also cause heel lift,where socks 'walk down\u00b0 your leg into the boot.Try a 1/16 or 1/8-inch Poron insole to remedythis problem.Boots and socks work together to provide prop-er fit, so a good-quality, well-fitted system is criti-cal. When you try on boots, make sure you arewearing the same sock system you will wearwhen hiking (or skiing, or climbing), includinginsoles. Also, wear a weighted pack, as the weightwill simulate the extra spread of your foot whenyou are carrying a full pack. Measure both thelength and width of your feet, and take intoaccount that the midsole in quality leather bootswill shorten slightly with wear (which is what caus-es boots to get the classic \"rocker shape). Try theboots on unlaced with your toes jammed intothe toe cap; there should be about 1/2 inch ofspace behind the heel. Similarly, with the heelagainst the heel counter, there should be a 1/2inch between the end of the longest toe and theend of the toe box. Lace up the first five eyelets,and walk around to check for heel lift. If the bootscannot be comfortably tightened to prevent heellift, try the next smaller size. Make sure your toeshave plenty of space to wiggle: cramped toesequal blistered toes.The two-sock system allows your footwear thebest opportunity to do their job. Start with a thin,( continued on page 6 ) Wilderness Medicine Newsletter 441September/October 1999 (Oh, My Aching Feet!continued)much standing on pedals can also cause knee pain. You mightneed to investigate a few things to determine the source of thepain.) Shin splints may also become a problem for cyclists. Painto either side of the leg bone is caused by muscle or tendoninflammation. This condition may be related to a muscleimbalance between opposing muscle groups in the leg.Generally associated with excessive foot pronation (as experi-enced by some runners and an injury found more commonlyin runners), shin splints can also happen as a result of wearingimproper shoes when cycling that allows the arch to collapse.Proper stretching and wearing appropriate cycling shoescan prevent the problem. Achilles tendinitis in bikers can becaused by improper pedaling, seat height, lack of a properwarmup, or overtraining.Sesamoiditis is an inflammation of the sesamoidstwosmall bones found beneath the first metatarsal. Sometimesknown as the \"ball bearings of the foot,\" these small bones caninflame or rupture under the stress of cycling. Sesamoiditis canbe relieved with proper shoes and/or orthotics. Numbness ofthe feet can also be a problem for cyclists. It's usually causedby an impingement of small nerve branches between the sec-ond and third or third and fourth toes that cause swellingresulting in numbness, tingling, or burning, or sharp shootingpains in the toes. Wider shoes or loosening toe straps or shoelaces often alleviate the problem. Or, try a clipless system if theproblem persists.RUNNINGInjuries common to runners are shin splints, plantar fasciitis,Achilles tendinitis, stress fractures for long distance runners,blisters, and blackened toenails. Most happen as a result ofovertraining, bad shoes, or poor terrain (hills, uneven surfaces,concrete surfaces). When injuries occur, then, it's a good ideato look at your training schedule, where you're running, andyour shoes. A good running shoe should have a wide, cush-ioned heel and sole. The toe box should be deep enough toprevent the toes from pressing against the top and longenough to allow free motion and gripping during running.There should be about a thumbnail-length between thelongest toe and the front of the shoe. Running shoes shouldhave spring in the forefoota good way to judge this is if theforefoot of the shoe tilts up off the ground when the shoe restsflat. The shoe should be flexible but not limp; the heel counter,firm and padded to support the heel. The sole of the shoeshould be cushioned enough to absorb much of the shock ofrunning. A soft neoprene insert sole is a great help, too, inabsorbing shock. Most running shoes have a built-in arch sup-port which can be helpful in avoiding excessive pronation.HIKINGProbably the most common malady afflicting hikers is blis-terseither due, as mentioned previously, to poorly-fittingboots or downright laziness. Boots should be big enough toaccommodate a pair of thick socks (or the two-sock system, ifyou prefer) and still give you some wiggle room to ensure ade-quate circulation but they should not be so big that they allowyour heel to slip when you walk. Too tight, too looseboth cancause blisters. Sprained ankles can also be a problem whenhikers buy boots with inadequate ankle supportespecially ifthey are hiking in boulder fields or other uneven terrain.Though some people prefer the low-cut \"sneaker\" boots, youshould consider what kind of load you'll be carrying and whattype of terrain you'll be crossing when buying boots. Somepeople, too, just have weak ankles and need the extra supportthat a full boot gives. There are many models of hiking bootsavailablewhen you shop, you should know exactly whatyou'll be asking your boots to do for you. A boot for a day hikein the woods may be quite different than what you need forthree-week expedition in the mountains. Also, take your hik-ing socks with you when shopping so you can get a proper fitwith what you'll normally be wearing.So now, considering all that you're asking your feet to dofor you, how do you keep your feet happy? Practice good foothygiene, for starters. Keep feet clean and dry and toenailsproperly trimmed, and don't go barefoot. Then look at yourshoes and boots. They should be comfortable, practical andwell fitting meaning they should fit the shape of your foot.Narrow and tight shoesno matter how fashionable they areor how good they make you lookover time will result in footproblems. According to the American Podiatric MedicalAssociation, only a small percentage of the population is actu-ally born with foot problems--ill-fitting shoes are the major cul-prit. Shoes should fit comfortably in the store when you buythem. If new shoes need to be \"broken in,\" they were eithernot properly designed or not properly fitted to your feet. Andstay away from what the American Orthopaedic Foot andAnkle Society calls \"cruel\" shoes: high-fashion shoes withpointy toes, shoes with thin soles, and shoes with high spikeheelsall can cause crowding of the toes and/or increasedpressure on the feet. These can lead to corns, calluses,bunions, and neuromas for starters with potential for on-goinglong-term foot problems. Choose function over fasion andyour feet will love you for it. And don't forget to pamper your-self. Soak your tootsies in some nice warm water or give thema massage with refreshing pepermint lotion at the end of theday or after a long walk or hike. Remember, you've got fourtrips around the globe to cover.REFERENCES:Brochure of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society,Seattle, WA.Brochure of the American Podiatric Medical Associationin cooperation with the American Academy of PodiatricSports Medicine.Treatment of Injuries to Athletes, O'Donoghue, Don H., M.D.,W.B.SaundersPublishingCo.(Philadelphia/London/Toronto), 1970.\"Running Injuries,\" Clinical Symposia by CIBA, volume 32,number 4, 1980.

Epinephrine, which increases bloodflow and helps restore breathing, is used to treatacute asthma attacks or severe allergic reactionsto insect stings or certain foods.For American Home, which faces legal prob-lems from its diet drugs and Norplant contracep-tive device, the recall is just the company's latestsetback.American Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratoriesdivision said it in 1 mL Tubex syringe. Thecompany said it's taking the action after observ-ing discolored samples in routine quality-controltests. A few of the discolored samples were foundto be less potent than they should be, which couldpose a potential health hazard for those who usethem to battle the allergic reactions.\"We encourage those who depend on these kitsto err on the side of caution,' Phillip de Vane,North American medical director for Wyeth-Ayerst,said in a statement. He encouraged consumers tocontact their pharmacists and other health careproviders to determine whether their allergy kitsare being recalled or have lost potency.The recall includes the Insect-Sting TreatmentKit packaged and distributed by Derm/Buro Inc.;Anaphylaxis Emergency Treatment Kit packagedand distributed by Bayer Corporation as Hollister-Stier Ana-Kit; and Ana-Guard, which was pack-aged and distributed by Bayer. All the kits soldvia prescription cost around $40.00.About 450,000 Ana-Kits and 55,000 Ana-Guards are being recalled in the United States andCanada, said Kathleen Bauemschmidt, spokes-womanforHollister-StierLaboratoriesofSpokane, Washington. Bayer sold its allergy kitmanufacturing business to Hollister-Stier in June.It was unclear how many kits were beingrecalled by Derm/Buro.The number of kits being recalled representsabout 25 percent of all allergic reaction kits onthe market, Bauemschmidt said. Consumers cancallWyeth-Ayerstat1-800-999-9384.Replacement products are available through doc-tors' offices and pharmacies.Overall, shares of American Home have fallenmore than 40 percent this year because of a rashof problems, though shares rose 6 1/4 cents to$41 in New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday.In August, a jury awarded $23 million to aTexas woman who claimed the company failed towarn her about the dangers of diet drugs, Reduxand Pondimin, also called fen-phen. Hundreds oflawsuits are now pending nationwide against thecompany stemming from the diet pills' potentialto cause heart-valve problems.The company this summer suspended ship-ments of rotavirus after it was linked to bowelobstruction in 32 infants. And last year, AmericanHome recalled a painkiller, Duract, after it causedfatal liver problems.With the latest numbers, 0497, 0597,8141, 11464, and 13239, should be returned tothe hospital, clinic, or pharmacy where they wereobtained.

The view of the surrounding mountainswas spectacular as the group of teens worked together to pullthe sleds over the last rise. The sweet feeling of success oneveryone's part was interrupted by shouts from the head ofthe line. One of the group members was leaning over with herhands on her legs, trying desperately to take in a good breath.With few exceptions, there is little else that creates suchanxiety for both a patient and a caregiver in a backcountrysetting than the inability to breathe. The good news is thatbackcountry traumas leading to respiratory emergencies are(fortunately) few and far between. However, there are medicalconditions that can create breathing difficulties for those ven-turing into the wilds.This article will review some of thosemedical conditions, their causes, signs and symptoms, theirtreatment, and preventative steps. First, some basic anatomy and physiology. Air passages inthe nose (nasopharynx) and mouth (oropharynx) join togetherto form the pharynx.The pharynx then divides into theesophagus (which brings food to the stomach) and the tra-chea. The epiglottis prevents the entry of food into the tra-chea (and ultimately the lungs). Just below the epiglottis is thelarynx (voice box), at the superior portion of the trachea. Thetrachea then runs aloi-ig the anterior surface of the neck, (itcan be felt just beneath the skin), into the chest. The tracheadivides into right and left air tubes, called bronchi. Eachbronchus enters its respective lung, branching into smaller andsmaller air tubes, the smallest of which are bronchioles. At theterminus of the bronchioles are alveolar air sacs. It is here thatthe exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes placebetween the single-celled walls of the alveoli and lung capil-laries. When looking at medical conditions that affect the res-piratory system, it is often divided into the upper and lowerrespiratory tracts. The upper airway includes the naso andoropharynx to the epiglottis while the lower airway beginswith the larynx and includes the trachea, bronchi, and all partsof the lungs.The respiratory center in our brain controls the rate anddepth of our breathing. This center will respond to either toolittle oxygen or too much carbon dioxide in the body. Wheneither situation exists, the brain causes the diaphragm andintercostal muscles to contract. Air rushes in to the lungs toequalize the pressure created by the flattening of thediaphragm and the expansion of the chest wall. Thus, webreathe. Exhalation is passive; as the intercostal muscles anddiaphragm relax, air escapes the lungs with ease, until the airpressure in the lungs and the outside air become equal. Oncethere is a build-up of carbon dioxide (or a lack of adequateoxygen), the whole process is repeated. That is, unless thereis an interruption in the process.HISTORYTry to familiarize yourself with program participants andtheir individual medical histories prior to starting a trip.Knowing any preexisting conditions, allergies, and medica-tions prior to someone developing a problem can go a longway toward keeping yourself calm during a respiratoryemergency.When assessing anyone in respiratory distress, rememberyour ABC's. If a respiratory emergency arises and the patientis able to speak, ask him if this has ever happened before, and,if so, was it similar and how was it treated. Also, ask him todescribe the difficulty, when it began, what makes breathingbetter, what makes it worse, is there pain associated with thedifficulty, and if so, where. Check vital signs. What is the skincolor (blue?), temperature(fever?)andmoisture.(clammy?). theMountains 5Year 2000 ConferenceSchedule 6CalendarBack Cover BEST COPY AVAILABLE 46 While doing a physical exam, listen to breath sounds at themouth and chest wall. If you do not have a stethoscope, placeyour ear over the chest wall in the same places you would puta stethoscope. Observe the rise and fall of the chest, notingany unusual or uneven movement of the chest wall.By fully assessing your patient and gathering all informa-tion, you will have the greatest opportunity to determine thenature of the breathing difficulty and the appropriate actionsnecessary for relief.ASTHMAAsthma is a chronic inflammatory dis-ease of the airways and is rapidly on therise in the U.S., particularly in children. Thereason behind this rise is not completelyknown.What is clear is that asthma ismanageable, and those with the diseasecan still participate in outdoor adventureswith proper care and preparation. With asthma, an individual's airways aresensitive, swollen, and constricted. An asth-ma attack may be triggered by cold, dry air,exercise, stress, an upper respiratory infec-tion, or inhalation of various allergens suchas pollens, molds, dust mites, animal dan-der, or smoke. An asthma attack may bemild to severe and may start suddenly ormay take a long time (even days) to devel-op.During an attack, the airway swells,and the smooth muscles in the airway tight-en.This causes the airways to narrow,making breathing difficult. At the sametime, cells in the airway make more mucusthan normal, and this mucus is thick andsticky. Because the bronchioles are so nar-row to begin with and swelling makes themeven more narrow, the mucus can createplugs in the bronChioles.An individual experiencing a mild ormoderate attack may start to feel tightnessin the chest; she may also be coughing upmucus, have a feeling of restlessness, orhave difficulty sleeping. The patient mayexperience very short periods of breathless-ness; and may be wheezing or making whistling sounds whilethey are breathing.air becomes trapped in the alveoli. An ever-increasing difficul-ty in breathing causes many patients to panic and forgetwhere their medication is located. Asthmatics may carry a variety of medications to managetheir asthma, namely bronchodilators, which open the air pas-sages by relaxing the bronchial muscle and antiinflammatoryagents, which reduce the swelling inside the airways. It isessential to act quickly to bring an asthma attack under con-trol.In an emergency situation, the patient will need to use afast-acting, inhaled bronchodilator such asalbuterol ( Proventil, Ventolin) to help openthe airways. T y to keep the patient calm(that goes for you, tool) If the patient can-not find his inhaler, ordoes not have one,ask him to attempt pursed lip breathing. Bypuckering the lips during exhalation, backpressure is created inside the lungs, open-ing the bronchioles enough to allow air toescape from the alveolar sacs. Ifleftuntreated, asthma has the potential to killby completely occluding the airway. Whenthe use of a bronchodilator and/or pursedlip breathing Is ineffective and the patient'sairway is severely compromised, you mayneed to administer Epinephrine (0.3cc at1:1000 concentration for adult, 0.15cc at1:1000 concentration for children) in thesame dose as for an anaphylactic reaction.Once the patient is able to breathe, give theinhaler. (Do not give asthmatics antihista-mines.)THE SOUNDSOF LABOREDBREATHINGWHEEZING - a whistling orsighing sound made as air passesthrough narrowed passageways.Indicates that the problem is insmaller airways of the lower res-piratory tract This is generallyheard upon exhalation. STRIDON - a harsh, high-pitched sound indicating signifi-cant swelling or an obstruction inthe upper airway. CRACKLES - what was histor-ically referred to \"rales\" medidne nowterms as These breathsounds can below-pitchedsounds with a snoring quality orfine breath sounds similar to thesound of hair being rubbedthrough fingers that are placeddose to an ear. In either case thesound is created because of fluidor other secretions are in the airpassages. During a severe attack the patient will be wheezing audiblyas air escapes through very narrowed air passages. Most peo-ple will assume a position of sitting or standing up and lean-ing over (tripodding), which helps them to breathe better. Thepatient will have difficulty talking, and lips and nail beds willbecome a bluish color from lack of sufficient oxygen. Neckmuscles may become tight as the patient breathes, and theskin around the ribs may get sucked in (particularly with chil-dren). The chest may appear overinflated, as more and moreAs mentioned above, there are manydrugs used in the management of asthma.A number a metered dose_inhaler.Anti-inflammatory agent use helps toreduce the swelling in the air passages andminimize the chances of an asthma attack.In another type of treatment, medicationssuch as cromolyn sodium (Intal) are used toinhibit allergens from triggering bron-chospasm. Please note that these medica-tions are used for longterm effects and willnot assist the patient in a crisis situation. As with the use of anymedication, be sure you assist in the administration of theright drug to the right person for the right reason.Other measures to help prevent an asthma attack fromoccurring in the backcountry include: avoiding contact withallergens which cause a reaction; covering the mouth andnose with a scarf or bandana to prewarm the air in coldweather; maintaining emotional safety; staying well-hydrated;taking medications as prescribed by a physician; and begin-ning the trip in good physical condition.BEST COPY AVAILABI FWilderness Medicine Newsletter 24 7November/December 1999 rillEUNGAIDAPneumonia is an infection in the lungs caused by a virus,bacterium, or fungus. The infection causes the alveoli andspaces between to become filled with pus and sometimesblood, inhibiting the transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream.Depending on the cause, pneumonia may develop quickly, orover the course of a few days. The patient often has an exist-ing upper respiratory infection (such as a cold) and will devel-op a productive cough with thick yellowish, greenish, or blood-tinged sputum. This cough may or may not be accompaniedby difficulty breathing. A fever (101F or higher) and chills willbe present. Pulse and respiratory rates increase, and the soundof crackles may be heard with a stethoscope initially, and pos-sibly unaided as the infection progresses. If a stethoscope isavailable, you may also note diminished breath sounds in theaffected area of the lung. The patient may complain of chestpain on the affected side. In severe cases, she may be sweat-ing profusely, and show signs of cyanosis.Clearly, this individual needs to be evacuated from thebackcountry to seek medical treatment. If capable of walking,she should do so, as it will expedite the evacuation process.Continue to monitor vitals during transport and keep thepatient well-hydrated. (Fluids will help prevent sputum fromplugging the lungs.)If available, provide oxygen as needed.With regards to prevention, keep an eye on anyone whodevelops a cold or other upper respiratory infection.Oftentimes staying well-hydrated and getting plenty of rest isall someone will need to quickly get her on the road to recov-ery. Watch for signs of a worsening problem: developing ahigh fever or thick, colored sputum, and be prepared to actaccordingly. Remember to encourage coughing to help expelthe fluid in the lungs.DTYPERMENTFOILAITOONHyperventilation Syndrome is a common and benign formof respiratory distress created by a psychological stress. Anemotional reaction, pain, physical exertion, etc. may cause thisreaction. The stress makes the individual breathe faster and/ordeeper, blowing off much of the carbon dioxide in the body.Excessive loss of CO2 from the blood makes the blood morealkaline. Alkalosis interferes with the normal function of mus-cles and nerves, causing coldness, numbnessand tingling of the hands, feet, and around themouth. The patient will experience lighthead-edness and increasing shortness of breath.This alarms him and causes him to breatheeven faster. Blueness and spasms of the handsand feet (carpopedal spasms) may develop asalkaline levels increase. Rapid breathing caus-es excessive use of chest muscles, which maycause a slow onset of chest pain. Continuedhyperventilation will lead to the constriction ofblood vessels in the brain, and the patient willfaint. He will revive on his own once carbondioxide levels have returned to normal. (If thepatient passes out, he may stop breathing forup to 30 seconds before CO2 levels improve.)BEST COPY AVAILALTreatment of Hyperventilation Syndrome must include aprimary assessment to deal with immediate life threats. Onceit has been determined that the patient is suffering from hyper-ventilation, it is very important to calm him. Speak slowly andclearly, looking into his eyes. Try to breathe with the patient,starting at his breathing rate and gradually slowing that ratedown to a more reasonable pace. If this is not possible, askhim to try and hold his breath for short periods of time,increasing that time as you go along to allow for the increaseof carbon dioxide in the system. Once the patient's breathingreturns to normal, treat the underlying cause of the attack.Prevention includes being sensitive to the emotional needs ofthe individual and providing emotional support in an appro-priate manner as is necessary.55PONUMIE0115 Pilnliv001THOLItAXSpontaneous Pneumothorax is created by a congenitallyweakened area in the lung which spontaneously collapses,causing air to leak from the lung into the surrounding pleuralspace.The highest incidence of spontaneous pneumothoraxoccurs in tall, thin, muscular adolescent males and men intheir early twenties. Often the patient may have recently gonethrough a growth spurt. The pneumothorax may be spurredon by playing sports or severe coughing, though signs andsymptoms often occur when the patient is at rest. The patient will have a sudden onset of shortness of breathand chest pain. There may be decreased breath sounds on theaffected side. He may also have a previous history of a spon-taneous pneumothorax. An individual suffering from a spon-taneous pneumothorax needs to be seen by a physician. Hemay be capable of walking, but if not, place him in a positionof comfort (usually sitting up). Give oxygen if available andassist with ventilations as needed. Since a spontaneous pneu-mothorax is caused by a congenital defect, there are no back-country measures that would prevent its occurrence.In general, treatment for someone with difficulty breathingshould include:Keeping the patient, yourself, and those around you calm.Maintaining an open airway and monitoring vital signs. @ECO[212LZE, 17pG2 OOGI[EcICOR00001,r)oDa8R,woag Keeping the patient, yourself, and.those around'calm.Maintaining an open away and maniiiiing Vital Signs.Assisting in ventilations as needed by the patient.* Giving oxygen to anyone in respiratory 'distress, if it.is available.4* Treating the cause of-the problem, and evacuating.thepatient to the neared niedical facility lithe is not possible. Wilderness Medicine Newsletter 3 November/December 1999 HANTAVIRUSPULMONARY SYNDROMEHantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) was firstdescribed in 1993, when several people at aNavajo nation in New Mexico died from respira-tory failure associated with the disease. The virush4.11!en foiandprimarily in the SouthwesternU.S. (particularly Arizona, Colorado, New Mexicoand southern Utah), but it has been reported in atotal of 28 states.It is carried principally by thedeer mouse, which then sheds the virus in itsfeces, urine and saliva.It is believed thathumans take in the virus when saliva or excretaare inhaled as dust, absorbed through themucous membranes of the eyes, via skincuts/abrasions, or possibly through inadvertentingestion of the material. Humans do notappear to infect other humans with HPS:The hantavirus has an incubation period ofbetween one and six weeks, typically two weeks.The exposed individual develops a fever withchills, muscular aches, headache, possibly nau-sea and vomiting, and malaise. Within a fewdays the symptoms worsen and are accompa-nied by coughing and shortness of breath.Acute respiratory distress and respiratory failurequickly follow as the lungs fill with fluid. Peoplehave died within two to ten days after onset ofsymptoms.Ribaviren, an antiviral agent, is being tested todetermine its usefulness intreating.HPS, butcurrently there is no cure for the infectioncaused by the hantavirus. Chances of survivalare increased through use of a respirator, soimmediate evacuation to a medical facility isvital. As with any patient in respiratory dis-tress, monitor vitals, maintain an open airway,assist with breathing as needed, and give oxy-gen if available.Avoiding areas where rodents have burrows ornests may prevent the contraction of the han-tavirus. Use a tent with a floor, or use a groundtarp that extends at least two to three feetbeyond the sleeping bag. Store all food in anarea inaccessible to rodents. Properly dispose ofany trash or garbage as quickly as possible tominimize the risk of rodent visitors.-Assisting in ventilations as needed by the patient.Giving oxygen to anyone in respiratory distress,if it is available.-Treating the cause of the problem, and evacuating thepatient to the nearest medical facility if that is not possible. Many medical respiratory emergencies may be preventedthrough a combination of the following: keen observation bythe group leader for signs of excessive physical or mentaloverexertion; appropriate use of medications by individualparticipants; and the employment of necessary measures toprevent environmental factors from affecting the health andwelfare of all trip members. Now go out and play hard, have fun, and breathe easy inthe backcountry!

As more and more people are taking holidays ataltitude and many of them are elderly, there are going to be anumber suffering from chronic medical conditions. Howshould those who are planning trips to altitude be advised?EFFECT (S)EF ACTONJig E AND THEariliA011 [DIMON EMTAt altitude the low barometric pressure means that the oxygeninhaled is at a lower pressure than at sea level. This in turnmeans that the oxygen transport system of the body is oper-ating under difficulties, and any chronic condition whichaffects this system will make matters worse. Thus diseases ofthe cardio-respiratory system are especially likely to interferewith performance at altitude.Apart from the effect of altitude itself, the mountain environ-ment poses other hazards. The great ranges are situated most-ly In under-developed countries and in wilderness areas wheregastro-intestinal problems are common and medical helpuncertain.Altitude holidays usually involve quite strenuousexercise and put a strain on the Joints, especially knees, hipsand backs. Finally, the different culture and lifestyle of such aholiday may impose psychological stresses which may be toomuch for some people unused to the difficulties and privationsof such a trip.There is also the consideration that on an expedition or trekthe aphorism, No man is an island,' applies with greater forcethan in normal urban life.One members illness affects thewhole team and may even imperil the safety of other mem-bers.Therefore, itis ethically imperative that if a personknows he/she has some pre-existing condition which mightaffect his performance, he should make it known, at least tothe leader or medical officer (if there is one).5PECDFOC CONEDOTOOR15A few of the most common conditions are discussed here.Further reading is suggested at the end of the paper.RespiratoryConditions such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema (COPD)and other lung conditions which cause breathlessness at sealevel are obviously going to cause even more shortness ofbreath at altitude. However asthma sufferers usually find theyhave less trouble at altitude. Although they may be breathingcold, dry air, which can be a cause of bronchospasm, becauseof the absence of the allergens in the air at altitude, in themajority of cases, they have less wheeze. The increasedsympathetic drive and adrenal steroid output may also help.They should, of course, take a good supply of their usualmedication.BEST COPY AVAILABLEiT@HZ Cardiac ConditionsClearly patients with symptomatic heart conditions (e.g.unstable angina, heart failure, etc.) should not go to high alti-tude, but patients with systemic hypertension controlled bymedication seem not to be at increased risk nor do patientsfollowing successful coronary bypass surgery or angioplastywho have good performance at sea level. Patients with angi-na controlled by drugs should certainly consult their cardiolo-gist before considering an altitude trip. The question ofwhether altitude is a risk factor in the aetiology of coronaryocclusion in previously asymptomatic people is unknown, butthe best evidence is that it Is not a significant factor.Blood DisordersPatients with anaemia will be more short of breath at alti-tude, and some women who may have low iron stores wouldbenefit from taking iron tablets when going to altitude. But forthe majority of people these and vitamins are unnecessary.Patients with bleeding or clotting problems should not go toaltitude. Although the effect of altitude on the clotting systemis debated, the remoteness from medical help Is reasonenough to advise caution. Similarly, patients on anti-coagula-tion therapy for any reason should probably be advised tochoose a holiday where medical help is readily available.Patients with sickle cell disease also should not go to altitude.Even in those with sickle cell trait there is a 20-30% chancethat altitudes above 2000 m may trigger a crisis. Aspirin istaken by a number of people going to high altitude with theidea of reducing any risk of thrombotic problems due to thehigh haematocrit of altitude. We have no evidence either wayfor this practice, but the usual precautions in taking aspirin (orany NSAIDs) must be stressed.Endocrine DisordersDiabetes MellitusAltitude itself probably does not have any effect on dia-betes, and many diabetics have enjoyed holidays in themountains. However, the increased exercise is likely toreduce the insulin requirements, and, if this is not allowedfor, hypoglycemia is a risk. Both the patient and compan-ions need to be aware of the risks of hypo- and hyper-glycemia and know how to recognize and treat theseproblems In the absence of medical help.Steroid TherapyPatients who have been on steroid replacement therapyfor adrenal failure should increase their steroids on goingto altitude to cover the increased requirement due to thestress of altitude.Gastro-intestinal DisordersThe most common medical problems amongst trekkers areusually diarrhoea! disorders.

Peptic ulcershould be treated before going into the high mountains.Similarly; conditions such as hemorrhoids, fissure in ano, etc.considered trivial at sea level can cause real problems in themountains and need to be dealt with before the trip.Neurological ConditionsMigraineMany migraine sufferers find that ascent to altitude triggers anattack, often a severe one with neurological symptoms. It canbe difficult to distinguish this from AMS or even HAPEalthough the headache of AMS is not usually unilateral, as It istypically in migraine. Migraineurs should take a supply of thedrugs that usually help them and use the drugs at the first signof an attack.If in doubt about the diagnosis, especially ifsymptoms persist after using drugs which normally relievesymptoms, the patient should be treated as for AMS or HACE.Cerebro-vascular DisordersPatients with known or suspected cerebro vascular problemssuch as TIAs, previous strokes, or carotid artery stenosisshould probably be advised against altitude travel because ofthe risk of thrombosis with the high haematocrit.EpilepsyContrary to what might be expected, there is no evidence thataltitude increases the risk of an epileptic seizure so patientswhose epilepsy is well-controlled can enjoy holidays at alti-tude with the same confidence as would apply to hill walkingat low altitude.Joints and LigamentsA trek, particularly with long down-hill sections, will revealeven slight weaknesses in weight-bearing joints. Again, this isnot due to altitude itself and would-be trekkers can test them-selves out at low altitude.Non-steroidal anti-Inflammatoryagents are valuable in this area, and a good supply of variousdrugs should be packed. Anyone suffering Joint pain shouldstart NSAIDs early (taken on a full stomach) and in adequatedosage rather than being heroic about the pain.ENT and Dental ProblemsNasal polyps which interfere with breathing should be dealtwith prior to the trip as should any outstanding dental prob-lems. Dental abscesses seem to be very common at altitude,possibly as a reflection of reduced immune function. They canusually be kept under control by antibiotics until the travelerreturns home.Mental OutlookFor the majority of people, venturing into the high mountainsis a wonderful experience even if, at times, the conditions areharsh and uncomfortable. Most have graduated to this expe-rience via family trips into the hills, short camping trips nearhome, hill walking, etc. But some suddenly get the idea thatthey want to make some big trip with no previous experienceand have quite unrealistic ideas of their own performance.Sometimes all works out well, and the spontaneous adventur-ers adapt to what is a very different lifestyle with no problem.Others are clearly psychologically quite unsuited to this expe-rience and become psychiatric casualties, to the distress ofthemselves and their companions.5UKKIANYAn account of this sort inevitably focuses on the gloomy side.Many people with chronic conditions can nevertheless enjoyholidays In the mountains. The important thing is to assessthe situation realistically, take advice, be honest with oneselfand one's companions, and tailor the trip to one's abilities.MER READOile*Ward, MP; Miliedge, JS; and West, JW (1995), High and Physiology 2nd Edition, Chapman Ft Hall.London.
