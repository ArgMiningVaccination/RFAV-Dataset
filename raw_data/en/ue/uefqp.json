You might overindulge in food or alcohol and feel like it's time to detox your body and rid it of built-up waste and toxins. In those circumstances, some people opt for a cleanse or detox product. These products have become [incredibly popular](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/detoxes-and-cleanses-what-you-need-to-know) over the last few years to help jumpstart a new diet, boost energy, and shed extra pounds. But, do these products work? Are they safe? There are many 3-day cleanses on the market, so it can be challenging to decide which one might be right for you. Read our expert guide to learn about our top picks, including their upsides and drawbacks. Here's a quick summary of our top 3-day cleanse recommendations if you're in a hurry. Dr. Kellann's 3 day cleanse is our top choice because it's highly effective while containing a variety of nutritious foods and drinks. This cleanse works for keto and paleo diets and doesn't contain gluten, dairy, soy, or GMOs. In addition to cleansing, it also improves digestion and boosts energy levels. Each purchase is covered by a 90-day money-back guarantee. To determine our top picks, we looked at five evaluation criteria: cost, effectiveness, safety, ingredients, and convenience. We used these criteria to classify the top 3-day cleanses and give you further insight into each product. Winners: [Dr. Kellyann](/recommends/drkellyann-winner-in-effectiveness) and [Lemonkind](/recommends/lemonkind-winner-in-effectiveness) A 3-day cleanse is intended to rid your body of toxins and waste, among other benefits. How effective a cleanse is depends mainly on how strictly you follow the company's instructions and refrain from activities that could negatively impact the cleanse. The cleanse products also determine effectiveness. Do they contain scientifically backed ingredients? Will you see long-standing results once the cleanse ends? Dr. Kellyann's [3-Day Cleanse and Reset Kit](/recommends/drkellyann-3-day-cleanse-and-reset-kit) includes various products - smoothies, broths, soups, and water flavorings - to help you feel full and satisfied during the cleanse. The products contain ingredients like collagen, inulin, and whey protein that have been shown in studies to have beneficial effects on overall health. Lemonkind is also an effective cleanse because of its diversity of ingredients. With Lemonkind, you'll get 24 pre-prepared juices and a schedule that shows when to drink each one. The juices are packed with nutrients, enzymes, and antioxidants that help digestion, weight loss, and energy. Winners: [Renew Life](/recommends/renew-life-winner-in-cost) and [R's KOSO](/recommends/rs-koso-winner-in-cost) The 3-day cleanses included in this guide vary in price from just $6 to $260. The cleanse price is determined by the types and number of products included. Some cleanses include many products like shakes, soups, and smoothies, while others are simplified and include only a few capsules or a single bottle of product. Our winners for cost are Renew Life and R's KOSO. Renew Life is - by far - the least expensive cleanse in this guide, costing only $5.99 for 12 capsules. You can even get the product for less ($5.39) by opting for the subscribe and save feature. R's KOSO costs only $99 for one bottle of a fermented drink packed with over 100 ingredients. With their subscribe and save function, the price reduces to just $74, saving you about 25%. Winner: [Chef V](/recommends/chef-v-winner-in-safety) In this guide, many of the cleanse products are made with all-natural ingredients and botanicals that you would find at your local grocery store. Rarely will you see an ingredient that you don't recognize. (When there is one, we've tried to provide resources that show what that ingredient offers.) You can rest assured that many of these cleanses are safe for most people. Of course, we always recommend consulting your doctor or dietitian before starting a new cleanse. Chef V wins out for safest cleanse because of the way its products are made and its ingredient transparency. The majority of the ingredients in Chef V's products are certified organic, and all of the juices are handmade. Chef V even has a few brick-and-mortar locations that you can visit or have your juice shipped directly from the store. You know what you're getting with this product. Winner: [R's KOSO](/recommends/rs-koso-winner-in-ingredients) All cleanse products in this guide are packed with healthy ingredients that can lead to body detoxification. Sometimes, it's hard to distinguish between the products because they contain similar ingredients. This isn't a bad thing - it can help you feel confident that you're getting high-quality products no matter what. However, R's KOSO stands out in terms of ingredients. Each bottle of the fermented drink includes over 100 components, including fruits, veggies, seaweed, mushrooms, grains, herbs, and beans. This is far above the ingredient lists of any of the other cleanses in this guide. Each bottle of KOSO is also fermented for over a year before being sold. Winners: [Renew Life](/recommends/renew-life-winner-in-convenience) and [R's KOSO](/recommends/rs-koso-winner-in-convenience) Some cleanses require a lot of products and a specific schedule. You may have to drink eight juices a day or receive gallons of healthy drinks. Other cleanses require less product but offer the same types of results. Renew Life wins for convenience because the 3-day cleanse only involves taking 12 capsules. You don't have to mix up a smoothie or remember a juice schedule. You simply take some capsules in the morning and evening, and that's it. R's KOSO also ranks for convenience because it's one product - a bottle of fermented drink. Replace all three meals with KOSO for three days for maximum benefits. We made a short video focused on our three favorite 3-day cleanses, so you can find out more about how they arrive at your door and what it's like to use them. And below is a handy table that compares top cleanse products across various important factors. A 3-day cleanse - sometimes also referred to as a detox, detox cleanse, or detox diet - is designed to rid your body of toxins or other harmful buildup. Generally, these cleanses involve: The instructions for different cleanses vary, but the goal is always the same: restrict your food intake to help your body flush out toxins. Some cleanses also claim to: Detox diets vary in length, intensity, and instructions. Make sure to read the packaging carefully and follow the steps for best results. The 3-day cleanses included in this guide involve some or all of the following steps: The results you see from completing a 3-day cleanse are based on your own experience, as many detox diets [are not scientifically proven](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/detoxes-and-cleanses-what-you-need-to-know) to work. Those that have gone through clinical testing have been hampered by flawed [experimental conditions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25522674/). Many cleanses don't specify how or what toxins they eliminate, so evidence of the cleanse's effectiveness is based solely on customer testimonials - not science. In fact, the body naturally cleanses itself, and it is the consensus of [health experts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/01/11/are-detox-juice-cleanses-necessary/) that it doesn't need assistance through cleanses or detox products. This doesn't necessarily mean that completing a cleanse is harmful or a bad idea. In fact, many people who use cleansing and detox products talk about the immediate benefits they experience, including weight loss, renewed energy, and better digestion. Many people who complete a 3-day cleanse report feeling better physically and mentally. Some show quick weight loss results and report less brain fog and better moods, digestion, and energy levels. A 3-day cleanse may also help with: Because cleanses encourage you to eat nutrient-rich foods, those lacking in essential nutrients will feel almost immediate physical improvement. Detoxes also encourage you to cut out processed food, alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, sugar, and other harmful substances. Removing these from your routine is always a good idea and may account for feeling better. When it comes to weight loss, those who cleanse tend to see quick results, sometimes losing multiple pounds over a short period. This may be due to the flushing of toxins and buildup, or it could be because detox diets tend to restrict calorie intake, causing you to eat less than normal throughout the cleanse. Many people report [putting weight back on](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11894-017-0603-8) once the cleanse ends. Some clinical trials have shown the potential benefits of cleanses. [This cleanse trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31536033/) showed improvement in patients' cravings, sleep quality, and energy levels. This randomized controlled trial of a [lemon detox diet](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25912765/) showed an improvement in weight loss and insulin resistance. Before starting any cleanse, it is a good idea to speak with your doctor, especially if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. In general, cleanses are intended for adults, so consult with a pediatrician if you want to use a cleanse on a child under 18. If you are diabetic, malnourished, or have a history of [eating disorders](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29983105/), a 3-day cleanse is very likely not the best option. The 3-day cleanses included in this guide are generally safe for most people. However, it is essential when using detox products to pay attention to the label instructions and your body's reaction to the products. Since many cleanses involve some level of calorie restriction - whether this is through fasting or restricting the food you eat - you may experience lightheadedness, irritability, or fatigue. Restricting calorie intake long-term can cause malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, and other complications that can severely impact your health. Also, keep in mind that the FDA does not regulate cleanses and detox products, so you can't ever be 100% sure about the [safety](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22884574/) of ingredients or doses. It's important to notice how your body responds to the products and discontinue use if you experience any adverse side effects. As always, consult your doctor before beginning a 3-day cleanse or any other detox diet.

The melon juice concentrate used is called SOD B Dimpless, shown in a [clinical study](https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/4859545) to visibly reduce cellulite.

Dr. Kellyann's Protein Complex includes [whey protein isolate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31568698/) and [xylooligosaccharides](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25872243/).

It's always a good idea to consult with your doctor before starting any new cleanse, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, or living with digestive illness. Keep in mind that the goal of the product is to detox your system, so you may find yourself in the bathroom a lot during the cleanse period. You may also feel bloated for the first two days, but this will subside.

The [3-Day KOSO Cleanse](/recommends/rs-koso-3-day-koso-cleanse) is similar to a juice cleanse in that you replace your meals for three days with 3-5 oz of KOSO mixed with a half cup of still or sparkling water. You can also consume non-caffeinated coffee or tea and should drink plenty of water every day. One bottle of KOSO is sufficient for a 3-day cleanse, and you can repeat the 3-day cleanse every two months. KOSO includes over 100 ingredients, many you'd recognize from your own grocery list.
