On May 25, the House of Rep- resentatives passed language as part of the \"National Defense Authorization Act\" (H.R. 1815) granting independent practice authority for mental health coun- selors under the TRICARE health care program.

The num- ber of people struggling to find a healthy relationship seemed to be escalating, and at one point he was counseling almost 75 percent of the congregation. \"I found so many couples coming to get premarital coun- seling but already completely set on the marriage and' mar- riage date:' he said. \"There was not a lot of openness toward working on issues that may have already been present in the rela- tionship.\" He realized duringthis time that the need existed for a program targeted at singles before they became serious in their dating relationships. \"Be- cause once serious,\" he said, \"they overlook and minimize the problems that later infect and plague their marriage.\" Van Epp felt strongly that there was a need to help this popula- tion further, so he decided to pur- sue his counseling degree and eventually a doctorate. In 1986, he made the switch from the pas- torate to a full-time counseling practice in Ohio. Although he was now working in a clinical setting, he continued to see many clients who were frustrated with broken marriages or dysfunction- al relationships. \"Once I got into the counsel- ing practice,\" he said, \"the sameissues kept presenting them- selves in those who came in for couples counseling, as well 'as the individuals who had left the relationship.

A student looking for an in- ternship with Chase's company mentioned a new master's de- gree program in organizational counseling at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University. What began as a brief job query turned into a two-hour discussion about the program -and an answer for Chase. \"It was right up my alley,\" she said. \"I applied, was accepted and moved to Balti- more within six months to startthe program.\" That sort of comfortable fit is common among the students in the five-year-old program - and among employers who in- creasingly are looking for peo- ple with the unique mix of skills that the program provides.

The report was devel- oped by a research team at SERAPH.net, a security consult- ing and training firm that offers problem solving for school and educational institutions in areas such as school safety training, bullying, sexual harassment and teacher safety. In addition to col- lecting data based on its inter- views with 1,200 teachers, 320 school administrators and 925 law enforcement professionals in rural, suburban and urban school districts, the SERAPH.net re- search team compiled the report using information from previous studies on school safety and child-on-child aggression. \"In 2000;' said research teamleader Dale Yeager, \"the United States Human Rights Projects' National Campaign to Fight for Children asked SERAPH to cre- ate a detailed report on school safety for select members of the U.S. Congress. Because of the misconceptions about school safety by the public and many legislators, we felt that releasing this year's report to the public would assist in educating people about the problem. The report covers many areas not traditionally discussed in school safety research. These topics include: * Young children and aggres- sion N Educational philosophies and student aggression * Health issues and school safety * Sexually transmitted diseases * Piercing and tattoos* Girl aggression, sexism and school safety * Youth-on-youth sex aggres- sion and staff abuse of students * Parenting * Dress codes * Hazing' \"The issue of school safety affects everyone in society, Yeager said. \"Juvenile crime, domestic violence and poverty are all tied to school safety issues. The report will provide factual information to the public so that they can understand the complexity of the problem and provide information to legisla- tors so that they can assist schools in preventing and man- aging school safety issues:' The complete report is available online at http:// seraph.net/schooLsafe-report. htnl.E The Last Word \"As I wrote about the things that had happened to me, I was able to feel them and embrace them.

To work effectively, the network needs at least two ACA members from each state to serve as \"Key Con- tacts\" and to be responsible for recruiting counselors and creating a rapid response system to contact Congress. Currently, the advocacy network has Key Contacts in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Key Contacts are still needed in Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Key Contacts will help to make sure that public policy informa- tion reaches as many counselors as possible. In addition, they will help ACA to schedule meetings with members of Congress and generate support from state counseling associations. ACA's Pub- lic Policy and Legislation staff will provide direction, support and additional training to Key Contacts.

Mark Sanford signed into law the \"South Carolina Education and Economic Development Act:' The legislation is designed to foster development of a \"career clus- ter system\" within the state's Department of Education. The new law requires that students \"be provided individualized education- al, academic and career-oriented choices and greater exposure to career information and opportunities.\" The new law includes several provisions of interest to school counselors, developed and advocated for by the South Carolina Counseling Association and the South Carolina School Counsel- ing Association. Among these, the law stipulates that \"School guidance counselors and career specialists shall limit their activi- ties to guidance and counseling and may ndt j6rform administra- tive tasks.\" The law requires that, by the 2007-2008 school year, both middle schools and high schools provide students with the services of either a certified guidance counselor who has com- pleted Career Development Facilitator -certification training or a career specialist who has completed such training and obtained a bachelor's degree. Such services must be conducted under the supervision of a certified guidance counselor. The law also requires that middle and high schools have a student-to-guidance personnel ratio of no more than 300-to-1.

ACA joins school personnel coalition ACA was among nearly 20 organizations that joined together on May 19 for a second national discussion on personnel quali- fications and persistent vacancies in the U.S. school system. Fol- lowing up on an initial meeting held earlier this year, the partic- ipants decided to form the Coalition to Address Personnel Needs in Special Education and Related Services. ACA believes that the coalition's advocacy efforts will assist in ensuring that persistent vacancies, caused by school counselor shortages in rural and urban areas, are filled by applicants who are well-trained and qualified to serve as school counselors. In addition, the coalition's efforts should raise the perceived value of service providers in schools, encouraging decisionmakers at all levels of government to support funding for school counseling positions at the recommended ratio levels. The coalition's next meeting will take place at ACA headquarters on Aug. 2. For more information, contact ACA Professional Projects Coordinator .- e a, 3 I . Letters 4- A Alternate model for crisis debriefing is appreciated Thank you very much for the \"Before and after\" article in the May 2005 issue of Counseling Today. It is so welcorme to hear others talk about the fact that there is no one intervention that fits every situation or every student/staff person (in the after- math of a school shooting). I was most interested with the debriefing experience. The Na- tional Institute for Trauma and Loss in Children generally sug- gests that debriefing not be con- ducted until at least the third or fourth day after the event to give witnesses time to process what they experienced and/or to get some distaqce from it. We have found that several days later, emotions have calmed a little more. There is less need to dwell on actual details, while at the same time there is more need to feel \"connected\" with other survivors or other friends/ students and to know that others are having similar thoughts and feelings. .We have also said for years that we can't possibly know what students are experiencing following exposure to a traumat- ic event because it is their expe- rience, not ours. Joan Collins- Marotte's point that \"We didn't have the right ... to tell them how they should feel\" was well said. It sounds' like her team basically relied on crisis inter- vention by belpifig students dis- cover their own inner resources to \"get through\" the day. I just wanted to say thanks for the article. It was definitely on track with our experiences and strategies. Should your readers be interested, our website is www.tlcinstitute.org. William Steele Director National Institute for Trauma and Loss in Children Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich. steele@tlcinst,org Calling all counselors: Law enforcement officers S have need'for services As a staunch reader of Coun- seling Today, I have always found the articles informative and worth the read. I particular-- ly like the articles that focus on counseling clients with certain needs. Such client populations have included minority cliehts, persons with disabilities and persons with different spiritual. 4 frameworks, to name a few.While these populations have special needs of which. coun- selors should be cognizant, there is another population that often gets overlooked. Speaking both as a law en: forcement officer of 14 years and as a professional counselor who provides counseling for officers and their families, the lav enforcement population of- fers unique challenges for coun- selors. Counselors consider this population to be difficult to attract into counseling, distrust- ful of any kind of mental health services and very cynical. De- spite the challenges this popula- tion presents, working with law enforcement persofnel can be a rewarding experience for any counselor once trust is estab- lished Counselors are prepared to handle the challenges of law enforcement personnel and their families. However, like any group of clienis that has special considerations, it behooves the practitioner to have an under- standing of what the needs are for this population and how to effectively provide services. As the world of law enforcement is continually changing, more offi- cers are seeking the assistance. of professionals to help them with job-related and personal concerns. Counselors interested in working with this population will benefit greatly by earning the trust of the officer as well as the organization. This can be achieved by taking the time to understand how the police orga- nization works and becoming familiar with the special circum- stances that officers and their families experience. For this reason, I strongly sup- port Counseling Today publish- ing counseling-related articles that address the needs of this population. Law enforcembt is becoming more receptive to mental health services, and this represents a new and growing opportunity upon which coun- selors would be astute to focus. Sgt. Deborah C. Moore New York City drdebicounseling@yahoo.con Editor's note: We agree. We'll try to publish an article about the counseling-related needs of law enforcement personnel in an upcoming issue.Reader believes that .anti-Christian bias is pervading ACA ' -One -of the first things I learned in therapy school is that, sometimes it is possible 'to say too much. It would seem that Terry Abell missed that day in class judging by the Letter to the Editor in the June.2005 issue of Counseling Today. The letter trod on ground which angels should fear to tread, and I find I must respond to the thinly veiled ieligious bigotry committed on the letters page of that issue. I am a Catholic pastoral coun- selor who has authored seven books integrating Catholicism and counseling practice. I host a daily radio broadcast heard na- tionally on Catholic radio and maintain an active behavioral tele'health practice that draws Catholic clients from around the world. Frankly, I could not care less whether the American Coun- seling Association acknowl- edged Pope John Paul II for any- thing (the issue to which Abell was responding). Of course, it would have been completely appropriate to honor him not only for his strong moral leader- ship or his huge contribution to the canon and practice of social justice teaching, but also because he was the de facto head of the largest social welfare agency in the world. (For example, in the United States alone, Catholic Charities USA cared for 10 mil- lion people last year without regard for age, race or creed.) Nevertheless, his greatness hard- ly stands or falls by the ACA's corporate recognition of it. That said, Abell goes on to suggest that the pope was per- haps not worthy of honor by ihe ACA-because, for example, he upheld the church's teaching on artificial contraception and the male priesthood, and insisted that sex be reserved to married heterosexuals. At this point, Abell crossed the line. This is not the space to attempt to defend those teach- ings, but the printing of such a letter is indicative of the hostili- ty nd'ignorance that pervades the membership and administra- tion of ACA toward religion in general and Catholicism in par- ticular. In a recent issue of the Journal of Counseling & Devel- opment, for example, contribu- tors excoriated the Catholic Church by name for being \"hyp- ocritical;' anachronistic and re- pressive.

In the multicultural counseling literature, there is an expression often heard about \"standing on the shoulders of those who came before us,\" a way to acknowl- edge that our accomplishments have historical roots. The proverb, or dicho, I am using this month means \"the apple never falls too far from the tree?' As I prepared to write my first col- umn as president of the largest and greatest counseling associa- tion in the world, I automatically had images of my parents and maternal grandmother. These three individuals have had an enormous influence on my respect for multicultural diversi- ty, servant leadership, education and hard work. My personal andprofessional values are grounded in their examples and dedication to lafamlia. They are the special gente, or people, I refer to in my tide. I am not a self-made person. Indeed, there were others who guided, supported or otherwise let me do my thing. Some of these special gente are friends, family and American Counseling Association colleagues. My in- volvement with ACA since my graduate school days in the late 1970s has fostered the special connection of community and familia that I enjoy. Although I cannot speak for those of you reading this column, I imagine there are special gente inside and outside of ACA with whom you connect and who have guidedyour pathway both personally and professionally. Take a moment to celebrate them. As we embark on another year of professional activity within ACA, I am reminded of how fast time moves. It seems like not so long ago I was preparing to become president-elect and learn from Sam Gladding as he ably stepped forth to offer his vision and creativity to ACA. And as we all know, Sam did provide lead- ership throughout ACA as he journeyed to different regions, branches and countries. The role of the ACA president is multidi- mensional, providing us with a variety of venues to promote and enact the mission of the associa- tion (published each month in Counseling Today's masthead on page 4). I am following the example and contributions of my predecessors, and in so doing I hope that another dicho will be- come a reality: Dime con quien andas y te dire quien eres (Tell me who your \"associates\" are and I will tell you who you are). Engagement with different facets of ACA over the years continues to be a source of both professional identity enrichment and affirmation. My recent par- ticipation in the Canadian Coun- selling Association conference in St. John's, Newfoundland (afour-hour plane ride from Scot- land) was another reminder that the spirit of counseling and coun- selors has no borders. I have always valued language and bilingualism or multilingual- ism. Call it serendipity, but the 2006 ACA Convention will be in Montredl, in the province of Quebec, in the country of Cana- da. Montreill is predominantly French-speaking, although many other Canadian cities and prov- inces have Francophone citizen- ry. There are many forces creat- ing synergy for ACA's first con- ference outside the U.S. main- land. Culture, language, form of government and history are just some of the forces that influence Canadian and U.S. worldviews, making us both similar and dif- ferent as countries that share bor- ders. These facts caused me to identify a multilingual theme for the year and the convention that communicates synergy and hope: Culture-Centered and Diversity Counseling Empowers All Families. French: Le counseling axe sur la culture el la diversite fortalece a todas lasfamilias.As a profession, ACA is about families, not just individuals. After all, we all exist in relation to others. The second message in this theme is that of empower- ment. Our preparation as coun- selors provides us with the awareness, knowledge and skills to facilitate the mental well- being and dignity of others. My belief is that empowerment is both an inherent process and out- come in counseling relationships. For example, in our work with immigrant families who speak English as a second language, we will likely focus on presenting issues, but we also have to focus on empowerment. Counselors may need to affirm for the immi- grant parents the strengths and re- sources they possess that enable them to manage a major life tran- sition and acculturative stressors. The third message in the theme promotes the importance of mul- ticultural diversity in counseling. Our conference in Canada, the emergence of counseling pro- grams in Mexico and Latin America, the increase in interna- tional counseling conferences and the continuation of new immigration into the United States are all indicators that cul- ture and diversity are the fabric of life.

Each year, I actually cel- ebrate four different new years. Let me explain what I mean. On Jan. 1, I join with people around the world as we usher in a new calendar year. Some make resolutions, some celebrate in a very \"active\" manner and others choose to observe the passing of the previous calendar year in a more reserved way. Regardless of how people observe the new calendai year, this is something that impacts everyone. Usually four t6 eight weeks after the Jan. 1 \"new year;\" my family and I observe Chinese New Year. This \"new year\"inipacts fewer people, but brings with it interaction with family and an abundance of good food, customs and traditions. -In September, I acknowledge the beginning of a new academic year. For niany qf the student members in the American Coun- seling Association, this marks a significant passage in their pro- fessional development as they continue their edication and training. And for those of you in counselor education, this time period represents a new begin- ning after summer session or summer vacation. Fot those of us With children at the K-12 level, this is a time of following a new schedule as the summer ends, possibly returning to carpoolduty and finding the elusive school supplies that our children \"just have to have?' You might wonder what my fourth \"new year\" could possibly be, and I want to tell you that it occurs on July 1. This month is yet another \"new year\" for ACA, as it marks the beginning of our. fiscal year. June represented the month when we said goodbye to a fine group of dedicated leaders and volunteers who served at all lev- els of governance and on our committees and task forces. On July 1, we begin our work with a flew cadre of people who have agreed to serve ACA and our divisions. On behalfof the staff, I want to officially welcome Patri- cia Arredondo as ACA's 54th president, as well as those who are joining the Governing Coun- cil, our committees and our task forces for the first time. In addition, I would be remiss ifldidn'trecognize those assum- ing leadership positions in ACA's' 19 divisions, as well as on the boards of those organizations with whom we have professional partnerships, including the ACAFoundation, ACA Insurance Trust, National Board for Certi- fied Counselors, Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs, and the American Association of State Counseling Boards. The hundreds of volunteers assuming leadership roles in this \"new year\" are to be congratulat- ed for agreeing to serve and for their dedication to the profession. Froir the staff perspective, we look forward to providing the support and resources necessary for all of you to meet your goals for the year. As we embark on a new year, I want to ask all of you for your input What we have planned for this year came as the result of many of you letting the staff and me know what you expect .for your membership dollar. Ideally, we will meet (and hopefully exceed) your expectations. Over the course of the next 12 months, we will be launching a number of new projects designed to help those at the beginning of their careers in counseling, at the midpoint of their careers as well as for those who ate lookingahead to \"life after\" professional counseling. As you know, we will also hold our first joint ACA Annual Con- vention with our colleagues from the Canadian Counselling Asso- ciation in Montredl next April. This event will feature more than 400 education sessions, as well as half-day arid full-day precon- vention learning institutes. We will have interesting speakers, an enhanced career center and a full complement of more thani 100, exhibitors demonstrating the lat- est products and services for pro- fessional counselors. Our ongoing project to provide more information to you via the Internet will also see a number of completed phases during this cal- endar year. I hope you will visit us at www.counseling.org during the next several months to see what we have built just for you. Once again, thank you so much for your membership in ACA, and Happy New Year! As always, contact me via e-mail at ryep@counselinzg.org or via phone at 800.347.6647 ext. 231 if you would like to share some thoughts. Enjoy and be well.

GIERINGER Spirituality: Teaching and learning with children Sitting in the back of the quiet conference room with closed eyes, I became aware of my slow breathing and noticed tense shoulders loosen as relaxation took over. A calm smile began and muscles released the tight- ness of a hectic day. Soft music started to envelop the room and ears soaked up the, sound of ocean waves lapping against the sand. I could visualize the mighty ocean waters crashing on the white, sandy beach, wild waves roaring as the wind blew salt into the air. A deep cleansing breath and I was there. Or was I? It felt like I was there until the presenter's voice shat- tered the illusion of peace I had experienced for a few precious moments. It had been a spiritual sort of place where comfort and love were the core sensations. There are things about such places and experiences thatwould have been good to learn earlier in life but which later experiences have taught me to use effectively. My day as an elementary school counselor now begins and ends with soft, nurturing background music floating throughout the office. It soothes my soul, prepares me for the craziness of the day ahead and settles me as I re- group and journey home to fam- ily. Music is a necessary part of every one of my days. Some- times body and mind tell me there is a sense of spirituality in this that is centering. Hearing music or envisioning any num- ber of nature scenarios recon- nects and recharges me. I know the importance and the health benefits of winding down after a long day. My productivi- ty is greatly increased when I take care of myself, but imple- menting the necessary actions iseasier said than done. Living my work, taking it home with me each day, having difficulty let- ting it go, neglecting to take care of myself -all of these things still occur at times. The result is decreased effectiveness on my part, as well as my feeling over- burdened with others' problems. Exhaustion, disconnectedness and loss of focus finally cause me to ask, \"Where is the peace- fulness, the calming force, the center, the spirituality? Where is the music for my soul?\" The questions jolt me back to reality and propel me to search for what is missing. Eyes close as I envision the white, puffy clouds on an incredibly bright, sunny day when the sky is as blue as the Caribbean waters. I hear the rustling of the autumn leaves skipping across the forest floor and walk in time to the gentle beat of a hollow drum. The cool, crisp wind brings a sense of a larger presence that returns me to the sereneness that had escaped me. Ahhh. In the book Riding the Drag- on, author Robert Wicks refers to these moments as \"renewalzones.\" He says we \"need to visit them on a regular basis in order to avoid drowning in the stress that comes our way.\" He talks about how they are essen- tial to our lives if we are to remain vital, compassionate and grateful. Renewal zones can be as simple as walking in the park, exercising, meditating, laughing with friends, planting a garden or listening to music. The more we are in the moment, aware of the incredible gifts every day has to offer and thankful for Our lives, the better we deal with the stresses of work and home. I try to go to my renewal zones a couple of times during the day for refreshment and rejuvenation. My body tells me when it's time for a visit. Shoulders tighten, breathing hastens and my forehead takes on a furrowed look. These signs confirm the need for me to get back on course so I can better help children and myself dur- ing their times of stress and dif- ficult moments. Children also need renewal zones because they provide them with opportunities toexpress themselves in calm, nur- turing environments. Children can reconnect through play, re- lationships with each other or relationships with adults. Ob- serving children on the play- ground interacting in their nat- ural environment, hearing their contagious guffaws and seeing them running, jumping, swing- ing, shouting, skipping and singing remind me of lessons we need to relearn as adults. Children may not be cognizant of the spirituality of these actions, but they definitely feel better, sense connectedness and have niore energy after such renewal activities. It's not unlike the energy experienced after a good workout, an invigorating run, an action-packed soccer game or a fully involved conver- sation concerning an issue of vital personal importance. My personal experiences with children have taught me many ways to help both them and myself find creative and spiritu- al connections to our world. These techniques go beyond relaxation and meditation to Continued on page 17 dramatically CONwTIcNN EDUrCATION -, 44.~ ttn,+ 3LLLohvcrr Big Sur chiffs, WAY- JON CARLSON, PaD AND AAN MAIA , P thA web or call 8AI1667 3005 For additional inforatoO please contact Info@esalen.orgis dediciated to exploring work in the humanities and sciences that furthers the ful realization of the human potential.

Are you sometimes caught in multicom- plex webs of work, family, friends, and social and house- hold obligations? Inundated by paperwork and a cacophony of sound? Ah -and even after you have done the breathing exercise and quiet meditation, it is all still there. Many of us can easily be over- whelmed by events, worries andfears. Indeed, the momentum of life's complications seems to gather strength. This situation is further aggra- vated by thinking about the what ifs, what might happen, what we ought to have done or what someone else should have done. :We assume and exaggerate so that we can't see realistically or function effectively. Irrational tlinkmg results, creating dys- functional or even destructive situations for ourselves and oth- ers. We become addicted to the expectation of disaster, thus fer-tilizing the field for self-fulfill- ing fears of catastrophe. Lives become governed by anxiety. We lose control and are no longer taking charge of ourselves or our lives. Some of us immerse our- selves in sleep, alcohol, affairs or drugs 'to ease the pain, anxiety and victimhood. I frequently hear comments such as: \"Nothing ever works out for me -my down?' \"I had to have an affair because I was so lonely and bored.\" \"I took drugs to dull the emotion- al or psychic pain?'

Picture a checkerboard with traditional black arid white or black and red squares resting on a game table. It is as if the empty squares are waiting to be filled by your moves. Imagine the squares representing blocks of time, defined by boundaries. These blocks of time can be one hour, two or three hours, or a half-hour. As you visualize the square spaces on the. board, decide which event or problem must be dealt with first. What ismost important and urgent? Esti- inate an amount of time to be blocked off for a given purpose. Place a checker piece that repre- sents this task on the square or squares closest to you at the edge of the table. Perhaps writing in the square or using chess pieces to prioritize would be helpful. One could even color-code pri- orities and use colored dots. This is your first move.

Now she encourages other survivors to tell their stories as part of the journey to recovery. Breaking the silence, breaking the cycle In sharing her life story, a counselor and adult survivor of child abuse develops a new therapy model to help other victims BY JONATHAN ROLLINS Sandy Riggin graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in psychology from Armstrong State College in Savannah, Ga., in 1988. She followed that up by earning her master's of education degree in rehabilitation counsel- ing from the University of Geor- gia in 1992, completing the pro- gram with a 4.0 grade point aver- age. But she didn't become a Licensed Professional Counselor or begin her practice until 1999. \"I knew I didn't have anything Sto offer,\" Riggin said about the 8 years-long gap, \"because I was drowning in the emotional toxic ' waste of my own past.\" In fact, in June 1997, at the .age of 32, it appeared that Rig- 12 gin was about to lose the battle to keep her head above water, After ingesting 180 muscle relaxants in a suicide attempt, she spent five days in a coma, on the very precipice of death. A 10 veteran of previous suicideattempts, Riggin emerged from the murkiness of her coma with a newfound determination to finally escape, once and for all, the haunting darkness of her childhood -a past filled with physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect. Eight years later, it can no longer be said that Riggin has nothing to offer to clients or to the counseling profession. She has developed a new treatment model she calls Cognitive Emo-' tional Restructuring Therapy (CERT) and maintains two pri- vate practices in Georgia where she specializes in helping other adult victims of childhood abuse. Her memoir of abuse and recovery, Forbidden Memories: A Journey of Healing, was pub- lished in March 2004, and she was subsequently nominated as Georgia Author of the Year. In addition, the book received hon- orable mention recognition in the nonfiction category for-theWriter's Digest International Book Award. Riggin recently followed up her first book with Breaking the Cycle: A Step-by- Step Guide to Healing From Childhood Abuse, Neglect and Trauma. The new book details the CERT process she developed and includes exercises and a CD to assist in the healing process. - Finding a voice After surviving her final sui- cide attempt, Riggin sought help and entered into a three-and-a- half-year counseling relation- ship with a therapist. Eventual- ly, however, she found that even her therapist \"could only take me, halfway down that path to healing?' While the therapist assisted her with the cognitive aspects of the abuse she had suf- fered as a child, Riggin said, the emotional issues -going back to deal with her wounded child -went largely unaddressed. \"So I went on this quest myselfto heal little Sandy who was still stuck inside of me,\" Riggin said. Riggin described that quest in Chapter 1 of Breaking the Cycle: \"When I couldn't obtain the healing I was looking for through traditional counseling, I started writing my life story. I began looking for a way to help the little girl who still lived inside of me to heal from the hurt and pain she was still carry- ing around. As I wrote about the things that had happened to me, I was able to feel them and embrace them. I was able to find a way to recover.\" Chronicling the traumatic events in her life proved ex- tremely therapeutic for Riggin. \"For the first time in my life' she said, \"I was able to get my words and my feelings to match!' Most adult survivors of child abuse can talk about what happened to them but are numb to \"feeling\" it, she explained, or are so over- whelmed by their feelings that they can't put those feelings into words. Before true healing can begin, Riggin said, she believes each abuse victim must break his or her silence about what hap- pened to them. But the process of opening up is challenging, she acknowledged, because child abuse and domestic violence are still somewhat taboo subjects in our society, and victims of abuse can be made to feel shameful for sharing their \"secret.\" That taboo was doubly daunt- ing for Riggin, givei the profes' sion she had chosen to pursue. In' training to become d counselor, she had been warned against self- disclosure, and now she was thinking of laying her life wide open for all to see in a book. \"One of the biggest fears was that peo- ple were going to thinkI was still - the person describedin the book' she said. But she took the chante, not only to complete her owh healing process but to encourage other adult survivors of childhood, abuse to break their silence and start down the road to recovery. Personal history Riggin, who spent five. years writing Forbidden Memories, was the eldest child of an abusive father and a \"distant and emo- tionally crippled mother.\" Al- ready acquainted all too well with physical abuse and neglect, Riggin also became the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of her first stepfather (her mother would get married four times during Riggin's childhood and adolescence). In addition, shewas witness to rampant alco- holism and what she termed \"weird spurts of poverty,\" dunng which her family lived in a house with no exterior siding and in a structure previously home to pigs, chickens and rats. During the time she and her -brothers were being abused, Riggin only twice recalls school counselors or other. school offi- cials checking on their welfare. Even when alarms were sound- ed, she said, \"My stepfatherjust found new ways of hitting us in different places. ... Someone should have stepped in, but I don't think they (the school sys- tem) knew what-to say or do. In a way, I think they felt paralyzed by it.\" Another impediment to school officials, she said, was that her family never put down roots for very long. Between the ages of 8 and 16, Riggin and her family moved eight different times. In the eighth grade, Riggin reached an emotional breaking point. She began drinking, tak- ing drugs and getting attention with negative behavior. \"I was just ieally crying out for some- one to make the things happen- ing to me at home stop;' she said. Instead, she was simply labeled a troublemaker. A schoolteacher finally stepped in when Riggin was about to get kicked out of school for the third time, offering to let * her stay with him and his family. But instead of finding comfort and safety, Riggin again became the victim of an authority figure, as the teacher began molesting her. \"So the school system didn't really work for me,\" Riggin said. .\"It was like there was no safe place for me to tum.\" When she was 17, Ri;gin also began strug- gling with anorexia and bulimia. The heart of the matter According to the latest avail- able statistics, 3.2 million chil- dren were abused (physically, sexually or via neglect) in the United States in 2002. And as Riggin pointed out, that number takes into account only substan- tiated cases. Most therapists believe the number of actual cases is far greater, she said. Almost as disturbing are other numbers. According to Prevent Child Abuse America, the nation spends more than $94 billion each year treating the fallout from child abuse (hospitaliza- tion, mental health care, child welfare, law enforcement, etc.). For every dollar being spent on the aftermath of child abuse, only a single penny is dispensed on prevention. Riggin is a firm believer in pre- vention as a cure for child abuse. People who have never been vic- tims of it themselves don't understand that abuse is a mind- set, she said, or that childhood abuse is very often multigenera- tional. For instance, Riggin said her mother was abused as a child and never resolved' -her own issues concerning her upbring- ing. Those issues carried over into her relationship with Riggin and her siblings. \"She treated me the only way she knew how to,\" Riggin said. \"What we have is wounded children who are hav- ing children, and then they wound those children.\" Riggin believes that helping adult sur- vivors of child abuse could dras- tically reduce the number 6f chil- dren who will be abused in the next generation. To effectively reach and treat this segment of the population, Riggin again draws on her per- sonal experience. Even when she was old enough to leave home and remove herself from her abu- sive environment, Riggin said, she found her past sabotaging her efforts 'to live a nbrmal life. Despite her mother's neglect and the role she played in allowingher daughter to be subjected to physical and sexual abuse at the hands of others, Riggin longed for nothing more as an adult than her mother's approval and love. Because she didn't receive those things in satisfying amounts, Riggin felt emotionally aban- doned.and like she wasn't good enough to live a normal life. Her self-destructive behavior eventu- ally landed her in numerous drug treatment centers and mental health facilities, she said, but .none of them probed below the surface of her symptoms to deal with the core issues at the heart of her problems. \"As a survivor, I went to a lot of different people trying to figure out what was wrong with me, but nobody really knew what to do,\" Riggin said. 'That made me feel even more hopeless.\" But during her personal journey to healing after her final suicide attempt and in the course of writing her mem- oir, Riggin believes she chscov- ered a recovery method that digs below the surface problems of abuse survivors and treats the whole person. Cognitive Emotional Restructuring Therapy Riggin characterizes CERT, described in-depth in her book Breaking the Cycle, as a treat-ment that combines traditional cognitive therapy with a set of techniques that address the past abuse on an emotional level. She begins with the cognitive component, helping her clients look at what happened to them more objectively so they can function better in their daily lives. This process features many steps, including: * Educating clients on why they behave the way they do. * Helping clients to explore dif- ferent ways of thinking about themselves and the world they live in, including relearning how to trust other people. E Teaching clients how to take care of themselves. E Teaching clients how to safe- guard their decision-making power instead of giving it away to others. Generally, Riggin said, abuse victims and survivors allow others to tell them how to think and feel. In addition, Riggin helps adult survivors of abuse to recognize when they are taking on the role of their inner, wounded child, and allowing that dimension' of themselves to run their lives. She teaches clients how to respond to different situations in a more adultlike fashion and trains them to analyze difficult situations from their past to consider how they could handle those circum- stances differently in the present. After clients have become healthier in their daily lives, Rig- gin unlocks the emotional com- ponent of being an abuse sur- vivor. Although vaguely aware that their problems as adults may stem from the abuse they suf- fered as children, most abuse sur- . vivors can't connect all the dots, Riggin said. That's because the abuse caused these clients to become emotionally arrested at different points in their lives, she said. \"Most people come in unaware of why they are the way they are,' Riggin said. \"Most don't even know that they have an inner child!\" The emotional component of Riggin's CERT method involves: M Teaching clients how to find a safe place within themselves. * Introducing them to the wounded child who still dwells within them. M Having them revisit specific instances of abuse and the perpe- ftators of that abuse. * Teaching them how to resolve those abusive experiences through experiential exercises. What generally happens dunngthis process, Riggin said, is that former victims of abuse begin viewing not only themselves more objectively but also the people who hurt them. This is important, she said, because it often allows them to forgive what the other person did and helps the client to finally release past hurts instead of allowing them to fes- ter. When clients succeed in doing this, she said, the inner child no longer assumes such a dramatic influence in their life. Then the cognitive tools learned in the first part of the therapeutic process essentially become the framework for a new way of thinking and living, she said. \"When they have faced the demons in their closet, I find that most people are able to resume pretty normal lives;' Riggin said. The missinglink When helping adult survivors of child abuse, Riggin stresses both the cognitive and emotional components of recovery and healing, but she believes another element is equally essential. \"Recovery, to me,just isn't pos- sible without the spiritual com- ponent. ... We have to help our- selves in the natural (component) so God can help us in the spiritu- al,\" said Riggin, who has earned her associate degree in biblicalstudies from Mustard Seed Bible Institute in Georgia. For a long time, Riggin said, she struggled with why God did such horrible things to her. Then she realized that God didn't do them but allowed them to happen to her -and not without reason. She believes God used those ex- periences to make her a stronger person, to give her more empathy for others and to present her with keen insight on how to help other survivors of abuse. Likewise, she tries to help other adult. survivors of abuse find a deeper purpose and meaning to their experiences and explores with them how they can use those experiences to benefit others - especially their own children. \"I don't cram it down their throat, but I do express my opinion,\" Riggin said. \"And wherever I can put God into the equation, I do it.\" To. order either Forbidden a Memories or Breaking the Cycle, S visit www.sandyriggin.com.

The Senate continues to refine its version of the bill in preparation for expected floor consideration within the next month. The Senate's bill does not yet include language to remove the physician-referral and supervision requirement for counselors. Near the end of May, Senate offices received the long-await- ed DOD study concerning its demonstration project on re- moving the referral and supervi- sion requirement. Although the study's findings in many ways support granting independent practice authority for coun- selors, the DOD still opposes this step. The American Coun- seling Association and the American Mental Health Coun- selors Association joined in writing Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John Warner (R-Va.) to urge Congress to base its decision on the study's find- ings and to remove the referral and supervision requirement. ACA members are strongly encouraged to call their senators in support of independent prac- tice authority for Licensed Pro-fessional Counselors under TRICARE.

First hurdle cleared on counseling appropriations ACA is pleased to report that the House Appropriations sub- committee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education included $34.7 million for the Elementary and Secondary School Coinseling Program (ESSCP) in the Fiscal Year 2006 spending bill it adopted June 9. Although this is the same amount as was allocated for the program in FY 2005, it repre- sents a significant achievement given that monetary support was decreased or eliminated for many education programs in the bill. The legislation also re- stored funding for' the TRIO, GEAR UP and Perkins career and technical education pro- grams. (See the accompanyingchart for funding levels of selected Education and Health and Human Services programs on p. 13.) At press time, the Sen- ate Appropriations Committee was set to announce its alloca- tions for the various appropria- tions subcommittees. WIA consideration facing likely delay Senate consideration of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) may not occhr until as late as September, following the August recess of Congress. WIA, which establishes the sys- tem of One-Stop employmerit centers and the state vocational rehabilitation system, is overdue for reauthorization. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved its version of WIA legislation (S. 1021) on May 18, and Sen- ate staff had considered attempt- ing to quickly adopt the legisla- tion. Continuing uncertainty over the possible introduction of amendments to make major structural changes to the legisla- tion -such as turning severalcurrent programs into a single block grant -forced abandon- ment of the effort. ACA will continue to work on this issue alongside other organizations.

The seminar, \"How to Avoid Marrying a Jerk: The Way to Follow Your Heart Without Los- ing Your Mind,\" was a hit and eventually evolved into a video program with a workbook, cur- riculum- and instructor certifica- tion. With amusing lesson titles such as \"You can't marry Jethro without getting the Clampetts\" and \"Putting the horse before the cart,\" the program's popular- ity grew quickly. Van Epp's seiniar has been taught in 45 states, seven countries, more than 250 military bases and thousands of churches, singles organizations, educational set- tings and agencies. A book is currently under review for pos- sible publication as well. \"It's very concise and focused because it's centered on a plan and builds around a model - the Relationship Attachment Model (RAM),\" Van Epp said. \"Because this is based around, the RAM, it's very user-friendly' and easy to remember and apply. It informs the person on the major areas that predict what a persoi will be like in a mar- riage and the bonding forces that must be kept in balance as a relationship grows.\" The five-hour video program presents Van Epp's live seminar that comprehensively and comi- cally describes the five dynam- ics that create attachment and the five crucial areas to explore in a premarital relationship. A 42-page video series discussion workbook is available to assist viewers with the outlined les- sons. In addition, numerous re- flective questions help to per- sonalize the material. The end of the workbook has questions that couples should answer during the premarital period of the rela- m tionship. An instructor certifica- tion packet is also available for 2 those interested in leading dis- 2 cussion groups with the video series/workbooks or those who want to be certified to actuallyteach the program, now referred to by its more politically correct title, the \"Premarital Interper- sonal Choices and Knowledge Program\" or PICK. The certifi- cation packet includes a display board of the Relationship Attachment Model, a Power- Point presentation of the pro- gram, a manual and a seven- hour DVD home instruction course. \"The program is about a lot more than avoiding a certain type of person;' Van Epp said.. \"It's how to pace your relation- ship and know what exactly to look for in a healthy' commit- ment.\" The course focuses on what he calls the underdevel- oped education of the mind and the overdeveloped attachment of the heart. \"Too many people simply do not know what to look for when dating, and too many people. simply do not know how to keep a dating rela- tionship in balance,\" he said. \"It was these two needs which led me to develop a program to fol- low in the premarital relation- ship and decisionmaking process.\" Van Epp concedes that tons of self-help books for singles are already on the market but con- tends that none of them really provide a road map or plan for effectively choosing a partner. Head knowledge \"The program addresses two main parts -the head and the heart\" Van Epp said. \"There are certain areas that a person needs to get to know about another per- son. That's the 'head knowl- edge.' Even if you get to know all the right stuff about someone else, if your heart has become so involved, so attached and so overwhelmed with a person, it will not even pay attention to who you are getting know.\" The most common mistake in newrelationships, he said, is assum- ing that how a person acts now is how he or she will act over the course of a long-term commit- ment. \"They draw the conclusion that the way the person is treat- ing them the first months of the relationship is how they will be treated throughout the course of a long-term relationship, espe- cially into marriage,\" he said.' \"It's one of the main problem areas that I see singles buy in to. The reality is there are some very subtle but powerful predic- tors as to what a person will be like in a marriage?' To address the head knowl- edge, he said, it is important to explore five areas -or FACES -when forming a relationship. Family dynamics and background The way a person interacts with family members is a subtle predictor of how he or she may act in a relationship, Van Epp said. The roles and dynamics learned from the family tend to present themselves later on in the commitment, he said. \"A good example is a man who has major conflicts with his mother,\" Van Epp pointed out. 'He may be wonderful in a dat- ing relationship because he is not viewing the woman as a prospective wife or mother. He is viewing her as his girlfriend or soul mate. Yet once married, those roles will kick in and become lenses that he looks at the woman through?' At that point, he said, the man may have a major shift in behavior. For example, while he once was very conscientious in the dating period, he may become detached and uninvolved in the marriage. \"It becomes very important that singles -before they are heavily involved in a relation-R.A.M. Relationship Attachment Model (Glow Trust itly Commhit Touchship -learn what to look for so that when they get into a rela- tionship, they aren't fooled or overwhelmed by all the posi- tives that might be happening,\" he said. \"They can look at the areas, like family background, that might be predictors of something very negative.\" Unfortunately, he said, this idea goes against popular dating practices, where the courtship takes place first, followed by a commitment. Only then do suit- ors tend to \"meet the parents?' Attitudes and actions of the conscience Someone can have charm or \"mad game,\" as the kids would say, but then tum into Al. Bundy once the newness of the rela- tionship has worn off. \"These are the skills of winning a per- son;' Van Epp said. \"They are extremely focused on the other person in the beginning. With that intense connection, one cannot see how the person will actually be like in a long-term relationship, but over a few months you can detect the pat- terns of their relationship con- science through subtle patterns in their behavior.\" Compatibility Compatibility is what attracts one person to another person and can be influenced by per- sonality characteristics, values or lifestyle. Examples of other relationships Van Epp suggests looking at a person's past intimate relation- ships for clues. \"Find out their history from friends or family,\" he said. \"If we listen more care- fully and we ask about some key areas in terms of the past relationships, you can start to see patterns in the subtle areas. Patterns become very important -patterns from their family, other relationships -patterhs that help to reveal or expose the way their relationship con- science works?' Van Epp cau- tioned, however, that many times people automatically take the side of their partner and assign blame to \"the ex\" for whatever issues arose in the for- mer relationship. Skills This is the area often ad- dressed in counseling sessions -communication skills, con- flict resolution skills, keeping a balance between assertiveness and understanding, etc. \"TheSingles key is their relationship con- science will determine when they use or don't use their skills later on in a relationship;' Van Epp said. \"They may be very skilled but choose to not use those skills with you, or they will use those skills against you. Understanding a person's rela- tionship conscience and their relationship skills is vital?' Van Epp exemplified this point with some classic stereo- types. \"There arejobs where the person may have great relation- ship skills but a very poor con science, like the idea of a used car salesman or politician;' he said. \"It's common knowledge that there is a difference, but many times when a person is forming a relationship they overlook that and assume that the skills are the conscience. And that can be very misleading and very painful to face later on down the road.\" In today's impatient society that embraces instant gratifica- tion, accelerated attachment ap- pears to be a precursor to failed relationships. \"Singles have to know what to look for and slow down their attachment so they can see clearly from the begin- ning;' Van Epp said. Heart knowledge \"Heart knowledge\" uses the RAM model, which examines bonding processes and how to properly pace a growing rela- tionship. The model, which bor- rows from other areas of re- search, illustrates the compo- nents of attachment and close- ness. Five key bonding compo- nents are present in almost every type of relationship. Healthy relationships keep all the com- ponents in balance. In contrast, when any one component is extremely high or low, the rela- tionship becomes unsafe. The model offers both clients and counselors an easy way to mea- sure the areas and see how they relate to each other. The bonding components are: * Getting to know someone. The process of getting to know someone and having him or her get to know you can form a very strong bond, Van Epp said. N Trust. \"The trust that we feel pulls from what attachment theory has found in terms of mental representation,\" he said. \"As you are getting to know someone, you are forming a pic- ture or representation of him or her in your mind.

Organizational counseling Continued from page 7 took every course she could in industrial psychology and orga- nizational behavior, and worked on a minor in business adminis- tration. She said she wanted to bridge the gap between business management and counseling. Her efforts landed her a job in human resources, then with an organizational development and leadership consulting firm, but she still felt unsettled. She hoped to hone in on ajob where she could use counseling in the workplace and combine it with a thorough understanding of the workplace environment. 'The organizational counsel- ing program is a wonderful com- bination of clinical theory and business application;' Chase said. After graduating last spring, she landed the job she wanted as a consultant for the corporate offices of a large health care firm where she had interned. New program takes root Mary Guindon, chair of the Johns Hopkins University De- partment of Counseling and Human Services and founder of the organizational counseling program, litters conversation about the program's history with similar stories of students finding just what they want and employ- ers finding what they need. When she took over as chair of the department, Guindon said, a certificate program was in place that prepared students for careers in employee assistance. But she sensed that the program could be expanded and was encouraged by her dean to offer a full degree. After extensive research and input from several focus groups, Guindon determined a direction for the program, confident that it would succeed. \"What I heard over and over again, and continue to hear today, is that there is a real need for this,\" she said. \"These stu- dents receive targeted training in organizational psychology, or- ganizational behavior and de- velopment, and they are taught how to apply their counseling skills to this coursework. No other counseling program does this to my knowledge?' There are three phases to the course work, beginning with an eight-course regimen of coun- seling courses similar to those one might find in other counsel- 12 ing degree programs. Included are such standbys as \"Theory Z and practice of counseling,\" \"Group counseling\" and \"Diag- L) nosis?'Phase two is described as a workplace orientation and 16 includes four courses concern-ing organizational culture and behavior and consultation. This phase utilizes a cohort format that features distance education and monthly class meetings. The third phase, a 600-hour internship, requires students to spend two-thirds of their time in a clinical setting and 'the remainder in an organizational counseling role. \"They receive the same basic training as the other counseling students here;\" Guindon said. \"They learn the organization is the client, although they do ser- vice to the employee or the organization?' Also offered is a post-master's certificate, which requires as a prerequisite exposure to various courses related to organizational counseling. The certificate pro- gram provides 15 credits in courses similar to those taken in phase two of the master's pro- gram relating to the workplace culture and organizational be- havior and counseling. A different beginning As a 25-year veteran of human resources work with the federal government, John Rogers ap- proached the organizational counseling program at Johns Hopkins with a very different background than Chase. He graduated from the post-master's certificate program. 'This pro- gram appealed to me because it involves working in an organiza- tion (and) using mental health training to help them deal with the inkier aspects of the organi- zation and the people in it,\" Rogers said. He found the pro- gram prepared himn to work on issues within an organization by using a counselor's eyes to examine the organization's struc- ture and tendencies. Rogers now works for a feder- al agency where he routinely puts his training to use in every- thing from traditional employee assistance and dispute resolu- tion to innovative preventative measures. He said his day-to- day work might involve helping a supervisor with \"lousy com- munications skills;' developing a group to tackle an opgoing employee issue or counseling an employee when personal prob- lems begin to interfere with their work. Sara Sundstrom, an instructor with the organizational counsel- ing program, said graduates can use the skills acquired to meet a wide range of needs, including: U Serving as a \"sounding board\" for individuals facing home issues, battles with a bossMary Guindon or co-worker, problems with drugs or alcohol, or stress, burnout or mental illness. Essen- tially, organizational counselors serve as a link between employ- ees and the organization. * Offering career counseling for employees. * Serving at the forefront of an organization undergoing change by reassuring those who are most iffected and anticipating/ mitigating disruptions and changes in relationships that might occur. In addition, the counselors would report to man- agement about the psychosocial effects of the change. * Setting up training and coaching programs to deal with issues such as alcohol abuse or sexual harassment, and working with management to improve supervisors' \"soft skills\" for managing people. Counselors might organize offsite retreats and meetings to address interper- sonal relations or workplace bbhavior. N \"Taking the pulse\" or mood of an organization, then report- ing to management and recom- mending ways to alter it. * Helping supervisors manage an employee with psycho- pathology or assisting employ- ees who are mentally ill. * Sitting on committees in- volved in issues related to their field, such as inappropriate behavior, substance abuse or conflict resolution. In the ab- sence of these committees, organizational counselors might take charge of establishing groups on those topics. * Offering staff information about key topics in their realm of expertise. \"They are really experts in community building at a time when the world of work has increasingly replaced family and neighborhood as the place where many people seek a sense of community in their lives,\" Guindon said. 'This (field) tar- gets worker well-being. Our graduates are a personal coun- selor and coach, a career devel- opment specialist and an organi- zational consultant in the work- place. They are trained as coun- selors who have the workplaceknowledge they need to be cred- ible and-talk the talk.\"' I Guindon said the Johns Hop- kins program offers something different than the traditional training for organizational psychology, career counselingor employee assistance and often fills a gap between the responsibilities of these spe- cialists and those of human resource professionals. 9/11 solidifies urge to help Danielle DeSimone knew she wanted to work with people, but after receiving her degree in sociology she was still uncertain how her career would develop. \"I wanted to do counseling;' she said, \"but I wasn't sure what age groups and what degree pro- gram would be best for me. I considered social work, coun- seling psychology, community counseling and other positions?' She was living in New Jersey when the Sept. 11, 2001, terror- ist attacks occurred, and after the shock wore off she began to think about how survivors and people in nearby buildings were struggling. \"It helped me see that people in organizations have a unique need that, currently, personnel and human resources are not able to handle;' she said. DeSimone decided the Johns Hopkins program best met her needs because it would satisfy her interest in employee assis- tance while also providing sub- stantial flexibility. \"It offered a unique advantage over typical master's courses in counseling or social work,\" she said. Her internship offered her an oppor- tunity to work in a large federal agency in the area of depression awareness. She later took a per- manent position in a human resources department, with the hope of finding a specific slot in employee assistance. While the organization coun- seling program meets a very dis- tinct need, DeSimone said, there is often some confusion about the skills and placement of grad- uates. She said that many people don't yet recognize the field's potential. Career decision made on the commute- A subway car poster describ- ing the Johns Hopkins organiza- tional counseling program got Emily Noll's attention one morn- ing on her way to work, then stuck in her head as she saw it several more times. She already had a degree in psychology and sociology and was working for a survey research firm but was considering other options.\"The ad copy appealed to my combined interests in human services and business;' she said, noting that she thought she might be happy \"helping the people of an organization to have a happier and more pro- ductive life.\" Noll thrived in the program, thoroughly. enjoying what she described as diverse but practical course work, the unique mix of students and the flexibility. She even put her organization-building skills to work and began the Association of Counseling Students. Noll returned to the research firm but soon got an opportuni- ty to move into human re- sources and combined that experience with her master's work. \"That advanced my knowledge of work-life cul- ture,\" she said. \"The Hopkins program helped me develop my ability to build relationships and hear ideas, and make con- nections with people.\" Noll has since taken an ac- count executive position with the workplace wellness depart- ment of a large health care orga- nization, and she finds that her training in organization counsel- ing often pays off. She conducts wellness seminars, handles child and elder care referrals, and offers employee assistance and coaching. \"I get to help our business understand that the value in pro- viding these services is to culti- vate a productive, happy, creative and committed workforce,\" she said. 'It's more than just doing the right thing. It really does make a difference in the energy of a working moim to have assis- tance in selecting high-quality child care, for example. ... I also use the counseling skills every day to shape the programs and the decisions made to benefit the employees.\" All the graduates of the orga- nizational counseling program interviewed for this article be- lieve that the field will change and that more opportunities will anse. \"Workplace leaders have increasingly acknowledged that career development increases retention and that psychosocial issues affect worker productivi- ty,\" Guindon said. \"Consequent- ly, interventions targeted at enhancing optimal worker well- being are in demand. This pro- gram trains people to make those interventions.\"f Jim Paterson is a high school counselor and writer living in Olney, Md. E-mail comments about this article to ct@counselng.org Student Focus Continued from page 7 An internship beyond all expectations BY JIM PATERSON A group of students in the Johns Hopkins University organizational counseling program had an opportunity last spring to be involved in a consulting project that thrilled their employer and taught them a lot about their spanking new field of study. In the process, they got a firsthand look at how coun- seling can sometimes in- volve more than a single individual. According to Sara Sund- strom, an instructor in the organizational counseling program, the students were given a chance to conduct an organizational analysis with a directorate in a large federal agency. Such stud- ies generally involve gath- ering data through surveys and interviews, organizing the data into themes, draw- ing conclusions and making recommendations, she ex- plained. The students used detailed employee survey data and interviews with managers. \"The beauty of our work was that, just as in counsel- ing individuals, we helped this part of the organization listen to itself better and thereby improve its organi- zational self-awareness,\" said Jason Murillo, one of the students involved. Such a distinction is a key part of the new Hopkins program, which strives to fill a gap in the \"therapy\" provided to organizations and their members. According to Delois John-son, another participant in the consulting project, the students were trying to devel- op out-of-the-box thinking. Among the students' recom- mended actions were mediat- ing before decisions and statements were made, form- ing online discussion groups and making management more transparent Murillo said the students worked to develop \"sound, needs-based recommenda- tions. ... Instead of focus- ing on the challenges, we helped the organization develop a balanced. con- crete perspective on their current reality which leaned on their strengths. We were able to help them craft a vision of what could be from evidence of what already was.\" The result? The recipient of the students' work asked them to present their find- ings and recommendations to 20 members of a leader- ship team, with others tun- ing in offsite. For Murillo, the proof of what the students had ac- complished came after the presentation. \"When the presentation was complete, people actually stayed in the room, engaging one another and us on a variety of the issues we discussed;' he said. \"They expressed inter- est in working more with us in the future (or) even taking on an organizational coun- seling intern. The project was a big success.\"' AMERICAN COUNSELING ASSOCIATIONinclude many of the more tradi- tional academic and counseling activities. Each technique can reach beyond the words and actions to support the growth of one's inner strength. Music: CDs have proved very useful in my efforts to help chil- dren prepare, regroup and recharge. Kindergartners enter- ing classrooms where music is playing are bestowed with a calmness needed to settle them and begin the day in a positive way. Background music that plays as students develop stories or write in journals serves to promote a more relaxed and cre- ative state for expressing ideas. Music-guided imagery that exudes feelings of peacefulness and calmness works well during classroom lessons, especially prior to state-testing periods when anxiety levels are high. Then there are character-educa- tion traits such as self-control and respect that are taught as important parts of the school's climate and safety programs. Whatever the model for teach- ing these traits, students receive strong reinforcement from song lyrics and musical rhythms that match the concepts being dis- cussed. Music also connects me to the children and to my own tasks in a way that preparation and experience alone' cannot provide. Expression notebooks: Note- books for writing and drawing have proved useful to me in helping children let go of their negative feelings and worries. They are powerful tools in re- connecting children to their world and refocusing them on the things they can control ver- sus the things they cannot. Jour- naling in particular provides a valuable connection between the children, therapeutic sharing and myself. Both the children and I gain a greater sense of each other, our concerns and our thoughts on how to deal with life situations. Sometimes children mention a higher power in these discussions and exhibit an accompanying sense of security and confidence. I smile, nod and acknowledge what they said, knowing that writing and shar- ing about ourselves often recon- nects us to spintual sensations that can provide comfort and direction. Play: Using dollhouses for free-play expression seems par- ticularly helpful for children working through traumatic inci- dents that occurred in theirhomes, often the night before. The incidents don't make much initial sense to them, but the play often can provide a broader perspective. I have seen children re-enact domestic violence situ- ations where fighting occurred and police were involved. Some children change their voices to mimic the substance-abusing parent who stumbled through the house chasing a sibling or adult. Fears and haunting dreams are played out with characters the children can more effectively control. While it is rewarding to be involved with children, watching innocent minds rid themselves of the dragons is also emotionally draining. Witnessing play so in- tense that exhaustion quickly follows might lead one to believe that something bigger is part of the process. As healing begins and freedom from the dragons is gained, a serene calmness can emerge -both for students and myself -that has the feeling of spirituality, connectedness to self and recharging of the soul. Artwork: Crayons, markers and paints (with lots of paper on hand) encourage children to explore feelings and thoughts through artistic means. Color, images, shapes and objects are used to create works of art that are meaningful to life events, emotions, conceptualizations and self-exploration. Just being part of the process of self-dis- covery, awareness and healing that takes place is refreshing and rejuvenating. I have witnessed how huge strides in the counsel- ing process are made through the artistic path. Watching chil- dren draw, paint, create, build, mold or color their hidden secrets, forbidden truths and hard feelings forces the coun- selor to experience something that is hard to put into words. Creating art along with the students and participating in the counseling process provides me with another renewal zone. Drawing, coloring and just doing along with the children helps them feel more connected to me, less anxious about the task and more open to express- ing inner experiences. Helping children experience this con- nectedness at school can also bring more direct benefits back to me. During one recent group focused on loss, special mo- ments were remembered by drawing memory pictures of a loved one who had died. Memo-ries of my mother who died recently were bouncing around in my head itching to come out -and they did in drawings and words. A small amount of shar- ing these thoughts and pictures with the children encouraged healing to begin both for the stu- dents and myself. A general spir- itual energy was exhibited as the grieving children and I began sharing, letting go of some pain and recharging ourselves. A wide variety of paths lead to renewal zones, where opportu- nities for self-expression and nurturing of spirit abound. The ways of getting there are not always so different for children and adults, and we all need to take advantage of these opportu- nities. All the paths contain a common thread of connecting, and those connections between children and the adults who care for them have been particularly meaningful to me. The mes- sages we give to young people every day are essential: We love you. We accept you and your life. We care about you. We care about what happens to you. We are here for you. We think you are special. These relationships are ex- tremely important to children and offer powerful meaning to us all. Maybe there is a spiritual component working within us to affect a life here or there, to make a real difference in some- one's world or to change and recharge our own existence. Perhaps this spirituality informs us of the essential need to care for and love one another. To find this spiritual place on our life journeys, it seems we need to slow down, breathe deep, listen and watch. Creating special renewal zones for ourselves and for those we serve may better enable us to deal with those bothersome dragons nipping at our heels. Seeking peace and spirituality in our everyday experiences can move us toward the growth and healing so evi- dent in children at play..It's something we all strive for in -our own lives as adults, students and counselors.

Depending on a person for your needs. \"What is found in social exchange theory -whereas I go about meeting a person's needs and they go about meeting my needs -(is that) the better our needs are met, the stronger the depen- dence and reliance is on each other and, therefore, the stronger the bond?' * Commitment The degree to which two people belong to one another. \"It's a kind of healthy ownership in a relationship,\" Van Epp said. \"In terms of a strong bond in a relationship, the more I feel that this person really belongs to me and I belong to them, the stronger the commitment?' * Sexual chemistry and touch. \"Even in friendships there may be sexual chemistry, but we set boundaries,\" he said. \"This is certainly a very bonding force in romantic relationships.\" \"If you think of all these areas, they are very bonding, but they also relate to each other,\" Van Epp said. His theory is that if the components are kept in a safe zone, where one level does not greatly exceed a previous level, then the relationship is positive. For example, don't let your sexual involvement greatly exceed your commitment; don't become more comititted than the level of reliance you have formed; don't try to meet each other's needs beyond the level of trust; don't trust a person you don't know well. \"Married couples also need to keep those five areas of the RAM vital and vibrant in their relationship,\" Van Epp said. \"Couples, over time, can feel like they don't know each other anymore. Their trust picture of each other can begin to be infected with small, negative attitudes. They may stop meet- ing each other's needs, causing the reliance to drop?' Teaching this model to married couples and showing them how to evalu- 8 ate their relationship can help keep each bonding component strong, he said. Van Epp often a uses the RAM chart in his prac- tice to conduct assessments of 4 couples seeking marriage coun- , seling. Having the couple rate each of the five components in gtheir marriage is helpful in set- 0 ting the agenda, he said. \"It's become a very utilitarian model,\" he said, \"not just to helpthem rebuild their relationship but to continue to build it throughout the years.\" Military involvement According to Van Epp, his program's versatility allows it to be presented in a variety of set- tings, be it churches, organiza- tions for singles, divorce recov- ery groups, women's shelters or high schools. Even the military has embraced his simplified design for successful courtships. The U.S. Army started imple- menting the PICK program five years ago, Van Epp said. \"Before, they didn't have any type of program geared toward choosing a partner and building a relationship;' he said. Now, several chaplains and family advocacy officers are certified to teach the program. \"About three years ago the Army took a more serious inter- est,\" he said, \"and the Chief of Chaplains Office orchestrated a funding of a research project that would look at how useful this program would be for single soldiers in both Army bases and academic settings.\" The re- search project 'was recently completed, and the findings will be submitted for publication this summer. \"The findings were extremely positive in terms of altering attitudes and intentions of single soldiers toward dating and relationships,\" Van Epp said. \"The military has reallystruggled to try to help singles slow down these accelerated relationships. Military bases are like incubators for these types of relationships. So the PICK pro- gram has really taken off in that environment. Spreading the RAM gospel Van Epp encourages coun- selors, both secular and pastoral, to become certified in the PICK program and to use the model with clients and in the commu- nity. \"Psychoeducational pro- grams are a tremendous asset to a counseling practice,\" he said. \"It helps to take the information that is so necessary for personal change and personal growth and put it in a structured educational format so that it becomes hand- and-glove with your counseling practice. Being certified in the PICK program will help you not only address singles' needs bet- ter but also help you organize your own seminars where you can teach the course.,\" While attending a marriage conference five years ago, Bob Ruthazer and his wife discov- ered Van Epp's by the program's princi- ples, the Ruthazers, who have been married 26 years, pur- chased the video for their two young-adult children. \"It had a pretty significant impact on our college-aged daughter,\" Bob Ruthazer said. Since imple- menting the program, he said,his daughter can tell within the first two weeks of dating some- one whether the courtship. has potential for turning into a happy and healthy relationship. \"She can avoid that serial dating trap which many singles get stuck in -being in a relation- ship for six months to a year and then realizing it just can't work out,\" Ruthazer said. \"Then they break it off and start another.\" Ruthazer, a certified family life educator through the Na- tional Council of Family Rela- tions, is now also a certified instructor of the PICK program. He has presented the program to a variety of religious groups, universities and area community organizations and once held the presentation at a local coffee- house over the course of two days. \"The program has great value in helping people under- stand the basic ideas of relation- ships and how they work,\" he said. \"It's helpful in preventing people from getting hurt over and over. It gives them a better start to forming a healthy rela- tionship that might lead to a long-term commitment. Every single or single again should familiarize themselves with this program.\" Beth Miller is also a certified PICK instructor and believes the program is too effective not to use and teach. In fact, Miller and Epp collaborated last summer on the first seminar for teens. Millerpicked 15 teen-agers from her church congregation's youth group to attend the three-day retreat. \"They were really recep- tive to it,\" she said. \"John puts this in an application that just makes sense to people. That sim- ple (RAM) board is such a great visual that people can wrap their minds around very easily and really understand. Regardless of whether it's taught from a Chris- tian perspective or a secular one, people can see that when things are out of balance, that's when they are in pain.\" Miller also taught an abbrevi- ated version of the program to previously homeless individuals who were seeking services at an inner city outreach agency in Richmond, Va. \"No matter what walk of life or where you are coming from;' she said, \"it just makes sense. One of the agency employees told me the next day that one of the men came up and said, 'I learned something tonight ... I'm a jerk.' John's material helps people recognize the poor choices that they are making in terms of relation- ships, but they are also, in a ifon- confrontational way, forced to look at themselves and see where they may be a 'jerk.\"' In the works Van Epp is currently updating the program's website (www. nojerks.com) to include a pass- word-protected instructor's sec- tion that will make supplemen- tal materials available for down- load free of charge. Instructors will be able to tailor the pro- gram to their specific popula- tions. For example, if an instruc- tor is teaching the program to singles who have previously had abusive relationships, the in- structor can download informa- tion that can be added to the \"trust\" lesson or one of the other key parts of the RAM. Other areas to be addressed include issues concerning single parent- ing and stepfamilies.

The \"pieces\" or \"checkers\" or colored dots are specific situations requiring your attention. Nothing else will be allowed to invade that area or areas. Because there are many competing demands, you con- tinu planning your strategy by placing your checkers on the board based on your priorities. As an example, imagine you are the mother of teen-agers, but you are now in graduate school learning a profession after having been a stay-at- home mom. You are part of the \"squeezed generation.\" Your teen-age children still need guidance, supervision and pa- tience, while the elderly mem- bers of your family may have failing health and are often in distant locations. Imagine that a parent is quite ill, one of your teen-agers has had several minor car accidents and is not doing well in school, and your husband's nephew has come to live with you temporarily. Meaiwhile, you have papers and exams due within the next week. , Standing in the middle of the family rooin floor, having just returned from a night class with new assignments, your hus- band insists that decisions must be made about your son at once. You feel overwhelmed and panicky. In order to calm down, you can develop a men- tal game plan of priorities. It feels like a survival tactic but can also be an interesting men- tal challenge. As events move on or change and other pressures materialize, your goal is to move to the next row of squares or priorities that have presented themselves and that may be less crucial. You need to be flexible enough to utilize many of the squares, oneat a time, or to change and rearrange the pieces as needed. This can be a fun challenge in itself. The number of squares for any given situation can vary depending on the urgency and time needed. The \"game plan\" must be flexible. You are to be in control of it; it is not to be in control of you. Back-to the dilemma of the mother/student. First, it is im- perative that you spend that very evening stitdying and organiz- ing notes for your paper, as there ate immediate deadlines to be met. The nearest couple of squares have checkers on them, covering non-negotiable time slots in the next couple of days. Another empty space a few blocks away awaits the piece representing the meeting with your husband about your son. Filling this square pacifies you both because you know time has been set aside to concentrate on that important problem, while another square of space and time in the row beyond awaits a piece for the dialogue with your son. There will be time to work on your paper the following morning. That afternoon you will study, and the square for that evening already has a piece on it for class attendance. Sever- al spaces will be occupied the next weekend for visiting a sick parent, taking care of her needs and studying in the car while your husband drives. But what on earth to do about giving your nephew time? Here's where you have to be- come really creative. Since the nephew works all day, you visu- alize \"checker hopping\" and using spaces in between those already filled to visit with him and your family during leisurely meals. You would save blocks here and there to cook new recipes, which gives you a cre-ative outlet and which your nephew especially appreciates, and save blocks of time for those family dinners. You would also allow time for yourself to lie in the hammock gazing at the leaves and listening to the birds. And you and your husband would fill a blank space next weekend with dinner and a movie, also leaving time to talk to a friend in need. You may have to shorten some blocks of time, but something is better than nothing. And where do these hours come from? You decide! As you see, the \"pieces\" or \"checkers\" and useof the empty squares are what you choose them to be. They could be pro- jects to complete, appointments to keep, creative work or study to focus on, relaxation or fun, errands to do, conversations to have, support to give to another, etc. They could be items on your \"to-do\" list. But a list or full schedule can be as overwhelming and daunt- ing as the vague confusion of wondering where to begin. A list can hit you in the face like a formidable wall, causing de- spair or depression. What, then, is the diffeience between lists or schedules and placing \"pieces\" ,on the squares of your checker- board? -. By separating items from the list (which could be made in writing first), you have the opportunity to analyze each one in terms of time and attention needed, importance and effect on others, urgency in regard to timing and so on. The process of doing this empowers you to make decisions, to prioritize and to place activities in a kind of sacred time and space according to needs and desires -both yours and others' -as repre- sented on the checkerboard.For a person who is visual, this task might be fairly easy to complete. For those who have more trouble, a therapist can help with exercises in visualiza- tion, imagery, the discipline of attacking irrational beliefs, developing pro and con lists in order to prioritize, etc. As- sertiveness training and the examination of one's interests, strengths and values can aid in preparing a client to make deci- sions and to take control by placing his or her \"pieces\" on the checkerboard. Probably the most effective way to utilize the checkerboard squares is to mentally create or to create a board on paper rep- resenting one week of time. Simply drawing the game board can help you see that there is a time and space for a chore, rela- tionship or project that needs to get done. Seeing the board mentally or on paper can relieve worry, anx- iety and fear that important aspects of life will not be given attention or completed as need- ed. By knowing you have made both time and space to accom- plish the tasks you feel are important, you are using your power and taking control of your situation instead of allow- ing it to captrol you. This knowledge can bring relief from chaos, freeing you from feelings of helplessness and the ensuing dangers of depressioff and despair. The process con- tributes to peace of mind, to physical and emotional health, and to efficiency. The value here is that you have taken charge of yourself, your time and your space. In this way you know that the problem, decision, activity or crisis will be taken care of in a ,timely fashion because you have planned and prepared for it.What are some steps you can take to get from confusion to clarity on your checkerboard? * Identify and separate your feelings. N Flash a spotlight on the thoughts causing the feelings. Focus with ratiorial thought on the irrational ideas and assump- tions that create or complicate problems. For example, identify exaggerations based on your own unsupported ideas: \"I can't possibly do all of this! There is no time. I am too tired. I don't know what to do first!\" Change the irrational to rational: \"I am wasting time stewing about what I can't do. Instead I'need to separate what I feel to be cru- cial and discipline myself to do what I can?\" * Recognize what you can and cannot do. . E Distinguish the things that are your problems and responsi- bilities from those that do not belong to you. N Organize your thoughts, energy and time by creating and isolating spaces defined by boundaries such as checker- board squares and decide what takes precedence. N Now move your pieces according to your designed strategy. E Play the game of life, have fun and embrace satisfaction. \"For everything there is a season, .and a time for every matter uder heaven.\" -Ecclesiastes Coun- selor and a Licensed Marriage ahd Family Therapist, recently retired after 17 years in private practice and 25 years in the counseling field.

When I was 7 years old I moved to the United States from the Philip- pines, and I can remember how hard the struggle was to feel comfortable in a new culture. Even 'at my present age, I re- member my experiences in the U.S. public school system as if they had'occurred yesterday. I reached the airport in the evening. An early spring rain was falling. I waited in the lobby with my mother. I ran toward the gate after seeing my grandmother fight through a crowd of Filipino faces, I felt as though this would be the last time I would see her. She hand- ed me a handkerchief after tears ran down my face. I knew at once that I would not be able to leave.Before departing to the new land, I remember clinging des- perately to my grandmother, whq had escorted me to the air- port. I have probably never felt more emotional pain in my life than the moment when niy mother pulled me by the arm and dragged me across the air- port lobby. Crying and scream- ing, I could not bear the painful agony of having to leave. Leav- ing the Philippines, and espe- cially my grandmother, was similar to leaving my parents because my \"Lola\" (Filipino for grandma) had raised me my whole life. On the evening of my arrival in America, I felt completely lost. I had wished that my mov- ing was only a big dream. I had been welcomed with a great big hug from my father, whom I had not seen in five years, and with aplastic bag full of mixed fruits. I remember feeling exhilarated, thinking -how everything would be a happy ending now that my family was reunited. I soon real- ized, however, that I could not escape mourning over the loss of my friends and relatives back ifi the Philippines. The euphoric feelings of anticipation were quickly replaced with heartache and deep pain. My first night in America felt like my first night in prison. We had to live with my cousins until my father earned enough for our own apartment. That night, I lay between my parents. Restless, I began thinking of iny grand- mother. I began to let out my sorrows, crying freely as I enter- tained thoughts of \"I wish she was here\" or \"I wish I was back home?' I desperately wanted my mother's embrace as I screamed into the soaked pillow. All I received was silence. I did not know which was more painful -being emotionally ignored by my parents or missing my grandmother. In the morning I was awak- ened by the merry noises of mylittle cousins running across the hallway. I felt so anxious that my legs seemed paralyzed, unable to move down the stairs. Hoping to be invited down, I sat nervously at the top of the stairs and then proceeded down slow- ly while in a sitting position. Halfway down I heard, \"Hurry up, big crybaby!\" Not only were my legs paralyzed, but now my butt was paralyzed as well. Ashamed, I desperately wanted to slide back up to hide in my room. Unexpectedly, my uncle glee- fully picked me up and put me in the middle of the dining table to join everybody else. Still frozen in fear and embarrass- ment, I couldn't open my mouth. My cousins kept making fun of me for crying and for the way I was dressed. They teased me for looking like a \"FOB,\" a defogatory acronym meaning \"fresh off the boat?' -Three weeks later, I found myself in grade school. Talk about out of the frying pan and into the fire. This was an even worse form of torture for a lost little boy. I cried and hid behinda school building each time my mother dropped me off. I ran home from school each day in an attempt to avoid being beaten up by bullies who harassed me because I looked, dressed and talked differently than the other children. In the beginning, I was youhg, naive and lost. I figured the key to American life was to imitate pop culture and daytime televi- sion. In short, the key to learning the English language was to model myself after characters in TV sitcoms such as Punky Brew- ster and I Love Lucy. I felt like an extraterrestrial wanting desper- ately to go unnoticed in this new world. I said to myself, \"I defi- nitely am no longer in the Philip- pines;' emulating Dorothy's character in The Wizard of Oz. Recalling these childhood experiences, I realize I was also sinular to the lead character in the movie Forrest Gump. I was unaware of the basic protocols of the American public school system. On the first day of class, I decided to blend in as much as possible. But since I had never heard of recess or lunchtime, I rrn anorne con Ethical-Iegal, and Professioinal: Issues Iri Counseling, Second Edition Theodore P.

Therefore, I had no notion of how to obtain them. Instead, I simply ate my packed hot dog, which was the only thing my mother had put in my lunch bag. On another occasion, I had a squished hot dog in the bottom of my book bag. I feltembar- rassed about taking it out to eat for lunch, but it was either the hot dog or having to sit and wait for everyone else to finish their -cafeteria .unches-AlthoughL was not a bit hungry, I didn't want to draw attention to myself by sitting alone without any food to eat. So I reached in to grab the hot dog that my mother had packed for me. Unbe- knownst to me, the hot dog wassoggy with grape juice, as was everything else in my book bag. A few kids pointed at me and someone threw a milk cartoon that hit me in the head. Humili- ated, I ran to the bathroom. After the hot dog fiasco, I thought I would never have to go to school again. But appar- ently, feeling humiliated was not a good enough excuse to hold off on public schooling. To my surprise, after I decided to face the music and set my foot back on school soil, it seemed as though the hot dog incident had never occurred. Everyone ig- nored me as I walked back into the classroom. My fear of being on the receiving end of long stares from my classmates quickly dissipated when a fight\"I assumed that the bully Was long gne.

The teacher quickly took mat- ters to hand and sent the two boys to the principal's office. The rest of the class was soon inundated with school stuff so I, too, casually lost myself in the assigned tasks. I felt assured that everybody's attention was on the fight and not my hot dog incident.I thought I had survived the dreadful day of returning to class after my embarrassing moment until the school bully caught me. He had warned me earlier that he planned to beat me up after school. Evidently, when I had stormed out of the cafeteria after my incident, another milk cartoon had hit him in the back. It seemed logi- cal to him that I was the guiltyparty since I had been seen run- ning away from the crime after he got hit. I clearly had been set up, but my English was not yet sufficient to explain the circum- stances. I ran home that day as fast as I could, thinking of avoiding the bully. After finally arriving, I let out a sigh of relief, but then my heart began beating fast once again. My key to the house apparently was misplaced, and I had no way of letting myself in. No one was home to open the door. I could either wait outside for hours until someone arrived, or I could go back to school to call my parents. Grudgingly, I decided to return to school.

Subject: Define \"advocacy\" and explain if you support requiring \"advocacy\" as a com- ponent of graduate counseling programs. - Advocacy is taking actions to increase awareness and create positive change for individuals, groups, organizations and soci- eties. Counseling does not entail advocacy; it is advocacy. We, counselors, speak for our clients, the counseling profes- sion and our livelihood. Advo- cacy is not only a role of a coun- selor, but also a responsibility. If the premise of the counsel- ing profession is advocacy, then why do we, counselors, take a back seat to psychologists and social workers due to their ag- gressive advocating skills? I believe that the path to the \"front seat\" is paved with advocacy training. One way to improve the profession, which in turn accom- modates the needs of our clien- tele, is to integrate advocacy training into all graduate cours- es. Moreover, due to the vast amount of information needing to be learned, I support incorpo- rating an advocacy course into the training requirements. In order to advocate, counsel- ing students need to be aware of the purpose of advocating, they need to discern what caus- es to advocate for and deter- mine how to advocate in a suc- cessful manner. Potentially these three aspects could be the focus of an advocacy coursecurriculum. Moreover, under- standing these three compo- nents will prepare students to partake in different types of advocacy, whether it is for the clientele or for the profession. It is essential that students are aware of the history of advocacy. For example, reading the works of Clifford Beers could enlighten students as to why such action is beneficial to the profession and the welfare of humanity. Learn- ing about the rewards of advo- cating can motivate and encour- age the counselor to get involved and take social action. It can reit- erate that counseling is more than a 50-minute session in a small, square room. Knowing that there is more to the profes- sion can inspire students to unleash their abilities. Learning advocacy skills will arm coun- seling students with confidence in their helping ability and in- crease their awareness of social justice concerns. Once students understand that the future of their profession and well being of their clients rely on their advocating, it is essential that they learn how to choose their battles. Advocacy training could teach students how to access information about current events and legislative activities that affect the counseling profes- sion and their clientele. Addi- tionally, this course could allow students the opportunity to par- ticipate in self-exploration. It could give them the opportunity to discover what issues are important to them and release their passions. Once they engage in self-reflection and identify how to obtain pertinent informa- tion, students need to identify what actions to take and how to do so in a productive manner. There are a multitude of social action skills that counseling stu- dents could learn that would enhance their advocating abili- ties. An advocacy course could teach counselors how to mediate between clients and outside institutions, negotiate with out- side agencies and cope with resistance at a systemic level. It could teach students practical methods of advocating, as sug- gested by ACES's Advocacy Network. Students could learn how to take action against public advertisements that misuse the word counselor, create brochures that describes a counselor's skills, publish articles about counseling in popular media,write letters to legislators, start petitions, speak to local organi- zations, prepare debates, etc. Additionally, I would suggest incorporating an advocacy com- mittee in the department or Chi Sigma Iota branch, which I have done at the University of Akron. Learning advocacy techniques could liberate counseling stu- dents by taking them out of their box (more commonly known as the 12 x 12 room). In addition to learning func- tional applications, counseling students should also be aware of the negative aspects of advocacy. Ideally, an advocacy course would teach counselors that ad- vocating could be demanding, emotionally taxing and jeopar- dizing to their job. Being aware of the drawbacks would prepare students for the struggles and enable them to manage the stress that accompanies social justice action. Because advocates may be viewed as troublemakers, it is imperative that students learn how to work against the system. from within it. In an advocacy class they could learn how to use their personal characteristics and counseling skills as social action tools. Requiring advocacy as a com- ponent of graduate training would benefit the individual counselor, the counseling profes- sion and the clientele. An effec- tive counselor is an advocate, thus counselors need specialized training in advocacy. Counselors who have advanced advocating skills would not only grow per- sonally but also professionally. Thus training programs should unleash a counselor; unveil an advocate.

Subject: Should graduate counseling programs continue to focus on human development and career counseling or shift to emphasize diagnosis and treat- ment of mental disorders?? I believe that graduate counsel- ing programs should continue educating and training in human- istic development and career counseling irith less focus on diagnosis and treatment. With most mental health professionals now obtaining a strong education, in the medical model, counselors may be the orily \"healthy\" client advocates left among mental health providers. For, the coun- seling profession it is paramount that student counselors receive solid humanistic training so they are able to critically evaluate cur- rent possible incompatible thera- peutic models utilized in the workplace. If programs succumb to the \"medical-ized\" focus, counselors' ability to give voice to healthy developmental views and to influence economic and political powers will continue to diminish, and subsequently we will be consumed by the medical madhine. Employment forces will then ask us to forsake out roots, our voice. My personal journey into be- coming a humanistic/client-cen- tered counselor started in the late 1990s with my acceptance into a CACREP-accredited Counselor Education program. My educa- tion.helped me fdrm the belief that clients desire their coun- selors to witness their human dignity and, in turn, their coun- selors believe that the clients possess the skills to grow in healthy directions. My job as therapist is to \"be\" with clients on this part of their journey. Comfortable and confident with my academic training, I started my internship At a hospi- tal psychiatric ward. I experi- enced firsthand how safe the diagnostic world can be. I found the medical model to be \"clean- er\" and with strong boundaries. It was easiet for me in my inex- perience to put a label on a per- son whose life seemed 'out of control and very complex. The medical model helped me devise treatment plans designed for anyone in such dire straits. I had a diagnosis, psychotropic prescription and a treatment plan. The patieits will get better. If they did not, it was not because of the diagnostic andstatistical manual's defined treatment plan but rather an incorrect diagnosis, the need for a drug change or lack of patient motivation. The locus of control and blame was outside me, the therapist. I unwittingly found the medical model a comfortihg place in which to exist. Next, I decided to intem at Hospice. I had not realized the extent of my internal theoretical change until I was sitting with a dying person. I found it really did not matter what the psycho- logical diagnosis was or what psychotropic drugs were pre- scribed. What was most poig- nant was the relationship and human dignity present in the dying process. I was a counselor from a solid humanistic background; hoW could I fall into the medical model trap so easily? The changes were so subtle, subver- sive and frighteningly simple. My experience of adopting the medical model gave me a false sense of authority and expertise which allowed me to distance myself from patients' weakness and- disease -their humanity. In turn, I distanced myself from my own pain, fear and weakness -my own humanity. I discov- ered that distancing was the last thihg dying People and their families need in,that moment; they need meaningful relation- ship, and I want to' be in that relationship. If offered early during their education, I believe that student counselors who are struggling with the ambiguity and tension of the \"therapeutic relationship\" will grab hold of the concrete steps and answers the inedical model offers. This model is less messy than having to deal with all the unknown factors of the clients' and counselors' unique- ness, strengths and humanity. Medical model training allows counseling students to distance themselves from their personal struggles with ambiguity, a struggle which I now believe is paramount in achieving the per- sonal growth and compassion needed to become partners in the therapeutic relationship. Even though many present- day professional counselors come from a humanism back- ground, they and the political and economic authority appear trapped in the medical model. Indeed, my own counselor edu- cation program has been some-what modified to meet the changing demands of mental health employers to hire those savvy in the medical 'model. Although I understand the uni- versal language, utility and appeal of the medical model, I believe the subtle shift I experi- ended in what it means to be a developing human coping'with life's difficult circumstance was a product of my exposure to the medical model. This shift result- ed in me compromising my clients' dignity and integrity. This is far too great a price to pay for the economic and politi- cal future of our counseling pro- grams and future employment. We cannot give up our roots, our voice, our soul.

Subject: How can counselor training programs better prepare students to address today's broad range of social justice concerns? The concept behind this essay materialized at around 36,000 feet altitude. I was on a flight returning home from a spring break service trip. During the past week we were at Red' Cloud, a school located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. While there, we personally witnessed many of today's most pressing social justice issues. On the plane ride home an undbrgraduate counsel- ing major who we'll call Jill (to protect her identity) mentioned how counselors could do so much mbre as advocates for the oppressed if they received ade- quate education in justice-felat- ed political, social and econom-ic issues. After I responded with, \"Well, um, we do have the social cultural issues class:' I realized that something was not right. Social justice concerns influence in every dimension of society. As a result, it would be wrong to confine these issues to one course. Instead, a counselor training, program must offer an integrated approach to teaching justice interweaving education, skills training and direct first- hand experience to better pre- pare students to address these issues in the future. Since all aspects of a coun- selor's professional identity are influenced by social, political and economic issues, every train- ing course within a counseling program should be geared to address these concerns in a, rele- vant and appropriate manner. For instance, a course on social and cultural issues dah be molded to prepare counselors to identify issues within their community and also provide the skills train- ing necessary to be an -advocate for populations who experience these forms of discrimination and oppression. A professional issues course can enhance stu- dent's knowledge of the many local, state and national laws and prpvisions (PATRIOT. Acts, poverty laws, etc.) that may impact their futire clients. In order to integrate these issues, counseling departments should establish a curriculum committee composed of faculty, staff and representatives from lodal advo- cacy organizations, to outline clear education for social justice objectives for the program, re- view current course offerings and make recommendations to the department chair and dean on what gaps are pisent. Beyond elucation and train- ing, a direct experience working with the marginalized and op- pressed is necessary in order to fully prepare future counselors. To facilitate this experience, practicum and, internship re- quirements should be reconsid- ered. I propose that students be required to spend a designated amount of hours -researching a social justice topic and then completing direct onsite hours at an organization which works with those who are negatively impacted by the issue. Taking this one step further, programs can offer short-term immersion experiences to live and workwithin a community that has been devastated by economic or political justice issues to pro- vide an even more profound frame of reference. My experi- ence in Pine Ridge exposed me to poverty on the reservation, but at the same time revealed the poverty and economic de- pression present where I live, which-had gone unioticed by me -until now. I believe that these experiences, which pro- vide the human faces and per- sonal stories behind the statis- tics, will give students the moti- vation and energy to continue to integrate advocacy and justice concerns throughout their pro- fessional lives. In order to' prepare future counselors-to incorporate social justice concerns and advocacy into their professional lives, counselor training programs will need to integrate these themes into education, training and experiential learning opportuni- ties. Students in such programs will have a firmer grasp of the magnitude and complexity of how issues such as poverty, homelessness, workers' rights, immigration and women's rights negatively impact the health and well-being 'of individuals. By receiving education on these social, political and economic issues as well as training in advocacy skills, counselors will be more equipped to take on these problems within therapeu- tic relationships employing an ecological systems framework. Drawing from past direct experi- ences working with the margin- alized and oppressed to motivate and reinforce, counselors will also have a realistic understand- ing of what they can accomplish outside of thdir offices and on the streets. One of the first things I learned when studying coun- seling is that positive change does not always occur within a session, it happens outside of it, in the client's life when they are able to put into practice what they have learned in counseling. As a profession, we must realize that if we want to act as change agents within our communities and be a vojce for the voiceless, students must be given enough Upreparation and insight during > training to instill the confidence and hope they will need as coun- selors to stand -up and make a .E difference. .

Subject: Should graduate counseling programs continue to focus on human development and career counseling or shift to emphasize diagnosis and treat- ment of mental disorders? To answer the question of whether graduate counseling programs should continue to focus on human development and career counseling, it is important to understand the fun- damental beginnings and focus of counseling as a profession, aswell as how these factors make counseling unique in the context of the other helping professions. When exploring which topic areas to include in the curricu- lum of a counseling program, it is necessary to determine the goals and focus of the associat- ed profession. Counseling, as a -helping profession, has several cousins that are similar in scope, yet differ in significant ways, such as psychology, psychiatry and social work. According to the American Counseling Asso- ciation website, professional counselors \"work with people of all ages, races, cultural back- grounds and circumstances to help them maximize their potential, make positive changes in their lives and achieve their goals\" (wwwcounseling.org). Specific areas concentrated on by professional counselors in- clude education, career develop- ment and well being across the life span. Counseling differs from psychiatry in that psychia- try is focused on the medical disease model (B.F. Okun, 2002). Counseling also differs from psychology in its focus on development and prevention, rather than treatment of patholo- gy (BE. Okun, 2002). In order for prevention to occur, it is nec-essary to understand the nature of pathology (thus its inclusion in most counseling programs); however, it is against the inher- ent nature of counseling to focus solely on it. When examining the relation- ship between counselor educa- tion programs and career coun- seling as a specialty within the counseling field, it is impossible to ignore the intrinsic history they share. Interestingly, as pointed out by M.L. Savickas (2003), the counseling profes- sion as we see it today was born of what was the field of voca- tional guidance in the early 20th century. Given the occupational demands most individuals face, it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate well being from one's occupational and career experience. The counseling vo- cation grew from the seeds of occupational guidance not by coincidence, but because many of the issues that one faces in the workplace or in making occupa- tional decisions are issues that are pervasive throughout his or her life. As a result, most gradu- ate counseling programs require at best one course in career and lifestyle theory (The author's current graduate program only recommends the Career andLifestyle Development course for those sitting for licensure; however, it is not required for graduation.) It, would be dis- couraging to witness the elimi- nation of a career counseling component to counselor educa- tion programs, as this specialty is fundamental within our field. Therefore, the question should not be whether to maintain the inclusion of career counseling in graduate programs, but how to aid its growth to maintain the integrity of our profession. As the counseling profession began to evolve into what we see today, a focus began to emerge on development and well being. As such, and as was previously noted, counseling programs emphasize normal human development over path- ology, while psychology pro- grams emphasize diagnosis and treatment. As with career coun- seling, when examining the worth and importance of human development as a part of coun- selor education curricula, it becomes a question of the iden- tity of a profession. Greater emphasis on human develop- ment is one of the key areas that sets the counseling profession apart from the other helping professions. Additionally, for proponents of emphasizingtreatment and diagnosis, one additional question must be answered: How do you treat the abnormal until you know what normal development looks like? Human development is de- scribed as \"the multidisciplinary study of how people change and how they remain the same over time\" (R.V. Kail and J.C. Cavanaugh, 2000). The study of human development is unique in that it allows for the exploration of human behavior and growth from a multitude of angles, such as found in longitudinal, cross- sectional and cohort studies. Observing behavior from these perspectives allows for the most comprehensive view of human behavior, allows for recognition of commonalities and a better understanding of the human experience. In addition, many theoretical perspectives such as psychodynamic theory, cogni- tive theory and learning theory have constructs that are applica- ble to both psychopathology and the study of human devel- opment. As such, it is difficult to truly understand one without the other, I recommend that career coun- seling and human development continue to be included in coun- selor education programs, be- cause these two areas of study A A'3 A * A*-. -*- COUPLE COMMUNICATION I & II plus.

Subject: How can counselor training programs better. prepare students to address today's broad range of social justice concerns? \"Never believe that afew car- ing people can't change the world. For indee4 that's all who ever have.\" -Margaret MeadYou do not teach social jus- tice. You do not lecture on it. You do not take tests in it. You live it. You observe the treat- ment of others. You question. You challenge others to ques- tion. You imagine what it feels like to bejudged based solely on what you look like, what you earn, how you worship, whom you love. You search inside yourself and honestly acknowl- edge how you benefit from the privileges of your gender, color, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, physical stature, religion or sex- ual orientation. You examine your own prejudices. We can be a few of the caring people. Our counselor educa- tion programs need to encom- pass addressing social justice concerns and effecting change. Counselors are change agents for their clients and students. We can be change agents for our communities. We should read about social justice. But reading is not enough. We should talk about social justice. But talking is not enough. Counselor educa- tion programs can do more than 1cture on diversity and multi- cultural issues. Reading litera- ture from cultures other than one's own is important. But, it is not enough. Our institutionsshould intentionally fill their programs with a diverse popula- tion of students. We can learn froi working alongside each other. Our pro- grams need to challenge students to explore and question their own convictions first. Addressing so- cial justice concerns means encouraging people to challenge their own belief systems. It is an ongoing, interactive and experi- ential process. The steps com- prise awareness, -open-minded- ness, education, understanding, intention and action. Examine yourself boldly and honestly. Acknowledge your own prejudiced beliefs bravely. How do they disconnect you from others? What do you want to do about them? In her book Learning to Be White: Money, Race and God in America (1999), theologian and minister Thandeka explores the price of admission to being \"inducted\" into whiteness. She writes how white people reserve racial descriptions for those who are not white and learn, as children, that they must uphold and guard the'privileged position of white- ness or risk the loss of affection by caretakers and peers. She pur- ports that white children must learn to separate themselvesfrom their own feelings in order to survive. The result is self- alienation, emptiness and shame. Indeed, being a member of the dominant culture does not pro- tect you. Whether we live as perpetrators or victims of social injustice, we all lose. We do not have to aspire to be Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. or Mother Teresa to change the world. We can be one of a few caring people. What can our counselor educa- tional programs do to immerse students in learning social jus- tice? Social justice can be incor- porated into our current curricu- lum. A professor teaching social justice could encourage her stu- dents to experience their educa- tion and stretch their limits. Imagine that you could choose from the following class projects: * Attend a religious service that is different from your own previous experiences. What did you like and appreciate about it? * Volunteer with an organiza- tion that works for social justice on a grassroots level such as Habitat for Humanity, a home- less shelter, a spouse abuse shel- ter or an organization working with AIDS victims. What do you learn from the people you work with?M Mentor a student at an inner- city school. How is his life dif- ferent from your own? E Spend one day imagining all the ways your life would be affected, and how you would be treated by others, if you were in a wheelchair, blind or deaf. Journal about this. * Learn who your local politi- cians are, and contact them on an injustice issue that touches you and relates to the counsel- ing profession. * Speak up assertively and respectfully when you find a joke or comment socially insen- sitive. How does it feel to take this risk? E Share a traditional meal with someone you know who is from a different country or culture. Learn about some of their cus- toms. What do you like about them? How might doing any one of these experiences, writing about it and processing it with your peers affect you? How might it change you? Our counseing education programs should urge students to be role models of social jus- tice through knowledge, words and actions. Be one of a few car- ing people. Inspire a few more. Our opportunities abound. E PRIVATE PRACTICE: Starting or Expanding? THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO PRIVATE PRACTICE FOR LICENSED MENTAL C.

I remember entertaining many irrational thoughts, such as \"I'm lower than everybody else because I'm different.\" At times, I came to actually believe those thoughts. At other times, I watched TV rather than face my shortcomings. I followed my instincts, thinking that the immi- grant thing to do was to take life's punches, fight to get back up and move forward. I am still trying to find a-con- stant feeling of belonging. I am just a beginner as a counselor, and I hope that I don't find myself screaming into my pil- low over another new culture. I must say that I feel as lost now as I once did as a newcomer to this country. The main differ- ence is that now there is no bully chasing me (at least none I'm aware of). Perhaps it is not surprising that I now feel a strong need to stand up for anyone who is being taken advantage of by a bully. I also feel a need to help those who are ignored. At least now I can say that my English will finally suffice to get direc- tions. I may still be lost at times, but now others can help me to find my way. In my work as an advocate for minority and iimmigrant stu- dents, I recognize myself in their struggles. I am able to pro- vide emotional support for my clients and to share my own experiences. In addition, I chal- lenge my clients to find their own way and not allow society or their parents to, dictate their lives. Nevertheless, I am still learn- ing how to comfort those who have no clear directionsin life. I know that nobody can destroy my belief in myself, which sprung from all the hopes and aspirations of my dear grand- mother, Lola.

Many people believe tattooing and body piercing among young people represent normal desires for attention and individual style. Others think such body modification is a sign of nega- tive underlying tendencies, and past research has linked tattoos and body piercings with drug and alcohol use, unprotected sex, crime, violence, suicide, eating disorders, low self- esteem and body dissatisfaction. Jonathan Roberti and Eric Storch explored the association between body modifications and psychological symptoms among 198 college undergraduates in the Journal of College Counsel- ing (Spring 2005, pages 14-19). Having more than one tattoo or piercing (excluding pierced ears for women) was considered body modification for this study. All the students completed theBeck Depression Inventory and the Trait version of the State- Trait Anxiety Inventory. Stu- dents with body modifications (65 percent of the sample) re- ceived significantly higher scores on both depression and anxiety inventories. The individual's number of tattoos and piercings correlated significantly with levels of de- pression and anxiety, as well. The auth6rs advise that college counselors attend to clients' body modifications as symbolic representations of inner states. Perfectly Rogerian When perfectionism is sepa- rated into two factors -having high standards and feeling a dis- tressing discrepancy between one's performance and one's standards -two types of per- fectionists can be distinguished:High standards in combination with distressing discrepancies characterize maladaptive per- fectionists, while high standards without the distress characterize adaptive perfectionists. These two groups can also be distinguished from nonperfec- tionists, argue Jeffrey Ashby, Simone Rahotep and James Martin in the Spring 2005 Jour- nal of Humanistic Counseling, Education and Development (pages 55-65). These research- ers perceived an association be- tween perfectionism and Roger- ian personality constructs, and tested these by analyzing the responses of the three groups to scales of the Feelings, Reactions and Beliefs Survey (FRBS). The FRBS comprises nine scales reflecting aspects of Carl Rogers' personality theory. Both types of perfectionists scored more highly on ability to focus conscious ittention and on emo- tional sensitivity in relationships than nonperfectionists. Adaptive perfectionists scored higher than the other two groups on the Fully Functioping Person sub- scale, which captures the Roger-ian version of self-actualization, and scored lower than the other groups on feelings of inferiority. These findings are consistent with logical interpretations of perfectionism from a Rogerian point of view. The only scale that distin- guikhed maladaptive perfection- ists from both nonperfectionists and adaptive perfectionists was Feeling Ambivalent in Relation- ships. The researchers construe this finding as maladaptive per- fectionists' desire to have inti- mate relationships and their simultaneous impatience with the time and energy these re- quire. Ashby, Rahotep and Mar- tii discuss the implications for person-centered counseling of perfectionists. Marketing counseling outreach programs College counseling centers usually develop programs for the campus community designed to promote positive behavior, pre- vent problems from developing and educate people about mental health topics. Furthermore, out- reach programs may encouragestudents who otherwise would be reluctant to seek individual counseling to do so when need- ed. However, many counselors become discouraged by the low turnouts for programs they have so carefully designed. In the Spring 2005 Journal of College Counseling (pages 86- 96), Lawrence Marks and Richard McLaughlin provide a useful report on their efforts to discover the best ways -to im- prove student attendance at psy- choeducational presentations.

Rencken's plan as an undergraduate was to be- come a professional Air Force officer. Instead, he became a force in the fields of mental health counseling, sex therapy and school psychology, and a vital contributor to the Ameri- can Counseling Association, the American Mental Health Coun- selors Association and the Ari- zona Counselors Association. Rencken died suddenly on May 12 at the age of 60 in Arizona. In addition to playing a piv- otal role in the creation of both AMHCA and a state division of AMHCA in Arizona, Rencken served as ACA Governing Council parliamentarian in 1995-96 and as president of the Arizona Counselors Association in 1982-83. He became the executive director and confer- ence coordinator of the Arizona Counselors Association in 1985 and held the position for 14 years. He was twice named the AzCA Member of the Year and was honored by AMHCA as its Counselor of the Year in 1986. In addition, he was the first recipient of ACA's Kitty Cole Human Rights Award in 1989, given in recognition of his efforts to recognize and affirm the personhood of all individu- 8 als regardless of race, gender or sexual preference. Rencken -a Certified Clini- cal Mental Health Counselor, a > Licensed Professional Coun- a selor, a National Certified a Counselor and an American .S Board of Sexology Certified Sex Therapist and Diplomate - devoted much of his career tooo advancing counselor credential- ing at both the state and nation- 30al levels. He led the char establish the Certified Cl Mental Health Counselor dential for AMHCA and s on the Clinical Academy oversaw administration o credential. He also was a cated advocate for the up ing of the Certified Profes Counselor credential to Licensed Professional selor credential in Arizona In addition, Rencken member of the ACA Insu Trust and had two books lished by ACA: Interv Strategies for Sexual Abus Briefand Extended Interve in Sexual Abuse. He also c an ACA home study progr counselors about interv strategies for sexual abus presented workshops and nars nationwide concernin ual abuse, incest and chil sexuality.

While working jobs in residen- tial treatment and child guid- ance, he also obtained training in the area of testing and became credentialed as a school psychol- ogist, which he liked to say pro- vided him with his \"day job.\" He served as a school psychologist for the Sunnyside School Dis- trict in Arizona. As his private practice also evolved, his interest in clinical sexology developed, and Rencken took courses at the Institute for Advanced Study in Human Sexuality in San Fran- cisco. From that point on, one of his specialties became helping clients deal with problems relat- ed to sexual abuse. Many of Rencken's colleagues remember him most fondly for his pioneering role in promoting the field of mental health coun- seling and his leadership in help- ing to start AMHCA. \"Bob was an important force behind the early group of mental health counselors,\" said Bill Weikel, a past president of AMHCA. \"He led training workshops and wrote and edited the training manual The Book of AFIHCA. Bob and his wife Kay were present at vir- tually every AMHCA meeting and event. ... He was a gentle giant (Rencken stood approxi- mately 6'4\"), an imposing man with a heart truly of gold.\" Recalled as someone who gave great hugs by Breasure-Herrick, Rencken had another comforting talent especially appreciated by colleagues. \"Late nights in the AMHCA suite,\" Weikel said, \"we would all line up for a shoul- der or foot massage from Bob.\" But Rencken was even more valued for his guidance, Krieger said. \"I was a state president and becoming active at the national level,\" he said. \"The national leadership would gather in the AMHCA suite at midnight. Bob was one of those whose advice and reactions were always sought after while I, a relative newcomer, would sit on the out- skirts of the circle and watch Bob and Dave Brooks calm a rowdy group of young turks with their thoughtful responses and suggestions. Years later, when I was president of AMHCA, I often called Bob for advice and feedback. ... He was one of us who formed a profession out of a dream, and for many years he gave his life to making that dream a reality.\" \"Bob was a very large man with an equally large heart\" recalled Richard Wilmarth, another of AMHCA's past presidents. \"Dur- ing the beginning days of AMHCA, we had a slogan - 'Work hard. Party hard! Bob did both very well. He was a gentleman with exceptional skills.\" Rencken was known for being quick with a joke and for bring- ing levity to almost every situa- tion. Wilmarth recalled a trip that several of AMHCA's lead- ers took to China in 1985 as part of a goodwill exchange pro- gram. \"Bob and I decided to place one of our promotional AMHCA balloons on the Great Wall,\" Wilmarth said. \"We were always trying to promote AMHCA in every way we could. After we had located a site to place the balloon, Bob turned to Bill Weikel and myself and said as he looked at the Great Wall, 'It's a GOOD wall.' If you knew Bob, you surely appreciated his refreshing and advanced humor.\" Weikel concurred: \"Whenever there was work to be done for the counseling profession, Bob was there. Whenever there was fun to be had, Bob was there. The world has lost one hearty laugh, and I have lost a dear and true friend.\" Smith also remembered Rencken's playful nature fondly. \"Bob loved to play with words and often used innuendoes, dou- ble-entendres or perhaps only a pause with a wry look,\" Smith said. 'It gave conversations with him an edge that was entertaining and intriguing as I anticipated his next line. In addition to his well- known sense of humor that was sometimes a bit risqu6 and verg- ing on impropriety, he was one of the most sensitive men I have ever known. He held fervently to such a wide range of dispositions in his quest for life at its fullest. He was a 'quiet' leader, which is a bit of an oxymoron given his raucous laugh and love of a good time. Throughout the 20-plus years of knowing Bob, my re- spect for and value of him as a person, for his judgment and for his understanding of the profes- sion continued to grow. My memory of him is one of my highly valued possessions:' Breasure-Herrick seemed to sum up everyone's feelings about Rencken. \"He loved to laugh and he loved life,\" she said. \"He was one of the best people and counselors I know.\" Robert Rencken is survived by his wife, Kay Stritzel Rencken; children, David and Michele Rencken, Kristin and David Audelo, C.J. Stritzel and Lorca Wood, and Stephen and sister, Dottie Kafalas. E John W. Bloom, a professor in the Butler University School Counseling program and a close friend of the Rencken family, contributed much of the background forthis article.

AMERICAN COUNSELING ASSOCIATION Governing Council adopts resolution on families, reviews ethics code changes BYANGELA KENNEDY In an effort to keep American Counseling Association mem- bers abreast of what is happen- ing in the organization, Counsel- ing Today presents information from the April 2005 ACA Gov- erning Council meeting. Based on the research sup- porting same-sex parenting, a resolution regarding sexual ori' entation, parenting and children was approved by a unanimous vote of the Governing Council. The motion, proposed by the Association for Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Issues in Counsel- ing, stated that ACA opposes any discrimination based on sexual orientation in matters re- lated to creating and maintain- ing families, including adop' tion, child custody and visita- tion, foster care and reproduc- tive health care. \"AGLBIC continues to work at not only supporting and advocating for sexual minority counseling professionals and our straight allies in our work, but also'to continue to identify and discuss important issues that affect the sexual minority community at large, including our biological families and fam- ilies of choice;' said Ned Farley, the division's president. \"In that vein, it became clear to us that with the rising tide of anti-gay 'initiatives around the country, it was time for us to begin using our voices as a professional organization to ensure that the rights of sexual minorities and their families and friends were heard. I am so honored that we have had such strofig voices representing AGLBIC on the ACA Governing Council, in- cluding our current representa- tive, Colleen Logan, whose leadership has encouraged the introduction of this resolution.\" Passage of the resolution cor- roborated the work of AGLBIC and the ACA leadership in pro- moting equity and honesty, both within the field of counseling and in society, he said. Among the items noted in the resolution are that ACA:, 0 Supports and promotes safe, secure and nurturing environ- ments for all children.* Has established policies man- dating that professional coun- selors do not discriminate on the basis of sexialorientation. N Acknowledges that discrimi- nation against gay, lesbian, bisex- ual or transgendered (GLBT) par- ents deprives their children of the benefits, rights and privileges enjoyed by the children of hetero- sexual parents.. E Has reviewed the research indicating that the adjustment, development and psychological well-being of children are unrelat- ed to parental sexual orientation. Other points in the resolution, are as follows: * ACA believes that children reared by a same-gender couple benefit from legal ties to each parent. * ACA shall take an active lead- ership role in opposing all dis- crimination based on sexual ori- entation in matters related to cre- ating and maintaining families, including adoption, child custody and visitation, foster care and' reproductive health services. N ACA' strongly encourages counselors to actively participate in the eliminatioi of all discrim- ination based on sexual orienta- tion in matters of adoption, child custody and visitation, foster cafe and teproductive health ser- vices in their practice, research, education and training. * ACA shall continue to serve as a resource to the general pub- lic as well as to its members, divisions and regions regarding discrimination based on sexual orientation in matters of creating and maintaining .families, in- cluding adoption, child custody and visitation, foster care and rdproductive health services. Samuel T. Gladding, ACA's immediate past president, said, \"In passing this resolution, ACA continues to affirm the value of persons in families everywhere regardless of their sexual orien- tation. We know from the re- search that families are diverse and that one's sexual orientatioh has nothing to do with one's ability to parent in a caring, com- passionate and effective way.Children, parents and. families need to feel safe, supported and secure.\" He noted that the resolu- tion's passage puts ACA on record as standing up for families of same-sex parerits in exercising their basic rights. Logan, past president of AGLBIC, agreed, adding that being part of a united front on this issue is essential for the asso- ciation's progression, reputation and authority. \"It's important for ACA to take a strong stand with the other mental health profes- sional organizations affirming gay and lesbian families,\" said Logan, who was a majorplayer in coordinating and developing the propqsal. \"We, as counselors, are obligated to provide affirma- tive, effective counseling to our gay and lesbian families and clients. We need to be educated on the research, legal issues -and challenges of this population, just as we would With any couple of single person.\" \"This is critical because it pro- vides the foundation,\" she said. 'We are saying that we believe in gay and lesbian families, we affirm gay and lesbian families, and we will provide the best treatment we can.\" She noted that tihe resolution should make GLBT clients feel confident and safe in 'seeking help from ACA counselors. 'We cannot afford to have our voice silent on these important social issues that have a direct impact oh -our clients;' said Mark Pope, ACA president in 2003- 2004. \"Same-sex families and parents need our love and support and help to fight the prejudice that they face. Further, I think we have a moral obligation as pro- fessional counselors, to take on such prejudice wherever it raises its ugly and hateful head. Some counselors cast this in conserva- tive religious terns, but I think they are very far outside of the mainstream in our profession. I do think it is a values issue. We as a profession have said that we value' removing obstacles for individuals to achieve their full potentihl. Our roots historically are allied with the progress of and positive reform for hunianity, not regression. We have a duty to such clients and their families.\"Editor's note: Next month, Coinseling Today will take a closer look at same-sex families, including the struggles and tri- umphs of those within this popu- lation.

He started his career as a school counselor in rural Indi- ana, worked as a counselor edu- cator for 30 years and spent the last eight years working on the Transforming School Counsel- ing Initiative at the Education Trust in Washington, D.C. 'He also worked for several years as an HIV/AIDS activist and edu- cator. I was the last doctoral candi- date of Reese House. Vowing never to read another disserta- tion, House finished a distin- guished career at Oregon State University in 1997 to begin another one with the Education Trust. He left Oregon State to shape the future of school coun- selor education, while I left to be shaped by the very.forces he was initiating with the Transforming School Counseling Initiative. Influenced to become a social advocate, I found embracing thisidentity daunting and often ... frightening. Appreciating sys- temic conflict, enduring person- al and professional criticism, and prevailing when the boat you set sail in is left empty and aground have been interesting to say the very least, and more often than not enlightening. I often remem- bered House's words: \"You are not truly an advocate until you have been fired at least once.\" Spoken like a true warrior of social justice. In preparation for House's retirement, I contacted him sev- eral months ago to arrange an interview. I was curious about his development as a social advocate and his dreams for the field of counseling. I was also hoping, as his last doctoral stu- dent and mentee, for guidance on my own continued growth as an advocate and counselor edu- cator -a final advising session, if you will. The following is an overview of that conversation. It demonstrates the honesty andintegrity House brought to his work as a school counselor, counselor educator and advo- cate for justice and human rights. I believe the interview also embodies the hopes of counselors in becoming agents of social change and of inter- vening in the lives of their clients and within the world around them. Q: What would you describe as key events ia your develop- ment as 'an agent of social change (advocate)? A: I was taught by Mother to question' what was going on. Questioning became a learned way of being in the world in which I interacted. I quickly learned that by questioning, some people tended not to like me. They would rather I accept the status quo rather than chal- lenge it. I found that others who ques- tioned were appealing people to me and discovered allies inlooking at what could be differ- ent rather than what was. Also, Martin Luther King reaffirmed this questioning stance and that advocacy can take place outside of the traditional 'ounseling role. My early training in coun- seling emphasized the counselor as an agent of change, and I found the role to be a natural fit. At that time, the counseling pro- fession adopted the organiza- tional ideas of social change from the race and gender equity movement. As counselor- educators, this task translates to helping trainees' understand how an organization can empower people to act on issues of access and equity. Many students are being system- ically denied access and equity to services based on color, gen- der, etc., where prganizations (for example, schools) view the individual as more important than the system. This is the pri- mary intent of systemic change -to shift from purely an indi- vidual intervention model of change to that of a systemic model. Q: What do counselors need to know when incorporating the role of advocate into their prac- tice and training and when find- ing his orher voice in promoting social change? A: Being an advocate is not only an obligation to the profes- sion and the population we serve but needs to be demonstrated in our personal lives as well. My identity as an advocate is grounded in a personal commit- ment in how best to live the prin- ciples of social change in my own life. What am I passionate about and how do I get involved in changing the status quo? We need to empower the pro- fession and counseling profes- sionals to find a voice that is first and foremost personal. Embrac- ing your identity as an advocate is to view this voice as a priori- ty, to see the value in it and to understand that advocating not only serves the profession and those we serve but also us. It is important that this personal advocacy stems from a place of passion and a genuine belief in the issue. Counselors will be unable to fully accept them- selves as advocates unless the change they are advocating for is deeply personal. Often, the first step is developing a rela- tionship with the idea of being, an advocate. Q: What obstacles were pre- sent in seeing yourself and other counselors become a force in promoting social action and change? I discovered at Oregon State that my colleagues and I had our own kind of advocacy ... unique versions and outlets for the var-ied passions brought into the group by each of us. The diffi- culty was to translate this diver- sity into a common force of energy. Effective advocacy can- not occur in isolation, and coun- selors need to find pockets of people interested in similar is- sues. Change happens when a group of committed individuals reflects on what they believe and uses the energy and resources of the group to initiate change. Q: What is the current climate with regard to advocacy and the present role of school coun- selors? What gaps and issues still need to be addressed? There still exists a gap be- tween counselor education and what school counselors actually do. Schools are changing, and the battlegrounds for change are schools. Every staff member needs to know how to under- stand and improve student achievement for all students. This is the new challenge for school counselors. Within the ASCA (American School Coun- selor Association) Model, advo- cacy, leadership and outreach are emphasized. If school coun- selors could take on this mantle, they would be the leaders need- ed in schools to advocate for all students. However, they are overwhelmed with the personal and social issues presented by students and the demands placed on them by others. We need to develop models that instruct and guide school counselors. We need to increase a dialogue between school counselors and counselor educa- tors to develop a mutual lan- guage on how the practice and trainmng of all counselors needs to change. We also need to use research to inform school coun- selors and school counselor edu- cators on how to better achieve change for the school, faculty and all students. Some counselor educators continue to resist this idea and hesitate in shifting the focus away from a purely mental health model. They have not infused the training curriculum with the passion and skills nec- essary for empowering coun- selors to become social advo- cates of change. A message. needs to be sent to counselor educators that what they are doing in the overall training of counselors no longer fits the needs of schools in the 21st century. Q: What ivere your discover- ies in relation to your own pro- fessional growth as well as to the field of counseling? A: Seeing students get excited about their learning and to become advocates themselves ... generalizing into a lifestyleIn 0 I- ' 0, 34 of interacting with others, both professionally and personally. Also, in being part of shifting counselor education programs to match the purpose of the Educa- tion Trust initiative (Transform- ing School Counseling). This has been a mushrooming move- ment and can be best viewed in the lives of our students and the impact they make in the lives of their students. When you are out there work- ing on \"making a difference,\" you don't realize all of what you are doing. Understanding the bigger picture often occurs well after change has occurred, and even then it can be difficult to fully appreciate, much like see- ing the forest through the trees. What I have discovered from this is to focus only on what I am doing right now and where I am going and not waiver from the vision. Q: What is your hope for counselors and counselor edu- cators/supervisors in reference to social advocacy? A: That counselor education programs do better at screening for people disposed toward the ideas of advocacy from a variety of backgrounds and to take the call for programmatic change seriously ... to reflect on what they are and how they can shift to better train and prepare coun- selors for the social issues addressing the populations that future counselors will be serv- ing. People can be taught to become and embrace them- selves as counselor advocates. Most people have advocated for something in their lives, and we can and must assist them with developing this sense of self, empowering them with the pas- sion, faith and skills to promote systemic change. - We cannot get comfortable with how things are. Learn not only to expect change but to also question \"why not?\" Be in- volved in the process of change rather than (only acting) as an observer. It will have a ripple effect. Finally, advocacy is hot only what we stand for as coun- selors but also who we are. If you believe in the future and a better reality, then you can do it! Conclusion In 1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote, \"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be:' The counseling profession lacks a unified definition and a com- mon focus, which undermines any major efforts 'at advocacy. This interview with Reese House provides a window for profes- sional counselors to glimpse what can be and suggests a uni- fying voice through an identityof social change. This begins by becoming acquainted with the \"idea of being an advocate.\" It is an idea House has demonstrated in both his personal commitment to AIDS research and interna- tional education and to profes- sional action for challenging counselor educators to shift their training practices. Embracing this idea also requires having a willingness to question the status quo, identifying a group of com-mitted allies, having faith that systemic change is inevitable and compassionately commit- ting to an identity as social action and economic justice ad- vocates. Translating the diverse nature of the counseling field into a common force of energy needs such an idea. A friend retired last month.

The col- umn directed attention to King's call to \"remain awake during a great revolution.\" We noted that this message has particular rele- vance for multicultural-femi- nist-social justice counseling advocates who continue to pro- mote new paradigms that are revolutionizing our thinking about the way helping profes- sionals can more effectively, respectfully and ethically oper- ate in our culturally diverse, 21st-century society.By exploring the relevance of King's philosophy and teachings for the counseling profession, we hope new and untapped aspects of your own multicultur- al competence will be stimulated as you gain a greater awareness and knowledge of the vital inter- connections that exist between human development, profession- al counseling and a socially responsible approach to mental health care. This month's col- umn is designed to: E Increase your awareness of King's evolution as a multicul- tural-social justice advocate. a Underscore the importance of embracing a broad definition of multiculturalism. * Highlight some of the im-portant social, moral and politi- cal issues counselors need to address to more effectively fos- ter the psychological develop- ment, mental health and person- al well being of larger numbers of persons who come from diverse groups and backgrounds in our contemporary society. King's perspective of the mental health professions Many people primarily iden- tify King as a champion of civil rights for African-Americans. However, a closer examination of his personal and professional evolution indicates that he became increasingly aware of the unique interconnections, strengths and needs of persons in other marginalized groups as well. This growing understand- ing is explicitly reflected in King's later writings and speeches. He frequently re- ferred to the unique strengths and plight of poor white per- sons, women, Jews, Muslims, farmers in rural America and the large number of youths who experienced a heightened senseof alienation and hopelessness during the 1960s. As King expanded his under- standing of the unique strengths and common challenges that people in these diverse groups experienced, he gained new in- sights about human develop- ment, mental health and psycho- logical distress. These insights led him to articulate a number of things he believed counselors and psychologists had to do to more effectively promote the psychological and spiritual well being of persons from devalued cultural groups in our nation. Among the specific recom- mendations that King stressed for mental health professionals: * Not remaining silent in the face of social scientific evidence pointing to the various ways that individuals' mental health is negatively affected by the vari- ous forms of social injustice and cultural oppression rooted in our societal institutions. * Actively working to eradicate the complex problems of racism and classism that continue to be perpetuated in our nation. 60 hours of Approved CE Certification course in Six Days NBCC provider #5460 * Experiential training with ready-to-use skills NASW provider #886422919 * Begin using the methods with your clients immediately Dramatically grow your practiceNBCC & NA* Be a specialist, receive referrals from other professionalsAPPROVED B Benefit from more word-of-mouth referrals Distance CE * Increase your hourly rate Each Help clients make rapid progress with: Author -Journal 'a- compulsions/addictions * stress-related codependency * sexual abusefrom the =5brs Victim Trap Holistic approach to healing, combining: * developmental psychology * humanistic psychology Diane Zimberoff, Licensed MFT * hypnotherapy * behavior modification FounderoftheInstitute For 25 years as therapist and teacher, Diane has travelled the world learning to combine physical healing,e o t i o n a THE WELLNESS Copenhagen Aug 16-21 psychotherapy, andspiritual growth.

King described the important roles that mental health profes- sionals can play in addressing all these issues during his keynote address at the American Psycho- logical Association's annual con- vention in Washington, D.C., in September 1967. In doing so, he presented his vision of the need for counselors and psychologists to take a more socially responsi- ble and politically active stance in promoting the mental health needs of our entire nation. This vision challenged mental health practitioners to embrace new roles and responsibilities as help- ing professionals. The new roles and responsibilities King urged mental health practitioners to incorporate into their work would lead them to implement professional services that went beyond helping individuals to learn better ways of adjusting to the existing status quo. The socially responsible vision that King advocated included coun- selors and psychologists becom- ing positive social change agents who would intentionally strive to transform the organizations and institutions that constitute our societal infrastructure as they helped to build a more just and sane society. Many mental health profes- sionals, both then and now, resist the wisdom of King's call for a socially responsible ap- proach to mental health care. They commonly argue that the fields of counseling and psy- chology should avoid address- ing social-political issues and instead maintain a position of \"value neutrality\" when provid- ing services to clients. But their position continues to be challenged by numerous other persons in the profession. Many multicultural, social con- struction and postmodem coun- seling experts point out that everything we say and do re- flects various values that are consciously and unconsciously embedded in our individual and collective constructions of reali- ty. These experts also assert that \"value neutrality\" is a modern myth that is impossible toO -0 o0 I- implement in anything we do personally or professionally. Growing recognition that it is impossible for any of us to oper- ate from a position of \"value neutrality\" has led an increasing number of counselors to become more cognizant of the values that they implicitly promote in their work. Increasing aware- ness of the myth of value neu- trality not only complements King's vision of a socially responsible approach to mental health care, but it is also implic- it in many of the multicultural counseling competencies that the American Counseling Asso- ciation has formally endorsed. Acquiring the competencies that enable us to attain aware- ness of how and when we are imposing our personal and pro- fessional values on others is no easy task. The difficulty in doing so becomes even more challeng- ing when we embrace a broad and inclusive definition of mul- ticultural counseling. Embracing an expanded, inclusive definition of multiculturalism It is interesting to note that King's own evolution in becom- ing a more inclusive social jus- tice advocate paralleled the development of the multicultur- al counseling movement. It is well-known that the genesis of the multicultural counseling movement can be traced to cer- tain African-American theorists and researchers. They described the many ways in which tradi- tional counseling and psycho- therapeutic interventions were not only ineffective but even harmful when used among Black clients. These ineffective and harmful outcomes typically occurred when Black persons received counseling services primarily focused on promoting intrapsychic changes for prob- lems that frequently could be traced to toxic environmental conditions. Among the environ- mental conditions identified as having particularly adverse psy- chological effects on African- Americans were the various forms of racial injustice, dis- crimination and oppression per- petuated where many Black clients lived and worked. The revolutionary and liberat- ing spirit that characterized the onset of the multicultural move- ment was reinforced shortly thereafter by the work of other counseling theorists, researchers\"It is well-known that the genesis of the multi- cultural counseling movement can be traced to certain African-American theorists anid researchers. They described the many ways in which traditional counseling and.psychot hera- peuticr interventions were not only ineffective but even harmful when used among Black clients.\" and social justice advocates from Asian, Latino/Latina and American Indian decent. Their work led to a tremendous expan- sion in our understanding of group differences, strengths and needs that characterize persons from a broader range of ethnic- racial groups and backgrounds. The evolution of the multicul- tural-social justice counseling movement did not however, stop here. During the 1970s and 1980s, we witnessed increasing demands for a more inclusive definition of multiculturalism among persons in other devalued \"cultural\" groups in our society. Such demands were most notably made by women's and gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgen-dered counseling advocates. Even more recent calls have been made for the inclusion of older adults, individuals with disabili- ties and persons from Jewish, Muslim and other religious/spiri- tual groups in an expanded defi- nition of multiculturalism. We have endorsed the impor- tance of embracing a broad def- imtion of multiculturalism on several occasions in the past in this column. In doing so, we have outlined an expansive mul- ticultural framework that we call the RESPECTFUL Coun- seling Model. RESPECTFUL Counseling is an acronym that highlights 10 factors counselors are encour- aged to keep in mind as theystrive to implement culturally competent helping strategies that reflect an expanded and inclusive definition of multicul- turalism. The factors in this the- oretical framework emphasize the importance of attending to counselors' and clients': R -Religious/spiritual identity E -Economic class background S -Sexual identity P -Psychological development E -Ethnic/racial identity C -Chronological disposition T -Trauma and other threats to their personal well-being F -Family history U -Unique physical character- istics L -Language aid location of residence, which may affect the helping process In addition to promoting a broad and inclusive definition of multiculturalism, the RESPECT- FUL Counseling framework is also grounded in a social justice perspective closely aligned to King's philosophy and teach- ings. The RESPECTFUL Coun- seling model emphasizes the t I Si -IK *1~~>14,., ,4$important role that counselors can play in addressing those social-political-environmental factors known to adversely impact the psychological devel- opment and mental health of mil- lions of people who identify with the model's framework. Promoting intellectual honesty, socially responsible practices Multicultural and social jus- tice counseling researchers have been particularly helpful in expanding our understaiding of the adverse impact that specific types of toxic social-political- environmental conditions have on pedple's lives. These re- searchers have described how racism, sexism, classism, able- ism, heterosexism and other types of cultural oppression result in negative physical and psychological outcomes for mil- lions of persons in marginalized and devalued groups in our nation. A growing body of empirical Continued on page 38 :~IN/W TWWVt 1% 7 tLI-aelvd L I 37 Dignity, Development & DiversityContinued from page 37 evidence in the social sciences suggests that King was indeed accurate when he pointed out that social injustices and cultural oppression represent unique forms of psychological, eco- nomic, structural and spiritual violence that undermine peo- ple's mental health. Given the abundant evidence of the many ways in which social injustice and violence undermine healthy human development, it is diffi- cult to understand why some persons in the counseling pro- fession continue to argue against the need to implement the sort of socially responsible counseling strategies that King called for during his lifetime. In light of the growing empiri- cal evidence that supports many of King's claims about the vital interconnections between a just society and the psychological health of its inhabitants, we sug- gest the time has come for open and honest discussion about the need for counselors to incorpo- rate more socially responsible approaches into their profession- al practices, We have outlined a number of resolutions we believe are consistent with King's phi-losophy and teaching about men- tal health. These resolutions also conplement the spirit and princi- ples of the multicultural-femi- nist-social justice counseling movement -a movement that continues to have a tremendous impact in transforming the coun- seling profession. We hope the following reso- lutions will stimulate open and honest discussion about the need for the counseling profes- sion to become more socially responsible in its practices. We also hope members of the ACA Governing Council will consid- er the possibility of formally endorsing these resolutions in our professional organization. In doing so, they would not only help to realize King's vision of a socially responsible mental health profession but also stimulate new ways of thinking about the counselor's role in promoting human devel- opment and dignity by fostering a greater level of justice, peace and sanity in our culturally' diverse society. Resolution #1: Given the substantial body of empirical knowledge that describes thenegative effect that religious bigotry, violence and discrimi- nation have on human develop- ment, it is resolved that the socially responsible approach to mental health care that Martin Luther King Jr. advocated is necessary to eradicate these toxic social-environental con- ditions in our society. Resolution #2: Given the substantial body of empirical knowledge that describes the negative impact that racism continues to have on human development, it is resolved that the socially responsible ap- proach to mental health care that Dr. King advocated is nec- essary to eradicate this com- plex, toxic, iocial-environmen- tal condition in our society. Resolution #3: Given the substantial body of empirical knowledge that describes the negative impact that sexism and sexual violence continue to have on human development, it is resolved that the socially re- sponsible approach to mental health care that Dr. King advo- cated is necessary to eradicate these toxic social-environmental conditions in our society.Resolution #4: Given the substantial body of empirical knowledge that describes the negative impact that ableism continues to have on human development, it is resolved that the socially responsible ap- proach to mental health care that Dr. King advocated is necessary to eradicate this toxic social- environmental condition in our society. Resolution #5: Given the substantial body of empirical knowledge that describes the negative impact-that heterosex- ism and violence against gayllesbian/bisexual/transgen- dered persons continue to have on human development, it is resolved that the socially re- sponsible approach to mental health care that Dr. King advo- cated is necessary to eradicate these toxic social-environmental conditions in our society. Resolution #6: Given the substantial body of empirical knowledge that describes the negative impact that ageism continues to have on human development, it is resolved that the socially responsible ap- proach to mental health care thatDr. King advocated is necessary to eradicate this toxic social- environmental condition in our society. Resolution #7: Given the substantial body of empirical knowledge that describes the negative effect that poverty has on human development, it is resolved that the socially re- sponsible approach to mental health care that Dr. King advo- cated is necessary to eradicate these toxic social-environmental conditions in our society. Resolution #8: Given the substantial body of empirical knowledge that describes the negative effect that war has on human development, it is re- solved that the socially respon- sible approach to mental health care that Dr. King advocated is necessary to promote peace and to end all wars in our world.

The Executive Board of the Association for Creativity in Counseling met in May and discussed plans to begin a rigorous assessment of the research and clinical inter- ests of our membership. We hope to help members with like- minded interests collaborate and support one another in their pro- jects. Indeed, the diversity with which creativity can be ex- pressed and experienced in our counseling practices is far- reaching. ACC's commitment is to provide a forum for coun- gelors, counselors in training and counselor educators to speak to the immeasurable ways we access both our creativity and that of our clients. No doubt, such access brings vigor, excitement and wonderful pos- sibilities to our work. Please let us hear from you by contacting Dana Comstock at dcomstock@satx.rr com. We will also be sending an electron- ic survey to the membership with respect to research and clinical practices, and will pub- lish our findings by fall. Our hope is to explore the creative interests of our membership and to identify the scope and prac- tice of our membership. This project is in keeping with ACC's stated mission to provide an opportunity for counselors and counselor educators to work together on the diverse ways that creativity can be used in counseling. Additionally, the ACC Board will be creating grant opportu- nities for members interested in researching the varied practices of creativity in -counseling. Heather Trepal (heather trepal@utsa.edu) will organize this effort. We also look forward to the upcoming launch of ACC's Journal of Creativity in Mental Health, published by the Haworth Press Inc. As the editor of JCMH, I am very excited with our progress in bringing this new journal to you. Given that a myriad of steps come into play in establishing such an effort, the logistical process of establishing the journal is, in fact, a creative one! I will keep you posted on bur progress. The journal is sure to include informative, innovative and prac- tical sources of information for students and professionals in theareas of counseling and coun- selor education. We are currently accepting manuscript submis- sions for upcoming issues of JCMH. Visit our website at wwwaca-acc.org for more infor- mation. We are especially seek- ing submissions that describe how creative interventions can be used in the service of facilitating growth-fostering connections and productive, mutually sup- portive relationships. In addition, we are seeking movie and book reviews for our cinema and bib- liotherapy columns. Again, I offer my sincere appreciation to our membership for helping make our launch as a division a success. You have been amazing. Thank you for helping us lift our vision to a place of action and for helping create a collaborative culture where relationships, diversity and innovative ideas are valued. I look forward to being in touch. Please let us hear from you. Cre- ativity at its best comes in the connections we share and in the collaboration we enjoy. ACCA highlights its achievements, activities Submitted by June Williams jwilliams@selu.edu The American College Coun- seling Association has had an extremely productive year and is looking forward to the future for even more activities that benefit college counselors throughout the country. First, I would like to recap some of the major devel- opments that occurred in the past months and highlight some of the major activities and areas of focus for the upcoming months. Among the major accom- plishments in 2004-2005 are the following: * Last fall, we launched two online courses for college coun- selors: \"A Creative and Collabo- rative Approach to Test Anxiety Counseling\" by Joyce R. Thomas and \"Ethical and Policy Issues When Dealing With Sui- cidal Behavior on the College Campus\" by Perry C. Francis and Mary Jeanne Raleigh. * In addition, we arranged to provide continuing education credit for reading the Journal of College Counseling. * ACCA agreed to co-sponsor Robert Gallagher's 2004 Na- tional Survey of Counseling Center Directors, which can be accessed from our website at www.collegecounseling.org. * In conjunction with theLouisiana Counseling Associa- tion, we co-sponsored the first regional drive-in workshop. This very successful venture featured ACCA's own Keren Humphrey, who volunteered to present two workshops, \"The T-F-D Model for Counseling\" and \"Adaptive Grieving Styles.\" * The ACCA Executive Coun- cil voted to allot $5,000 to sup- port research in the area of counseling and college student retention. * In response to suggestions and requests by numerous ACCA members, a bylaws change was approved at our an- nual business meeting to allow ACCA-only members (those who do not also belong to the American Counseling Associa- tion) to be voting members. 1 As we look to the future, some of our immediate goals and projects include the follow- ing: N Planning for our third ACCA national conference to be held in Reno, Nev., from October 3-6, 2006, at John Ascuaga's Nugget Casino Resort. A call for pro- grams has recently been sent out, and we are actively seeking quality proposals. Visit our web- site for more information. * Providing additional online CEU opportunities. Please con- tact us if you have ideas for pos- sible workshops. * Continuing to forge collabo- rative relationships with related professional organizations. Offering idditional regional drive-in workshops in conjunc- tion with state divisions. * Providing more information and networking opportunities to connect ACCA members who are job searching with organiza- tions and institutions that are seeking college counselors. * Continuing to update our website with information for and about college counseling. In addition to these areas of specific focus, rest Issured that the ACCA leadership is commit- ted to continuing to provide qual- ity services, activities and prod- ucts for the membership. There are many, many ACCA members who volunteer their time and tal- ents to support our mission. If you are one of those people, thank you for your contributions. If you are not, thank you in advance for your future contribu- tions. Now is 'the time to get involved. Accept the challenge!ACES to debut expanded conference format Submitted by Paige Bentley pbentley@triadrr.com The heart of counseling is cre- ativity and change in response to changing needs. The 2005 Association for Counselor Edu- cation and Supervision National Conference reflects this truth not only in its theme, \"Creativi- ty and Change in Counselor Education and Supervision' but also in its format. Earlier this year, ACES lead- ership recognized a need for an expansion of the traditional con- ference format to include more opportunities for interaction and exchange of ideas. \"We are see- ing so many great ideas among counselor educators and super- visors for how to move the pro- fession forward,\" said ACES President James Benshoff. \"We wanted to provide a forum that would promote both the sharing of these ideas and the generation of new ones.\" With that goal in mind, this year's conference will include roundtable discussions and poster sessions in addition to the traditional 50-minute workshops. In all, almost 600 programs will be offered. \"We hope that the addition of the roundtable dis- cussions will spark even more discussion and creative thinking about where the profession is going -and can go;' Benshoff said. \"Because of the variety of program topics on the schedule, we anticipate that participants will come away with a wealth of new ideas, models and tech- niques to incorporate into their work:' Some of the topics that will be offered include technology in counselor education, experien- tial approaches to training coun- selors, counselor development and multicultural issues in coun- selor education and supervision. Because conferences also are a time to network and enjoy the company of other counselor educators and supervisors, par- ticipants can look forward to a number of informal activities throughout the main conference. 'Two featured events include a reception on Thursday night at Duquesne University and a Pres- ident's Reception on Saturday night. In addition to other events, time will be available for explor- ing Pittsburgh with friends and colleagues. Additional programs are planned for more intensive learning and growth prior to themain conference. Two half-day workshops will be offered on Wednesday, Oct. 19, from 1-5 p.m. \"The Rewards of Mentor- ship: Keys to Success\" will pro- vide students and counselor edu- cators alike insights into how to create and enhance mentorship relationships. \"The Education Trust: Transforming School Counselor Preparation\" will explore changes in the prepara- tion of school counselors. A Women's Retreat will be held from 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 18, until 1 p.m., Thursday, Oct. 20. This will be held offsite at the Gilmary Diocesan Center, a retreat center nestled in the woods three miles west of the Pittsburgh airport. More infor- mation on this retreat and the half-day workshops is available online at www.acesonline.net. The 2005 ACES conference will be held from Oct. 20-23 in Pittsburgh. \"Super Saver\" dis- counts are available through Aug. 30. ACES members can save as much as $75 off the onsite registration fee. Special hotel rates have been guaranteed through the Pittsburgh Marriott City Center and -the Ramada Plaza Suites ' Pittsburgh (to become a Doubletree Hotel after Aug. 1).

N LettersFrom page 4 boundaries of professional ethics and gave a platform to views that were completely inappropriate for a professional journal. Currently, my response to that article is under editorial review by the JCD. Some have argued that anti- Christianity,- and in particular, anti-Catholicism -is the last acceptable prejudice. It would appear that in the publications and perhaps even the pervading culture of the otherwise radical- ly inclusive ACA, this unfortu- nate sentiment is alive and well. Perhaps counselors of various faith traditions would do well to question whether their member- ship dollars should continue to support an organization with so little regard for their beliefs. Gregory K. Popcak Executive Director Pastoral Solutions Institute Steubenville, Ohio -aOn a 41 Resource Reviews Diversity and Development: Critical Contexts That Shape Our Lives and Relationships Edited by Dana L. Comstock, 2005, Belmont, CA: Thomson Brooks/Cole, 368 pages, $66.56, ISBN 0-534-57406-8. This text uses the diverse individual journeys of its contributors to explore hu- man development in the sociocultural con- text of privilege and oppression, largely through the lens of Relational Cultural Theory (RCT). The editor uses compar- isons with traditional theories early on, providing a foundation from which to judge the validity of arguments presented throughout the text. In this way the editor organizes the topics and chapters toward the reflective capacity of the reader. The text fulfills the promise of personal courage through vulnerability and coura- geously shared stories of raciallethnic development and relational growth across the life span. The authors provide com- pelling arguments and, more importantly, hope to individuals seeking their own per- sonal and professional development as well as a greater voice and alliance with others. Readers are offered multiple op- portunities, through introspection, to accept and challenge their own relational and cultural insensitivities. Readers cannot help but be moved from the position of political correctness to the stance of per- sonal compassion, which, in the words of one author, becomes the foundation of social justice and professional advocacy. The editor has presented a text that is very accessible even if one is not trained in RCT. The text's style and structure are informative, conversational-and engaging. As offered by Dana Comstock in her pref- ace, \"Our value systems regarding what constitutes mental health and 'normal' development are made up of prejudices, assumptions and ideologies that have been taught to us, both overtly and covertly ... racist and sexist ideologies permeate the social structure to such a degree that they have become hegemonic, namely seen as natural and normal and inevitable.\" The editor does an exceptional job of develop- ing transitions that centralize the guiding point: that encouraging a blanket adoption of mainstream values ends up promoting mainstream prejudices. Thus, the intent of the text is to shift one's thinking away from traditional models of human devel- opment toward growth-fostering relation- ships. This is done to bring the reader to an awareness that considering multiple iden- a tity convergence is essential in the concep- o tualization of -inclusive and culture-cen- tered counseling practice. The early chapters take issue with the E limitations of traditional lifespan develop- ment theories while providing a credible foundation for material presented in subse- ap quent sections. Each chapter that follows delves deeper into the myths, stereotypes and stigmas associated with established 0 theories of \"normal\" development and beckons readers toward critical thought 42 and reason. The text continues with broadand integrative chapters on the critical developmental contexts of both women and men. The book centers not so much on the knowledge gained from the individual chapters and stories of others but rather on the personal integration and development of the reader, who is challenged to better understand her or his own life. Comstock brings into balance the per- sonal and professional voices of her con- tributors and creates an impressive instruc- tional tool to help others establish and maintain growth-fostering relationships necessary for psychological well-being and emotional resilience over the life span.

Community Genograms: Using Individual, Family and Cultural Narratives With Clients By Sandra A. Rigazio-DiGilio, Allen E. Ivey, Kara R Kunkler-Peck and Lois T Grady, 2005, New York, NY Teachers Col- lege Press, 140 pages, $50 (clothbound), $26.96 (paperback), ISBN: 0-8077-4553-7. This book illustrates how to use the community genogram to help clients and counselors discover ways in which indi- viduals and families fit into wider contexts of community and culture. The authors developed the community genogram by building on the concept of family genograms, adding the contexts of com- munity and culture to the traditional appli- cation of systems theory. Their goal is to help clients recognize positive assets across all contexts and apply these in ways that enhance their lives. By co-creating their community genograms, clients are moved to identify their goals as well as the specific components that contribute to their experiences in the world. The authors present three applications of the community genogram. First, as an assessment tool, the genogram helps clients and their counselors identify which influences and interactions with family, neighborhood, community agencies and sociopolitical forces are contributing to one's current experience. The objective is to understand the individual or familyclient in relation to wider contexts in terms of past, present and future goals. The com- munity genogram may also be applied as an intervention strategy. By broadening the focus to include contexts of communi- ty and culture, clients can uncover blocks to personal goals, reframe their personal stories and find empowerment to explore new avenues for change. Finally, the com- munity genogram' can be used to docu- ment client progress over time. The book illustrates several ways of graphically organizing and interpreting community genograms using case exam- ples. Suggestions for graphic organization are presented, but the authors stress the genograms should be designed in ways that are meaningful for each client. To assist practitioners7 in developing personal expe- rience, insight and famil- iarity in working with this tool, the authors encourage readers to create their own community genograms through a series of practice questions and exercises. Chapters outline the different types of information that can be generated by using community genograms. Examples of the different uses discussed in the book include exploring the client-in-relation, identifying strengths and cultural influ- ences, exploring boundaries and power, identifying themes across the life span, and creating interactive assessments and treatment plans. In summary, this book presents a prac- tical tool for exploring the complex nature of human relationships across the broader spectrum of community and cul- tural interactions. The authors offer an expanded view of empathy, which en- compasses not only a genuine under- standing of the individual perspective but of family, community and cultural per- spectives as well. This resource would be of interest to individual, family and school counselors who wish to add an effective, culturally responsive tool to their repertoire. Most importantly, this tool can benefit clients' understanding of themselves in relation to wider contexts. It offers clients a way to develop insight, hope and empowerment.

Nichols, 2004, New York, NY Guilford Press, $15.95, 229 pages, ISBN 1-57230-284-4. Few parents would say they enjoy argu- ing with their children, yet they would likely concede it is a far too common occurrence in their households. Michael Nichols walks parents through an easy-to- follow approach to stop those arguments by using responsive listening. Nichols introduces parents to the con- cept early in the book and sprinkles exam- ples throughout to show parents how the approach can be used. From ways to stop arguments before they begin to methods to inspire cooperation in children, the author uses plain language to get his point across. Understanding that what works with a 3- year-old may not pass muster with a 16- year-old, the author relates the use of responsive-listening to children who are at different developmental levels. Explaining how to look for the message behind the whining and complaints, Nichols encour- ages parents to listen in a manner they have likely underutilized. Nichols acknowledges that all children are different, and parents must learn that what has worked with one child may not work with another. Encouraging parents to take into account their children's unique personal style, he reminds them that the parents' job is not to mold their children into what the adults think their children should be but rather to support them on their journey to who they will become. Being a parent is not easy, and few other responsibilities come without training or a manual to which one can refer. Nichols does not pass responsive listening off as something that parents can easily master. He acknowledges that the process is a change in thinking and actions that takes time and dedication. He explains a sys- temic perspective of family interactions so that readers can grasp how change in any one part of the system -notably, how they react to their children -encourages change in the total system. This book is written for parents but would make an excellent resource ,for counselors who teach parenting courses or who work with parents to enhance their communication and relationships with their children. School counselors might also use the information to assist teachers who struggle with classroom management issues. Finally, all readers can benefit from the reminder that the way we listen to and show respect for the speaker can be the first step in improving our relationships with others, including our children.

Yet the Department of Defense (DOD) does not allow Licensed Professional Counselors to practice independently in TRICARE, the military health care system, or in DODfacilities. LPCs are the only men- tal health professionals required to practice under physician referral and supervision. The House of Representatives has passed language establishing independent practice authority for counselors as part of the Fiscal Year 2006 bill authorizing defense spending. At press time, the Senate Armed Services Committees had yet to approve this provision. Congress is aiming to put the finishing touches on the FY 2006 \"National Defense Authorization Ace' by midsummer, so it is vital that counselors contact their senators to urge adoption of the House-passed provision for independent reimbursement of coun- selors. Although every counselor should weigh in on this issue, it is especially vital for counselors to call if they are constituents of members of the Senate Armed Services Committees. To see if your lawmakers are on the committees, visit http://anned-services.senate.gov/. Who to Contact Your Senators Capitol Switchboard 202.224.3121 www.senate.govMessage \"As a constituent, Pim calling to ask you to support Senate passage of a House-passed provision in the defense authorization bill to give soldiers easier access to mental health services provided by Licensed Mental Health Coun-' selors. The House defense authorization bill will allow independent practice authority for mental health counselors instead of requiring soldiers to see their doctor before they can see a counselor. The current physician referral and supervision requirement for Licensed Professional Counselors is inconsistent and outdated; the other master's level mental health professionals were granted independent practice authority 15 or more years ago. Increasing access to services is especially important considering that as many as one in three soldiers will return from Iraq with symp- toms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Many Guard and Reserve members don't live near a military base, making access to mental health providers in their own community vital to their decision to seek treatment. I'd like to hear back on what the Senator will do on this issue. Can I give you my contact information?\"ACA Resource Scott Barstow 800.347.6647 site: http://capwiz.com/counseling Appropriations for the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Program For the fourth year in a row, President.George W. Bush has proposed a budget that would eliminate funding for the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Program. ESSCP is the only federal program focused solely on supporting counseling programs in our nation's schools, and its elimination would mark the end of counseling and men- tal health services to thousands of students in the 99 school districts in 32 states and the District of Columbia currently receiving funds. While in years' past Congress has continued to fund ESSCP despite the president's lack of interest, the Fiscal Year 2006 battle to fund the program may be our hardest yet, given the unprecedented spendiiig cuts in domestic non-defense programs being considered. Therefore, it is imperative that concerned counselors take action now. Call or write your members of Congress to lexpress your concern about President Bush's proposal to eliminate funding for the Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Program in his FY 2006 budget. Who to Contact Your Senators and Representatives Capitol Switchboard 202.224.3121 www.house.gov www.senate.govMessage \"I'd like the Senator/Representative to reject Bush's proposal to eliminate funding for the Elemen- tary and Secondary School Counseling Program in Fiscal Year 2006. In addition, I strongly urge the Senator/Representative to support sufficient funding to allow middle and high schools, as well as elementary schools, to benefit from this program. ESSCP is the only federal program devoted to supporting counseling pro- grams in our nation's schools.

Although the Senate passed counselor coverage legislation in 2003, the House has not. We need Represen- tatives to know that Medicare beneficiaries need better access to mental health services and that Licensed Professional Counselors stand ready to help them. Seniors deserve the same choice of provider under Medicare as is enjoyed by private-sector beneficiaries. In many communities, LPCs are the only accessible mental health providers. Sadly, older Americans remain the demographic group most at risk of committing suicide. Who to Contact Your Representatives Capitol Switchboard 202.224.3121 www.house.govMessage \"I'm calling to ask the Representative to sponsor and support legislation to establish Medicare coverage of mental health services provided by Licensed Professional Counselors. Legislation accomplishing this -the 'Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act' -was passed by the Senate in 2003 and has been reintro- duced this year by Sen. Craig Thomas as S. 784. There is not yet a House bill to establish coverage of Licensed Professional Counselors, and I urge you to consider sponsoring such a bill. Licensed Professional Counselors meet the same level of education and training standards as other mental health professionals long covered by Medicare, and covering counselors is a cost-effective way to address the devastating problem of mental illness among the elderly, which contributes to older Americans being the demographic group most at risk of committing suicide?'ACA Resource Scott Barstow 800.347.6647 4) U $4.4 4) t j [1 La 0 C N U F- 0, C 0, C 0C) S. t 47 AATBS aCOUNSELING EXAM PREPARATION PROGRAMSA Tes W V_4156i 5j I/ r cY Independent Study Programsmn MA National Clinical Mental Health Counselor Exam Preparation $279 X INCLUDES: *Three Study Volumes, featuring 14 practice vignettes Z * Two Motivational Audio Cassettes * Expert Study Help Additional Study Tool Current enroillmnent in ab Independent Study Programn required for purchase.
