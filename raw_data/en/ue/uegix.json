This includes 8 million doses administered onsite to long-term care facilities in the early days of the COVID-19 vaccination program. - A total of 21 retail pharmacy partners are participating in the program, with more than 41,000 locations nationwide. This includes long-term care pharmacies. The Federal Retail Pharmacy Program (FRPP) for COVID-19 Vaccination is one part of the federal government's strategy to ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines for the American public. Pharmacies are readily accessible in communities - with most Americans living within five miles of a pharmacy. Recognizing this, the federal government made pharmacies a key part of its COVID-19 vaccination strategy. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccine is free of charge for everyone. Increasing the number of places where people can get vaccinated for COVID-19 will help ensure more people are protected, ultimately helping us end this pandemic. The FRPP is designed to use the strength and expertise of pharmacy partners to help rapidly and conveniently vaccinate the American public. Through the program, certain participating retail pharmacies nationwide receive COVID-19 vaccine supply directly from the federal government, and then provide vaccinations to eligible individuals at no cost. The program relies on collaborations between public health agencies (CDC, state, local, and territorial health departments) to encourage individuals to go to pharmacies and get vaccinated. Community outreach remains critical to educating people about the importance of vaccination and where vaccines are available nearby.
