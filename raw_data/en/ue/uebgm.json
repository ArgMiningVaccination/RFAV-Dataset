A blend of certified organic restorative herbs in organic black sesame, avocado, rose-hip and jojoba oils with organic essential oils. Responsible - Ibu Ayurveda are passionate about protecting our planet and avoiding more plastic ending up in landfill and oceans. Their packaging is biodegradable and made of post-consumer recycled, and recyclable, materials wherever possible. This includes bamboo, glass and recycled/sustainable cardboard. Ibu Ayurveda products are vegan friendly, cruelty-free, 100% natural, and contain certified organic ingredients wherever possible. The products are formulated by naturopaths and hand-crafted locally in small batches by skilled professionals using sustainably sourced therapeutic-grade herbs and herbal extracts, nutrient dense plant oils, essential oils, floral hydrosols, and biogenic flower and gem essences. The scent of the oil was BEAUTIFUL! It really stood out from all the other oils because of the citrine gem essence. The essential oils, like it's promise, made me feel grounded and restored balance during times of stress. This is especially important for women managing business or a busy homelife! The smell of this delicious oil makes me feel like I'm relaxing in a private spa salon. It's a rich, inviting smell that means I don't need to wear perfume, and the oil soaks in very quickly and easily. I especially like that this product is created by naturopaths, and there is emphasis on recycled and sustainable packaging where possible. There's something about this oil that takes me on a magical journey and brings me back again grounded and restored. Thoughtfully and intentionally crafted from the highest quality oils and restorative herbs, my skin laps it up. Incredible. I like how original this product is. I have never put oil in the bath before! What gorgeous packaging and branding! I absolutely love the subtle fragrance of this divine body oil: like peaches and tangerines. Presented in a beautiful glass bottle with a wooden joiner and easy to use pump, this oil disperses easily and absorbs slowly but surely (which I love). I also ove that this oil has been formulated using Ayurvedic principles: to support one of the three 'doshas'. It contains a heavenly blend of withania (also known as Ashwagandha aka the Indian ginseng), Indian sandalwood, black sesame oil, rosehip and avocado oils. "}
