By staying up to date with vaccines before and during pregnancy, you can pass along immunity that will help protect your baby from some diseases during the first few months after birth. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention 3 Source: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/growing/images/global/CDC -Growing -Up-with-Vaccines.pdf Prenatal Immunization Education: What Vaccines Do I Need During Pregnancy? Recommended Vaccines: -Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (whooping cough vaccine) During the third trimester of every pregnancy (between 27th and 36th week of pregnancy, preferably during the earlier part of this timeframe) -Yearly seasonal flu vaccine Before or during pregnancy By the end of October, if possible U.S. CDC recommends flu vaccination as long as flu viruses are circulating - even into January and later Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention 4 Source: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/growing/images/global/CDC -Growing -Up-with-Vaccines.pdf Vaccines Right After Birth and During Breastfeeding It is safe to receive vaccines right after giving birth, even while you are breastfeeding. Be sure to discuss each vaccine with your healthcare professional before getting vaccinated. Postpartum vaccination will help protect you from getting sick and you will pass some antibodies to your baby through your breastmilk. Vaccination after pregnancy is especially important if you didn't receive certain vaccines before or during your pregnancy.

Your child is exposed to thousands of germs every day in his environment. -This happens through the food he eats, air he breathes and things he puts in his mouth. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention 6 Source: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/infographics/strengthen -baby -immune -system.html Babies are born with immune systems that can fight most germs, but there are some deadly diseases they can't handle. -That's why they need vaccines to strengthen their immune system. Prenatal Immunization Education: Why Does My Baby Need Vaccines? Some diseases that vaccines prevent remain common in the U.S. -Pertussis (whooping cough) -Chickenpox Other diseases are no longer common in this country because of vaccines. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention 7 Source: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/diseases/index.html However, if we stopped vaccinating, even the few cases we have in the U.S. could very rapidly become tens or hundreds of thousands of cases. How Vaccines Work: The Basics Vaccines use very small amounts of antigens to help your child's immune system recognize and learn to fight serious diseases. -Antigens are parts of germs that cause the body's immune system to go to work. More than one dose is necessary for many vaccines, to build and boost immunity. Because influenza viruses are constantly changing and the body's immune response declines over time, everyone over age 6 months needs a flu shot every year.

Vaccines contain only a fraction of the antigens that babies encounter in their environment every day.

On-time vaccination throughout childhood is essential because it helps provide immunity before children are exposed to potentially life -threatening diseases. U.S. CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Childhood Immunization Schedule is set by ACIP. ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) is made up of medical and public health experts who develop recommendations on the use of vaccines.
