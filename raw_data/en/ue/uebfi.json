Best Air Purifier Green Air Encore HEPA and Odor Fighting Filter Air Purifier Courtesy of Amazon View On Amazon When air quality is a top priority, spend a little more to get an air purifier with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Because HEPA is officially defined by the U.S. Department of Energy, standards are high.

For scale, a human hair is about 30 to 70 microns thick. Green Air Encore Air Purifier uses a three-stage system that includes a washable mesh pre-filter, an odor fighting filter, and a true HEPA filter. Covering up to 1000 square feet, it is non-ozone-based, which means that it does not, like some \"air purifiers,\" generate and use ozone to clear the air of particles. It's Ion Cluster Technology attracts water molecules to airborne particles, making them theoretically easier to filter.

Price at time of publish: $319 Final Verdict No matter what odor is ruining your mood, there several natural and environmentally-friendly remedies. Improve the air in the space with a Smelleze Pouch, or in a pinch, light a Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Candle. What to Look for in a Natural Odor Eliminator Fragrance Most fragrance chemicals are not disclosed, so you really can't be sure what you're getting. No federal law exists to require disclosure or public safety of fragrance ingredients, and the International Fragrance Association lists 3,059 materials that are used in fragrances. Some of these have been linked to cancer and reproductive toxicity, so if you're concerned about what's in a product, avoid those that have the vague term \"fragrance\" listed on the label. Essential Oils Essential oils are fragrance ingredients of natural origin, but many still cause reactions in sensitive or allergic individuals. If you tend to react to strong odors, you may want to avoid products that contain essential oils. Fragrance-Free These products are the best choice for anyone who is sensitive to any strong odor--good or bad. Fragrance-free products means that masking scents are not used in the product. Unscented means that the product may contain chemicals that neutralize or mask the odors of other ingredients. Why Trust Treehugger?
