Detox can be used as a spot treatment instead of a full face mask Can I use Detox or Soothe with Superfruit? Do they do the same thing? Both Detox and [Soothe](https://www.threeshipsbeauty.ca/collections/masks/products/soothe-rosehip-vitamin-c-clay-mask) contain Kaolin Clay which pulls dirt and impurities deep from within the skin. [Superfruit](https://www.threeshipsbeauty.ca/collections/masks/products/superfruit-exfoliating-mask) will exfoliate the surface of the skin while the actives resurface and brighten the skin tone. If using both in your routine, we recommend using Superfruit 2x per week and either Detox or Soothe 1x per week. How do I create the best mask consistency with Detox? Take your desired amount of clay powder and slowly add a few drops of water to get the desired consistency. For a thinner mask, use slightly more water. Can I only mix Detox with water? No! Detox can be mixed with a toner for an extra clarifying face mask, or you can mix it with an oil serum for added hydration. How many times a week should I use Detox? We recommend using Detox 2x a week. If you have oily skin, you can increase it up to 3x per week, and if you have dry skin, you can decrease it to 1x per week.

Customer Reviews - Reviews - Questions - skin - mask - pores - face - times - water - breakouts - consistency - Three - results feels squeaky clean after My skin felt super clean after just one use. I like to use it with the superfruit right before. Love, love, love I was so pleasantly surprised by this product! Initially, I thought the mixture was too watery, but it quickly dried and became a beautiful mask. Used this the night before being in a wedding, along with the under eye masks, and felt ready to go for makeup the next morning! Perfect for spot treatment Skin feels so refreshed and smooth after just one use. I typically use as a spot treatment for hormonal acne and it works great! Don't need to use all the time and it lasts longer. "}
