If policies are not well designed andimplemented the consequences can be serious, for example, public servicesmay be of poor quality or not meet users' expectations and those intended tobenefit may not do so or groups in society may be excluded (Figure 1) . 2 High quality public services depend on departments designing and implementing cost effective policies.

Risk to value for money If the information base underlying the business case for the project delivering the policy is unrealistic, the policymay cost more than expected. If options are not tested to determine whether they work in practice the option selected may be difficult orimpossible to implement or it may be delayed or costmore than expected. If what is expected of those responsible for implementing a policy is not assessed and managed,costs may be higher than expected and policy outputsnot delivered. If a long-term view is not taken of how users' needs might evolve over time, changes in conditions mightdecrease the usefulness of the chosen policy or make itrapidly obsolete. If a plan for implementation has not been tested and drawn up to cover resources required to implement thepolicy successfully, it is unlikely that everyimplementation requirement will be available at theright time, or a viable solution may be delayed or failbecause the necessary resources are not available whenneeded.Example The main cause of the financial difficulties of the Dome was the failure to achieve the visitor numbers andincome required. The targets were ambitious andinherently risky which inevitably meant a significantdegree of financial exposure. The result of skimping at the start by allowing inadequate time for specifying the requirement andpiloting was delay and wasted money on the BenefitsPayment Card Project. With the National Probation Service Information System poor specification of expected outputs, weaknesses inservice monitoring and inadequate control by the HomeOffice contributed to the higher than expected cost ofthe programme. For the BOWMAN communication system, the Ministry of Defence was unable to take full account of the effectwhich the rapid pace of technological change, and thecorresponding increase in users' expectations, wouldhave on demand. Many of the risks associated with implementation of the new passport system had been identified at theplanning stage. But the risks and the response requiredhad not all been realistically assessed, and when thingsbegan to go wrong the Passport Agency's plans provedinsufficient. Several factors interacted to produce acrisis in public confidence in the Agency. Risks which if not given sufficient attention in policy-making can result in poor value for money2 POLICY IMPLEMENTATION The process of testing different policy options and putting the chosen option into effect.

The Department of Social Security failed to publicise a change in the law about the State Earnings RelatedPension Scheme (SERPS) and gave misleadinginformation to the public for more than a decade. Continuing backlogs of applications for citizenship, asylum or extension of stay in the United Kingdomcaused enormous personal distress to hundreds ofthousands of applicants and their families. The HomeOffice's contingency planning when things started to gowrong was inadequate. Prioritisation of resources for dealing with hospital acquired infection was restricted by the lack of basic,comparable information about rates of hospital acquiredinfection. It was not possible to quantify the business benefits derived from the introduction of the National ProbationService Information Systems Strategy. Costs andachievements had not been monitored againstprojections in the original case. The number of broken rails on the railway network had increased since privatisation in 1996.

The Centre for Management and Policy Studies of the Cabinet Office work with the civil service, the public and private sectors and academia to ensurethe civil service is cultivating the right skills, culture andapproaches to perform its task; to ensure policy-makers haveaccess to the best research and evidence and to helpgovernment learn better from existing policies. The nine key characteristics of modern policy-making Policy should: !Be forward looking !Be outward looking !Be innovative and evidence !Be inclusive !Be joined up !Evaluate !Review !Learn lessons Additional measures taken by the Passport Agency to deal with the delays in issuing passports in the Summer of1999 cost some \u00a312.6 million. The failure by the Department of Social Security to introduce the Benefits Payment Card cost some \u00a3127 million in nugatorysystems development. Some \u00a32.5 billion was spent on BSE related schemes between 1996 and 1998 arising from the pressure on the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Intervention Board toprotect public health and support the beef industry followingstatements in March 1996 about possible links between BSE incattle and a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans. Source: National Audit Office reports3,4,5A B C5executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY 3 The Modernising Government White Paper (Cm 4310) published in March 1999 emphasised that policy-making was too fragmented and risk averse witha focus on the achievement of short-term rather than long-term objectives. TheWhite Paper concluded that departments paid too little attention to the policyprocess and the way it affected their ability to meet the needs of citizens. 4 The Centre for Management and Policy Studies (CMPS) were formed as part of the Cabinet Office in June 1999 to promote improvements in policyformulation (A). For example, by making it more evidence-based, giving greater focus to output achievement and learning lessons through systematicevaluations. In September 1999 the Cabinet Office published \"ProfessionalPolicy Making for the Twenty First Century\" setting out nine key characteristicswhich policy-making should aspire to (B). This was followed in November 2000 by a survey of senior civil servants in departments to identify the extentto which policies were being developed in accordance with thesecharacteristics, including examples of innovative approaches, and what theyconsidered to be the main issues in modernising the policy process. Thefindings were published in \"Better Policy-Making\" by the Cabinet Office'sCentre for Management and Policy Studies in November 2001. 5 Policy-making is often necessarily a complex undertaking. Events frequently require a quick response for example, the floods of September 2000. Citizensare better informed and have rising expectations of what policies shoulddeliver, for example 24 hour access to advice about health. Policy issues canswitch rapidly from the domestic to the international arena for example, theimpact of BSE on the international market for British beef. And new forms ofjoint working between departments, local government and the voluntary andprivate sectors and new forms of service delivery are being developed to tackleissues such as drug abuse and social exclusion. Where policy proposals arelikely to impose costs and benefits on business, charities or voluntaryorganisations policy-makers are expected to carry out a regulatory impactassessment, an aspect of the policy process examined in the National AuditOffice report \"Better Regulation: Making good use of regulatory impactassesments\" 2. Policies also have to take account of international requirements such as treaty obligations and European Union commitments. 6 Policy-making involves reconciling conflicting priorities and risks through analysis and judgement to arrive at the most cost effective option and todetermine the management required to implement and maintain policies overthe longer term so that sustainable outcomes such as improvements in health,education, law and order and transport are achieved. The costs of failing toidentify the flaws in policy design and implementation and not learning lessonsfrom previous policy initiatives can be substantial 3,4,5(C). Accounting Officers of departments and other public bodies are now required by the Treasury toreport annually in a published statement that they have reviewed the controlsin place in their organisation for identifying the principal risks to theachievement of the body's policies, aims and objectives, for evaluating thenature and extent of those risks and for managing them efficiently, effectivelyand economically. 7 There are often many factors and risks which can influence whether a policy will be successful or not. This report examines how departments manage therisk of policies not achieving their intended outcomes and not delivering valuefor money. The report is intended to help promote improvements in policy-making by identifying examples of good practice. We examined four policies(Figure 3) reflecting the different circumstances which departments most often face. We also drew on twelve other examples of policy-making from local 2 NAO Report: Better Regulation: Making good use of regulatory impact assessments (to be published in November 2001) 3 NAO Report: The United Kingdom Passport Agency: the passport delays of Summer 1999 (HC 812,1998-99).4 NAO Report: The Cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card project (HC 857, 1999-00).5 NAO Report: BSE: The Cost of a Crisis (HC 853, 1997-98).Policies examined in this report The Department of Health's Meningitis C vaccination programme - a policy anticipating a specific social health need which wasimplemented rapidly (Appendix 2).

In addition we interviewed senior staff in five departments to explore how risk andvalue for money feature in the policy-making process. Part 2 of the report covers policy design and Part 3 the implementation and maintenance of policies. Designing policies (Part 2) 8 A single uniform \"one size fits all\" approach to policy-making is not practicable because of the range of factors - social, economic,environmental - which departments have to respond to. Departments needto adopt a flexible policy-making approach involving four key elements. 9 Identifying the need for a policy (D). Departments have to be forward looking to reduce the risk of something unexpected suddenlyhappening which requires immediate action and thus limits theirscope to consider a range of options. Departments should havereliable and comprehensive information including research intocitizens' preferences or what is likely to influence them to changetheir behaviour. If departments misjudge likely behaviour, thoseintended to benefit from a policy may reject it. Professor Hogwoodof Strathclyde University in the paper 6at Appendix 1 emphasises the need to give sufficient attention to human behaviour in policy design.Based on reliable data departments should consider a range ofdifferent circumstances - scenarios that might arise in terms of whenand what a policy may have to respond to. In the departments weexamined, we found that the use of scenario planning was limitedbecause they often lacked the specialist expertise to apply it. 10 Policies can have an indirect impact on other policies either in the same department or other departments and organisations. ProfessorHogwood concludes that policies are best considered as packagesinvolving several programmes delivered by a mix of central, local,voluntary and private organisations. The need for a policy cannot beconsidered in isolation - a portfolio management approach tomonitor and consider the interconnection between different policyneeds and how they are met is important. This can help avoidresources being misdirected, one policy working against another, orlessons not being learned. We found no examples in the departmentsincluded in this study of the interconnection between policies beingregularly reviewed. Early warning indicators ranging from increasesin letters from the public to detailed analyses of trends in theincidence of diseases or increases in demand for social support areimportant for alerting departments to the need for a new policy or foran existing policy to be modified. 11 Understanding the nature of the problem . Sound analysis is central to understanding the nature of the issue requiring a policy response(E). Comprehensive epidemiological information, for example, enabled the Department of Health to determine how best toimplement the Meningitis C vaccination programme (Figure 4) . Without sound analysis a policy may be based on amisunderstanding of the problem, resulting in misdirected effort andpoor value for money. A prerequisite of sound analysis is, however,having reliable data and staff with the appropriate research andIdentifying the need for a policyrequires: !Forward looking thinking. !Reliable comprehensiveinformation. !Assessing sometimes needs. !Being able to respond quicklyto unforeseen events. !Having early warning indicators. !Drawing on existing knowledgeand experience. !Consulting stakeholders. !Understanding the needs of theclient group. The report Adding it Up - Improving Analysis and Modellingin Central Government published by the Performance and InnovationUnit in January 2000 identified aneed for policy-makers to makemuch greater use of the 1,800specialists (economists, statisticians,social researchers) employed bydepartments. MODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY 6 Beyond Muddling through - Can analysis assist in designing policies that deliver? - Professor Brian Hogwood of the Department of Politics - University of Strathclyde- Appendix 1 to this report.D E7executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Designing policies to achieve intended outcomes cost effectively: The Department of Health's Meningitis C vaccination programme4 Having the right information The Department had comprehensive epidemiological evidence from the Public Health Laboratory Service to assess the likelyevolution of the disease, the best time to implement thevaccination programme and who to vaccinate first to maximiseits impact. Assessing cost effectivenessThe Department assessed the costs and the likely benefits of immunisation by commissioning a cost-benefit analysis. Thecosts and benefits of the programme compared well with otherpossible forms of health care intervention, confirming that theprogramme was likely to represent value for money. Managing stakeholdersThere was a risk that the pharmaceutical industry had no incentive to develop an effective Meningitis C vaccine with onlylimited global commercial opportunities. The Departmentdemonstrated to the pharmaceutical companies theircommitment to the programme thus reducing some of thecommercial uncertainty. Analysing optionsThe Department recognised that if they were to run the programme without the risk of vaccine shortages sufficientstocks would have to be built up. To do so would delay theprogramme by one year but epidemiological data suggested thatdelay would result in 1,500 further cases and a possible 150deaths. To avoid this the programme was brought forward byone year and the Department managed the risk of insufficientsupply by analysing a range of implementation options and byadopting a two stage approach.Planning implementation The Department ensured that the programme was administered effectively in primary health care centres, schools and collegesby commissioning individuals with knowledge and experienceof similar campaigns to identify the levels of support that wouldbe required and by basing their planning on detailed statisticalinformation about the likely incidence of the disease and thosemost at risk. Having early warning indicatorsThe Department relied on ten immunisation co-ordinators, nursing professionals and pharmacists to provide weekly statusreports on the supply and distribution of the vaccine to giveearly warning of implementation problems, such as whethersupplies of the vaccine had not been received from thedistributors as expected. Managing the supply chainThe Department exercised tight management over the supply of the vaccine from manufacture to distribution so that they knewwhen and how many children they could vaccinate in differentparts of the country and in different age groups. By day to daymonitoring of the manufacturers and distributors theDepartment ensured that they had precise and up to dateinformation on the supply of the vaccine, so that they couldadjust the numbers scheduled for vaccination if necessary. Managing demand and public expectationPublic confidence in the programme was secured and demand for the vaccine managed by making explicit to the publicthrough an integrated information campaign, includingtelevision advertising and promoting the programme instudents' colleges, that those at most risk from the diseasewould be vaccinated first and others would be vaccinated asmore vaccine became available.In response to the impact and growth of Meningitis C the Department of Health (the Department) in July 1999 announced the devel opment of a new safe and effective vaccine and a vaccination programme with the objective of reducing the greatest number of cases and de aths from the disease in the shortest possible time. The programme was implemented one year ahead of schedule. The Department delivered some 18 million doses of the vaccine between November 1999 and December 2000 and co-ordinated their wor k with some 29,000 schools, 100 health authorities and around 30,000 General Practitioners. The vaccination programme was the lar gest since the introduction of the polio vaccine in the 1950s, cost some \u00a3300 million and involved a complex pattern of stakeholders. In designing the policy the Department adopted the following good practice: More detail about this case study is provided in Appendix 2. Source: National Audit OfficeImpact The Meningitis C vaccination programme has achieved the following impacts: \"The successful distribution between November 1999 and December 2000 of 18 million doses of vaccine sufficient for every child under 18 years of age; \"In the six months to December 2000 a 90 per cent reduction in the number of cases in the under one year old and15 to 17 year old age groups; \"In the six months to December 2000 a 75 per cent reduction in the number of cases across all age groups; \"In the six months to December 2000 the saving of around 50 lives; and \"Raising public awareness about other forms of Meningitis through the health promotion campaign.8executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Understanding the needs of the client group The Women and Equality Unit's policy to encourage more women tobecome entrepreneurs involvedstakeholder analysis so that policywas designed to provide supportwhen women said they most neededit. (More detail is provided in Appendix 5). An example of piloting different approaches is the Department forWork and Pensions' testing of the\"ONE\" service intended to increasethe proportion of people ofworking age in employment andnot dependent on benefit. Thepilots are testing alternativedelivery mechanisms, for exampleuse of call centres for advice andproviding personal advisors for theunemployed.analytical skills. Web based technology makes it much easier to access a range of information from across departments and also from research institutions andthink tanks. The use of the internet and internal intranets is increasing butdepartments need to make greater use of this source of data. Departmentsshould have in place well developed strategies which determine their longerterm information needs and how and in what form such data should becollected. 12 Assessing the nature of the issue a policy is intended to address also requires analysing its main components so that departments can target their interventionon these. In the case of the Department for Education and Skills' NationalLiteracy Strategy there were many potential causes of the low level of childliteracy - social background, size of class, standards of teaching. Throughcareful research the Department identified that targeting resources onimproving the skills of teachers to teach literacy was likely to have the mostimpact and be the most cost effective use of resources (Figure 5) . Departments also need to understand the characteristics of the client group which policiesare intended to benefit by consulting all those who have something to gain orlose from a policy (F). Having identified the key issue a policy should focus on, a business case should be prepared setting out as a minimum the range ofpossible policy options considered, an assessment of their resourceimplications, who will be responsible for implementation and an assessment oftheir capability, who is intended to benefit, and the risks associated with thepolicy and how these will be managed. 13 Assessing how policies are likely to work in practice is a crucial stage in policy design because it should identify practical constraints which need to beovercome if policies are to be successful; it can help to develop more accurateestimates of the likely cost and impacts of policies; it can provide opportunitiesto modify policies if necessary to avoid any group of society intended to benefitbeing excluded; and it can help to determine whether policies are likely torepresent value for money and whether their benefits are likely to besustainable in the longer term. Departments we examined use a range ofapproaches to assess whether policies are likely to work in practice, forexample, piloting to test policies (G); formal consultation with intended beneficiaries and other stakeholders; regulatory impact assessment; andpreparing analyses about the impacts and costs of different policy options. 14 Involving those who have to implement and evaluate a policy in its design is key to assessing how practical a policy is likely to be. We found, however, thatthose required to implement and evaluate policies were consulted fairly late inthe design process. If they are not consulted those responsible forimplementation may have only half-hearted commitment to the policy andmore practical solutions may be missed. Departments we examined recognisethese risks although they consider more progress is needed to integrateimplementation and evaluation questions more fully into policy design. This isparticularly important where responsibility for policy design, implementationand evaluation is split between a department and an executive agency or wherea policy cuts across government with a range of departments and agencieshaving a role. F G9executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Implementing a policy cost effectively: The Department for Education and Skills' National Literacy Strategy5 Using research to identify the problem They analysed international research about literacy teaching to understand the options for improving the teaching of literacy, todesign the teaching that was most likely to deliver improvementsin literacy, and to identify that high quality training provision forteachers was the crucial factor for securing teachers' support forthe Strategy. Testing options to learn what was cost effectiveThey reviewed the impact of different approaches to teacher training to identify which schools needed more intensivetraining and which would need more basic training materials.Learning from the testing of teaching materials enabled them tolaunch the policy with a clear and rapid timetable forimplementation. Planning implementation They published an implementation plan for the Strategy setting out how the Department would manage the Strategy and theresponsibilities and deadlines for all those involved - theDepartment, local education authorities, schools, headteachers,teachers, pupils, parents and the Office for Standards inEducation (OFSTED). Managing barriers to change They tackled barriers to implementation head on, such as a potential resistance to change from teachers responsible forimplementing the Strategy in schools. The Department adopteda \"high challenge - high support\" approach by settingchallenging standards for teachers whilst providing support toimprove teachers' skills.Marketing the Strategy to implementers They used a highly visible programme of visits which involved regional literacy directors explaining the Strategy to localeducation authorities, headteachers and teachers and receivingfeedback on how it was being implemented. For example,conferences were held for primary headteachers and Governorsin every local education authority to deliver briefings about theStrategy and training materials. Introducing flexibility They secured the support of teachers implementing the Strategy by identifying the need for high quality training and teachingmaterials for teachers. The teaching materials were modified onthe basis of testing and feedback from trialling the Strategy in300 schools, and on the basis of subsequent feedback fromteachers. Securing a change in the culture of teaching literacy They changed the way in which teachers taught literacy and secured their longer term commitment to the Strategy byencouraging a culture where schools and teachers recognisedthe benefits the Strategy can bring in terms of the continuingprofessional development of teachers, and better planning andmanagement of teachers' time. More detail about this case study is provided in Appendix 3. Source: National Audit OfficeIn the mid-1990s, there was strong evidence that standards of literacy in children and in the adult population in the United Ki ngdom were unacceptably low. In 1996, only 57 per cent of 11 year olds reached the literacy standards expected of children of their age. L iteracy in the UK has been a persistent, long-term problem, with UK adult literacy levels during the mid-1990s below those of most European co untries and Australia, performing similarly to the United States. In September 1998 the Department for Education and Skills (the Department) introduced the National Literacy Strategy (the Strat egy) in all primary schools. The aim of the Strategy is to improve standards of reading and writing through more effective teaching and man agement of literacy in primary schools. This is underpinned by a national target that by 2002, 80 per cent of 11 year olds will achieve th e standards expected for their age in English (measured by National Curriculum Key Stage 2 test results). The Strategy advises 190,000 primary school teachers to dedicate at least one hour to teaching literacy each school day to thre e million primary school children. Specific guidelines about how the teaching of literacy can be organised are set out in a \"Framework for Teachi ng\". 350 local literacy consultants support schools in implementing the Strategy through provision of training, training materials, and more i ntensive training for those schools which need it most. The Strategy has cost up to \u00a3100 million a year since 1998-99. In implementing the policy the Department adopted the following good practice : Impact It remains too early to evaluate the long-term effect that the Strategy will have on standards of reading and writing. National Curriculum Key Stage 2 test results in English for 2001, however, showed that 75 per cent of 11 years olds reached the expected level for their age group compared to 65 per cent in 1998. 15 Consulting stakeholders is also important in testing whether a policy is likely to work in practice. It is crucial, however, that departments consult all majorstakeholders. If only well organised stakeholders are consulted those who areless well organised may become marginalised because they may not be able toexpress their views so effectively. The departments we examined were generallyless convinced about the value of involving outside stakeholders in the designand testing of policy options. This is because at this early stage a departmentmay not be fully committed to the policy and involving outside stakeholdersmay raise expectations or public criticism in cases when a pilot initiative doesnot work. Fear of leaks and premature publicity may also inhibit the range ofconsultation with stakeholders that would otherwise be useful. 16 Identifying and assessing risks to performance and delivery . Key to managing the risk of policies not being successful is departments assessing the capabilityof those required to implement policies. These may be staff within thedepartment, a separate agency or a private or voluntary sector partner. Forexample to tackle the risks of capacity constraints that might affect delivery ofthe \"Transport 10 Year Plan\", which provides for \u00a3180 billion investment in newand improved transport infrastructure and services, the Department forTransport, Local Government and the Regions are working with the constructionindustry and other suppliers to identify and meet any skill shortages. 17 A further risk is that those intended to benefit from a policy do not do so. Minimising this risk requires ensuring that a service is accessible and all thoseintended to benefit from it understand what the policy is intended to achieve. Thisrequires careful communication. For example, the Department of Health inimplementing their Meningitis C vaccination programme were, through a targetedmedia campaign, successful in managing the public's expectations and fears aboutthe risks to health from Meningitis C (Figure 4) . A policy may also have an unintended impact. For example, the policy to make public services available electronically is driven by the opportunity to provide better quality services by them being more easily accessible, being available more quickly and at a time more convenient to citizens. There is the risk, however, that those who are less familiar with new technology or are disinclined to use it may be excluded from the benefits. The risk of unforeseen consequences is common to all policies and it emphasises the importance of departments consider- ing very carefully the ways in which policy benefits can be delivered, given the variability of citizens' awareness of policies and their access to information systems, and the impact policies might have on their behaviour.MODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEYexecutive summary 1011 executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Typical problems during implementation include: !Overambitious time scales; !Those implementing clearly defined. Source: National Audit OfficePolicy implementation and maintenance (Part 3) 18 Implementing policies requires careful consideration of the resources needed, the time period over which the policy is to be delivered and how the quality ofthe desired outcomes is to be achieved and maintained. Any potentialconstraints such as the capability of information technology systems and staffexpertise should be identified and resolved. A policy may need to beimplemented rapidly which inevitably has greater risk, or it may be a longerterm policy where to have the desired impact modifications need to be madeover time to maintain the policy's relevance. How a policy is to beimplemented and evaluated should be an integral part of policy design. Poorvalue for money and under-performance often occur because implementationhas not been well thought through and planned (H). Policy implementation is more likely to be successful if departments have a well developedimplementation plan; identify and manage risks; exercise reliable projectmanagement; and have a clear communications strategy. 19 An implementation plan should as a minimum set out the timetable for delivering a policy, the roles and responsibilities of all those involved indelivery, the resources allocated to the policy including money, skills, andinfrastructure, how potential barriers are to be tackled and how performance isto be reported and monitored to ensure appropriate accountability. Anassessment of a policy's implementation critical path can help identify the keystages in delivering the policy so that these can be organised efficiently orwhere there are potential problems corrective action can be taken. Forexample, one factor in the implementation of the Department of Health'sMeningitis C vaccination programme was ensuring that manufacturers couldsupply sufficient vaccine when needed (Figure 4) . H12executive summarySainsbury's have two teams which are on continuous stand by withbusiness continuity managementas an integral part of their jobwhich they put into practice in theevent of a crisis (more detail isprovided in Appendix 12).MODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY 20 The risk faced by any policy should be identified and assessed during its design and this should be followed through to implementation when risk monitoringand management are essential. When departments enter into agreements withother organisations, both private and public, to implement policies and deliverpublic services they need to take great care in the allocation of risks - inparticular where the services are those on which citizens depend directly (a National Audit Office report to be published in December 2001, \"Joining Upto Improve Service Delivery\", will highlight good practice in joint working, tohelp departments who are considering such arrangements). If risks areinappropriately transferred to a party who is not best placed to manage the risk,then service delivery to citizens may suffer. Reliable project managementrequires setting key targets and milestones for achieving critical stages inimplementing policies, having reliable monitoring information to assessprogress and indicators to alert managers to under-performance requiringremedial action. 21 Communicating to the general public and other stakeholders, such as the business community, international trading partners, and lobby groups what apolicy is about, what it is seeking to achieve and what the targeted client groupcan reasonably expect is important in ensuring the success of policy.Departments are seeking to simplify public access to information about theirpolicies through the use of websites and national helplines. Departments weexamined recognise, however, that they need to improve the marketing ofpolicies. For example, information is not necessarily reaching those at whomthe policy is directed, and members of the public seeking advice can beconfused by the complexity and variety of government programmes. Policy maintenance 22 The circumstances which policies are designed to respond to are inevitably subject to change. Policy maintenance is about adapting to change. Forexample the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs introducedthe Arable Stewardship Pilot Scheme to test the effectiveness, practicality andlikely cost of modifying existing policy to tackle the loss of wildlife habitats thathad been caused by changes in arable farming practices (Figure 6) . Departments need to be able to maintain service delivery when somethingunexpected occurs which knocks a policy off course; they need to reviewpolicies, for example to determine when the time is right to modify a policy inresponse to changing circumstances so that it remains relevant and costeffective; and departments may need to terminate policies if they are no longercost effective or they are not delivering the policy outcomes intended. Dealing with the unexpected 23 Events can occur such as a natural hazard or breakdown in key systems which result in departments not being able to deliver a policy as intended with theconsequence that the well-being of citizens is put at risk. Departments have tobe well prepared to deal with such eventualities. They can do this in variousways for example, by having contingency arrangements such as implementedby Sainsbury's to keep their supermarkets open and well stocked during thefuel shortages in Autumn 2000 (I). It is not normal practice for departments to have contingency arrangements in place unless a policy is considered to behigh risk. The departments we examined are giving more attention tomaintaining services to the public as a result of the greater emphasis on theidentification of risk in the design of policies. I13 executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Adapting a policy to meet changing requirements: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' Arable Stewardship Scheme6 Getting the right information Without information about wildlife on arable land the Department could not have identified the type of scheme tointroduce. To address this risk they reviewed researchcommissioned by the Department during the 1980s and 1990son the reasons for the decline in wildlife and reviewed researchprepared by three national bodies with an interest inconservation and wildlife habitats. Testing a range of optionsThe Department had to strike a balance between testing as wide a range of options as possible to find out what might work andwhat might be attractive to farmers, and limiting the range ofoptions so that enough information could be collected abouteach option to test in sufficient depth its likely effectiveness. Managing stakeholdersThe Department built on research proposals for the scheme put forward jointly by three organisations in October 1996 - EnglishNature, the Game Conservancy Trust, and the Royal Society forthe Protection of Birds (RSPB). These three organisationssubsequently became partner organisations with theDepartment, helping to market the policy to farmers andencourage applications for the scheme. Analysing optionsThe Department were under pressure from their partner organisations to introduce options that would deliver the bestenvironmental benefits in terms of improved habitats for birdsand wildlife. If the Department had included options thatmaximised environmental benefits but were difficult or costly toimplement this would have discouraged farmers from applyingto participate in the scheme. The Department struck a balancebetween management options that were likely to maximiseenvironmental benefits and would be cost effective to operate. Managing implementation The Department faced the risk that if farmers did not apply the management options to their land as intended, the effectivenessof the various options would not be clear, and money wouldhave been wasted. To counter this risk, the Departmentappointed two Project Officers in each pilot area. Their role wasto launch and operate the scheme, by providing practical,technical and administrative help to farmers implementingdifferent management options. Assessing cost effectivenessThe Department needed to know if better environmental benefits could be secured by paying farmers more and whetherpaying more for some land management options might improvefarmers' take up of the options in the pilot scheme. Tounderstand what would provide value for money in terms of thecost effectiveness of different management options, theDepartment commissioned an economic evaluation of thescheme. Balancing policy requirements The European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy requires the Department to ensure that any scheme which providesincome to farmers is transparent and that compliance with EUrules can be verified. To address this the Department: !Examined the enforceability of compliance whendesigning the options to be included in the pilot scheme. !Made transparency and ease of understanding of theoptions a key feature of the pilot. !Worked backwards from when they wanted to introducethe scheme and built into their timetable sufficient time toconsult the European Commission. More detail about this case study is provided in Appendix 4. Source: National Audit OfficeFarmland bird populations have been declining from the mid-1970s. Birds are regarded as good indicators of the broad state of w ildlife and the countryside, because they are supported by many different types of habitat, and tend to be at or near the top of the food c hain. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (the Department) identified that changes in arable farming practices had led to a loss of wildlife habitats and contributed to the decline in the populations of a number of species of birds, insects, mammals and plant s. In response to this problem, the Department introduced the Arable Stewardship pilot scheme. The aim of the pilot scheme was to test the effectiveness and practicality of a range of land management options to recreate wildlife habitats in arable areas. The pilot s cheme was open to applications for three years from 1998 until 2000, and some of the options tested in the scheme are now being rolled out nat ionally. The pilot scheme was run in two arable areas of England - East Anglia and the West Midlands - over 6,000 hectares of land. Over the three years of the pilot scheme, five land management themes covering 17 different management options were applied by farmers. The sc heme involved farmers entering into legal agreements with the Department which detail the options they are applying, the areas cover ed, and completion dates, with financial penalties for breach of agreement. Agreements last for either five or six years. The Departmen t managed the scheme through 227 agreements with farmers, at a total cost of \u00a38.5 million in payments to farmers over the life of the agreeme nts. In adapting an aspect of their agricultural policy to changing circumstances the Department applied the following good practice : Impact The overall impact of the scheme is that it has given the Department information on which to base their decision about longer t erm policy. The Department have a published Public Service Agreement target to \"reverse the long-term decline in populations of farmland bi rds by 2020\". This is underpinned by data that are collected and published by the Department as a national statistic, which means that the data have been objectively and impartially prepared according to agreed statistical professional principles and quality assurance st andards.Knowing when to modify and adapt policies requires: !Comprehensive monitoring toassess the performance ofexisting policies !Formal reviews of the effective-ness of policies !Innovation \"to think out of thebox\" to identify new and betterways of delivering services. Source: National Audit OfficeJ 14executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Modifying policies 24 A policy may need to be modified for various reasons. A policy or an aspect of it may no longer be effective in its present form (J). The Department for Education and Skills' National Literacy Strategy is an example of the traditionalways of teaching reading and writing being redesigned to remedy unacceptablylow levels of children's literacy (Figure 5) . The requirements of the client group may have changed or be better understood or there may be opportunities todeliver policies more cost effectively. For example, NHS Direct, by providingcitizens with 24 hour advice on health care should discourage people frommaking unnecessary visits to their GP and local Accident and EmergencyDepartment. Policy changes in one department may require other policies toadapt. For example, changes in sentencing policy can have an impact on thesupport required by prisoners such as education and training while in custodyand from social services on release. Terminating policies 25 There may come a time when a policy has achieved its intended outcome, remedied the social or economic issue it was designed to tackle, or the policymay have become obsolete or ineffective. It may then be necessary to replace apolicy with a new one to reflect different circumstances or it may be more costeffective to terminate the policy altogether. The departments we examined told usthat it was often difficult to terminate a policy. They considered that this is partlybecause establishing the right time to do so is often not easy and there is alwaysa reluctance by officials to accept that a policy has not worked as planned.Departments said that policy reviews and formal evaluations very rarely resultedin a decision to terminate policies that were no longer effective. They told us thatthe results of evaluations are more likely to be used to refine policies. Learning lessons 26 Evaluation is important for determining the extent to which a policy has met or is meeting its objectives and that those intended to benefit have done so.Evaluation can also help departments learn lessons and share good practice inpolicy design and implementation. For long-term policies, evaluation canidentify ways in which the policy can be improved or developed to increase itsimpact. To encourage departments to make evaluation a more prominentfeature of policy-making the Treasury, as part of the Public Spending Review2000, required departments to provide an assessment of how policy objectiveswould be delivered; to demonstrate that their approach was evidence based;and to show how departmental research programmes would underpincontinuous improvements in performance. 27 All of the departments we examined provided examples of evaluations they had commissioned. These departments also identified, however, a need forevaluations to be more practical for example, showing what worked well inimproving public services and why, and considering what further practical stepswere needed to enhance service delivery and improve effectiveness.Departments also recognised that they needed to do more to draw together andact on the common lessons and good practice which a range of differentevaluations bring out.15 executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Recommendations \"Professional Policy Making for the Twenty First Century \" set out three themes - vision, effectiveness and continuous improvement - and nine characteristics whichmodern policy-making should aspire to. To reinforce these themes andcharacteristics and to realise the potential to improve the policy-making process andthe way it affects government departments' ability to meet the needs of citizenswhilst securing value for money, we recommend: For the Cabinet Office 1 Accelerate the dissemination of good practice . The Cabinet Office have through their report \"Better Policy-Making\" identified areas of good practiceand innovation in policy-making. To secure improvements across alldepartments and agencies they now need to accelerate the dissemination ofthis knowledge, and the good practice contained within this report, and seekassurance that progress is being made. The Cabinet Office should do this bypromoting more active use of their website as a source of advice and goodpractice, training and workshops, and ongoing benchmarking of departmentsto identify areas requiring further improvement. 2 Identify how lessons learned can best be applied . Failures in policy design and implementation also offer the opportunity to learn lessons to avoid repeatingsimilar failures, which may be costly and undermine service delivery to thetaxpayer. The Cabinet Office should identify where departments can applythese lessons to similar sets of circumstances to avoid repeated failures in thedesign, implementation and maintenance of policies, whilst highlighting howthe ability of departments to apply lessons may be affected by differences in,for instance, skills, experience, information technology infrastructure, and typeof policy delivery. For departments Departments should address the suitability of their policy-making systems to secureintended outcomes and deliver value for money in designing and implementingpolicies by: 3 Identifying and analysing critical factors. Departments should be rigorous and systematic in determining and analysing the key factors and barriers at theoutset of policies, such as the behaviour of implementers or the client group,which may have an impact on the likely success or failure of a policy.Departments should build into policy design: !Mechanisms to understand critical factors and how they might change overtime, such as effective consultation arrangements and clear links with client groups so that their needs are well understood. !Arrangements for monitoring performance and progress , so that corrective action can be taken if performance is not as expected, such as how the resultsfrom reviews and evaluations of policies should be acted upon and when. !Arrangements for embedding critical factors into the management ofpolicies , such as identifying practical constraints and how they will be overcome if policies are to be implemented successfully.16executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY !Estimates of the likely costs and benefits of policies and how changes in critical factors might have an impact on these , taking advantage of the mechanisms introduced by resource accounting and budgeting to helpidentify the full economic costs and assessing, for example, howtechnology might offer new forms of service delivery over the life ofpolicies, whether awareness of policies is sufficient amongst implementersand those at whom the policy is directed, and whether focused and targetedmarketing is needed so that policies reach the groups and citizens intended. !Arrangements to engage implementers early , so that the practicability of policies can be assessed and so departments have a clear view of the likelyopportunities and barriers that policies will face as they are implemented.Involving implementers closely as policies are designed can help identifyand manage risks to their effectiveness, secure ownership and commitmentfrom staff, and identify practical solutions more likely to work whenimplemented. !Assessments of the capability of those responsible for implementingpolicies , so that departments can gain assurance that implementers have the capacity - in terms of capital, human resources and technical infrastructure,such as information technology systems or logistics - to deliver what isrequired in the timescale planned, and can cope with variations inworkload, for instance, if policies involve services led by demand fromclient groups. 4 Having a well thought through implementation plan , which should set out: !The timetable for delivering the policy , including key targets and milestones for the achievement of critical stages in policies. !Roles and responsibilities of those involved in delivery and maintenance. !The resources allocated including money, skills and infrastructure. !How potential barriers are to be tackled , so that resources can be allocated accordingly. !Tested contingency plans , so that if the unexpected happens or an unforeseen event occurs, the continuity of the policy can be underpinned. !How performance is to be reported and monitored to ensure appropriate accountability; in particular, for accountability to be effective it is necessaryfor there to be one person who is ultimately responsible for the success ofa policy's implementation, and for lines of responsibility to remain clear inthe event of changes and adjustments in the policy. !The risks identified and the approach to managing them , in particular where departments enter into agreements with other organisations to deliverservices they need to allocate responsibility for managing risks to the partybest able to do so. !How project management approaches will be applied to manage implementation, including having reliable monitoring information to assessprogress and indicators to alert managers to under-performance so thatremedial action can be taken. 5 Preparing and using a clear communications strategy , which should be integrated into the design of the policy, to explain to the general public andother stakeholders, such as the business community or lobby groups, what thepolicy is about and what the targeted client group can reasonably expect as aresult. Where a service is demand led, a communications strategy should be akey part of the approach to managing demand. 17 executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY 6 Demonstrating flexibility . Departments should ensure that policies are designed and implemented with sufficient flexibility for opportunities to reviewprogress and determine whether policies are still delivering the policy benefitsintended and value for money. To identify when a policy might need to bemodified, departments should encourage: !A willingness to listen to the views of those consulted , including implementers, about the possibilities and pitfalls associated with policiesand where they might need to be adapted. !A readiness to draw on comprehensive monitoring to assess the performance and effectiveness of policies, including whether they continueto meet the needs of client groups. !Regular policy reviews to assess formally the effectiveness and performance of existing policies, including external input to challenge assumptionsunderlying policies. !Innovative approaches to identifying new methods of delivering policies and reaching client groups more effectively. !A recognition of the unintended effects of policies, such as where costs of policies might fall on groups or other organisations, including otherdepartments, which might contribute to the need for policies to be adapted. 7 Seeking continuous improvement through active evaluation and lesson learning . Departments should encourage, during the policy process, better understanding of the benefits of evaluation and greater clarity in: !The scope and purpose of evaluations of policies to identify their progress towards achieving desired outcomes. !How the results of evaluations will be used to modify policies. !The opportunities offered by evaluation to inform the development of future policy and to enhance departments' reputation and credibility. !The sharing of lessons learned from evaluations across policy areas in departments and between departments. 8 Having the confidence to act where value for money is threatened . Where circumstances that a policy was intended to address have changed or wheremonitoring and other information identify that a policy is not working asintended, departments may need to terminate a policy. Departments shouldhave the confidence to terminate policies rather than modify them or refine themif the results of evaluations and other reviews suggest that the policy measuresbeing taken are no longer cost effective or are not delivering intended benefits. Annexes 1 and 2 to this Executive Summary set out some key questions which departments might use to assess whether policies are likely to achieve their intendedoutcomes and deliver value for money. In addition the following National Audit Office reports include points of good practice which are also relevant for risk and value for money in policy-making: !Policy Development: Improving Air Quality (HC232, 2001-02) !Better good use of regulatory impact assesments (to bepublished in November 2001) !Joining Up to Improve Service Delivery (to be published in December 2001) 18executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Embed the identification and management of risks into policy design and implementation . Have the department identified and assessed the risks to performance and delivery and how they will be managed? For example, the department, in working with others, should allocate responsibility for managing risks during policy implementation to the party bestable to manage them, and allocate resources consistent with the risks being taken. Connect with other policy areas . Does the policy being designed have an impact - direct or indirect - on other policies in the same department or relateddepartments and agencies? For example, policy interrelationships should be identified and managed so that decisions are taken with the benefit of lessons from other policies, andpolicies are designed taking account of wider priorities. Draw on existing knowledge and experience . Have the department exploited the collective institutional knowledge in the department and experiencebeyond the department? For example, if a department's understanding of a problem is insufficient, there is the risk of an inappropriate or inadequate response being developed. Sharingexperience can also stimulate innovation, particularly by introducing anexternal opinion to analyse and challenge departmental assumptions abouthow a policy is expected to work in practice. Consider how options will work in practice . Have options developed been assessed against a range of different circumstances that might arise inimplementation? For example, the design of the policy should take account of the variability of factors that might have an impact on its success, such as demand for a service,or a dependence on specific skills during implementation. Understand the needs and characteristics of the client group . Have the department identified and analysed the risks associated with the client groupand do they have an approach to managing those risks? For example, the department should analyse how the behaviour of the client group or implementers might impact on their response to the policy, such as whetherincentives are needed to overcome the risk of a policy not being accepted.Annex 1 CHARACTERISTIC Policies should be innovative and creative Policies should be joined up Departments should learn lessons Policies should be forward looking Policies should use evidenceThe delivery of high quality public services depends on the effective identification, assessment and management of risks. Conti nuous improvement in public services also relies on innovation and taking opportunities to deliver services in new ways. To improve t he likelihood of policies delivering what is intended and to uphold the Cabinet Office's nine characteristics of modern policy-making set out in Professional Policy Making for the Twenty First Century , departments may wish to consider how they are best able to:Ten key questions departments need to consider in managing the risk of policies not delivering what is intended19 executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Test the policy . Has the policy been tested before implementation to determine how it might work in practice? For example, piloting a policy in areas of the country or among a sample of the client group can be an effective way of gaining feedback and obtaining a reliableassessment as to whether a policy is likely to work. Be prepared for the unexpected . Are contingency arrangements in place to maintain standards of service to the public and the delivery of programmes in the event ofunforeseen circumstances? For example, departments need adequate continuity arrangements to minimise the risk of inconvenience, financial loss, or anxiety to the client groups at whom a policyis directed, should the policy fail to be implemented as intended. Have and act on early warning indicators . Do the department have well understood systems to identify a policy need and to enable corrective action to be taken toaddress under-performance with existing policies? For example, indicators may highlight a gap in services to a client group or may assist with identifying where progress with implementation is not as intended. Market the policy . Is communication of policies and their benefits tailored to the client group and to those responsible for implementing the policy? For example, departments should communicate clearly what a policy is seeking to achieve and what the targeted client group can reasonably expect when it isimplemented. Apply learning . Have lessons about the performance of other policies been addressed and applied in design and implementation? For example, departments should take the opportunity to identify ways in which a policy can be improved or developed to increase its impact by learning from theexperience of other policies and other organisations.CHARACTERISTIC Policies should be inclusive Policies should be forward looking Policies should be evaluated and reviewed Policies should be outward looking Departments should learn lessons20executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Increase productivity . Does the design of the policy provide scope to harness developments that may have an impact on costs and benefits? For example, the assessment of costs and benefits over the life of the policy should include analysis of the likely evolution in available technology which may offeropportunities to deliver services in new ways, and factors which may have an impacton implementation costs, such as the need for staff training. Be realistic . Has the balance between the cost, quality and timeliness of the policy been assessed from previous experience and is this balance reasonable and realisticin terms of the expectations for service delivery? For example, targets for the number of working days to process applications for a service should be tested with implementers to identify potential barriers to achievingand improving performance and whether more practical solutions can be more costeffectively implemented. Plan for delivery in an organised way . Have resources, such as staff, skills and information technology been allocated to deliver the policy, and has theresponsibility to manage these resources been clearly identified for the life of thepolicy as it is implemented? For example, this should include an assessment of the department's ability to manage and maintain policy delivery in the event of departure of key staff, throughsuccession planning arrangements. Estimate the overall costs of the policy over time. Have the factors that might impact on overall costs over time been identified and assessed by breaking down the policyinto its cost components? For example input costs such as human resources, training costs, information technology development and maintenance should be assessed, the costs to businessand others affected by possible regulations, and costs which may be influenced bythe demand for a service, such as the number of citizens claiming benefits, shouldbe forecast. Measure the activities and outcomes of the policy . Is there a framework for measuring the progress of the policy, including its costs and benefits, and forreviewing and evaluating its effectiveness? For example, performance measures should be selected which are underpinned by a clear understanding of how programmes and activities impact on desiredoutcomes and client groups.Annex 2 To secure value for money during the policy-making process and to uphold the nine characteristics of modern policy-making set out in Professional Policy Making for the Twenty First Century , departments may wish to consider how they are best able to:Ten key questions departments need to consider to promote value for money in policies CHARACTERISTIC Policies should be forward looking Departments should learn lessons Policies should be innovative and creative Policies should use evidence Policies should review performance21 executive summaryMODERN POLICY -MAKING: ENSURING POLICIES DELIVER VALUE FOR MONEY Assess where and on whom costs fall and who benefits . Has an assessment been made of the relative costs of the implementation of the policy and whichorganisations and individuals will incur costs and derive benefits as a result? For example, in seeking to achieve their performance targets, the department may raise the costs of another department providing a different service to the same clientgroup, or one group may benefit from a policy at the expense of another. Determine whether the benefits of a policy can be clearly identified . Are the benefits being delivered to the client group liable to be counted several times overor can they be clearly attributed to the policy? For example, the effect of individual policies should be identified and evaluated, so that their cost effectiveness can be more accurately determined. Secure equitable policy impacts . Are certain groups at whom the policy is directed excluded from its benefits because of the way that a policy has been designed ordelivered? For example, the impact and benefits of a policy should fall equally on those at whom it is directed and assumptions about how the policy will work in practiceshould be subject to a challenge process by involving the client group or by testingassumptions in policy design. Enhance choice . What decisions will need to be made about delivery routes and what impact will this have on the way that client groups can access services? For example, a 'one size fits all' approach is unlikely to suit all individuals in the client group, as people may want to access services in different ways - via thetelephone, internet or in person at a local office - so departments should assess theextent to which different delivery routes are based on an awareness of the clientgroups' needs. Assess capability to deliver . Have the department determined the robustness of delivery mechanisms, resources and infrastructure of those responsible forimplementing the policy and delivering its outputs? For example, practical expert advice should be commissioned to assess whether other parties involved in implementation - whether in the private or public sector -have the technical and business know-how and sufficient flexibility in theirinfrastructure to implement the policy, or the proposed activities involved inimplementation should be benchmarked through the Public Sector BenchmarkingService or against organisations who have delivered similar projects andprogrammes.CHARACTERISTIC Policies should use evidence Policies should be evaluated Policies should be inclusive Policies should be outward looking Policies should be joined up "}
