(A) The employer shall make available the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series to all employees who have occupational exposure, and post-exposure evaluation and follow-up for bloodborne pathogens exposure to all employees who have had an exposure incident. When an employer is also acting as the evaluating health care professional, the employer shall advise an employee following an exposure incident that the employee may refuse to consent to post-exposure evaluation and follow-up from the employer-healthcare professional. When consent is refused, the employer shall make immediately available to exposed employees a confidential medical evaluation and follow-up from a healthcare professional other than the exposed employee's employer. EXCEPTION: Designated first aid providers who have occupational exposure are not required to be offered pre-exposure hepatitis B vaccine if the following conditions exist: 1. The primary job assignment of such designated first aid providers is not the rendering of first aid. a. Any first aid rendered by such persons is rendered only as a collateral duty responding solely to injuries resulting from workplace incidents, generally at the location where the incident occurred. b. This exception does not apply to designated first aid providers who render assistance on a regular basis, for example, at a first aid station, clinic, dispensary, or other location where injured employees routinely go for such assistance, and emergency or public safety personnel who are expected to render first aid in the course of their work. 2. The employer's Exposure Control Plan, subsection (c)(1), shall specifically address the provision of hepatitis B vaccine to all unvaccinated first aid providers who have rendered assistance in any situation involving the presence of blood or OPIM (regardless of whether an actual exposure incident, as defined by subsection (b), occurred) and the provision of appropriate post-exposure evaluation, prophylaxis and follow-ups for those employees who experience an exposure incident as defined in subsection (b), including: a. Provisions for a reporting procedure that ensures that all first aid incidents involving the presence of blood or OPIM shall be reported to the employer before the end of work shift during which the first aid incident occurred. i. The report must include the names of all first aid providers who rendered assistance, regardless of whether personal protective equipment was used and must describe the first aid incident, including time and date. A. The description must include a determination of whether or not, in addition to the presence of blood or OPIM, an exposure incident, as defined in subsection (b), occurred. B. This determination is necessary in order to ensure that the proper post-exposure evaluation, prophylaxis and follow-up procedures required by subsection (f)(3) are made available immediately if there has been an exposure incident, as defined in subsection (b). ii. The report shall be recorded on a list of such first aid incidents. It shall be readily available to all employees and shall be provided to the Chief upon request. b. Provision for the bloodborne pathogens training program, required by subsection (g)(2), for designated first aiders to include the specifics of the reporting requirements of subsection (f)(3) and of this exception. c. Provision for the full hepatitis B vaccination series to be made available as soon as possible, but in no event later than 24 hours, to all unvaccinated first aid providers who have rendered assistance in any situation involving the presence of blood or OPIM regardless of whether or not a specific exposure incident, as defined by subsection (b), has occurred. 3.
