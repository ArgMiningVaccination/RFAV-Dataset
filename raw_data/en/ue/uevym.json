We think it is hate, but it is fear.\" (Gandhi) There has been misinformation on social media that I am supposedly not vaccinated. In fact, my wife and I have both received 3 doses of the [#BioNTech](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fbiontech&trk=public_post-text) [#Pfizer](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fpfizer&trk=public_post-text) vaccine. For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to address these false rumors. Until now, I had refused to do so, as I believe that my communication should not be about me. I believe that my communication should contribute to scientific transparency and provide data, facts and insights. This week, I had planned to write an update about our early data on the [#Omicron](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fomicron&trk=public_post-text) variant and how we are preparing so that we are ready to react immediately if the strain becomes dominant. The data from our lab tests, as well as from many other experts, indicates that boosters with the current vaccine improve immune responses against the [#Delta](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdelta&trk=public_post-text) and spreading Omicron variant. A large study published yesterday in [#NEJM](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fnejm&trk=public_post-text) (link below) underlines that boosters do help to save lives. I also wanted to explain that we started developing a vaccine to address the Omicron variant, irrespective of whether it will be needed or not, how long it will take to be developed, and that it's important not to wait for the new vaccine but to continue with booster vaccinations as the data show. However, a call last week changed my mind. I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is fighting against severe COVID-19 and has been on a ventilator for 3 weeks. I learned from his wife that he and his family were not vaccinated. I did not ask why they made this decision. People have different, personal reasons. However, the most common root cause seems to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and distrust. Fear is not rational, yet it always feels real and justified. It is people's fear that often turns into anger and hate. Fear is hard to combat with facts and figures. Sometimes fear can be better defeated by sharing personal experiences. Therefore, to reach out to those who are struggling personally with their fears, I would like to share a picture showing my COVID-19 vaccination in early 2021.

Ich bin nach wie vor fassungslos... ! Ok, I'm sorry to hear that your friend is struggling to stay alive. Ratio is above fear. At least in my case. I look at the vacation campaign as a top-down operation. We, the human society are forced into it in order to deliver facts of all kind. One fact deals with the response of the human society to power tools. Another one is of a lateral kind. How simple is to crack the social bonds within our human society. The last one proves that the forced vaccination isn't an intelligent design. It's a measure to dismantle the societies around the world. What is the point to get the 2 shots and still get infected ? How can you explain that health authorities recommand a booster shot every 3 months to keep the green pass, knowing that even though we still can get infected and propagate COVID anyway ?! The only plausible explaination is : money... the big pharma has an opportunity to have more and more money. Unfortunatly, you as a scientist, you collude with them regardless of your ethical duty.
