{"title": "Infographic: How Vaccinations Have Changed the World", "author": "Guido Mingels", "url": "https://www.statista.com/chart/10826/result-of-vaccinations", "hostname": "statista.com", "description": "This chart shows how the incidence of several diseases has been reduced since the introduction of vaccines.", "sitename": "Statista", "date": "2017-08-25", "cleaned_text": "Data about the US serves to illustrate the long-term success rates of vaccinations: by what percentage did the number of infections fall in wake of the introduction of certain vaccinations? The figures speak for themselves and are comparable to improvements seen in Germany, as confirmed by the Robert Koch Institute. Diphtheria: reduced by 100 percent. Polio: 100 percent. Measles: 99.9 percent. Pertussis: 96.6 percent. There is, however, danger in this enormous success: potentially deadly diseases such as measles have lost their terror. That is the only explanation for why outbreaks of measles can still occur in a country like Germany. All those who oppose vaccinations are actually free-riders: they can only afford this kind of nonsense because an overwhelming majority of people whom they look down on are getting vaccinations. If the entire anti-vaccination movement founded their own country in which all of its unvaccinated citizens could live together with their beloved viruses, most of them would be long dead by now.
