Being told you have Hepatitis C at this time in your life, when it has \"been laying dormant in your system\" is a HUGE MONEY GRAB for the Pharmaceutical Companies. We are here to find TRUE SOLUTIONS to your health concerns. To Request an Action Plan to Address Hepatitis C [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) I came across this article on line after hearing a radio commercial for getting a Hepatitis C Shot for anyone born between the years 1945 through 1965. So I thought I'd do some research to understand why. Here is what the article said. My comments are at the end. If you're a baby boomer, getting tested for hepatitis C would be a wise decision because boomers are five times more likely to have this virus than other generations, and most people that have it don't realize it. Those that are infected are at very high risk of eventually developing liver cancer, cirrhosis or other fatal liver diseases. Here's what else you should know. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently announced that all Americans born from 1945 through 1965 get a hepatitis C test. The reason is because baby boomers account for 75 percent of the 3 million or so hepatitis C cases in the U.S., even though they make up only 27 percent of the total population. Most hepatitis C infections occurred in the 1970s and 1980s, before there were tests to detect them and before the nation's blood supply was routinely screened for the virus. Hepatitis C is transmitted only through blood, so anyone who received either a blood transfusion or an organ transplant prior to 1992 is at increased risk. So are health-care workers exposed to blood, and people who injected drugs through shared needles. The virus can also be spread through microscopic amounts of infected blood that could occur during sex, from sharing a razor or toothbrush, or getting a tattoo or body piercing at an unsterile shop. But the biggest part of the problem is the symptomless nature of this disease. Most people that have hepatitis C don't have any symptoms until their liver becomes severely damaged. It can actually take 30 years for people to show any signs of the virus, but by then, it may be too late to treat. But if it's detected in time, new treatments are now available that can cure it. If you're between ages 47 to 67, or have one of the previously listed risk factors, you should see your primary care doctor for a basic blood test to determine whether you have ever been infected with hepatitis C. This is a relatively inexpensive test and typically covered by health insurance under routine medical care. If you're not covered, the test will run $30 to $35. If the test is negative, no further tests are needed. But, if the test is positive, you'll need another test called HCV RNA, which will show whether the virus is still active. This test runs between $100 and $250 if you're not covered by insurance. If you test positive, you have chronic hepatitis C and will need to talk to your doctor about treatment options. If you're infected, but have no liver damage, your doctor should monitor your liver at your annual physical. THE MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE If you test positive, you have chronic hepatitis C and will need to talk to your doctor about treatment options. If you're infected, but have no liver damage, your doctor should monitor your liver at your annual physical. The main treatments for chronic hepatitis C today are new antiviral medications that have a 75 percent cure rate. Your doctor may recommend a combination of these medications that are typically taken over a 24- to 48-week time period. But, be aware that the side effects can be grueling and may cause extreme fatigue, fever, headaches and muscle aches. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine currently available to prevent hepatitis C, although studies are under way to develop one. Savvy tips: For more information about testing and treatment for hepatitis C, along with a quick, online quiz you can take to determine your risks, see the CDC's website at cdc.gov/knowmorehepatitis. You can also get information over the phone by calling the national toll-free HELP-4-HEP helpline at 877-435-7443. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You I understand the need for being cautious. I also know the industry. And if they can have everyone who is between the ages of 47 and 67 come in and pay $ 30 - 35 for the first test and $100 - 250 for the second test, that is between $130 - 285 for every person who is between the ages of 47 and 67. That is a big chunk of change just to \"test\" for it. That has nothing to do with the treatment that will be recommended, the antiviral medications that have a 75 % \"cure\" rate will need to be taken for 24 - 48 week time period. What is the cost for that? About $1000.00 a month JUST for the prescription. And perhaps your insurance company will pick up a portion of the testing, so you won't have to pay for all of it. But at what cost to you for going on a \"witch hunt?\" Roughly $40,000 - 50,000.00. You can decide. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Dr. Huntoon has experience working with several people who wanted an alternative solution to the old method of treatment. He successfully helped each one of them overcome their Hepatitis C, meaning they had it no more. Working with your [Holistic Chiropractor](holistic-chiropractor.asp) who can advise you if you have Hepatitis C and then treat the condition, for perhaps $475.00 - 600.00 total (As this is what Dr. Huntoon charges to address the condition fully) is a much more viable and cost effective form of treatment. And doing it without all the harsh medications that will create more stress on your liver is important to consider. If you go with the allopathic treatment, the potential for side effects with these new treatments and any medication is important to fully understand before beginning any medication. Discussing with your Medical Doctor or Pharmacist is prudent. Understanding if you have Hepatitis C and what can be done to \"cure\" the condition is a smart thing to find out. But at the cost the \"Authorities\" are proposing, I say consider the lesser of the two and start conservatively first. You can always do what they want you to do if the conservative care doesn't fix the concern.
