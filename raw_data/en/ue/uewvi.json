You provide them with healthy food, make sure they get enough sleep and protect them from harmful germs. Did you know that chiropractic care can boost your child's immune system? Chiropractic care does more than just improve digestive function and reduce stress, it also helps you raise healthy kids naturally. Here are some of the awesome ways chiropractic care improves immunity: 1. Clear communication between the brain and immune system improves immune function to help your kiddo get better faster. The brain and immune system work together to keep the body protected from harmful pathogens. A healthy spine and nervous system ensure that this communication runs smoothly to the immune system when a germ invades. 2. Chiropractic adjustments increase antibody levels when your child is sick, so they get better faster. Antibodies are produced by the immune system when the body is fighting an infection. Research shows that patients who received chiropractic care had increased antibody production compared to those who did not. When your kiddo regularly receives chiropractic adjustments, their immune system is supported, making it easier for the body to fight off infections. 3. In studies, chiropractic adjustments have been shown to increase the number of CD4 immune cells- a vital component of the immune system. CD4 cells play an essential role in the immune response; they signal other immune cells to attack invaders like bacteria and viruses. When your kiddo receives chiropractic adjustments, the number of CD4 cells in their blood increases significantly. This gives their body a better chance of combating infections effectively. 4. Studies also show that kids who have regular chiropractic adjustments have up to 200% greater immune capacity than those with no care. A study published in the Journal of Vertebral Subluxation Research found that the immune system's function was significantly better in a group of chiropractic patients than in a control group without chiropractic care. This increased immune capacity can help your kiddo fight off many illnesses faster, reducing the number of sick days spent at home. As parents, we want to ensure that our kiddos are happy and healthy. Chiropractic care can help you achieve that by promoting optimal immune function. By enabling proper communication between the nervous system and immune system, chiro care enhances the body's ability to fight off infections. Regular chiropractic adjustments can have significant benefits for your kiddo's health and wellbeing, making it an essential part of raising healthy kids naturally. "}
