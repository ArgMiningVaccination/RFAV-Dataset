AP'S ASSESSMENT: False. Autism is not listed as a reaction on packaging for any of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines _ often referred to as DTaP_ currently used in the U.S., according to documents on the FDA's website. THE FACTS: Amid a measles outbreak in the U.S. that has public health officials pushing for people to get vaccinated against the highly contagious virus, posts being shared on Facebook are misrepresenting old vaccine packaging to revive the discredited assertion that vaccines cause autism. None of the pediatric or adult diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines currently administered in the U.S. list autism as a reaction on packaging labels _ or other vaccines, either, for good reason: \"There's no credible evidence linking vaccination to autism or other developmental disorders,\" the FDA said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \"This question of a purported link between vaccines and autism has been exhaustively studied over many years, in dozens of investigations and through some of the largest scientific studies ever undertaken.\" Some of the most commonly listed adverse reactions to vaccines currently used in the U.S. include inconsolable crying and pain at the injection site, according to the packaging inserts available on the FDA's site. Back in 2005, Sanofi Pasteur's Tripedia DTaP vaccine automatically included autism on a long list of \"adverse events\" because some consumers had sent in that claim _ without scientific evidence. Since then, the FDA changed its labeling rules and now only includes adverse events \"for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship,\" the agency told the AP in a statement last year, when similar reports resurfaced. Tripedia has not been used as a vaccine in the U.S. since 2011, according to information on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.
