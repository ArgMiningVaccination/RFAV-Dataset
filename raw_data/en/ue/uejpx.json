It's hard not feeling completely out of control amid a viral pandemic\u2014and working to fortify your own first line of defense is an understandable instinct. The truth is, your immune system does a fairly remarkable job at defending against disease and sickness. Its complex and pervasive network of cells extends to each organ and system in your body, keeping a detailed record of every microbe it defeats and evolving to defend against new diseases and environments each day. But immune systems aren't perfect, and sometimes they fail. A virus invades and makes you sick, or the common cold outmaneuvers even the most basic immune response. Lack of sleep, dehydration, dietary habits and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals\u2014not to mention stress\u2014can all play a role in its weakening. The good news is that you can strengthen your immune system, and there are concrete methods you can apply to improve its functionality. Proper hydration and an intravenous infusion of essential vitamins and antioxidants works best to boost your immune health, bypassing the waste and ineffectiveness of common oral supplements and rejuvenating your body directly. Here are four ways IV hydration therapy fortifies your immune system and works to keep you healthy. According to a [recent report from the Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/nutritionreport/pdf/4page_%202nd%20nutrition%20report_508_032912.pdf), about one in ten Americans are deficient in key vitamins and minerals, correlating to identifiable trends in healthiness over time. Concurrently, the report also found that water-soluble and orally-taken vitamin supplements have only some effect on mediating nutritional deficiencies. As it turns out, taking a fistful of vitamins and minerals in the morning isn't the quick fix many of us hope for. Because oral vitamin supplements must be digested, chances are, you'll only absorb about [40% of the vitamins you take](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/feeling-sick-ish-i-went-drip-bar-immunity-boost-here-ncna843406). The rest will be discarded as waste. The benefit offered by IV hydration therapy is that it delivers a nourishing fluid solution directly to your vein, sending a high concentration of key vitamins and minerals straight to the bloodstream, where your cells can reap their benefits immediately. In a recent Joe Rogan interview, biomedical scientist and nutritional health expert Dr. Rhonda Patrick concurred, adding that while oral supplements might have some effect on supporting your immune system, IV treatments, like IV vitamin C, are best for [long term results and therapeutic treatment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=4_ZJ8YDOX6g&feature=emb_title). While IV therapy also hydrates your body, Oasis has designed [custom formulas](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments) specifically catered to keep you healthy, drawing on a key vitamins and minerals needed to boost immunity, like: Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin and antioxidant that impacts every part of the immune system, producing beneficial effects on [virtually all of the immune system's cells](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2015/11/the-link-between-vitamin-c-and-optimal-immunity). Vitamin C is closely linked with the production of antibody-producing white blood cells, like lymphocytes. In addition, immune cells have active vitamin C transporter molecules embedded in their membranes that [ramp up consumption of the vitamin](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2015/11/the-link-between-vitamin-c-and-optimal-immunity) when your immune system is actively fighting an infection. Your immune system relies heavily on this vitamin for support, and vitamin C deficiencies are closely linked to more frequent and longer lasting colds, as well as an increased vulnerability to infection. Significantly, a recent research study found that high doses of intravenous vitamin C may be an [effective treatment for patients diagnosed with COVID-19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167497/), since vitamin C's antioxidant properties help to destress an immune system overwhelmed by the cellular injuries incurred during respiratory distress. In the study, doctors reported that various high-dose intravenous vitamin C infusions shortened patients' intensive care unit stay by close to 8%, significantly reducing mortality rates and successfully reducing symptoms in 50 moderate to severe COVID-19 patients. Because the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs takes time, IV vitamin C and antioxidants, the report claimed, are among the few available agents able to mitigate the effects of coronavirus. Vitamin C and IV Hydration Therapy The human body does not produce vitamin C, so it must be obtained from external sources, and, like many water soluble vitamins, vitamin C is quickly excreted. Luckily, Oasis Hydration provides [several formulas](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments) that administer a dose of this valuable vitamin directly to your bloodstream, guaranteeing total absorption. Oasis' [Health and Immunity](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments) formula is designed to keep your immune system strong while defending against viral invaders or fighting an infection. In general, Oasis' H&I formula can be applied to aid: Zinc is a micromineral that makes up various cells, enzymes and hormones that\u2014in addition to promoting wound healing, growth rates and healthy blood clotting\u2014is crucial to immune function. Strikingly, a recent report from the Japan Medical Association found that [one in three people are likely to be deficient in zinc](http://www.med.or.jp/english/pdf/2004_08/359_364.pdf), since the amount of zinc ingested per day is commonly insufficient relative to the daily requirements for children, elderly people and those on weight-reducing or augmented diets. Particularly, zinc is essential in the development of immune cells, and it plays an important role in the immune system's inflammatory response to infections, helping to tap the brakes on out-of-control inflammation caused by an immune response. Because COVID-19 has been shown to manifest as a vascular disease, not specifically a respiratory illness, coronavirus patients commonly experience inflammation. One recent study even found that zinc [played a key role in elderly immunity to COVID-19 for this reason](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297178/), and that the nutritional status of zinc in an elderly patient could change the course of the infection. On the whole, zinc, the report said, is crucial for growth, development, and the maintenance of immune function. Zinc and IV Hydration Therapy IV hydration formulas that supply zinc directly to the bloodstream can be integral in preventing zinc deficiency, particularly for those with reduced dietary intakes and modified diets, like vegans, vegetarians and those on restrictive meal plans. Like the best immune system treatments, Oasis' [Health & Immunity](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments) formula combines zinc with other needed vitamins for immune health, like vitamin C, B-complex vitamins and L-Glutathione. B-complex vitamins are an aggregate of 8 different vitamins that perform a variety of essential functions, like cardiovascular support, energy conversion and, importantly, immune function. B-complex vitamins include: Specifically, B-complex vitamins have been shown to play a [significant role in circulating antibodies to antigens](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7010964/), supporting and quickening immune system responses to infection. While 1 in 6 Americans are likely deficient in certain B-complex vitamins, like B12, inadequate levels can suppress the immune system and inhibit the body's ability to produce antibodies that fight infection. B-Complex Vitamins and IV Hydration Therapy Because B-complex is [beneficial for so many different body functions](https://www.oasishydration.com/blog/15-essential-supplements-to-boost-your-physical-mental-health), Oasis includes this vital ingredient in a [number of IV hydration treatments](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments), including: In addition to Oasis Hydration's [custom formulated hydration treatments](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments), Oasis also offers a [B-Boost booster shot](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments) containing all the necessary B-complex vitamins. Administered via intramuscular injection, Oasis Hydration's booster shots, like our IV therapies, bypass digestion and drastically increase absorption. Known as the master antioxidant, glutathione is a powerful vitamin that primes white blood cells and keeps your immune system healthy. Glutathione is essential for cellular homeostasis, and it plays a vital role in diverse cellular functions within the immune system. Importantly, glutathione is a natural antidote to the oxidative stress caused by toxins and serious vascular illnesses, like COVID-19. Glutathione-enhanced immune cells, like T-cells, are able to [produce more infection-fighting antibodies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22164280/) that strengthen the immune system and control viral infections. One 6-month study found that glutathione [more than doubled the immune system's ability to kill invaders](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24791752/), and another found that increased levels of glutathione in a patient's system modulated the behavior of immune system cells. Glutathione [augmented patients' innate and adaptive immunity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23089304/) and conferred protection against microbial, viral and parasitic infections. Significantly, one recent study found that a [deficiency of glutathione was the most likely cause of serious manifestations and death in COVID-19 patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7263077/). Low levels of glutathione exaggerated coronavirus patients' risk factors for serious illness and COVID-19 prognosis, directly tying the risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection with depleted levels of intracellular glutathione. L-Glutathione and IV Hydration Therapy Oasis Hydration provides a number of solutions to access this master antioxidant and powerfully strengthen your immune system. Oasis' [Health & Immunity ](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments)formula includes a nourishing dose of glutathione, pairing it with vital vitamins for immune health like vitamin C, zinc, and B-complex vitamins. Additionally, Oasis Hydration provides an [Immune Boost](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments) shot that will deliver a powerful dose of glutathione through intramuscular injection, enabling your immune system to dispel the harmful accumulations of free radicals that underlie illness. A key benefit of IV hydration is the cleansing of harmful free radicals from the body. Because an excess of free radicals can dampen and restrict the immune system, IV hydration therapy's detoxification abilities present an effective strategy to fortify immune function. Free radicals are [harmful toxins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614697/#:~:text=A%20molecule%20with%20one%20or,reactions%20(1%2C%202).) that are produced either naturally in the body or from external sources. Curiously, free radicals\u2014and the oxidants they create\u2014play a dual role in the body, acting as both toxic and beneficial compounds. Free radicals are often created from normal metabolic function, and they destroy invading organisms and damaged tissue. However, free radicals can also enter the body from contact with toxic external sources, like pollution, cigarette smoke, radiation or medication. Over time, this exposure upsets the healthy oxidant balance that aids your immune system. When this balance is upset\u2014and when an overload of free radicals cannot naturally be regulated\u2014their accumulation generates a process called [oxidative stress](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26370542/). While this process can play a major role in the progression of chronic and developmental illnesses like cancer, aging and cardiovascular disease, it can also lead to [significant immune system deficiencies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26370542/). The immune system is extremely vulnerable to this imbalance, and studies have shown that a build up of free radicals and oxidants in the body can [limit the production of key immune system compounds](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26370542/). Generally, our bodies have natural and expansive anti-oxidant systems that combat oxidative stress and protect the immune system. They ensure that the formation of free radicals during certain physiological processes do not result in cellular damage, and they directly protect against the buildup of harmful oxidants. However, frequent contact with external toxins means oxidative stress is [common in most people](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8530128/), and supplemental antioxidants are needed to restore the immune system to proper working order. IV hydration therapies detoxify the body by providing nourishing antioxidants that neutralize oxidative stress, cleanse the bloodstream of free radicals and strengthen the immune system. In addition, IV hydration therapy ensures that the delivery of vital supplementary antioxidants\u2014like vitamin C, L-Glutathione and [L-Carnitine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4125592/)\u2014is entirely absorbed in the body, bypassing the gastrointestinal metabolism and directly accessing the bloodstream. IV Therapy Detox and Immune Repair at Oasis Hydration Oasis provides a number of [nourishing IV therapies](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments) that are meant to detoxify the body and supply needed doses of antioxidants to support the immune system. Oasis [Health & Immunity](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments) and [Detox & Wellness](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments) are both rich in vitamin C, L-Glutathione and L-Carnitine, and they're designed to deliver your body a healthy concentration of these valuable resources. Other IV therapies, like [Revive & Energize](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments) and [Hydrate & Restore](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments), possess nourishing amounts of vitamin C and work to improve general body function. Proper hydration\u2014 [the key benefit of all IV therapies](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-therapy-101)\u2014is an essential component of a healthy immune system. Your immune system relies heavily on the bloodstream's ability to transport immune cells and antibodies. Yet, your blood steam is made mostly of water and, if dehydrated, [can not properly facilitate key immune system cells](https://ssihi.uci.edu/tip/hydration-for-immune-system/), which use the bloodstream to identify and target harmful antigens and infections. In addition, good hydration helps the immune system when it's most in need. Illness puts great demand on your body, requiring more resources and water to fuel your cells. If you're already sick, or if your immune system is working to prevent a viral infection from taking hold, proper hydration is essential for providing extra energy. Yet, studies consistently show that most people are chronically dehydrated. A 2013 study found that up to [75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated](https://www.medicaldaily.com/top-7-dht-blocker-shampoos-stop-hair-loss-442849), even if they know they should drink more water. Doctors recommend that adult men and women should drink anywhere from 2 to 4 liters of water a day\u2014and studies have shown that most people [struggle to meet that quota](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-blog/2011/january/if-water-is-so-great-why-dont). Further, while most Americans turn to other beverages or foods to supplement their water intake, one study found that only [22% of Americans' daily water intake is adequately supplemented by other beverages or foods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/). IV hydration, on the other hand, delivers needed electrolytes directly to your bloodstream. It fully and completely nourishes your body and, in turn, keeps your immune system healthy. Staying hydrated\u2014particularly with the aid of IV hydration therapy\u2014is just as important for detoxification. In a well hydrated body, the immune system is properly supported by the [lymphatic system](https://drinksword.com/blogs/news/hydration-the-immune-system-booster), a drainage and sewage system which removes toxins, waste and unwanted materials, like oxidants and free radicals that clog the immune system. The lymphatic system also works to facilitate fluid transport, carrying infection-fighting immune system cells, like white blood cells, throughout the body. When dehydrated, the lymphatic system doesn't work as properly, and immune responses to invaders are slowed. In this way, while IV therapies like Oasis' [Detox & Wellness](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-therapy-101) already work to detoxify the body by providing needed antioxidants, the hydration they provide in conjunction with those minerals works to keep your lymphatic system properly engaged in removing harmful toxins. Oasis Hydration is more than equipped to provide all of these health benefits and strategies for strengthening your immune system with our [full menu of IV hydration therapies](https://www.oasishydration.com/iv-treatments)\u2014but we recognize that strengthening your immune system will do little if you're put at risk in the process.
