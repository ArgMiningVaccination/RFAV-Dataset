The DHSS proceedings to amend the regulations were initiated pursuant to 29 Delaware Code Chapter 101 and authority as prescribed by 16 Delaware Code , Section 122 (3) p. On October 1, 2007 (Volume 11, Issue 4), DHSS published in the Delaware Register of Regulations its notice of proposed regulations, pursuant to 29 Delaware Code Section 10115. It requested that written materials and suggestions from the public concerning the proposed regula tions be delivered to DHSS by October 31, 2007, after which time the DHSS would review information, factual evidence and public comment to the said proposed regulations. Written comments were received during the public comment period and evaluated. The results of that evaluation are summarized in the accompanying \"Summary of Evidence.\" FINDINGS OF FACT: Based on comments received, substantive and non- substantive changes were made to the proposed regulations. The Department finds that the proposed regulations, as amended and set forth in the attached copy should be adopted in the best interest of the general public of the State of Delaware. THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED , that the proposed State of Delaware Regulations governing Licensing of Substance Abuse Facilities are adopted an d shall become effective January 1, 2009, after publication of the final regulation in the Delaware Register of Regulations . Vincent P. Meconi, Secretary, DHSS, September 11, 2008 SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE State of Delaware Regulations Governing Licensing Standards For Substance Abuse Facilities In accordance with Delaware Law, public notices regarding proposed Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Regulations governing Licensing Standard s for Substance Abuse Facilit ies were published in the Delaware State News , the News Journal and the Delaware Register of Regulations . Written comments were received on the proposed regulations during the public comment period (October 1, 2007 through October 31, 2007). Public comments and the DHSS (Ag ency) responses are as follows:The following responses to the comments received on the proposed Substance Abuse Treatment Program Standards identify the organization or i ndividual offering comment and/or recommendation. Where multiple organizations or individuals offered similar comments, reference is made to the additionalorganization or individual before the agency response is given. The Governor's Advisory Council for Exceptional Citizens, the Delaware Developmental Disabilities Council and the State Council for Persons with Disabilities of fered virtually identical comments and recommendations summarized below. DSAMH has considered each comment, found the comments to be helpful and instructive andhave adopted some of the suggestions made. First, it is unclear whether t he regulations apply to children's facilities. The licensing statutes [Title 16 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a72206(1), 2207, and 2208] authorize DHSS to adopt stand ards, in consultation with the DSCY&F, for adult and children's facilities. DHSS is also auth orized to delegate to the DSCY&F the authorit y to issued regulations for children's facilities. There is no recita l in the regulations that DSCY&F has been consulted. Moreover, all the references in the lengthy regulation are to DSAMH to the exclusion of DSCY&F. We identified only three references[\u00a75.1.4.4.1.14; \u00a75.1. 7.1.1.2; \u00a77.1 .2.1.7] which suggest coverage of children's fac ilities since they require reporting of child abuse or neglect. DSAMH should clarify whether the standar ds apply to both adult and child facilities. If the standards do apply to children's facilit ies, DSAMH should consid er revisions to addres s children. For example, residential facilities and some da y programs should ensure that minors receive schooling. Cf . Title 16 Del.C. \u00a75161(a)(12)[residential mental health fa cilities must ensure education of minors]. Agency Response: DSAMH would like to clarify that the standards do apply to children's facilities. The Division of Services for Children, Y outh and their Families (DSCY&F) particip ated in the initial drafting of the standards. DSCY&F was also invited to review the final draft before the proposed regulations were published. Subsequent to the receipt of comments on the propos ed regulations, DSAMH consulted with DSCY&F around education requirements. It was jointly determined that ther e was not a need to include regulations for education in these standards. Second, the definition of \"counseling\" in \u00a73.0 only permits \"face-to-face interaction\" between counselor and clients, family members, and sign ificant others. The regulations include some minimum amounts of such \"counseling\". See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a710.1.8, 11.1, and 12.1. Literally, the regulation may categorically preclude use of video- conferencing and tele-conferencing. Such modalities may be necessary to promote participation by family members and significant others. The Division should consid er authorization of such modalities at least under some circumstances (e.g. family is distant or lacks transporta tion). Moreover, the Division may wish to clarify whether videoconferencing amounts to \"face-to-face interaction\". Agency Response: \"Face-to-face interaction(s)\" would include vi deoconferencing as the interaction would be considered \"face-to-face.\" While best practices would sugges t that therapeutic contact is most beneficial when a professional counselor meets with a client and/or their family, programs that develop policies that include ongoing tele-conferencing would be e ligible to apply for a waiver as per \u00a74.15 of the proposed standards. DSAMH declines the recommendation to change the standard. Third, we are pleased to note that the definition of \"medical history\" in \u00a73.0 of TBI, this merits endorsement. Agency Response: As the addictions field becomes more soph isticated in treating individuals with co occurring disorders, providers have become more aware of the special needs of individuals with head injuries. DSAMH appreciates this reco gnition by the Council(s). Fourth, \u00a74.5.2.1 requires compliance with the ADA in license applications. Li kewise, \u00a77.1.1.3 requires compliance with ADA standards. These provisions merit endorsement. Agency Response : DSAMH appreciates this response and the support of the Councils in this area. Fifth, \u00a74.13.4 there are some extraneous brackets \"[ ]\".Agency Response: DSAMH has removed the extraneous brackets. Sixth, \u00a74.15.4 invariably requires any waiver granted by the Division to extend for the full term of the existing license, i.e., up to 2 years. This unnecessarily limits the Division's di scretion. For example, there may be circumstances under which a short-term waiver would be more appropriate. DSAMH should consider adopting the approach reflected in DLTCRP regulations covering DDDS neighborhood homes, 16 DE Admin. Code 3310, \u00a717.4. Section 17.4 provides as follows: \"A waiver ma y be granted for a period up to the term of the license.\" Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that provision for a short-te rm waiver should be clear. \u00a74.15.4 has been modified to read: \"A waiver granted under these regulations shall be in effect for the term of the applicant's license unless the approval of the waiver specifies a shorter term; all waivers not otherwise approved for a shorter termshall expire at the end of the term of license and new waiv er(s) must be requested as part of the licensure renewal process in accordance with 4.15\". Seventh, at least in the context of residential facilities, it is preferable to require notice of the waiver request be shared with residents to permit input from persons who may be most affected. Compare 16 DE Administrative Code 3310, \u00a717.1.4. No harm is done by promoting the opp ortunity for consumer input into waiver requests. Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that consumer input can be valuable when a program requests a waiver. \u00a74.15.1 has been modified to read: \"An application for a waiver from a requirement of these regulations shall be made in writing to the Division's Licensing Unit; it shall sp ecify the regulation from which waiver is sought, demonstrate that each requested waiver is justified by substantial hardsh ip, and describe the alternative practice(s) proposed. The waiver request sh all be posted in a pr ominent place in the facility a nd outline a process approved by the Division whereby clients can offer comments and feedback specific to the waiver request. The Division's Licensing Unit shall make a recommendation of action on the application to the Division Director or designee after reviewing the waiver request and any consumer input. Only the Division Director shallgrant waivers.\" Eighth, \u00a75.1.1.4 requires the facilities Governing Body to meet only once annually. If DSAMH wishes to promote an active, knowledgeable board, this st andard may fall short of achieving that objective. Agency Response: While DSAMH understands the rational behind more frequent meetings of the Governing Body, the standard will apply to a wid e variety of organizations both la rge and small. Th e proposed minimum standard allows prog rams flexibility in establishing Governing Body protocols that best meet their needs. DSAMH does not think the standard is in need of revision. Ninth, Facilities are required to make mandated reports of child abuse [\u00a7\u00a75.1.4.4.1.1 6; 5.1.7.1.1.2; and 7.1.2.1.7]. There is no comparable provision requiring reporting of abuse, mistreatment, neglect or financialexploitation as required by Title 16 Del.C. \u00a72224. This oversight should be corrected. Agency Response: DSAMH agrees and amended the standard in the final order to read: \"5.1.4.4.1.16...Policies and procedures for making mandated reports of suspected child abuse or neglect incompliance with 16 Del.C. \u00a7\u00a7 902 through 904 and 16 Del.C. \u00a7 2224...\"; \"5.1.7.1.1.2... reporting of cases of suspected child abuse or neglect in compliance with 16 Del.C . \u00a7\u00a7 902 through 904 and There is Section 6.1.2.1.1 requires the Clin ical Director to have a \"master's degree in counseling or a related discipline.\" Section 6.1.3.1.1 requires a Clinical Supervisor to have a bachelor's degree with \"a major in chemical dependency, psychology, social work, counseling, or nursing.\" The \"related discipline\" standard applicable to the Clinical Direc tor is ostensibly narrower than th e educational backgro und standards for the Clinical Supervisor (deg ree in chemical dependency, psychology, so cial work, counseling, or nursing). For example, could a Clinical Director qu alify with a master's degree in nurs ing? DSAMH may wish to clarify \"related discipline\" by at least providing some specif ic examples of acceptable contexts of degrees .(Russel Buskirk and Chris Devaney of Connections, Ja nice Sneed of Brandywine Counseling, Inc., David Parcher of Kent and Sussex County Counseling, Bruce Lore nz of Thresholds, Inc, Bruce Johnson on behalf of the Delaware Association for Addiction Counselors (DAADAC), David Parcher on behalf of the Delaware Certification Board (DCB), Steven Martin of the Center for Drug and Al cohol Studies: University of Delaware and Ms. Samantha Hurd offered simila r recommendations) Agency Response: DSAMH agrees and changed the standard in the final order to read: 6.1.2 Qualifications for the Position of Clinical Director 6.1.2.1 Each individual, hired or pr omoted, to the position of Clinical Director on or after the date these regulations become effective shall have, at a minimum: 6.1.2.1.1 A master's degree with a major in chemical dependency, psychology, social work, counseling, nursing or a related field of study and five (5) years of documented clinical experience in human services, at least three (3) years of whic h shall be in substance abuse services. 6.1.3 Qualifications for the Po sition of Clinical Supervisor 6.1.3.1 Each individual authorized, hired, or promoted , to provide clinical supervision on or after the date these regulations become ef fective shall have, at a minimum: 6.1.3.1.1 A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited college or university with a major in chemical dependency, psychology, social work, counseling, nursing or a related field of study and full certification as a certified alcohol and drug counselor (CADC) in the state of Delaware or by a nationally recognized organization in addictions counseling; or 6.1.3.1.2 A Bachelor's Degree from a accredited college or university with a major in chemical dependency, psychology, social work, counseling, nursing or a related fi eld of study and five (5) years of documented clinical experience in the substance abuse treatment field. Eleventh, \u00a77.1.1.1is problematic. It recites as follows: \"No program shall deny any person equal access to its facilities or services on the basis of race, color, religion, ancestry, sexual orientation, gender expression, national origin or disability, unless such disability makes treatment offered by the program non-benef icial or hazardous . [emphasis supplied]\" The underlined exclusion is an inane standard which is not consistent with the ADA, \u00a7504, or the Equal Accommodations statute (Title 6 Del.C. Ch. 45). It is also inconsistent with \u00a77.1.3.1. For example, it would authorize a program to deny services to a Deaf applicant since the Deaf applicant could not benefit from the existing program. Legally, the program must provide accommoda tions to ensure that its program is beneficial to the applicant with disabilities. In this example, the progr am should not be barring the D eaf client from admission. It should be providing a sign-language interpreter. Similarly, there is no \"hazardous\" exception in the ADA [28 C.F.R.\u00a7\u00a735.149-35.150 (public entities); 28 C.F.R. \u00a736.302(priv ate entities)]. For example, it may be \"hazardous\" for a person with ambulatory limitatio ns to climb a stairway to an upper floor location. However, rather than denying that person services, the provider should be providing accommodations (e.g. moving counseling session to groundfloor). If a specialty program does not offer the type of treatment that a pers on with a disability seeks, the program is expected to make a referral to another program. See 28 C.F.R. \u00a736.302(b). If an applicant poses a \"direct threat\" or \"safety\" risk to a private provider, that assessment mu st be made in the context of accommodations. [28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a736.208 and 36.301]. David Parcher of Kent and Sussex County Counseling also commented: It is not financially feasible to have the staff and expert ise readily available to serv e all populations. Most small or mid size programs are not able to afford the high co st of additional staff to provide specialized services. Additional funding needs to be in place. Agency Response : DSAMH agrees. The final order is being changed to read as follows: \"No program shall deny any person equal access to its fa cilities or services on the basis of race, color, religio n, ancestry, sexual orientation, gender, gend er expression, national origin, or disability.\" Twelfth, \u00a77.1.2.1.9 should be expanded to include a reference to advocates and advocacy agencies (See Title 16 Del.C. 2220(7).)Agency Response: 7.1.2.1.9 is in keeping with federal confid entiality law CFR 42 (Part II) which does not allow for the sharing of information with advocates or advocate agencies without proper consent from theconsumer. DSAMH declines this recommendation. Thirteenth, \u00a77.1 would benefit from the addition of a \"catch all\" provision requiring compliance with Title 16 Del.C. \u00a72220. This would be consistent with \u00a78.1.2.1.2.11. 1, which requires programs to provide notice of such rights. Agency Response: DSAMH agrees and changed \u00a77.1.1.3 in the final order to read: \"All agencies shall ensure that they comply with the federal Amer icans with Disabilities Act 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq.; 28 code of Federal Regulations, Part 36 (July 1991) and Title 16 Del.C. \u00a72220. Fourteenth, \u00a7\u00a78.1.2 and 8.1.3 could be strengthened in the context of discharge planning. Compare in the mental health context, \u00a75161(b)(4), which contemplates t hat the discharge plan be developed in consultation with anticipated post discharge providers. See also DLTCRP mental health group home regulations, 16 DE Admin Code 3305, \u00a76.8. Agency Response: DSAMH declines this reco mmendation at this time. Fifteenth, requiring facilities to only maintain records for 12 mo nths [\u00a78.1.4] is too s hort. Contrast the DLTRCP mental health group home regulations [16 DE Administrative Code 3305, \u00a78.1] which require records to be maintained for 7 years . Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that the standard as written does not clearly convey its intent. \u00a78.1.4 has been amended in the final order to read: \"Programs shall provide a minimum of twelve (12) months of records up until and including the expiration date of the current license for the purposes of licensure audit. Programs shall develop a policy that clearly outlines timelines for record retention and storage for all records beyond the required audit period. Sixteenth, there is an extraneous reference to \u00a78.1.2.2 in the marg in next to \u00a710.1.6. Agency Response: The reference to \u00a78.1.2.2 is not extraneous, but refers the reader back to the standards outlining treatment plan development Seventeenth, \u00a712.4.2.2.1 authorizes restrictions on pho ne use. Such restrictions may be precluded by Title 16 Del.C. \u00a72220(11). Agency Response: Best practice policies and procedures take in to consideration the benefits of each policy to the consumer. Programs may chose to restrict pho ne usage if the use would be considered dangerous or counter-therapeutic to a consumer (e.g. a consumer making or receiving phone calls from their drug dealer could cause harm to the consumer and other consumers who participate in treatment at the same program.) DSAMHdoes not think that permitting such limited restrictions would be precluded. Eighteenth, \u00a714.1.1.1.6 categorically precludes admissi on to opioid treatment services unless the applicant has been addicted at least 1 year. This categorical excl usion may unnecessarily limit provider clinical judgment and discretion. This provision should be deleted from the regulations . Agency Response: \u00a714.1.1.1.6 is in compliance with federal re gulations for opioid treatment CFR 42 (Part VIII) \u00a78.12(e)(1) which states : \"...that the person is currently addicted to an opioid drug, and that the person became addicted at least 1 year before admission for tr eatment...\" and applies specifically to Opioid Treatment Programs. DSAMH declines this recommendation. Nineteenth, the rationale for precluding admission to op ioid treatment services by someone released from a penal institution within 6 months [\u00a714.2.1] may also unduly restrict provider discreti on. For example, the applicant could have been in a penal institution (e.g. pre-trial pending release on bail) for only a few days.Agency Response: DSAMH believes that a misreading of \u00a714.2. 1 may have resulted in this comment. Federal regulations require that a person become addi cted at least one year before admission to an Opioid Treatment Program. \u00a714.2.1 provides an exception to th is requirement when clinically appropriate and is in compliance with federa l regulations for opioid treatm ent CFR 42 (Part VIII) \u00a78.12(e) (3) which states: \"If clinically appropriate, the program physician may waive the requirem ent for a 1- year history of addiction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for patients released from a penal institution (within 6 months after release)...\" Twentieth, in \u00a714.7 it would be prefer able to include a provision requiring that the applicant be provided with the specific reasons for denial of admission. Indeed, public entities would be required to provide such information as a matter of due process. Agency Response: DSAMH agrees. \u00a714.7 has been amended to add: \u00a714.7.2 The reasons for non admissi on must be made available in writing to the client upon request. \u00a714.7.2.1 Documentation of the writ ten response to the non admitted client must be entered into the client file. Twenty-first, \u00a714.18.3 categorically bars admission of a client for more than 2 detoxification treatment episodes in 1 year. It is unclear why such a restriction would be in cluded in a licensing standard. If an applicant wishes to \"private pay\" for detoxificat ion, or an insurer will cover su ch costs, why should the State categorically preclude access to detoxification? If DSAMH wishes to impose such a standard for detoxification paid for by the State, itcould do so by contract. Otherwise, providers should be allowed to exercise professional discretion. Agency Response: \u00a714.18.3 is specific to detox tment Program (OTP) for opioid consumers and is in compliance with fede ral regulations for Opioid treatment CFR 42 (Part VIII) \u00a78.12(e)(4) which states:\"Patients with two or more unsuccessful detoxifi cation episodes within a 12-month period must be assessed by the OTP physician for other forms of treatment. A program shall not admit a patient for more than twodetoxification treatment episodes in one year.\" This rest riction would not apply to licensed Detoxification programs. DSAMH declines th is recommendation. Finally, it is noted that there is an absence of standards in the context of criminal backgr ound checks and there is no references to the Adult Abuse Registry or the Child Abuse Registry in relation to hiring and maintaining staff. We highly recommend the inclusion of language that address es these issues. Agency Response: DSAMH agrees and added \u00a75.1.6.3.6 in the final order to read: \"Criminal background checks and previous, substantiated reports to the Adult Abuse and Child Abuse registries,\" Mr. Russel Buskirk and Mr. Chris Devaney of Connec tions, CSP, offered the following observations and recommendations summarized below. DSAMH has considered each comment, found the comments to be helpful and instructive. A. Under \u00a73.0 \"Definitions\", where is the definition for \"Program Director?\" (Ms. Samantha Hurd also asked this question.) Agency Response: DSAMH has reviewed the use of the term \"P rogram Director\" in the standards and the final order will be amended as follows : all reference to \"Program Directo r\" will be struck and replaced with Administrator. B. Under \u00a74.15.3: The standard states: \"No waiver sha ll be granted for any requirement in \u00a7\u00a7 6.1.2; 6.1.3 or 6.1.4 of these regulations. This will create undue hardship in a situation where an indi vidual does not meet the norm. (David Parcher of Kent and Sussex County Counse ling, Bruce Lorenz of Threshold, Inc., Jim Elder of CiviGenics and Ms. Samantha Hurd offered similar responses.) Agency Response: DSAMH agrees. This restriction has been removed.C. Under \u00a7\u00a75.1.7.3.1 and 5.1.7.3.2 fifteen (15) hours sp ecific to training and education in the treatment of alcohol and other drugs of abuse and six (6) hours specific to training and education in providing culturally competent services: Is this in addition to Certification/Licensure requirements? Agency Response: DSAMH has taken this comment and su bsequent discussion with commenters into consideration and has modified \u00a7\u00a75.1.7. 3.1 and 5.1.7.3.2 as follows. A \u00a75.1.7.3.3 has been added. This is not in addition to the Certification/Licensure requir ements applicable to private practitioners. Ten (10) hours specific to training and education in the treatment of alcohol and other drugs of abuse; and Three (3) hours specific to training and education in providing culturally competence services; and Three (3) hours of training specific to ethics training and education. D. Under 5.1.7.5 in regards to training in hepatitis; HIV/AIDS; Tuberculosis; and other sexually transmitted diseases: Will DSAMH Training office be able to accommodate clinical staff in having these subject/training areas available in the annual training catalogue? (David Parcher of Kent and Sussex County Counseling offered a similar response in regards to this training.) Agency Response: The DSAMH Training office provides comprehensive training throughout the year on a variety of subjects which may include hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and other sexually tran smitted diseases. DSAMH conducts a needs assessment and training is prov ided according to the identified needs of the field. E. Under \u00a76.0 is there any consideration for a per son with a Bachelor's, CADC or certain amount of experience for the position of Clinical Director? (Michael Kriner of Gateway Foundation, Jim Elder of CiviGenics, Bruce Johnson of PACE, Inc and Ms. Samantha Hu rd offered similar comments and recommendations.) Agency Response: DSAMH acknowledges that there may be indi viduals with a Bachelor's Degree, CADC and five (5) years of experience who would be competent in meeting the responsibilities of the Clinical Director. In these cases, programs may request a waiver of this standard under \u00a74.15.1. F. Under \u00a7\u00a76.0; 6.1.3.1; 6.1.4.1: Do the imposed time limits to meet the standard support the current needs of the work force and/or assist in securing long term employme nt stability for facilities? (David Parcher of Kent and Sussex County Counseling and on behalf of DCB, Bruce Lo renz of Thresholds, Steve Martin of the University of Delaware's Addiction Studies Department, Jim Elder of CiviGenics, Ms. Katherin e Harding and Ms. Samantha Hurd offered similar comments.) Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that the time limits do not me et the needs of the current or future work force and has amended the final order to remove the time limits. A \"grandfathering\" provision has been added as\u00a76.1.6. G. Under 6.1.4.1.1: Can there be further definition of \"nationally recognized body in addictions counseling?\" Would this include forensic counselors and counselors ce rtified by the National Association for Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselors (NAADAC) and National Counselor's Cert ification (NCC)? (David Pa rcher of Kent and Sussex County Counseling and on behalf of DCB, Bruce Lorenz of Thresholds, Inc. and Michael Kriner of Gateway Foundation offered similar comments.) Agency Response: Nationally recognized body in addictions counseling would include forensic counselors, NAADC and NCC as well as any credential offered by a Nation al organization that offers a certification specific to addictions counseling. H. Under 6.1.5; Assistant Counselor: Can there be further clarification of \"Assistant Counselor?\" Agency Response: \"Assistant Counselor\" is a term of art used to encompass a wide range of professionals who are beginners in the substance abuse treatment field. DSAMH realizes that the term can be confusing. The final order has been amended to strike \"Assistant Coun selor\" from the standards and replace it with the term \"Counselor II\" to relate the position back to counseling functions within a program.I. Under \u00a76.1.5.2, reference is made to individuals with less than 5 years of experience as meeting the criteria for Assistant Counselor. Would that account for anyone else who generally wants to be an addictions/AODA counselor? Agency Response: Assistant Counselor (now Counselor II) is the term used in these standards to accommodate the wide range of prof essionals who are beginners in the substance abuse treatment field. J. Under \u00a78.1.1.1.5: Records are to be updated within twen ty-four (24) hours of delivery of services. Is there consideration for 48 or 72 hours in hardship situations or completion for Friday services for outpatient programs? Agency Response: Documentation of services provided to or on behalf of the consumer should be completed as soon after provision of services as possible. D SAMH does not think this standard should be revised. K. Under \u00a78.1.2.1.2.19.1: \"Signed by the counselor completing the assessment;\" Can the Assistant Counselor perform this task? Agency Response: \u00a78.1.2.1.2.19.1 refers to the signatures of staff completi ng the assessment and would include the Assistant Counselor (Counselor II in the final order.) L. Under \u00a78.1.2.3.1 \"treatment plans shall be review ed and revised by the client and his/her primary counselor no less often than the intervals specifie d...;\" Can the Assistant Counselor complete this task. Agency Response: The Assistant Counselor (Counselor II under the final order) completes this task under the supervision of the Clinical Supervisor. M. Under \u00a78.1.2.5.1 \"primary counselor\" is used as a descriptor . Does this apply to the Counselor position, Assistant Counselor position or both? Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that this is in need of clarif ication. The final order has been amended to remove the word \"primary\". N. Under \u00a78.1.2.7.1 which states: \"...the program shall complete a discharge summary within seventy-two (72) hours of discharge...;\" Is there a reason this has been decreased from 5 days (current standard) to 3 days? (Michael Kriner of Gateway Foundation made a similar comment.) Agency Response: Documentation of services provided to or on behalf of the consumer should be completed as soon after provision of services as possible. This includes discharge planning and documentation which should be completed with the participation of the consumer. D SAMH does not think this standard should be revised. O. Under \u00a7\u00a78.1.2.7.2.6 & 8.1.2.7.2.7 there is referenc e to the summary of the client's progress toward meeting the treatment plan goals and a summary of the client 's participation in treatment. Can the narrative include both? Agency Response: \u00a7\u00a78.1.2.7.2.6 & 8.1.2. 7.2.7 specify the information to be captured in treatment planning documentation. A format that includes this in formation in a single narrative is acceptable. P. Under \u00a78.1.2.7.3.2 the discharge is to be completed by the \"primary counselor.\" Does this apply to the Counselor position, Assistant Counselor position or both? Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that this is in need of clarif ication. The final order has been amended to remove the word \"primary\". Q. Under \u00a78.1.3 programs are to provide a list of refe rral sources for the clients' various needs when the agency is unable to meet the needs inte rnally. How is this to be documented? Agency Response: \u00a78.1.3 specifies the information to be capt ured in referral documentation. The specific format that includes this informatio n is at the discretion of the program.R. Under \u00a78.1.4 programs are required to keep a minimum of twelve (12) months of records up and until the expiration date of the current license. This could be a significant volume of record s particularly for outpatient programs. Agency Response: Licensure audits are based on the review of documents completed up to one year prior to the current expiration date of the license and should be made available upon request by DSAMH. In order to clearly delineate between required records for an nual audit and overall record retention, \u00a78.1.3 4 has been amended as follows: \"Programs shall provide a minimum of twelve (12) months of records up until and includingthe expiration date of the current lic ense for the purposes of licensure audit. Programs shall develop a policy that clearly outlines timelines for record retention and storag e for all records beyond the required audit period.\" S. Under \u00a79.1.2.3 facilities must provide \"...restro oms for clients, visitors and staff...\" Do these have to be separate bathrooms? Agency Response: \u00a79.1.2.3 requires the availab ility of restrooms for those in dividuals usin g the facility. Programs are free to c hoose how to provide these at their individual facility. There is no requirement for separate bathrooms for clients, for visitors, for staff. T. Under \u00a712.1.1.6 treatment planning required by 8.1.2. 2 within seventy-two hours (72) of admission. How is this different from the initial treatment plan due within forty-eight (48) hours? Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that the requirements for trea tment plans are confusing. The final order as been amended as follows: \u00a78.1.2.2 \"An individual , Master Comprehensive Treatment Plan, developed in partnership with the client shall be completed...\" Definitions for \"Initial Treatment Plan, Master Comprehensive Treatment Plan and Periodic Treatment Plan Review/Revision have been added in \u00a73.0. U. Under \u00a712.1.1.8 and in accordance with \u00a78.1.2.3 treat ment plan update and revision is due on the thirtieth (30) day and every thirty ( 30) days thereafte r. In a thirty (30) day period co nsumer/clients will have had up to four treatment plans/reviews. Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that the description of treatm ent planning is confusing. The final order has been amended to include the following definitions: \"Initial Treatment Plan means a preliminary plan that addresses short term goals the program plans to achieve in the earliest days of treatment. The initial treatment plan shall be in effect until the master comprehensive treatment plan has been developed. Master Comprehensive Treatment Plan means a treatment plan that is formulated from the comprehensive assessment as outlined in \u00a78 .1.2.1.2.14. and in the format outlin ed in \u00a78.1.2.2.1. Periodic Treatment Plan Review/Revis ion is a process whereby the clinic al supervisor and counselor review prior treatment plans and establish new goals based on th e client's progress and/or changing needs through out treatment.\" \u00a78.1.2.2 has also been amended as follows: \"An indivi dual, Master Comprehensive Treatment Plan, developed in partnership with the clie nt shall be completed...\" V. Under \u00a712.2.4 a minimum of 1 hour of face-to-face supervision per week be tween the counselor and clinical supervisor is required. Can this occur individually or as a treatment team? Agency Response: \u00a712.2.4 outlines the minimum requirement for supervision of the clinical staff by the clinical supervisor. It is acceptable to meet this mi nimum standard in individual or group supervision or both. W. Under \u00a715.1.1.4 the frequency of treatment plan revision has increased from every 90 days to every 60 days. Is there clinical justification fo r this? (David Parcher of Kent and Sussex County Counseling, Janice Sneed of Brandywine Counseling, Inc., Bruce Lorenz of Threshol ds, Inc., and Ms. Katherin e Harding offered similar 0bservations.)Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that the 90 day intervals for treatment plan revision remain acceptable. The final order has been amended to stat e: \"Treatment plan revision...every ni nety (90) days after the effective date of the initial treatment plan.\" X. Under \u00a715.1.1.5 a schedule for individual, group and fa mily counseling is to be reviewed at the time of the treatment plan review. Do I document this as part of the treatment plan revision? Agency Response : Yes. All services provided to the consum er are to be documented on the treatment plan and treatment plan review. Y. Under \u00a715.2 there is a requirement that all servic es offered at locations other than the program's main building meet the requir ements of \u00a79.0 (Client Rights) in full. Where does this apply? Agency Response : The requirement under \u00a715.2 applies to programs providing services away from the program's main building (e.g . in the case of a satellite site) and as sure client rights are met in full when documentation is transported from one site to another. Z. Under \u00a7\u00a716.5.1.1.2 & 17.0 programs are required to be in compliance with \u00a76.0. If an agency has CARF or JACHO accreditation, the agency must meet this standard. Will waivers be granted to providers that have Deemed Status? Agency Response: DSAMH has amended \u00a74.15 to allow agency's to request waiver for the requirements of \u00a76.0. All programs, including those with Deemed Status, are eligible for waiver under \u00a74.15. AA. Under \u00a715.1.1.1.1 how is a \"good faith effo rt\" to receive physicals to be documented. Agency Response : Any attempt to request a physical from a pr imary care physician (PCP), including any written correspondence to the PCP, and/or any attempts to have the consumer acquire a physical exam should be documented in the clinical file. Imad Jarwan of the Department of Corrections offered the following comments summarized below: The Department of Corrections (DOC) operates su bstance abuse programs based on Therapeutic Community (TC) standards. The TC model of treatment advocates the use of recovering addicts as counselors to promote theuse of addicts and ex-addicts and/or offenders in key le adership and counseling positions. The proposed education and training background for clinical staff provides a hardship to correction substance abuse programs as \"...(program) graduates who have a Bachelor's Degree or a Master's Degree is very dim at best...based on the historical educational level of our TC graduates, it is near impossible to have a Key graduate who holds a Master's Degree. The following options are offered for consideration: A. Apply the current Therapeutic Community Accredit ation (TCA) standards to the DOC's substance abuse treatment programs in place of the proposed standards. (Steven Martin of the Center for Drug and Alcohol Studies:University of Delaware offered similar comment.) Agency Response: DSAMH and DOC have discussed alternativ es to the application of the proposed standards with respect to DOC programs. It has been determined that the best course at this time is to apply the proposed standards. DSAMH and DOC have agreed that, where necessary to accommodate the requirements of the corrections environment, DOC programs will request waivers as re quired and that DSAMH will consider reasonable alternative practices designed to maintain quality of care. B. Exclude the DOC's substance abuse programs from th e proposed educational requirements for providers. Agency Response: DSAMH and DOC have discussed alternativ es to the application of the proposed standards with respect to DOC programs. It has been determined that the best course at this time is to apply the proposed standards. DSAMH and DOC have agreed that, where necessary to accommodate the requirements ofthe corrections environment, DOC programs will request waivers as re quired and that DSAMH will consider reasonable alternative practices designed to maintain quality of care. C. Provide a statement that states that when DSAMH standard is in conflict with DOC's policies and procedures, the DOC's policies and pr ocedures will supers ede DSAMH standard. Agency Response: DSAMH and DOC have discussed alternativ es to the application of the proposed standards with respect to DOC programs. It has been determined that the best course at this time is to apply the proposed standards. DSAMH and DOC have agreed that, where necessary to accommodate the requirements of the corrections environment, DOC programs will request waivers as re quired and that DSAMH will consider reasonable alternative practices designed to maintain quality of care. D. \u00a7\u00a77.1.2.1.3 (right to participate in grievance proced ure); 7.1.2.1.4 (informing a client that treatment is voluntary); 12.4.1.3 (Privacy for personal hygiene) and 12.4.1.7 (Space for solitude) present as a hardship for DOCsubstance abuse programs. (Jim Elder of Civigenics and Steve Martin of the University of Delaware Drug and Alcohol Studies Department offered a similar comment.) Agency Response: DSAMH and DOC have discussed alternativ es to the application of the proposed standards with respect to DOC programs. It has been determined that the best course at this time is to apply the proposed standards. DSAMH and DOC have agreed that, where necessary to accommodate the requirements of the corrections environment, DOC programs will request waivers as re quired and that DSAMH will consider reasonable alternative practices designed to maintain quality of care. E. Keep the old standard (\u00a712.0) which states: \"Alcoholism or drug abuse treatment programs operating within a correctional institution shall comply with standa rds applicable to program type, and in accordance with established regulations of the Department of Corrections as appropriate.\" Agency Response: DSAMH and DOC have discussed alternativ es to the application of the proposed standards with respect to DOC programs. It has been determined that the best course at this time is to apply the proposed standards. DSAMH and DOC have agreed that, where necessary to accommodate the requirements of the corrections environment, DOC programs will request waivers as re quired and that DSAMH will consider reasonable alternative practices designed to maintain quality of care. Jim Elder of Civigenics offered the following observations and recommendations summarized below. DSAMH has considered each comment, found the comments to be helpful and instructive and have, adopted some of thesuggestions made. A. There are some ambiguities abou t what is meant by Clin ical Director and Clinical Supervisor. The distinction is not clear. (Steve Martin and Daniel O'Connell of the University of Delaware Drug and Alcohol Studies Department and Ms. Samantha Hurd offered similar comment.) Agency Response : DSAMH agrees that the distin ction between Clinical Director and Clinical Supervisor is not clear. The definition of Clinical Dir ector in \u00a73.0 has been amended as follows: \"'Clinical Director' means an individual who, by virtue of educat ion, training, and experience meets the requirements of 6.1.2.1 of these regulations; and is authorized by the Administrator to prov ide clinical and administrati ve oversight of the treatment program. The Clinical Director may also serve as Clinical Supervisor when di rected to do so by the agency's governing body.\" The definition of Clinical Superviso r in \u00a73.0 has been amen ded as follows: \"'Clinical Supervisor' means an individual who, by virtue of education, training and ex perience, satisfies the requirements of 6.1.3.1 of these regulations; and is authorized by the Administrator and/or the governing body to provide clinical supervision to all clinical staff.\" B. \u00a76.1.2.1.1 as written requires a Master' Degree. I would like DSAMH to add the following requirements for Clinical Director: 1.) Bachelor's Degree in Counseling, Behaviora l Science, Human Services, Sociology, Education,or Criminal Justice, 2,) a current CADC certification and 3.) Five years of ex perience in the field. (Bruce Johnson of PACE and Ms. Samantha Hurd offered similar comment.) Agency Response : DSAMH accepts the recommendation to expand credentialing for the position of Clinical Director. The final order has been amended as follows: \"6.1.2.1.2: A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited collegeor university with a major in chemical dependency, psycho logy, social work, counseling, nursing or a related field, full certification as an alcohol and drug counselor and five (five) years of clinical experience in the substance abuse treatment field, including two years of management experience. David Parcher, Executive Direct or of Kent and Sussex Counseling offered the following comments and recommendations summarized below. DSAMH has considered each comment, found the comments to be helpful and instructive and have, adopted some of the suggestions made. A. \u00a75.1.7.2 requires 30 hours of training annually instea d of 20 hours which is the requirement for certification or professional clinical license. Provi ders are having difficulty meeting the current 20 hours of training per year. In addition, Six hours of cultural compet ence training is requir ed under \u00a75.1.7.3. This seems excessive. Who will review this to make sure it is alcohol and drug specif ic? (Howard Isenberg of Open Door, Inc., Michael Kriner of Gateway Foundation, Bruce Lorenz of Thresholds, Bruce Johnson of PACE, Inc. and David Parcher on behalf of the DCB offered similar comments.) Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that the increase to 30 hours of training annually from 20 hours of training annually is excessive. The final order has been amended to read \"Clinical supervisors and all staff providing counseling services to clients shall co mplete at least twenty (20) hours of training annually including: Ten (10) hours specific to training and education in the treatm ent of alcohol and other drugs of abuse; Three (3) hours specific to training and education in providing cultura lly competence services; and Three (3) hours of training specific to ethics training and education. (Note: Only \u00a75.1.7.3, not \u00a75.1.7 .2, addresses hours of annual training; \u00a75.1.7.3 has been amended accordingly.) DSAMH's Licensing and Medicaid Ce rtification Unit will be responsibl e for reviewing documentation to determine if training is alcohol and drug specific. B. Requirements for \u00a76.1 .3.1.2 for Clinical Supervisor should be more stringent if a CADC is not required. (David Parcher on behalf of DCB and Ms. Samantha Hurd offered similar comments.) Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that the requirements for Clinic al Supervisor are uncl ear. \u00a76.1.3.1.2 has been amended as follows: \"A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited college or universi ty with a major in chemical dependency, psychology, social work, counseling, nursing or a related fi eld of study and five (5) years of documented clinical experience in th e substance abuse treatment field.\" C. \u00a76.1.4.1.3 appears to negate the importance of certification and th e specific training and one on one supervision required to assure competence as a chemical dependency counselor. (David Parcher on behalf of the Dela ware Certification Board, Bruce Lore nz of Thresholds, Bruce Johnson of PACE, Inc and on behalf of the Delaware Association fo r Addictions Counselors and Ms. Samantha Hurd offered similar comments.) Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that the requirements for Counselor I are unclear. \u00a76.1.4.1.3 has been amended as follows: \"Five (5) years of documented clinic al experience working in the field of substance abuse treatment.\" DSAMH believes that this minimum requirem ent coupled with the requir ed clinical supervision adequately assure competence as a chemical dependency counselor. D. \u00a78.1.2 will require additional data co llected by the ASI and modification of the current face sheet. DSAMH reviewed paperwork burden with its contractual provider s a couple of years ago. The proposed changes do not appear consistent with that effort. Agency Response : DSAMH believes this to be a matter that is better addressed within the context of particular contract issues with its contracted providers.E. \u00a78.1.2 requires consent/disclosure regarding each medication (and its side effects) prescribed by the program physician. Would this apply to daily doses of methadone or suboxone or would consent/disclosure be completed just once? Agency Response: In the case of medication co nsent/disclosure, the physician reviews the medication and its side effects before the first dose of the medication. C onsent/disclosure is not needed for each dose of the medication. F. \u00a79.3.3 requires staff on site at all times who are trained in basic fi rst aid and CPR. This will cause a financial burden. Would everyone on staff have to be trained? Agency Response: Staff on site at all times who are trained in basic first aid and CPR provides assurances of appropriate intervention during medical emergencies. Progra ms are required to have at least one person available during hours of operation that have the mentioned tr aining. DSAMH allows individual programs to determine whether or not they will train their entire staff. G. \u00a715.1.1.3 requires the treatment planning in accordance with \u00a78.1.2.2 within thirty (30) days of admission or by the fourth (4) counseling session, which ever occurs first. Does this include group sessions? If so, it would present challenges in regard to getting the client ac tively involved in treatment an d still complete the treatment plan by the fourth session. Agency Response: The admission date referred to in \u00a715.1.1.3 is established by the individual program. Treatment planning in accordance with \u00a78.1.2.2 is required within 30 days of the established admission date, or by the fourth counseling session (whichever occurs first) and includes any treatment session that the consumer participates in as a part of their substance abuse tr eatment program. This may include group or individual treatment. H. \u00a714.0 (Opioid Treatment Services) requires testin g for CBC, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Tetanus immunization review. This will increase th e cost of treatment per client signif icantly. (Janice Sn eed of Brandywine Counseling, Inc. and Ms. Katherine Harding offered similar comments.) Agency Response: In order to allow opioid program providers to establish standards of care for admission to opioid treatment DSAMH agrees that an amendment to \u00a714. 1.1.1.10 of the final orde r is needed. The amendment states: \"Laboratory tests including serology and other tests deemed necessary by the program physician within 14 days of admission...\". Some tests specified in the sub-se ctions to \u00a714.1.1.1.10 in the proposed standards have been removed and subsections have been renumbered as necessary. I. \u00a714.1.1.2 requires assessment of ea ch client every (90) da ys by the program physic ian. This will result in more paperwork and more tracking. Agency Response: \u00a78.12(4)(f)(4) of CFR 42 (Part II) (Federal Standards for opioid treatment) state: \"Each patient accepted for treatment at an OTP shall be assessed initially and periodically by qualified personnel to determine the most appropriate combination of services and treatment.\" DSAM H will require assessment every 90 days in conjunction with clinical supe rvision and treatment plan review as pe r \u00a715.1.1.4 of the amended final order. J. \u00a714.14.1.2 states that no client may receive more th an two weeks of take homes. This is more restrictive than the federal guidelines (CFR 42 (Part II).) (Ms. Katherine Harding offered similar comments.) Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that the proposed state stan dards should be consistent with federal regulations for opioid treatment. The final order has been amended to delete this restriction. K. DSAMH had TRI review paperwork burden in an effort to reduce the burden on staff. This appears to conflict with that effort. Agency Response : DSAMH believes this to be a matter that is better addressed within the context of particular contract issues with its contracted providers.Michael Kriner, Community Director at Gate way Foundation offered the following comments and recommendations summarized below. DSAMH has considered each comment, found the comments to be helpful and instructive and have, adopted some of the suggestions made. A. Should a counselor be doing the supervision of an intern? Wouldn't it be advisable for the clinical supervisor to supervise an intern? Agency Response: At a minimum, a clinician should be responsible for the oversight of an intern. DSAMH acknowledges that many pr ograms will assign supervision tasks to just the Clinical Supervisor. DSAMH also acknowledges that ultimately, the Clinical Supervis or is responsible for the overall clinical program. B. \"Licensed Practice Nurse\" means a person licensed by the state of Delaware as a Practical Nurse. DSAMH should consider accepting nursing personnel who are licensed in states that are in the interstate compact. Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that Practical Nurses licensed in states that participate in the National Licensure Compact (NLC) should be eligible for employment in Delaware substance abuse treatment programs.The final order will be amended to state: \"'Licensed Practical Nurse ' means a person licensed by the State of Delaware as a Practical Nurse or a person licensed by a st ate that participates in the National Licensure Compact (NLC).\" C. \u00a75.1.4.2 requires that the Governing Body review and update the policy and procedure manual annually. We suggest that DSAMH allow a designee appointed by the Governing Body to review and update the policy and procedure manual annually. Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that a Governing Body should have the authority to appoint a designee to review and update the policy and procedure manual annua lly. The final order has been amended to state: \"The program's policies and procedures manual shall be review ed at least annually by the governing body or its designee.\" D. \u00a76.1.1.2.1.2 requires two (2) years of management experience for individuals hired as program Administrators. Is management exper ience specific to management in substance abuse programs? We would suggest that management experience be specific to substance abuse programs. Agency Response: The Governing Body will be responsible for making de cisions about the type of management experience the program will accept for th e position of Administra tor. DSAMH declines this recommendation. E. \u00a76.1.3.1.1 requires a Clinical Supervisor to obta in a Bachelor's Degree from an accredited college or university...and full certification as an addictions counselor in the state of Delaware or nationally recognized body in addictions counseling. We believe that a person with a Master's Degree and a CADC would qualify as a Clinical Supervisor. Agency Response: The requirements for Clinical Supervisor as ou tlined in \u00a76.1.3. 1.1 are minimum requirements for the position of Clin ical Supervisor. Individuals with cr edentials that e xceed the minimum requirement, as in the exampl e provided, would meet the stan dard for Clinical Supervisor. F. \u00a76.1.5 outlines the qualifications and background for an Assistant Counselor (someone who has worked in the addictions field for less than five years) and suggests that this individual is able to provide the same functions as a Counselor. We suggest that this position have limited duties and more training. Agency Response: The Assistant Counselor (now Counselor II) outlines minimum standards for individuals who are new to the substance abuse treatment field. D SAMH acknowledges that the standard as written causes confusion and implies that the Counselor II position is equi valent to the Counselor position. To clearly outline the increased level of supervision required for the Counselor II position, \u00a75.1.6.4.2 of the final order has been amended and states: \"Documentation of Supervision as required in 6.1.5.2 and 6.1. 5.3.\" \u00a76.1.5 has been amended to include: \"\u00a76.1.5.2. The individual must receive c linical supervision by the Clinic al Supervisor a minimum of one(1) hour per every twenty (20) hours of c linical services provided to clients. \" and \"\u00a76.1.5.3 The Clinical Supervisor must review all documentation developed by the Coun selor II for accuracy and clinical appropriateness.\" G. \u00a711.3.5 requires a counselor to be on site and available to clients at least eight (8) hours a day, seven (7) days per week and available on call twenty-four (24) hours a day. Would a supervisor suffice? Agency Response: In considering this comment, DSAMH determined that \u00a711.0 should be revised to Non- Residential Detoxification. \u00a711.0 has been amended and the final order will state : \"11.0 Standards Applicable to Non Residential Detoxification. \u00a711.1 Services required as determined by the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health.\" \u00a7\u00a7 11.2 through 11.4 have been struck from the final order. Bruce Lorenz, Executive Director of Thresholds, In c., offered the following comments and recommendations summarized below. DSAMH has considered each comment, found the comments to be helpful and instructive andhave, adopted some of the suggestions made. A. \u00a75.1.6.3.5.8 requires documentation of the staff me mber's abilities to provid e culturally competent services. While cultural competence is important this standard lends little clarity to determining competence. Beyond a statement asserting that the counselor is competent, how is this to be documented? Agency Response : \u00a7\u00a75.1.6.3.5.8; 5. 1.7.1.1.6; 5.1.7.3. 2; 5.1.8.3.1.1 and the definition section of the standards address cultural competence including documentation of staff's competence (\u00a75.1.6.3.5.8); agency policies and procedures providing training for staf f (\u00a75.1.7.1.1.6); required hours of an nual training for each staff person in cultural competence (\u00a75.1.7.3.2); and the agency's responsib ility to provide culturally competent clinical services including an agency self assessment to determine the cu ltural needs of the population that the agency serves (\u00a7\u00a75.1.8.3.1.1 & 5.1.8.3.1.1.1) Documentation of how each standard is being met by the agency as well asdocumentation of staff training and consideration for cu lturally competent provision of services on the annual employee evaluation would all be acceptable means to document cultural competence. B. \u00a76.1.5.1.1 outlines the educational and experiential requirements for Assistance Counselor and refers the reader to \u00a76.1.4. The referenced standard does not have an educational requirement. Agency Response : DSAMH agrees that \u00a76.1.4 does not identify educational requirements for the position of Assistant Counselor ( Counselor II in the final order.) The final order has been ame nded to state: \"\u00a76.1.5.1.1 A person who does not meet the educational and experiential qu alifications for the position of Counselor I as set forth in 6.1.4 may be employed as an Counsel or II if the individual holds a minimum of a high school diploma or its equivalent and meets at least one of the following:\" C. \u00a76.1.5.2 is accura te. \"If someone waits around for five years they will qua lify to meet the licensure standard. Agency Response: DSAMH agrees that the requirements for Counselor I (\"Counselor in the proposed order) and Counselor II (Assistant Counselor in the proposed order) are unclear. \u00a76.1.4.1.3 has been amended asfollows: \"Five (5) years of documented clinical experience in the substanc e abuse treatment field.\" \u00a76.1.5.1.1.1 \"The individual has less than five (5) years of docume nted clinical experience in the substance abuse treatment field.\" DSAMH believes that this mini mum requirement coupled with the requi red clinical supe rvision adequately assure competence as a chemical dependency counselor. The language in \u00a76.1.5.2 as proposed has beendeleted. D. \u00a717.5.1.1.1.7 references the reader to \u00a75.1.9 of the standards. There is no \u00a75.1.9 in the standards. Agency Response : DSAMH agrees that the reference is erroneo us. The final order has been amended and the reference to \u00a75.1.9 has been deleted. E. In \u00a75.1.7, staff training and development should incl ude training a familiarity with MRSA as part of the training on infectious diseases.Agency Response: The proposed standards are minimum standards of care. Agencies are encouraged to remain up to date on infectious diseases, including MRSA that may require further training for staff. Specific infectious diseases have not been named, but are left to the discretion of the program to be determined as appropriate to the needs of the program. DSAMH declines this recommendation. (Daniel O'Connell offered this additional comment.) The new standards set a lofty goal for higher levels of education without means to attain it. Other states (e.g. Maryland) offered reimbursement of tuition or partial tu ition for other professions when the minimum educational goal was raised. It would be prudent to provide a mechanism so that interested parties ca n more suitably attain the goal. Agency Response : DSAMH agrees that the minimum educational requirements may present as challenging to substance abuse treatment profession als. DSAMH is not in a position at this time to offer reimbursement for individuals pursuing college degrees. Ms. Samantha Hurd offered the following observatio ns and recommendations summarized below. DSAMH has considered each comment, found the comments to be help ful and instructive and hav e, adopted some of the suggestions made. A. \u00a76.1.3.1.1. references a degree in Chemical Dependency as an acceptable degree program. However, I am not aware of this type of degree at the Bachelor's level. I would like DSAMH to consider replacing the ChemicalDependency degree with one that is accessib le in Delaware at the Bachelor's level. Agency Response: \u00a76.1.3.1.1. is a list of degrees that may be obtained by professionals within and outside of the state of Delaware (e.g. Delaware Technical Community College offe rs degrees and certificates in chemical dependency counseling). It is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather offer guidance in the human service skills needed by individuals seeking to provide substance abuse treatment. We also note that this section has beenamended to include \"or a related field of study.\" DSAMH declines this recommendation. B. The proposed stand ards could possibly omit t he current CADC qualifications for Clinical Supervisor. I would like to suggest that DSAMH consider maki ng the CADC mandatory for Clinical Supervisors. Agency Response : DSAMH acknowledges the CADC credential as a respected credential and supports individuals who continue to work toward credentialing as a CADC. DSAMH also acknowledges the work force crisis in regards to the shrinking number of CADC's in th e state of Delaware. DSAMH declines this recommendation. C. \u00a76.1.2 implies that Clinic al Directors would report to Administrators as outlined in \u00a76.1.1. Administrators have less of an educational requirement. I believe this to be incongruent to typical management hierarchy. Agency Response: The educational requirements in \u00a7\u00a76.1.1 and 6.1.2 reference positions that may require different skill sets and theref ore, different educational re quirements. For example, T he Clinical Director's position requires education and background that prepares an indi vidual to deliver and supervise clinical services to substance abusing consumers. Administrators may not be calle d upon to deliver clinical services. Ultimately, hiring for the position of Administrator an d minimum qualifications within the program would be established by the program's Governing Body.
