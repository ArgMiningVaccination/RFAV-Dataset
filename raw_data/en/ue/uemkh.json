Here are some of the most effective remedies that you can try to treat this hormonal disorder. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that around 15 per cent of women of childbearing age experience. Women with this hormonal disorder may experience symptoms like irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism, acne, male- pattern hair loss, elevated blood sugar levels, subfertility, increased incidence of miscarriage and a variety of other health problems. PCOS is also the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. The good news here is that PCOS is treatable and there are many ways to treat or even eliminate all the symptoms of PCOS completely. Practising mindful yoga is one of the ways to treat this condition naturally. Introduction of mindful yoga into the routines of women with PCOS also helped to reduce acne breakouts and improve menstrual regularity. Lifestyle modifications like a nutritious diet and exercise can also keep the symptoms of PCOS at bay. Home Remedies To Manage Your PCOS Symptoms Instead of opting for over the counter medication or hormone therapy some women seek out natural alternatives. If you wish to try out the natural alternatives feel free to proceed, but have a word with your doctor first. Your health care provider can help in creating a plan that works best for you. Some of the home remedies that help PCOS symptoms are as follows: 1. Fenugreek Or Methi Seeds Fenugreek or methi seeds is used to help ease gastrointestinal problems. But it has therapeutic abilities that go far beyond this purpose. A study published in the International Journal of Medical Sciences suggested that fenugreek seed extracts can help treat conditions like ovarian cysts, various symptoms of PCOS and increase a woman's chances of fertility. In this study, women with PCOS who had problems with conception were provided with fenugreek seed extracts in the form of capsules. Each capsule was around 500 mg and was administered for a period of 90 days. When this study was concluded it was noted that about 71 per cent of women had a regular menstrual cycle and 12 per cent of them conceived during the treatment. Regular consumption of fenugreek seeds helps in the secretion of the luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) that help ward off the symptoms of PCOS. 2. Coconut Oil Coconut oil is one of the best choices for women with PCOS. It contains Medium Chain Fatty Acids (MCFA) and a variety of antioxidants that help regulate your blood sugar and insulin secretion levels. Coconut oil can also be easily digested and thus serves as a quick energy boost as well. It may also aid in your weight loss journey as it helps you burn off excess calories. For women with PCOS, losing just 10% of their body weight can bring their periods back to normal. Weight loss also improves insulin sensitivity and relieves some of the symptoms of this hormonal disorder. 3. Green Tea The antioxidants like catechins which are present in green tea can tackle the hormones which lead to ovarian cysts. Drinking green tea can also help reduce insulin levels and also help beat the bulge. A study which was published in 2017 concluded that regular consumption of green tea can lead to weight loss, decreased fasting insulin levels and also lower levels of testosterone with PCOS. 4.
