Tetanus vaccination is one of the most frequently administered vaccines as a part of wound managementand was also found to be associated with increased serum IgE levels. We hypothesized that the vaccina- tion modies the risk of allergic diseases through epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation. Method: Data on tetanus vaccination between 10 and 18 years of age was collected from a birth cohort established on the Isle of Wight UK in 1989. DNA methylation data were collected from individuals at different ages (at birth [n = 30], age 10 [n = 34], age 18 [n = 245] and [n = 121]) using the Illumina Innium HumanMethylation450 K array. Firstly, we performed an epigenome-widescreening to identify cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) associated with tetanus vaccination in 18-year-olds. Secondly, we tested their association with asthma, allergic sensitization, eczema, serum IgE and pulmonary lung function (FVC, and FEF25-75%). We then described changesin the methylation of the selected CpG sites over age, and by vaccination status.Results: Tetanus vaccination was found to be associated with decreased methylation of cg14472551 (p value 0.5 /C210 /C05, FDR-adjusted p value 2.1 and increased (p value 0.0007, FDR-adjusted p value 0.014). Both CpGs, in turn, were associated with decreased risk of asthma at18 years of age. Cg14472551 is located in an intron of KIAA1549L, whose protein binds to a B-cell com- mitment transcription factor; cg01669161 is located between an regulator the assembly chaperone PSMG3, with decreased serum IgE levels. Conclusion: DNA methylation changes following tetanus vaccination may offer a novel prospect to explain a differential occurrence of asthma in adolescence. /C2112016 The Author(s).

Introduction Vaccination is related to widespread immunity and eradication of many infectious diseases [1,2] . Vaccines induce acquired activeimmunity, which initiates a cascade of differentiation of immune cells into effector and memory cells [3,4] . Vaccines, along with booster doses generate immune memory cells to maintain long-lasting or lifelong protection against a specic antigen [4,5] . The tetanus vaccine has adjuvant effects and has been associated with upregulating total and specic immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies [6,7] , which in turn play a vital role in allergic diseases. Effects of vaccination on the prevalence of allergic diseases remain in debate. To assess their association, several studies have been conducted [7-12] . Scheduled childhood vaccination of DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) has been reported to be associated http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.068 0264-410X/ /C2112016 The Author(s).

Similar ndings were reported in children and adolescents (2 months to 16 years of age), conclud- ing that DTP and tetanus vaccination (TVac) were associated with increased risk of allergies [7]. Conversely, the DPPT (Diphtheria, Polio, Pertussis, Tetanus) and MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccines were not linked with physician diagnosed asthma or eczema in children in one birth cohort study [11]. A lack of associations was also reported in a population-based cohort study (TAHS-Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study), which followed participants from 7 to 45 years of age [9]. Thus, whether allergy and asthma are influenced by vaccination remains in contention. Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation (DNA-M) may provide a mechanistic link between vaccination and the occurrence of disease. DNA-M, the addition of a methyl groupto a cytosine followed by a guanine (CpG sites, CpGs), is known to mediate the effect of environment at transcriptional levels, and also has well-evidenced connections to allergic disease [13]. An immunological study suggested that epigenetic changes in vaccine-induced memory CD4 and/or CD8 T cells act as on-off-on switches for immune responses after re-exposure to antigen [14]. A recent study demonstrated an overall decrease in global DNA-M in vaccinated compared to non-vaccinated chickens [15]. Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the air- ways characterized by wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath. It has been suggested that DNA-M may modulate the reg- ulation of genes that are associated in the pathogenesis of asthma and allergy [13,16-19] . We hypothesized that TVac could alter the methylation of specic CpGs, influencing allergic disease risk. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify CpGs differ- entially methylated between 18-year old children vaccinated and non-vaccinated between 10 and 18 years. Next, we analyzed whether tetanus vaccination-associated CpGs are associated with allergy and asthma. To further explore the potential effect of TVac, we describe differential DNA-M of specic CpGs at different ages (at birth, age 10, 18 years and during pregnancy) and across chil- dren who were vaccinated and non-vaccinated between 10 and 18 years. 2. Methods 2.1. Study population A whole population birth cohort was established on the Isle of Wight, UK in 1989 to study the natural history and etiology ofasthma and allergic diseases. The study was approved by the local research ethics committee (NRES Committee South Central-Hamp- shire B). Of 1536 eligible children born between January 1, 1989 and February 28, 1990, 1456 were enrolled after excluding adop- tions, infant deaths and refusals. Written informed consents were received from enrolled parents (F 0). Their children (F 1) were fol- lowed up with detailed questionnaires at ages 1, 2, 4, 10 and 18 years. Guthrie cards (blood collected within 7 days of birth, n = 30) and peripheral blood samples at age 10 (n = 34) and 18 (n = 370) years were collected from randomly selected subjects for DNA-M proling. Pregnant F 1participants and their partners were recruited and followed up at 12, 20 and 28 weeks of preg- nancy with detailed questionnaires. During pregnancy, peripheral blood samples from pregnant F1 participants (n = 121) were col- lected for epigenome-wide DNA-M proling. Nearly all the chil- dren (94.3%) in our cohort have been vaccinated at 10 years of age according to the recommended UK immunization schedule [32].2.2. DNA methylation DNA was extracted from Guthrie cards using a procedure based on that described by Beyan et al. [20], and from whole blood using a standard salting out procedure [21]. In all samples up to 1 lgo f DNA was bisulte-treated for cytosine to thymine conversion using the EZ 96-DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA), follow- ing the manufacturer's standard protocol. Beadchip (Illu- mina, Inc., processed using a standard proto- col[22], with multiple identical control samples assigned to each bisulte conversion batch to assess assay variability. Samples were randomly distributed on microarrays to control for batch effects. The beadchips were scanned using a BeadStation, and the methy- lation level ( bvalue) was calculated for each queried CpG locus using the Methylation module of BeadStudio software. Beta values represent the proportions of methylated (M) over the sum of methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) sites ( b= M/[c + M + U]) with c being a constant to prevent dividing by zero [23]. 2.3. Pre-processing DNA-M data The detection p-values reported by Genome Studio were used as a QC measure of probe performance in our study. CpGs with a detection p-value > 0.01 in > 10% of samples were removed [24]. Bioconductor IMA (Illumina methylation analyzer) and Com-Bat statistical were used for pre-processing DNA-M data and inter-array variation adjustments respectively [25,26] . We excluded all CpGs with a potential single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the binding region or at base-pair exten- sion according to dbSNP137, because probe-SNPs may interfere with DNA-M measurement ( Fig. 1 ). 2.4. Exposure Information on vaccination at 18 years was collected from ques- tion ''Have you had the following immunizations since you were 10 years old?\", which included tetanus, BCG, diphtheria, polio and other vaccinations, answered by the individuals at the 18-year follow up. 2.5. Outcome variables In the rst step, we performed epigenome-wide screening for differentially methylated CpGs that were associated with TVac. In the second step, tetanus vaccination-associated CpGs were tested for association with asthma, eczema, and allergic sensitization (Fig. 1 ). Asthma at age 18 years was dened by ''ever had asthma\" as well as either ''wheezing or whistling in the chest during the previous 12 months\" or ''current treatment for asthma\". Allergic sensitization at age 18 years was determined by positive skin prick test response ( P3 mm larger than negative control) using 14 com- mon food and aeroallergens (ALK-Albello, Horsholm, Denmark) [27]. Eczema was dened as chronic or chronically relapsing, itchy dermatitis lasting more than six weeks with characteristic mor- phology and distribution [28], following Hanin and Rajka criteria [29]. In the third step, to determine the consistency, we tested disease-related markers such as serum IgE level and lung function measurements at age 18. Serum IgE was assessed using Immuno- cap (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden), designed to measure IgE between 2.0 and 1000 kU/L in serum. Regarding lung function, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), and forced expiratory flow (FEF 25%-75% ) were measured using a Koko spirometer and software with a portable desktop device (both PDS Instrumentation, Louisville, KY, USA). Spirometry was performed and evaluated according to the American Thoracic2 V.D. Janjanam et al. / Vaccine xxx (2016) xxx-xxx Please cite this article in press as: Janjanam VD et al.

Children were required to be free of respira- tory infection for two weeks, withhold steroids intake and were advised to abstain from any b-agonist medication for six hours and caffeine intake for at least 4 h. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was measured (Niox mino, Aerocrine AB, Solna, Sweden) according to ATS guidelines [30] as described by Scott et al. [31]. 2.6. Potential confounders Variables potentially associated with allergic disorders and/or DNA-M were considered to be potential confounders, including gestational smoking, chest infections at age one and two years, duration of breast feeding (in weeks), sex of the child, current smoking status, farm exposure and number of days of exercise at 18 years of age. Regarding lung function, we controlled for sex of the child, gestational smoking, duration of breast feeding (weeks), and height (in centimeters) at 18 years of age. Duration of breast feeding information was collected from the questionnaire answered by F 0mothers at age 1 and 2 years. Chest infection atage one and two years of ages were dened by ''recurrent chest infection one year\" and ''recurrent chest infections at two years\" of age. Information regarding gestational smoking, current smok- ing status, daily physical activities like number of days of exercise, height of the individuals were obtained from the detailed question- naire answered at age 18 years follow up. Farm exposure of the individual was ascertained by ''Have you ever lived on farm\". 2.7. Statistical analysis The sample analyzed in this work was assessed for its repre- sentability of the total cohort. M-values (logit transformed bval- ues) were used for epigenome-wide screening [33]. The ttScreening, R computing package (R version 3.1.1) [34] was applied to screen CpGs that are potentially associated with the sta- tus of TVac at 18 years of age. The analytical methods implemented in this computing package facilitates a screening process that l- ters the non-informative CpGs through 100 iterations of a training-and-testing process with robust regressions. By building a more generalized model than conventional EWAS methods,Total number of CpG sites obtained from Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip After excluding control probes and CpG sties with poor detection p-values (p-value > 0.01 in >10% of samples) After excluding CpG sites that are on sex specific chromosome (9650) After excluding CpG site s with probe-SNPs and normalization, and removing batch effect using IMA and COMBAT packages respectively 274,709 CpG sites were used for the epigenome- wide screening. The tt-S creening approach was used for identifying the informative CpG sites. In this screening, DNA-M is dependent variable and vaccination status is considered as the independent variable (adjusted for Sex and cell proportions at 18 years of age).A CpG with statistical sign ificance in at least 65% of training and testing samples was considered informative and are related to tetanus Vaccination.Excluding 11 CpG sites that were affected with low risk Probe-SNP: < 1% MAF, 10bp from the CpG Additional adjustment for physical activity and farm exposure Log-linear regression models using the 40 candidate CpG sites to assess their association with asthma, Skin prick test and eczema (adjusting for potential confounders).These two CpG sites were further tested for their association with serum IgE and lung function measurements. FDR was not performed since these outcomes (serum IgE, lung function measurements) are correlated with asthma, eczema and skin prick test.

Tetanus vaccination is associated with differential DNA-methylation: Reduces the risk of ast hma in adolescence. Vaccine (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.068ttScreening is able to detect more true positives than conventional methods [34]. In robust regressions, DNA-M is taken as the depen- dent variable and TVac and covariates (in this case, the potential confounding variables) are the independent variables. A CpG was selected as an informative site if it showed statistical signicance in at least 65% of training and testing samples. CpGs identied as informative were further tested in models including additional confounders to intensively test their association with the status of TVac at 18 years of age. We applied log-linear regression models (GENMOD procedure in SAS 9.4) to estimate risk ratios for asthma, allergic sensitization, and eczema at 18 years of age. To adjust for different sample size contributed by girls and boys we used weight statement and controlled for sex. In all analyses, including EWAS and associations of candidate CpGs with asthma, and other allergic diseases, all p-values were adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR)[35] with a p-value of 60.05 being statistically signicant. To further illustrate our ndings, the CpGs linked with asthma, allergic sensitization and/or eczema were categorized into four groups based on equidistant intervals of methylations across the range of the methylation. To evaluate the functional role of these associations, we investigated whether these CpGs are also linked with lung function measurements and serum IgE levels (log- transformed) at age 18 years controlling for duration of breast feeding, sex, height, physical activity, and smoking status at 18 years of age. To this end, we conducted linear regression models with DNA-M as the dependent variable. All regression analyses (log-linear and linear models) were performed using DNA-M data at 18 years of age (n = 370). EWAS analyses were performed in R(R package 3.1.1 version) log-linear and linear regression were per- formed using the SAS statistical package, Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Finally, we examined differential methylation of tetanus vaccination-associated CpGs at different ages in the F 1generation and in vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. In this descrip- tive part covering four periods of life, we had to use different sam- ple sizes of female participants that were available to us: n = 34 at birth, n = 30 at age 10, n = 245 at age 18, n = 121 during pregnancy. In addition, we describe the methylation changes in ve women, who participated in all of the above four periods. 3. Results We found no signicant difference between the population ana- lyzed, both female (n = 245) and male participants (n = 125), with methylation data available at 18 years of age with the participants of the whole cohort (750 females and 786 males) ( Table 1 ). Among female and male participants in the subsample, 73.5% and 71.2% had TVac, 19.2% and 22.4% had a history of maternal smoking, 7.0% and 6.4% had chest infection at age one year, and 14.2% and 12.8% of them had asthma at 18 years of age respectively. A total of 53 CpGs were identied in the EWAS, 11 of which were affected by a probe-SNP and thus were excluded ( Fig. 1 ). After adjusting for physical activity and farm exposure, which may be related to TVac, and controlling for FDR, two further CpGs were excluded and a set of 40 CpGs were retained ( Table 2 ).

In addition, decreased methylation of cg01669161 was associated with increased serum IgE (log10) levels (Estimate (SE): /C02.48 (1.23), p = 0.045). We further inspected methylation changes of cg14472551 and cg01669161 at different ages in ve female participants with com- plete follow-up data on DNA-M. In particular, we compared the methylation of these two CpGs among vaccinated (n = 269) and non-vaccinated individuals (n = 60) using the median methylation values ( bvalues). In this descriptive analyses ( Fig. 2 ) we observed that methylation of cg14472551 was higher at birth ( bvalue > 0.6)than at ( bvalue 18 years ( bvalue < 0.43). Cg14472551 showed the lowest methylation during pregnancy ( b value < 0.34). Cg14472551 was lower methylated in vaccinated individuals (n = 269, bvalue < 0.43) while higher methylated in non-vaccinated individuals (n = 60, bvalue < 0.47). cg01669161 also showed a difference among vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals: higher methylation was observed in vaccinated ( b value > 0.49) compared to non-vaccinated individuals ( b value > 0.47). However, cg01669161 was lower methylated at birth (bvalue < 0.36), but higher at age 18 ( bvalue > 0.42) and during pregnancy ( bvalue > 0.46). To further illustrate the effect of the TVac associated CpGs on the prevalence of asthma, we dichotomized the methylation at the median level. Interestingly, the prevalence of asthma among vaccinated individuals (13%) was lower compared to non- vaccinated (22%) however not statistically signicant (p = 0.07) (Fig. 3 ). When we stratied this association by cg14472551 (low vs. high methylated), we found a higher prevalence of asthma among higher methylated children with no vaccination (p = 0.041). In vaccinated children, no increased prevalence of asthma was detected. For cg01669161 the prevalence of asthma was lower among children with higher methylation; however, using a crude dichotomization, the difference did not gain statisti-Table 2 Estimates of the tetanus vaccination effect of originally selected CpG sites based on ttScreening and additionally controlled of confounders in lin ear models.

Discussion Our study demonstrated that epigenetic changes due to vacci- nation can alter the risk of asthma at age 18 years. In an epigenome-wide screening we found that TVac was associated with differential DNA-M: decreased methylation of cg14472551 gene ) region of PSMG3 and TFAMP1 ) at age 18 years. We further investigated the association of these two CpGs with asthma and other allergic diseases. Following the effect of TVac on these two CpGs, both a higher and lower methylation of cg14472551 and cg01669161, respectively, were associated with an increased risk of asthma at 18 years of age. To our knowledge this is the rst study to illustrate that TVac is associated with differential methy- lation which inturn has a protective effect on asthma in adolescence. The locations of these two CpGs suggest a potentially functional connections to allergic disease. Cg14472551 is located upstream of the transcriptional start site of KIAA1549L (also known as C11orf41 ) on chromosome 11. The KIAA1549L protein is 1849 amino acids long and contains highly conserved regions [36,37] .KIAA1549L acts a fusion partner of PAX5 , a transcription factor critical for B-cell commitment From Gene Ontology http://www.uniport.org/uniport/Q6ZVL6 ) it was found that KIAA1549L is involved in the biological process of upregulation, stimulation, and activation of defense response to virus by the host. Since DNA-M and gene expression are inversely correlated a lower methylation on TSS may upregulate the expression of KIAA1549L and enhance host immunity. Cg01669161 is located in the intergenic region (24,848 base pairs) between an antisense regulator of the proteasome assembly chaperone PSMG3 and TFAMP1 genes (a non-coding RNA) on chro- mosome 7. It is in close proximity (3000 base pairs downstream) of PSMG3 (Proteasome assembly chaperon 3) . Proteasomes are respon- sible for processing antigens for presentation on the cell surface, an essential step of vaccination-induced immunity. Close proximity of cg01669161 PSMG3 may thus explain its role in TVac and allergy.To further evaluate the functional role of these two CpGs, we investigated their association with lung function measurements and serum IgE. Serum IgE plays a key role in type I hypersensitivity (B-cell-induced IgE-mediated immune response) reactions such as allergy and asthma [38]. It also has an important role upstream of the cascade of reaction in inflammatory response in skin and lungs. Interestingly, higher methylation of cg01669161 is also associated with decreased serum IgE levels, which may potentially contribute to the protective effect against asthma. For descriptive purposes, we also examined the differential methylation of these two CpGs at four age periods in female sub- groups of the F1 generation using different (smaller) sample sizes. We observed that cg14472551 showed a higher methylation atbirth followed by a decrease methylation over age while cg01669161 represented a lower methylation at birth followed by increased methylation over age. Cg14472551 was lower and cg01669161 was higher methylated during pregnancy and in vac- cinated individuals, in agreement with the ndings from the regression analyses. In ve women with complete follow up the differential methylation of the two CpGs are in agreement with the cross-sectional ndings of different samples. After the identication of these two TVac-related CpGs, we con- tinued the analyses to test whether these CpGs affect the preva- lence of asthma and related markers. We noticed a decreased prevalence of asthma in vaccinated compared to non-vaccinated children ( Fig. 3 ). In addition, cg01669161 was also signicantly associated with decreased IgE levels, adding consistencies to our ndings. There are some limitations to this study. Since DNA-M mea- surements obtained using the Illumina Innium HumanMethyla- tion450 array have high reproducibility and validity [22,36] ,w e did not technically replicate the DNA-M measurements. Second, methylation data were obtained from whole blood but not from specic cell subgroups, due to cost, but also because the differen- tial methylation observed here may well be present in all cell sub- sets anyway. Nevertheless, since DNA-M of peripheral blood can be influenced by the cell composition, we controlled for the cell types in the EWAS. Third, in the descriptive part, we investigated DNA-M changes from birth to pregnancy. All individuals with complete follow-up were women, which restricted our observation of methylation changes over time to women ( Fig. 2 ). Fourth, the small sample size at 10 years (n = 30) and the fact that nearly all 21.67 Non-Vaccinated 8.331025.17 3.

The prevalence of asthma is lower in vaccinated compared to non- vaccinated individuals. The prevalence of asthma is higher in non-vaccinated individuals whose cg14472551 methylation was higher while the preval ence was lower in vaccinated individuals. Individuals with higher methylation of cg01669161 has showed lower prevalence of asthma compared to lower methylation in b oth vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals.V.D.

Finally, since this is the rst study that demonstrated an effect of vaccination on asthma that may be mediated via DNA-M and results in a reduced risk of asthma, further replication of these associations in an independent cohort is needed. 5. Conclusion In an EWAS, we found that TVac was associated with differen- tial methylation of two CpG site located in or near genes with func- tional connections to immunity and antigen presentation. These CpGs in turn were protective against asthma and increased IgE. This suggests that DNA-M act as a possible molecular mechanism of protective effects of TVac against asthma in adolescence. Vacci- nation and related methylation of specic CpGs may offer novel prospects to investigate and explain a differential occurrence of asthma in childhood/adolescence.
