GreenHeart Plant Meditation Classes Sundays, April 23rd, May 21st & June 11th | 1:00 - 3:00 PM, [RiverSong Farm](/riversong-farm) in [Saxapahaw, NC](https://www.saxapahawnc.com) with clinical herbalist and massage& bodywork therapist Lea Clayton, LMBT, BCPP It is a lovely & helpful practice to slow down & spend time with a medicinal plant: to savor its taste & feel its action in our bodies, to let it touch our hearts & show us how we can heal ourselves with its help. In this way, the plants themselves are our elders & teachers in their own right. They speak to us in a common language that we are fluent in at birth. Even if we have forgotten that language though the years, it is a straightforward process to regain that ability. In each class, clinical herbalist Lea Clayton will choose one healing plant ally and guide students through a simple plant meditation. After the meditation, students will explore traditional & modern ways the herb can support health and wellbeing. Only safe & gentle plants will be explored in this series, and the class is open to all levels of experience. With plant meditation, it doesn't matter whether someone is brand new to herbal medicine or has been learning about herbs for years: the plants always have something new to share - & new ways to reveal themselves. Within the teaching/learning circle we create in these classes, we are all on even footing; everyone's unique insight into the plants is valued. There are 3 classes in this series. Each lasts 2 hours and will be held on a Sunday afternoon on April, May and June. The cost for each session is $35.00. You will need to purchase a ticket for each class individually through the EventBright link button below.
