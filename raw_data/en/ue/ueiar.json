OPCs are a group of bioflavonoid complexes that work as free-radical scavengers in the body.* What are free-radicals? Free-radicals are single atoms with unpaired electrons in the body. They cause damage to otherwise healthy cells, proteins, and even DNA. All this damage can lead to disrupted healthy, oxidative stress and premature aging, and has been linked to the development of cancers, heart disease, and more. As a super-antioxidant, Clinical OPC works to stop free-radicals that could otherwise attack cells and disrupt good health.* In a comparison test with seven other grape seed extracts, Clinical OPC had the strongest ORAC value by far with 2,103,300 per 100 grams. Aside from dealing with free-radicals, Clinical OPC Extra Strength contains a high concentration of grape seed extract that can help improve focus, enhance liver function, and regulate blood pressure. It's among the best natural supplement to improve circulation and it also fortifies your heart, arteries, and immune system. Clinical OPC Extra Strength also helps your body maintain healthy blood sugar and cholesterol levels.* Suggested Use: Take 1 softgel daily, may take up to 3 times a day for enhanced benefits.
