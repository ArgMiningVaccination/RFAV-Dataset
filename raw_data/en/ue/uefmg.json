Most Cited Cases (Formerly 232Ak671 Labor Relations) The absence of factual analysis in National Labor Relations Board's opinion which ruled that full -time faculty members of private university were manag e- rial employees excluded them from coverage under the National Labor Relations Act reflected the Board's view that the managerial status of faculty members could be decided on the basis of conclusory rationales rather than examination of the facts of each case, and therefore, the deference normally accorded the exper- tise of the Board when its conclusions are rationally based on articulated facts and consistent with the Act was not applicable. **857 *672 Syllabus FN* FN* The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the conve n- ience of the reader. See United States v. D e- troit Lumber Co ., 200 U.S. 321, 33 7, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499 . Yeshiva University Faculty Association (Union) filed a representation petition with the National Labor Relations Board (Board), seeking certification as bargaining agent for the full -time faculty members of certain s chools of Yeshiva University, a private uni- versity. The University opposed the petition on the ground that all of its faculty members are managerial or supervisory personnel and hence not employees within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (Ac t). The evidence at hearings before the Board's hearing officer showed, inter alia , that a central a d- ministrative hierarchy serves all of the University's schools, with University -wide policies being form u- lated by the central administration upon approval o f the Board of Trustees. However, the individual schools within the University are substantially a u-tonomous, and the faculty members at each school effectively determine its curriculum, grading system, admission and matriculation standards, academic calend ars, and course schedules. Also, the over- whelming majority of faculty recommendations as to faculty hiring, tenure, sabbaticals, termination, and promotion are implemented. The Board granted the Union's petition and directed an election. Summarily rejectin g the University's contention that its faculty members are managerial employees, the Board held that the faculty members are professional employees entitled to the Act's protection. After the Union won the election and was certified, the University refused to bargain. In subsequent unfair labor practice pr o- ceedings, the Board ordered the University to bargain and sought enforcement in the Court of Appeals, which denied the petition. The court agreed that the faculty members are professional employees under \u00a7 2(12) of the Act, found that the Board had ignored \" the extensive control of Yeshiva's faculty \" over academic and personnel decisions as well as its \"crucial role . . . in determining other central policies of the instit u- tion,\" and accordingly held that the faculty members are endowed with \"managerial status \" sufficient to remove them from the Act's coverage. *673 Held : The University's full -time faculty members are managerial employees excluded from the Act's coverage. Pp. 861 -866. (a) The authority structure of a university does not fit neatly into the statutory scheme, because authority in the typical \"mature \" private university is divided between a central administration and one or more collegial bodies. The absence of explicit congressional direct ion does not preclude the Board from reaching any particular type of employment, and the Board has approved the formation of bargaining units composed of faculty members on the ground that they are \"pro- fessional employees \" under \u00a7 2(12) of the Act. Ne v- ertheless professionals may be exempted from co v- erage under the judicially implied exclusion **858 for \"managerial employees \" when they are involved in developing and implementing employer policy. Pp. 861- 862. (b) Here, application of the managerial exclusion to the University's faculty members is not precluded on the theory that they are not aligned with manage-ment because they are expected to exercise \" inde- pendent professional judgment \" while participating in 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 3 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M.

The controlling consideration is that the faculty exercises authority which in any other context unquestionably would be managerial, its authority in academic matters being absolute. The faculty's professional inte rests\u2014as a p- plied to governance at a university like Yeshiva which depends on the professional judgment of its faculty to formulate and apply policies \u2014cannot be separated from those of the institution, and thus it cannot be said that a faculty member exerci sing independent jud g- ment acts primarily in his own interest and does not represent the interest of his employer. Pp. 862 -866. (c) The deference ordinarily due the Board's e x- pertise does not require reversal of the Court of A p- peals' decision. This Court respects the Board's ex-pertise when its conclusions are rationally based on articulated facts and consistent with the Act, but he re the Board's decision satisfies neither criterion.

Frankel, New York City, for respondent in both cases. Mr. Justice POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court. Supervisors and managerial employees are ex- cluded from the categories of employees entitled to the benefits of collective bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act. FN1 The question presented is whether the full -time faculty of Yeshiva University fall within those exclusions. FN1. 49 Stat. 449, as amended, 61 S tat. 136, 73 Stat. 519, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et ., 416 U.S. 267, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974) . I Yeshiva is a private university which conducts a broad range of arts and sciences program s at its five undergraduate and eight graduate schools in New York City. On October 30, 1974, the Yeshiva Un i- versity Faculty Association (Union) filed a represe n- tation petition with the National Labor Relations Board (Board). The Union sought certification as bargaining agent for the full -time faculty members at 10 of the 13 *675 schools.FN2 The University opposed the petition on the ground that all of its facult y me m- bers are managerial or supervisory personnel and hence not employees within the meaning of the N a- tional Labor Relations Act (Act). A Board -appointed hearing officer held hearings over a period of five months, generating a voluminous record. FN2. The schools involved are Yeshiva College, Stern College for Women, Teacher's Institute for Women, Erna Michael College, Yeshiva Program, James Striar School of Gene ral Jewish Studies, Belfer Graduate School of Sciences, Ferkauf Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Wurzweiler School of Social Work, and Bernard Revel Graduate School. The Union did not seek to represent the faculty of the medical school, the graduate school of me d- ical sciences, the Yeshiva High School, or any of the theological programs affiliated with the University. A law school has been opened since the time of the hearings, but it does not figure in this case. The evidence at the heari ngs showed that a central administrative hierarchy serves all of the University's schools. Ultimate authority is vested in a Board of Trustees, whose members (other than the President) hold no administrative positions at the University. The President sits on the Board of **859 Trustees and serves as chief executive officer, assisted by four Vice Presidents who oversee, respectively, medical affairs and science, student affairs, business affairs, and ac- ademic affairs. An Executive Council of Deans and admini strators makes recommendations to the Pres i- dent on a wide variety of matters. University- wide policies are formulated by the central administration with the approval of the Board of Trustees, and include general guidelines dealing with teaching loads, sal ary scales, tenure, sabbaticals, retirement, and fringe benefits. The budget for each school is drafted by its Dean or Director, subject to approval by the President after consultation with a committee of administrators. FN3 The faculty partici-100 S.Ct. 856 Page 4 444 U.S. 100 S.Ct. 103 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2526, 63 L.Ed.2d 115, 87 as: 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856) \u00a9 2012 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works. pate *676 in University- wide governance through their representatives on an elected student -faculty advisory council. The only University- wide faculty body is the Faculty Re view Committee, composed of elected representatives who adjust grievances by i n- formal negotiation and also may make formal re c- ommendations to the Dean of the affected school or to the President. Such recommendations are purely ad- visory. FN3. At Yeshiva College, budget requests prepared by the senior professor in each subject area receive the \" perfunctory \" ap- proval of the Dean \"99 percent \" of the time and have ne ver been rejected by the central administration. App. 298- 299. A council of elected department chairmen at Ferkauf ap- proves the school's budget allocations when discretionary funds are available. Id ., at 626- 627. All of these professors were i n- cluded in th e bargaining unit approved by the Board. The individual schools within the University are substantially autonomous. Each is headed by a Dean or Director, and faculty members at each school meet formally and informally to discuss and decide matters of inst itutional and professional concern. At four schools, formal meetings are convened regularly pursuant to written bylaws. The remaining faculties meet when convened by the Dean or Director. Most of the schools also have faculty committees concerned with spec ial areas of educational policy. Faculty welfare committees negotiate with administrators concerning salary and conditions of employment. Through these meetings and committees, the faculty at each school effectively determine its curriculum, grading system , admission and matriculation stan d- ards, academic calendars, and course schedules. FN4 FN4. For example, the Deans at Yeshiva and Erna Michael Colleges regard faculty actions as binding. Id ., at 248 -249, 312- 313. A d- ministrators testified that no academic initia- tive of either faculty had been ve toed since at least 1968. Id ., at 250, 313. When the Stern College faculty disagreed with the Dean's decision to delete the education major, the major was reinstituted. Id ., at 191. The D i- rector of the Teacher's Institute for Women testified that \"the facu lty is the school, \" id., at 379, while the Director of the James Striar School described his position as the \" execu- tive arm of the faculty, \" which had overruled him on occasion, id., at 360 -361. All dec i- sions regarding academic matters at the Y e- shiva Progr am and Bernard Revel are made by faculty consensus. Id ., at 574, 583 -586. The \"internal operation of [Wurzweiler] has been heavily governed by faculty decisions, \" according to its Dean. Id ., at 502. *677 Faculty power at Yeshiva's schools extends beyond strictly academic concerns. The faculty at each school make recommendations to the Dean or Director in every case of faculty hiring, tenure, sabbaticals, termination and promotion. Although the final dec i- sion is reached by the central administration on the advice of the Dean or Director, the overwhelming majority of faculty recommendations are implemen t- ed.FN5 **860 Even when financial problems in the early 1970's restricted Yeshiva's budget, faculty recommendations still largely controlled personnel decisions made within the constraints imposed by the administration. Indeed, the faculty of one school r e- cently drew up new and binding policies expanding their own ro le in these matters. In addition, some faculties make final decisions regarding the admi s- sion, expulsion, and graduation of individual students. Others have decided questions involving teaching loads, student absence policies, tuition and enrollment levels , and in one case the location of a school. FN6 FN5. One Dean es timated that 98% of faculty hiring recommendations were ultimately given effect. Id. , at 624. Others could not recall an instance when a faculty reco m- mendation had been overruled. Id., at 193- 194. At Stern College, the Dean in six years has never overturne d a promotion de- cision. Ibid. The President has accepted all decisions of the Yeshiva College faculty as to promotions and sabbaticals, including dec i- sions opposed by the Dean. Id. , at 268 -270. At Erna Michael, the Dean has never hired a full-time faculty member without the consent of the affected senior professor, id. , at 333- 335, and the Director of Teacher's I n- stitute for Women stated baldly that no teacher had ever been hired if \"there was the slightest objection, even on one faculty member's part. \" Id., at 388. The faculty at 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 5 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2526, 63 L.Ed.2d 115, 87 as: 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856) \u00a9 2012 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works. both these schools have overridden reco m- mendations made by the deans. No prom o- tion or grant of tenure has ever been made at Ferkauf over faculty opposition. Id. , at 62 0, 633. The Dean of Belfer testified that he had no right to override faculty decisions on tenure and nonrenewal. Id. , at 419. FN6. The Director of Teacher's I nstitute for Women once recommended that the school move to Brooklyn to attract students. The faculty rejected the proposal and the school remained in Manhattan. Id. , at 379- 380. *678 II A three -member panel of the Board granted the Union's petition in D ecember 1975, and directed an election in a bargaining unit consisting of all full -time faculty members at the affected schools. 221 N.L.R.B. 1053 (1975) . The unit included Assistant Deans, senior professors, and department chairmen, as well as associate professors, assistant professors, and i n- structors. FN7 Deans and Directors were excluded. The Board summarily rejected the University's contention that its entire faculty are managerial, viewing the claim as a request for reconsideration of previous Board decisions on the issue. Instead of making finding s of fact as to Yeshiva, the Board referred generally to the record and found no \"significan[t] \" difference between this faculty and others it had co n- sidered. The Board concluded that the faculty are professional employees entitled to the protection of the Act because \" faculty participation in collegial decision making is on a collective rather than ind i- vidual basis, it is exercised in the faculty's own interest rather than ' in the interest of the employer, ' and final authority rests with the board of trust ees.\" Id. , at 1054 (footnote o mitted).FN8 FN7. \"Full-time faculty \" were defined as those \"appointed to the University in the titles of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor, or any adjunct or visiting thereof, department chairmen, d i- vision chairmen, senior faculty and assi s- tant this action]. \" 221 N.L.R.B., at 1057 . The term \" faculty \" in this opinion refers to the members of this unit as defined by the Board. FN8. Identical language had been employed in at least two other Board decisions. See infra , at 863. In this case, it was not su p- ported by a single citation to the record. Mr. Justice BRENNAN's dissent relies on this language, post, at 869, and adds that a fa c- ulty's \"primary concerns are academic and relate solely to its own professional reput a- tion,\" post, at 872. The view that faculty governance authority \"is exercised in the faculty's own interest \" rather than that of the University assumes a lack of responsibility that certainly is not reflected in this record. *679 The Union won the election and was cert i- fied by the Board. The University refused to bargain, reasserting its view that the faculty are managerial. In the subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding, the Board refused to reconsider its holding in the repr e- sentation proceeding and ordered the University to bargain with the Union. 231 N.L.R.B. 597 (1977) . When the University still refused to sit d own at the negotiating table, the Board sought enforcement in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which denied the petition. 582 F.2d 686 (19 78). Since the Board had made no findings of fact, the court examined the record and related the circu m- stances in considerable detail. It agreed that the faculty are professional employees under \u00a7 2(12) of the Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(12) . But the court found that the Board had ignored \" the extensive control of Yeshiva's faculty \" over acade mic and personnel decisions as well as **861 the \"crucial role of the full -time faculty in determining other central policies of the instit u- tion.\" 582 F.2d, at 698. The court concluded that such power is not an exercise of individual professional expertise. Rather, the faculty are, \" in effect, substa n- tially and pervasively operating the enterprise. \" Ibid. Accordingly, the court held that the faculty are en-dowed with \" managerial status \" sufficient to remove them from the coverage of the Act. We granted cert i- orari, 440 U.S. 906, 99 S.Ct. 1212, 59 453 (1979) , and now affirm. 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 6 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M.

III There is no evidence that Congress has consi d- ered whether a university faculty may organize for collective bargaining under the Act. Indeed, when the Wagner and Taft -Hartley Acts were approved, it was thought that congressional power did not extend to university faculties because they were employed by nonprofit institutions which did not \"affect co m- merce. \"*680 See NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chi- 59 L.Ed.2d 533 (1979) .FN9 Moreover, the authority structure of a university does not fit neatly within the statutory scheme we are asked to interpret. The Board itself has noted that the concept of coll e- giality \"does not square with the traditional authority structures with which th[e] Ac t was designed to cope in the typical organizations of the commercial world. \" Adelphi University , 195 N.L.R.B. 1st Sess., 7 (1935) ( dispute between employer and college professor would not be covered); H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 36 p. 1135 (listing professional employees co v- ered new statutory provision without mentioning teachers); S.Rep.No.105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 11, 19 (1947) (same). The Act was intended to accommodate the type of management -employee relations that prevail in the pyramidal hierarchies of private industry. Ibid . In contrast, authority in the typical \" mature \" private university is divided between a central administration and one or more collegial bodies. See J. Baldridge, Power and Conflict in the University 114 (1971). This system of \"shared authority\" evolved from the med i- eval model of collegial decisionmaking in which guilds of scholars were responsible only to the m- selves. See N. Fehl, The Idea of a University in East and West 36 -46 (1962); D. Knowles, The Evolution of Medieval Thought 164- 168 (1962). At early un i- versities, the faculty were the school. Although facul- ties have been subject to external control in the United States since colonial times, J. Brubacher & W. Rudy, Higher Education in Transition: A History of Amer i- can Colleges and Universities, 1636 -1976, pp. 25 -30 (3d ed. 1976), traditions of collegial ity continue to play a significant role at many universities, including Yeshiva. FN10 For these reasons, the Board has *681 recognized that principles develo ped for use in the industrial setting cannot be \"imposed blindly on the academic world. \" Syracuse University , 204 N.L.R.B. 641, 643 (1973) . FN10. See the inaugural address of Williams College President Paul Ansel Chadbourne, quoted in Kahn, The NLRB and Higher E d- ucation: The Failure of Policymaking Through Adjudication, 21 UCLA L.Rev. 63, 70, n. 16 (1973) ( \" 'Professors are som e- times spoken of as working for the college. They are the college ' \") (emphasis in orig i- nal); Davis, Unions and Higher Education: Another View, 49 Ed. Record 139, 143 (1968) ( \"The president . . . is not the faculty's He is as much the faculty's admini s- trator as he is the board [of trustees'] \"); n. 4, supra . The absence of explicit congressional direction, of course, does not preclude the Board from reaching any particular type of employment. See NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc. , 322 U.S. 111, 124- 131, 64 S.Ct. 851, 857 -860, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944) . Acting under its responsibility for adapting the broad prov i- sions of the Act to differing workplaces, the Board asserted jurisdiction over a university for the first time in 1970. Cornell University , 183 N .L.R.B. 329 (1970) . Within a year it had approved the formation of ba r- gaining units composed of faculty members. **862 C. W. Post Center , 189 N.L.R.B. 904 (1971) .FN11 The Board reasoned that faculty members are \"profe s- sional employees \" within the meaning of \u00a7 2(12) of the Act and therefore are entitled to the benefits of collective bargaining. 189 N.L.R.B., at 905 ; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(12) .FN12 FN11. The Board has suggested that Co n- gress tacitly approved the formation of fa c- ulty units in 1974, when the Act was amended to eliminate the exemption ac- corded to nonprofit hospitals. Although Congress appears to have agreed that no n- profit institutions \"affect commerce\" under modern economic conditions, H.R.Rep.No.93 -1051, p. 4 (1974); 120 Cong.Rec. 12938 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Williams), there is nothing to suggest that Congress considered the status of university faculties. 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 7 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M.

The Act provides broadly that \" em- ployees \" have organizational and other rights. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 . Section 2(3) defines \"employee ; \u00a7 2(12) defines \"professional 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(12) ; and \u00a7 9(b)(1) prohibits the Board from cr e- ating a bargaining unit that includes both professional and nonprofessional employees unless a majority of the professionals vote for inclusion, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(b) (1). Yeshiva does not contend that its faculty are not professionals under the statute. But professionals, like other employees, may be exempted from coverage under the Act's exclusion*682 for \"supervisors \" who use independent judgment in overseeing other e m- ployees in the interest of the employer,FN13 or under the judicially implied exclusion for \"managerial e m- ployees \" who are involved in developing and enfor c- ing employer policy. FN14 Both exempt ions grow out of the same concern: That an employer is entitled to the undivided loyalty of its representatives. Beasley v. Food Fair of North Carolina , 416 U.S. 661- 662, 94 S.Ct. 40 L.Ed.2d (1974) ; see NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co. , 416 U.S. 267, 281- 282, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1765, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974) . Because the Court of Appeals fo und the faculty to be manage- rial employees, it did not decide the question of their supervisory status. In view of our agreement with that court's application of the managerial exclusion, we also need not resolve that issue of statutory interpr e- tation. FN13. An employee may be excluded if he has authority over any one of 12 enumerated personnel actions, including hiring and fi r- \u00a7\u00a7 152(3) , 152(11) held repeatedly that profes-sionals may be excluded as supervisors. E. g., University of Vermont , 223 N.L.R.B. 423, 426 (1976) ; Presbyterian Medical Cen 218 N.L.R.B. 1266, 1267- 1269 (1975) . FN14. NLRB v. Co. , 416 U .S. 267, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974) . The Board never has doubted that the ma n- agerial exclusion may be applied to profe s- sionals in a proper case. E. g., Sutter Co m- munity Hospitals of Sacramento , 227 N.L.R.B. 181, 193 (1976) ; see General D y-namics Corp. , 213 N.L.R.B. 851, 857 -858 (1974) ; Westinghouse Electric Corp. , 113 N.L.R.B. 337, 339 (1955) . IV [1] Managerial employees are defined as those who \" 'formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer. ' \" NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., supra , at 288, 94 S.Ct., at 1768 (quoting Palace Laundry Dry Cleaning Corp. , 75 N.L.R.B. 320, 323, n. 4 (1947) ). These employees are \" much higher in the managerial struc ture\" than those explicitly mentioned by Co n- gress, which \" regarded [them] as so clearly outside the Act that no specific exclusionary provision was thought necessary. \" 416 U.S., at 283, 94 S.Ct., at 1766. *683 Managerial employees must exercise di s- cretion within, or even independently of, established employer policy and must be aligned with manag e- ment. S ee id. , at 286 -287, 94 S.Ct., at 1767- 1768 (citing cases). Although the Board has established no firm criteria for determining when an employee is so aligned, normally an employee may be excluded as managerial only if he represents management interests by taking or recommending discretionary actions that effectively control or implement employer policy.FN15 FN15. E. g., Sutter Community Hospitals of Sacramento, 193; Bell Aerospace , 219 N.L.R.B. 384, 385-386 (1975) (on r e- mand); General Dynamics Corp., supra, at 857; see NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., -1769 contend the Y eshiva faculty's decisionmaking is too insignificant **863 to be deemed managerial.FN16 Nor does it suggest that the role of the faculty is merely advisory an d thus not managerial. FN17 Instead, it contends that the manag e- rial exclusion cannot be applied in a straightforward fashion to professional employees becau se those e m- ployees *684 often appear to be exercising managerial authority when they are merely performing routine job duties. The status of such employees, in the Board's view, must be determined by reference to the \"align- ment with management \" criterion. T he Board argues that the Yeshiva faculty are not aligned with man-agement because they are expected to exercise \" in- dependent professional judgment \" while participating in academic governance, and because they are neither 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 8 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M.

Works. \"expected to conform to management policies [nor] judged according to their effectiveness in carrying out those policies. \" Because of this independence, the Board contends there is no danger of divided loyalty and no need for the managerial exclusion. In its view, union pressure cannot diver t the faculty from adhering to the interests of the university, because the univer-sity itself expects its faculty to pursue professional values rather than institutional interests. The Board concludes that application of the managerial exclusion to such em ployees would frustrate the national labor policy in favor of collective bargaining. FN16. The Board has found decisions of far less significance to the emp loyer to be managerial when the affected employees were aligned with management. Swift & Co. , 115 N.L.R.B. 752, 753 (1956) (procurement drivers who made purchases for employers); Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. , 112 N.L.R.B. 571, 573 (1955) (production Co. , 106 N.L.R.B. 194, 196 (1953) (lecturers who indoctrinated new employees); Western Electric Co. , 100 N.L.R.B. 420, 423 (1952) (personnel inve s- tigators who made hiring recommendations); American Locomotive Co. , 92 N.L.R.B. 115, 116- 117 (1950) (buyers who made substa n- tial purchases on employer's behalf). FN17. The Union does argue that the facul- ty's authority is merely advisory. But the fact that the administration holds a r arely exer- cised veto power does not diminish the fa c- ulty's effective power in policymaking and implementation. See nn. 4, 5, supra . The statutory definition of \" supervisor \" expressly contemplates that those employees who \"ef- fectively . . . recommend \" the e numerated actions are to be excluded as supervisory. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) . Consistent w ith the co n- cern for divided loyalty, the relevant co n- sideration is effective recommendation or control rather than final authority. That r a- tionale applies with equal force to the ma n- agerial exclusion. This \"independent professional judgment \" test was not applied in the decision we are asked to uphold. The Board's opinion relies exclusively on its previous faculty decisions for both legal and factual analysis. 221 N.L.R.B., at 1054 . But those decisions only dimly foreshadow the reasoning now proffered to the Court. Without explanation, the Board initially announced two different rationales for faculty cases, FN18 *685 then quickly transformed them into a litany to be repeated in case after case: (i) faculty au thority is collective, (ii) it is exercised in the faculty's own in-terest rather than in the interest of the university, and (iii) final authority rests with the board of trustees. Northeastern University , 218 N.L.R.B. 247, 250 (1975) ; University of Miami , 213 N.L.R.B. 634, 634 (1974) ; see Tusculum College , 199 N.L.R.B. 28, 30 (1972) .FN19 In their arguments in this case, the Board's lawyers have abandoned the first and third branches of **864 this analysis,FN20 which in any event were flatly inconsistent with its precedents,FN21 and have tran s- formed the s econd into a theory that does not appear clearly in any Board opinion. FN22 FN18. Two cases simply announced that faculty authority is neither managerial nor supervisory because it is exercised collec- tively. C. W. Post Center, 189 N.L.R.B. 904, 905 (1971) ; Fordham University, 193 N.L.R.B. 134, 135 (1971) . The Board later acknowledged that \"a genuine system of collegiality would tend to confound us, \" but held that the modern university departs from that system because \"ultimate authority \" is vested in a board of trustees which neither attempts to convert the faculty into manage- rial entities nor advises them to advocate management interests. Adelphi University, 195 N.L.R.B. 639, 648 (1972) . See Fairleigh on University, 227 N.L.R.B. 239, 241 (1976) . FN19. Citing these three factors, the Board concludes in each case that faculty are pr o- fessional employees. It has never explained the reasoning connecting the premise with the conclusion, although an argument similar to that made by its lawyers in th is case ap- pears in one concurring opinion. Northeas t- ern University , 218 N.L.R.B., at 257 (opinion of Member Kennedy). FN20. Although the Board has preserved the points in footnotes to its brief, it no longer contends that \"collective authority \" and \"lack of ultimate authority \" are legal rationales. 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 9 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2526, 63 L.Ed.2d 115, 87 as: 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856) \u00a9 2012 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works. They are now said to be facts which, respec- tively, \"fortif[y] \" the Board's view that fa c- ulty members act in their own interest, and contradict the premise that the university is a \"self-governing communit[y] of scholars. \" Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 78 -857, p. 11, n. 8. Cf. n. 8, supra . FN21. The \"collective authority \" branch has never been applied to supervisors who work through committees. E. g., Florida Southern College , 196 N.L.R.B. 888, 889 (1972) . Nor was it thought to bar managerial status for employees who owned enough stock to give them, as a group, a substantial voice in the employer's affairs. See Sida of Hawaii, Inc. , 191 N.L.R.B. 194, 195 (1971) ; Red and White Airway Cab Co. , 123 N.L.R.B. 83, 85 (1959) ; Brookings Plywood Corp. , 98 N.L.R.B. 794, 798 -799 (1952) . Ultimate authority, the third branch, has never been thought to be a prerequisite to supervisory or managerial status. Indeed, it could not be since every corporation vests that power in its board of directors. FN22. We do not, of course, substitute counsel's post hoc rationale for the reasoning supplied by the Board itself. SEC v. Chenery Corp. , 332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1577, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) . Because the first and third branches of the Board's analysis are insupportable, the Board's only colorable theory is the \"interest of the employer \" branch. The argument presented to us is an expanded and considerably refined version of that notion. *686 V [2] The controlling consideration in this case is that the faculty of Yeshiva University exercise a u- thority which in any other context unquestionably would be manageri al. Their authority in academic matters is absolute. They decide what courses will be offered, when they will be scheduled, and to whom they will be taught. They debate and determine teaching methods, grading policies, and matriculation standards. They eff ectively decide which students will be admitted, retained, and graduated. On Occasion their views have determined the size of the student body, the tuition to be charged, and the location of a school. When one considers the function of a unive r- sity, it is difficult to imagine decisions more manag e- rial than these. To the extent the industrial analogy applies, the faculty determines within each school the product to be produced, the terms upon which it will be offered, and the customers who will be served. FN23 FN23. The record shows that faculty me m- bers at Yeshiva also play a predominant role in faculty hiring, tenure, sabbaticals, term i- nation and promotion. See supra , at 859- 860, and n. 5. These decisions clearly have both managerial and supervisory cha r- acteristics. Since we do not reach the que s- tion of supervisory status, we need not rely primarily on these features of faculty a u- thority. The Board nevertheless insists that these dec i- sions are not managerial because they require the exercise of independent professio nal judgment. We are not persuaded by this argument. There may be some tension between the Act's exclusion of manag e- rial employees and its inclusion of professionals, since most professionals in managerial positions continue to draw on their special skills and training. But we have been directed to no authority suggesting that that te n- sion can be resolved by reference to the \" independent professional judgment \" criterion *687 proposed in this case.FN24 Outside the university context, the Board routinely has applied the managerial and supervisory exclusions to professionals in executive positions **865 without inquiring whether their decisions were based on manage ment policy rather than professional expertise. FN25 Indeed, the Board has twice implicitly rejected the contention that decisions based on pr o- fessional judgm ent cannot be managerial.FN26 Since the Board does not suggest that the \" independent professional judgment \" test is to be limited to unive r- sity faculty, its new approach would overrule sub silentio this body of Board precedent and could result in the indiscriminate recharacterization as covered employees of professionals working in supervisory and managerial capacities. FN24. The Board has cited no case directly applying an \"independent professional judgment \" standard. On the related question of accountability for implementation of management policies, it cites o nly NLRB v. Fullerton Publishing Co. , 283 F.2d 545, 550 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 10 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M.

(CA9 1960) , which held that a news editor \"responsibly directed\" his department so as to fall within the definition of a supervisor, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) . The court looked in part to accountability in rejecting the claim that the editor merely relayed assignments and thus was not \"responsible \" for directing e m- ployees as required by the statute. The case did not involve the managerial exclusion and has no a pplication to the issues before us. FN25. See cases cited in nn. 13 and 14, s u- pra. A strict \"conformity to management policy \" test ignores the dual nature o f the managerial role, since managers by defin i- tion not only conform to established policies but also exercise their own judgment within the range of those policies. See Bell Aer o- space , 219 N.L.R.B., at 385 (quoting Eastern Camera & Photo Corp., 140 N.L.R.B. 569, 571 (1963) ). FN26. University of Chicago Library , 205 N.L.R.B. Law Judge's decision which had been premised on the \" professional judgment \" rationale); Sutter Community Hospitals of Sacrame nto, 227 N.L.R.B., at 193 (excluding as managerial a clinical sp e- cialist who used interdisciplinary profe s- sional skills to run a hospital de partment). Moreover, the Board's approach would unde r- mine the goal it purports to serve: To ensure that e m- ployees who exercise discretionary authority on behalf of the employer will not *688 divide their loyalty between employer and union. In arguing that a faculty member exercising independent judgment acts pr i- marily in his own interest and therefore does not re p- resent the interest of his employer, the Board assumes that the professional interests of the faculty and the interests of the institution are distinct, separable ent i- ties with which a faculty member could not simulta-neously be aligned. The Court of Appeals found no justification for this distinction, and we perceive none. In fact, the faculty's professional interests \u2014as applied to governance at a university like Yeshiva \u2014cannot be separated from those of the institution. In such a university, the predominant policy normally is to operate a quality institution of higher learning that will accomplish broadly defined educa- tional goals within the limits of its financial resources. The \"business \" of a university is education, a nd its vitality ultimately must depend on academic policies that largely are formulated and generally are impl e- mented by faculty governance decisions. See K. Mortimer & T. McConnell, Sharing Authority Effe c- tively 23 -24 (1978). Faculty members enhance their own standing and fulfill their professional mission by ensuring that the university's objectives are met. But there can be no doubt that the quest for academic excellence and institutional distinction is a \"policy \" to which the administration expects the faculty to adhere, whether it be defined as a professional or an instit u- tional goal. It is fruitless to ask whether an employee is \"expected to conform \" to one goal or another when the two are essentially the same. FN27 See *689 NLRB v. Scott Paper Co. , 440 F.2d 625, 630 (CA1 1971) (tractor owner -operators); Truck Inc. v. , 337 F.2d 697, 699 (CA5 1964) (same), 381 U.S. 85 S.Ct. 1448, 14 L.Ed.2d 285 (1965) . FN27. At Yeshiva, administrative concerns with scarce resources and University -wide balance have led to occasional vetoes of faculty action. But such infrequent adm inis- trative reversals in no way detract from the institution's primary concern with the ac a- demic responsibilities entrusted to the fa c- ulty. The suggestion that faculty interests depart from those of the institution with r e- spect to salary and benefits is ev en less mer- itorious. The same is true of every superv i- sory or managerial employee. Indeed, there is arguably a greater community of interest on this point in the university than in industry, because the nature and quality of a university depend so heavily on the faculty attracted to the institution. B. Richman & R. Farmer, Leadership, Goals, and Power in Higher Education 258 (1974); see D. Bornheimer, G. Burns, & G. Dumke, The Faculty in Higher Education 174- 175 (1973). The problem of divided loyalty is pa rticularly acute for a university like Yeshiva, which depends on the professional judgment of its faculty to formulate and apply **866 crucial policies constrained only by necessarily general institutional goals. The university 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 11 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2526, 63 L.Ed.2d 115, 87 as: 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856) \u00a9 2012 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works. requires faculty participation in governance because professional expertise is indispensable to the form u- lation and implementation of academic policy.FN28 It may appear, as the Board co ntends, that the professor performing governance functions is less \"account a- ble\" for departures from institutional policy than a middle -level industrial manager whose discretion is more confined. Moreover, traditional systems of co l- legiality and tenure ins ulate the professor from some of the sanctions applied to an industrial manager who fails to adhere to company policy. But the analogy of the university to industry need not, and indeed cannot, be complete. It is clear that Yeshiva and like univer- sities mu st rely on their faculties to participate in the making and implementation of their policies. FN29 The large measure of independence*690 enjoyed by fa c- ulty me mbers can only increase the danger that d i- vided loyalty will lead to those harms that the Board traditionally has sought to prevent. FN28. See American Asso ciation for Higher Education, Faculty Participation in Ac a- demic Governance 22 -24 (1967); Bornheimer, Burns, & Dumke, Theory of the Profe s- sion and Its Predicament, 58 A.A.U.P.Bull. 120, 121 (1972). The extent to which Y e- shiva faculty recommendations are impl e- mented is no \" mere coincidence, \" as Mr. Justice BRENNAN's dissent suggests. Post, at 872. Rather t his is an inevitable chara c- teristic of the governance structure adopted by universities like Yeshiva. FN29. The dissent concludes, citing several secondary authorities, that the modern un i- versity has undergone changes that have shifted \"the task of operating the university enterprise \" from faculty to administration. Post, at 872- 873. The shift, if it exists, is neither universal nor complete. See K. Mo r- timer & T. McConnell, Sharing Authority Effectively 27 -28, 158- 162, 164- 165 (1978). In any event, our decision must be based on the record before us. Nor can we decide this case by weighing the probable benefits and burdens of faculty collective bargaining. See post, at 872- 874. That, after all, is a matter for Congress, not this Court. We certainly are not suggesting an application of the managerial exclusion that would sweep all pr o- fessionals outside the Act in derogation of Congress' expressed intent to prote ct them. The Board has rec- ognized that employees whose decisionmaking is limited to the routine discharge of professional duties in projects to which they have been assigned cannot be excluded from coverage even if union membership arguably may involve som e divided loyalty. FN30 Only if an employee's activities fall outside the scope of the duties routinely performed by similarly situated pr o- fessionals will he be found aligned with management. We think these decisions accurately capture the intent of Congress, and that they provide an appropriate starting point for analysis in cases involving profe s- sionals alleged to be managerial. FN31 FN30. For this reason, architects and eng i- neers functioning as project captains for work performed by teams of professionals are deemed employees despite substantial planning responsibility and authority to d i- rect and evaluate team members. See Gen- eral 213 N.L.R.B., ; Skidmore, Owings & Merrill , 192 N.L.R.B. 920, 921 (1971) . See also Doctors' Hospital of Modesto, Inc. , 183 1440, 1441 (1966) (broadcast newswriters). In the health -care context, the Board asks in each case whether the deci- sions alleged to be managerial or supervisory are \"incidental to \" or \"in addition to \" the treatment of patients, a test Congress ex- pressly approved in 1974. S.Rep. No. 93-766, p. 6 (1974), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, 1974, p. 3946. FN31. We recognize that this is a starting point only, and that other factors not present here may enter into the analysis in other contexts. It is plain, for example, that pr o- fessors may not be excluded merely because they determine the content of their own cours es, evaluate their own students, and supervise their own research. There thus may be institutions of higher learning unlike Y e- shiva where the faculty are entirely or pr e- dominantly nonmanagerial. There also may 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 12 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2526, 63 L.Ed.2d 115, 87 as: 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856) \u00a9 2012 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works. be faculty members at Yeshiva and like univers ities who properly could be included in a bargaining unit. It may be that a rational line could be drawn between tenured and untenured faculty members, depending upon how a faculty is structured and operates. But we express no opinion on these questions, f or it is clear that the unit approved by the Board was far too broad. *691 **867 VI [3] Finally, the Board contends that the deference due its expertise in these matte rs requires us to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals. The question we decide today is a mixed one of fact and law. But the Board's opinion may be searched in vain for relevant findings of fact. The absence of factual analysis ap- parently reflects the Board's view that the managerial status of particular faculties may be decided on the basis of conclusory rationales rather than examination of the facts of each case. The Court of Appeals took a different view, and determined that the faculty of Yeshi va University, \"in effect, substantially and pe r- vasively operat[e] the enterprise. \" 582 F.2d at 698. We find no reason to reject this conclusion. As our dec i- sions consistently show, we accord great respect to the expertise of the Board when its conclusions are r a- tionally based on articulated facts and consistent with the Act. Beth Israel Hospital v. NLRB , 437 U.S. 483, 501, 98 S.Ct. 2463, 2473, 57 L.Ed.2d 370 (1978) . In this case, we hold that the Board's decision satisfies neither criterion. Affirmed. Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice WHITE, Mr. Justice MARSHALL, and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting. In holding that the full- time faculty members of Yeshiva University are not covered employees under the National Labor Relations Act, but ins tead fall within the exclusion for *692 supervisors and mana- gerial employees, the Court disagrees with the deter-mination of the National Labor Relations Board. B e- cause I believe that the Board's decision was neither irrational nor inconsistent with the Act, I respectfully dissent. I Ten years ago the Board first asserted jurisdiction over private nonprofit institutions of higher education. Cornell University , 183 N.L.R.B. 329 (1970) . Since then, the Board has often struggled with the Procrus- tean task of attempting to implement in the altogether different environment of the academic community the broad directives of a statutory scheme designed for the bureaucratic industrial workplace. See, e. g., Adelphi University , 195 N.L.R.B. 639, 648 (1972) . Resolution of the particular issue presented in this case \u2014whether full-time faculty members are covered \" employees \" under the Act \u2014is but one of several challenges co n- fronting the Board in this \"unchartered area. \" C. W. Post Center , 189 N.L.R.B. 904, 905 ( 1971) . Because at the time of the Act's passage Congress did not contemplate its application to private unive r- sities, it is not surprising that the terms of the Act itself provide no answer to the question before us. Indeed, the statute evidences signi ficant tension as to co n- gressional intent in this respect by its explicit inclu- sion, on the one hand, of \" professional employees \" under \u00a7 2(12), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(12) , and its exclusion, on the other, of \" supervisors \" under \u00a7 2(11), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) . Similarly, when transplanted to the ac a- demic arena, the Act's extension of coverage to pr o- fessionals under \u00a7 2(12) cannot easily be squared with the Board -created exclusion of \"managerial emplo y- ees\" in the industrial context. See generally NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co. , 416 U.S. 267, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974) . Primary authority to resolve these conflicts and to adapt the Act to the changing patterns of industrial relations was *693 entrusted to the Board, n ot to the judiciary. NLRB v. Weingarten, Inc. , 420 U.S. 251, 266, 95 S.Ct. 959, 969, 43 L.Ed.2d 171 (1975) . The Court has often admonished that \" [t]he ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflictin g legitimate interests. The function of striking that balance to e f- fectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility, which the Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial re view. \" **868 NLRB v.

Accordingly, the judicial role is limited; a court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board. The Board's decision may be reviewed for its rationality and its c onsistency with the *694 Act, but once these criteria are satisfied, the order must be enforced. See Be th Israel Hospital v. NLRB, supra , 437 U.S., at 501, 98 S.Ct., at 2473 . FN1. \"It is not necessary in this case to make a completely definitive limitation around the term 'employee. ' That task has been assigned primarily to the agency created by Congress to administer the Act. Determination of 'where all the conditions of the relation r e- quire protection ' involves inquiries for the Board charged with this duty. Everyday e x- perience in the administration of the statute gives it familiarity with the circumstance s and backgrounds of employment relatio n- ships in various industries, with the abilities and needs of the workers for self organiza-tion and collective action, and with the adaptability of collective bargaining for the peaceful settlement of their disputes w ith their employers. The experience thus ac- quired must be brought frequently to bear on the question who is an employee under the Act. Resolving that question . . . ' belongs to the usual administrative routine ' of the Board.\" NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc. , 322 U.S. 111, 130, 64 S.Ct. 851, 860, 88 Se v- Bottling Co. , 344 U.S. 344, 349, 73 S.Ct. 287, 290, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953) . II In any event, I believe the Board reached the correct result in determining that Yeshiva's full -time faculty is covered under the NLRA. The Court does not dispute that the faculty members are \" professional employees \" for the purposes of collective bargaini ng under \u00a7 2(12), but nevertheless finds them excluded from coverage under the implied exclusion for ma n- agerial employees. \" FN2 The Court explains that \"[t]he controlling consideration in this case is that the faculty of Yeshiva University exercise authority which in any other context unquestionably would be managerial. \" Ante, at 864. But the academic community is simply not \"any other context. \" The Court purport s to reco g- nize that there are fundamental differences between the authority structures of the typical industrial and academic institutions which preclude the blind tran s- planting of principles developed in one arena onto the other; yet it nevertheless ignor es those very differ- ences in concluding that Yeshiva's faculty is excluded from the Act's coverage. FN2. Because the Court concludes that Y e- shiva's full -time f aculty are managerial e m- ployees, it finds it unnecessary to reach the University's contention that the faculty are also excluded as \" supervisors \" under \u00a7 2 (11). Ante, at 862. My discussion therefore focuses on the question of the faculty's managerial stat us, but I would resolve the issue of their supervisory status in a similar fashion. As reflected in the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Amendments of 1947, the concern b e- hind the exclusion of supervisors under \u00a7 2(11) of the Act is twofold. On the one hand, Congress sought to protect the rank -and-file employees from being u n- duly influenced in their selection of leaders by the presence of management representatives in their u n- ion. \"If supervisors were members of and active in the union which represe nted the employees they supe r- vised it could be possible *695 for the supervisors to obtain and retain positions of power in the union by reason of their authority over their fellow union members while working on the job. \" NLRB v. Me t- ropolitan Life Ins. Co. , 405 F.2d 1169, 1178 (CA2 1968) . In addition, Congress wanted to ensure that employers would not be deprived of the **869 undi- vided loyalty of their supervisory foremen. Congress was concerned that if supervisors were allowed to affiliate with labor organizations that represented the rank and file, they might become accountable to the workers, thus interfering with the supervisors' ability to discipline and control the employees in the interest of the employer.FN3 FN3. See H.R.Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 14 (1947): \"The evidence before the committee shows clearly that unionizing supervisors under 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 14 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M.

It is inconsistent with the policy of Congress to assure to workers freedom from domination or con-trol by their supervisors in their organizing and bargaining activities. It is inconsistent with our policy to protect the rights of employers; they, as well as workers, are entitled to loyal representatives in the plants, but when the foremen unionize, even in a union that claims to be ' inde- pendent ' of the union of the rank and file, they are subject to influence and control by the rank and file union, and, instead of their bossing the rank and file, the rank and file bosses them. \" See also S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 -5 (1947). Identical considerations underlie the exclusion of managerial employees. See ante , at 862. Although a variety of verbal formulations have received judicial approval over the years, see Retail Clerks Intern a- tional Assn. v. NLRB , 125 U.S.App.D.C. F.2d 642, 644- 645 (1966) , this Court has recently sanctioned a definition of \"managerial employee\" that comprises those who \" 'formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making o p- erative the decisions of their employer. ' \" See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co. , 416 U.S., at 288, 94 S.Ct. at 1768. The touchstone of managerial status is thus an alliance with management, and the pivotal inquiry is whether the employee in performing his *696 duties represents his ow n interests or those of his employer. FN4 If his actions are undertaken for the purpose of implemen t- ing the employer's policies, then he is accountable to manage ment and may be subject to conflicting loya l- ties. But if the employee is acting only on his own behalf and in his own interest, he is covered under the Act and is entitled to the benefits of collective ba r- gaining. FN4. Section 2(11) of the Act requires, as a condition of supervisory status, that authority be exercised \" in the interest of the emplo y- er.\" 29 U.S.C. 418 F.2d 140 (CA5 1969) ; International Union of United Bre w- ery Workers v. NLRB , 111 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 298 F.2d 297 (1961) . After examining the voluminous record in this case,FN5 the Board determined that the faculty at Y e- shiva exercised its decisionmaking authority in its own intere st rather than \"in the interest of the e m- ployer. \" 221 N.L.R.B. 1053, 1054 (1975) . The Court, in contrast, can perceive \"no justification for th is dis- tinction \" and concludes that the faculty's interests \"cannot be separated from those of the institution. \" Ante, at 865. FN6 But the Court's vision is clouded by its failure fully to discern and comprehend the nature of the faculty's role in university governance. FN5. The Board held hearings over a 5-month perio d and compiled a record co n- taining more than 4,600 pages of testimony and 200 exhibits. FN6. The Court thus determines that all of Yeshiva's full -time faculty members are managerial employees, even though their role in university decisionmaking is limited to the professional recommendations of the faculty acting as a collective body, and even though they supervise and manage no pe r- sonnel other than themselves. T he anomaly of such a result demonstrates the error in extending the managerial exclusion to a class of essentially rank -and-file employees who do not represent the interests of management and who are not subject to the danger of conflicting loyalties which motivated the adoption of that exemption. Unlike the purely hierarchical decisionmaking structure that prevails in the typical industrial orga n- ization, the bureaucratic foundation of most \" mature \" universities is characterized by dual authority systems. The primary decisional *697 network is hierarchical in nature: Authority is lodged in the administration, and a formal chain of command runs from a lay go v- erning board down through university officers to i n- dividual **870 faculty members and students. At the same time, there exists a parallel professional net- work, in which formal mechanisms have been created to bring the expertise of the faculty into the decisionmaking process. See J. Baldridge, Power and Conflict in the University 114 (1971); Finkin, The NLR B in Higher Education, 5 U.Toledo L.Rev. 608, 614- 618 (1974). 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 15 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M.

What the Board realized \u2014and what the Court fails to apprehend \u2014is that whatever influence the faculty wields in university decisionmaking is a t- tributable solely to its collective expertise as pr ofes- sional educators, and not to any managerial or supe r- visory prerogatives. Although the administration may look to the faculty for advice on matters of profe s- sional and academic concern, the faculty offers its recommendations in order to serve its own in de- pendent interest in creating the most effective env i- ronment for learning, teaching, and scholarship. FN7 And while the administration may attempt to defer to the faculty's competence whenever possible, it must and does apply its own distinct perspective to those recommendations, a perspective that is based on fiscal *698 and other managerial policies which the faculty has no part in developing. The University al ways retains the ultimate decisionmaking authority, see ante, at 858 -859, and the administration gives what weight and import to the faculty's collective judgment as it chooses and deems consistent with its own pe r- ception of the institution's needs and obj ectives. FN8 FN7. As the Board has recognized, due to the unique nature of their work, professional employees will often make recommendations on matters that are of great importance to management. But their desire to exert influ- ence in these areas stems from the need to maintain their own professional standards, and this factor \u2014common to all professio n- als\u2014should not, by itself, preclude their in- clusion in a bargaining unit. See Westin g- house Electric Corp. , 113 N.L.R.B. 337, 339- 340 (1955) . In fact, Congress clearly recognized both that professional empl oyees consistently exercise independent judgment and discretion in the performance of their duties, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(12) , and that they have a significant interest in maintaining certain professional standards, see S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 11 (1947). Yet Congress specifically included profes- sionals within the Act's coverage . See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co. , 416 U.S. 267, 298, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1773, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974) (WHITE, J., dissenting in part). FN8. One must be careful not to overvalue the significance of the faculty's influence on academic affairs. As one commentator has noted, \"it is not extraordinary for employees to seek to exert influence over matters e m- bedded in an employment relationship for which they share a concern, or that ma n- agement would be responsive to their strongly held desires. \" Finkin, The NLRB in Higher Education, 5 U.Toledo L.Rev. 608, 616 (1974). Who, after all, is better suited than the faculty to decide what courses should be offered, how they should be taught, and by what standards their students should be graded? Employers will often attempt to defer to their employees' suggestions, pa r- ticularly where \u2014as here \u2014those reco m- menda tions relate to matters within the unique competence of the employees. Moreover, insofar as faculty members are given some say in more traditional mana- gerial decisions such as the hiring and promotion of other personnel, such discr e- tion does not constitute an adequate basis for the conferral of managerial or super-visory status. Indeed, in the typical indus- trial context, it is not uncommon for the employees' union to be given the exclusive right to recommend personnel to the e m- ployer, and these hiring- hall agreements have been upheld even where the union requires a worker to pass a u n- ion-administered skills test as a condition of referral. See, e. g., Local 42 (Catalytic Constr. Co.) , 164 N.L.R.B. 916 (1967) ; see generally Teamsters v. NLRB , 365 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 835, 6 L.Ed.2d 11 (1961) . The premise of a finding of managerial status is a determination that the excluded employee is acting on behalf of management and is answerable to a higher authority in the exercise of his responsibilities. The Board has consistently implemented this requir e- ment \u2014both for professional and n on-professional employees \u2014by conferring managerial status only upon those employees \"whose interests are closely aligned with management as true representatives of management. \" (Emphasis added.) E. g., Sutter Co m- munity Hospitals of Sacramento , 227 N.L.R.B. 181, 193 (1976) ; *699 Bell Aerospace, 219 N.L.R.B. 384, 385 (1975) ; **871 General Dynamics Corp. , 213 N.L.R.B. 851, 857 (1974) .FN9 Only if the employee is expected to conform to management policies and is 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 16 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M.

Works. judged by his effectiveness in executing those policies does the danger of divided loyalties exist. FN9. The Board has also explained that the ability of the typical professional employee to influence company policy does not bestow managerial authority: \"Work which is based on professional competence necessarily involves a co n- sistent exercise of discretion and judgment, else professionalism would not be i n- volved. Nevertheless, professional e m- ployees plainly are not the same as ma n- agement employees either by definition or in authority, and managerial authority is not vested in professional employees merely by virtue of their professional st a- tus, or because work performed in that status may have a bearing on company direction. \" General Dynamics Corp. , 213 N.L.R.B., at 857 -858. Yeshiva's faculty, however, is not accountable to the administra tion in its governance function, nor is any individual faculty member subject to personal sanction or control based on the administration's a s- sessment of the worth of his recommendations. When the faculty, through the schools' advisory committees, particip ates in university decisionmaking on subjects of academic policy, it does not serve as the \"repre- sentative of management. \" FN10 Unlike industrial s u- pervisors *700 and managers, university professors are not hired to \" make operative\" the policies and decisions of their employer. Nor are they retained on the condition that their interests will correspond to those of the university administration. Indeed, the notion that a faculty member's professional comp e- tence could depend on his undivided loyalty to ma n- agement is antithetical to the whole concept of aca- demic freedom. Faculty members are judged by their employer on the quality of their teaching and scho l- arship, not on the compatibility of their advice with administration policy. Board Member Kennedy aptly concluded in his concurring opinion in Northeaste rn University , 218 N.L.R.B. 247, 257 (1975) (footnote omitted): FN10. Where faculty members actually do serve as management's representatives, the Board has not hesitated to exclude them from the Act's coverage as managerial or super- visory personnel. Compare University of Vermont , 223 N.L.R.B. 423 (1976) (exclu d- ing department chairmen as supervisors), and University of Miami , 213 N.L.R.B. 634 (1974) (excluding deans as supervisors), with Northeastern University , 218 N.L.R.B. 247 (1975) (department chairmen included within bargaining unit because they act pr i- marily as instruments of the faculty), and Fordham University , 193 N.L.R.B . 134 (1971) (including department chairmen b e- cause they are considered to be represent a- tives of the faculty rather than of the admi n- istration). In fact, the bargaining unit a p- proved by the Board in the present case e x- cluded deans, acting deans, directo rs, and principal investigators of research and trai n- ing grants, all of whom were deemed to e x- ercise supervisory or managerial authority. See ante, at 870, n. 7. \"[T]he influence which the faculty exercises in many areas of academic governance is insuffic ient to make them 'managerial ' employees. Such infl u- ence is not exercised 'for management ' or 'in the interest of the employer, ' but rather is exercised in their own professional interest. The best evidence of this fact is that faculty members are generall y not held accountable by or to the administration for their faculty governance functions. Faculty criticism of administration policies, for example, is viewed not as a breach of loyalty, but as an exercise in ac- ademic freedom. So, too, intervention by the uni- versity administration in faculty deliberations would most likely be considered an infringement upon academic freedoms. Conversely, university administrations rarely consider themselves bound by faculty recommendations. \" It is no answer to say, as doe s the Court, that Yeshiva's faculty and administration are one and the same because their interests tend to coincide. In the first place, the National Labor Relations Act does not condition its coverage on an antagonism of interests between the employer an d the employee. *701 FN11 The mere coincidence of interests **872 on many issues has never been thought to abrogate the right to co l- lective bargaining on those topics as to which that coincidence is absent. Ultimately, the performance of an employee's duties will always further the interests 100 S.Ct. 856 Page 17 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 103 L.R.R.M.

Works. of the employer, for in no institution do the interests of labor and management totally diverge. Both desire to maintain s table and profitable operations, and both are committed to creating the best possible product within existing financial constraints. Differences of opinion and emphasis may develop, however, on exactly how to devote the institution's resources to achieve those goals. When these disagreements surface, the national labor laws contemplate their resolution through the peaceful process of collective bargaining. And in this regard, Yeshiva University stands on the same footing as any other employer. FN11. Nor does the frequency with which an employer acquiesces in the recommendations of its employees convert them into managers or supervisors. See Stop & Shop Cos., Inc. v. NLRB , 548 F.2d 17, 19 (CA1 1977) . Rather, the pertinent inquiries are who retains the ultimate decisionmaking authority and in whose interest the suggestions are offered. A diffe rent test could permit an employer to deny its employees the benefits of collective bargaining on important issues of wages, hours, and other conditions of employment merely by consulting with them on a host of less significant matters and accepting their advice when it is consistent with manage- ment's own objectives. Moreover, the congruence of interests in this case ought not to be exaggerated. The university admi n- istration has certain economic and fiduciary respo n- sibilities that are not shared by the fac ulty, whose primary concerns are academic and relate solely to its own professional reputation. The record evinces n u- merous instances in which the faculty's recommend a- tions have been rejected by the administration on account of fiscal constraints or other managerial pol i- cies. Disputes have arisen between Yeshiva's faculty and administration on such fundamental issues as the hiring, tenure, promotion, retirement, and dismissal of faculty members, *702 academic standards and cred- its, departmental budgets, and even the faculty's choice of its own departmental representative. FN12 The very fact that Yeshiva's faculty has voted for the U n- ion to serve as its represent ative in future negotiations with the administration indicates that the faculty does not perceive its interests to be aligned with those of management. Indeed, on the precise topics which are specified as mandatory subjects of collective bar-gaining \u2014wages, hours, and other terms and cond i- tions of employment FN13\u2014the interests of teacher and administrator are often diametrically opposed. FN12. See, e. g., App. 740- 742 (faculty hi r- ing); id., at 232 -233, 632, 667 (tenure); id ., at 194, 362 (academic credits); id ., at 723- 724, 1469- 1470 (cutback in depar t- mental budget leading to loss of accredit a- tion); id., at 410, 726 -727 (election of de- partment and representative). U.S.C. Finally, the Court's perception of the Yeshiva faculty's status is distorted by the rose -colored lens through which it views the governance structure of the modern -day university. The Court's conclusion that the faculty's professional interests are indistingui sha- ble from those of the administration is bottomed on an idealized model of collegial decisionmaking that is a vestige of the great medieval university. But the uni- versity of today bears little resemblance to the \"community of scholars \" of yesteryear. FN14 **873 Education has become *703 \"big business, \" and the task of operating the university enterprise has been transferred from the faculty to an autonomous a d- ministration, which faces the same pressures to cut costs and increase efficiencies that confront any large industrial organization. FN15 The past decade of bud g- etary cutbacks, declining enrollments, reductions in faculty appointments, curtailment of academic pr o- grams, and increasing calls for accountability to alumni and other special interest groups has only added to the erosion of the faculty's role in the inst i- tution's decisonmaking process.

Mortimer & T. McConnell, Sharing Authority Effectively 4 (1978). The authors conclude: \"Higher education is in the throes of a shift from informal and consensual judgments to authority based on formal criteria. . . . There have been changes in societ al and legislative expectations about higher ed u- cation, an increase in external regulation of colleges and universities, an increase in emphasis on managerial skills and the technocratic features of modern manag e- ment, and a greater codification of internal decisionmaking procedures. These changes raise the question whether exis t- ing statements of shared authority provide adequate guidelines for internal gover n- ance. \" Id., at 269. FN15. In 1976 -1977, the total expenditures of institutions of higher education in the United States exceeded $42 billion. National Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics 137 (Table 133) (1979). In the same year, Yeshiva University, a pr i- vate institution, received over $34 million in revenues from the Federal Government. Id ., at 132 (Table 127). FN16. University fac ulty members have been particularly hard hit by the current financial squeeze. Because of inflation, the purchasing power of the faculty's salary has declined an average of 2.9% every year since 1972. Real salaries are thus 13.6% below the 1972 le v- els. Han sen, An Era of Continuing Decline: Annual Report on the Economic Status of the Profession, 1978- 1979, 65 Academe: Bull e- tin of the American Association of Unive r- sity Professors 319, 323 -324 (1979). Mor e- over, the faculty at Yeshiva has fared even worse than most. Whereas the average salary of a full professor at a comparable institution is $31,100, a full professor at Yeshiva ave r-ages only $27,100. Id., at 334, 348. In fact, a severe financial crisis at the University in 1971 -1972 forced the president to orde r a freeze on all faculty promotions and pay i n- creases. App. 1459. *704 These economic exigencies have also ex- acerbated the tensions in university labor relations, as the faculty and administration more and more fr e- quently find themselves advocating conf licting pos i- tions not only on issues of compensation, job security, and working conditions, but even on subjects formerly thought to be the faculty's prerogative. In response to this friction, and in an attempt to avoid the strikes and work stoppages that have disrupted several major universities in recent years, many faculties have en- tered into collective -bargaining relationships with their administrations and governing boards. FN17 An even greater number of schools \u2014Yeshiva among them \u2014have endeavored to negotiate and compromise their differences informally, by establishing avenues for faculty input into university decisions on matters of professional concern. FN17. As of January 1979, 80 private and 302 public institutions of higher education had engaged in collective bargaining with their faculties, and over 130, 000 academic personnel had been unionized.

Al t- hough the NLRA is not applicable to any public employer, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2) , as of 1976, 22 States had enacted leg islation granting faculties at public institutions the right to unionize and requiring public e m- ployers to bargain with duly constituted bargaining agents.

By its overbroad and unwarranted interpretation of the managerial exclusion, **874 the Court denies the faculty the pr o- tections of the NLRA and, in so doing, removes whatever deterrent value the Act's availability may offer against unreasonable administrative conduct. FN18 Rather than promoting the Act's objective of funneling dissension between employers and employees into collective bargaining, the Court's decision undermines that goal and contributes to the possibility that \"re- curring disputes [will] fester outside the nego tiation process until strikes or other forms of economic war-fare occur. \" Ford Motor Co. v.

Collective bargaining does provide agreed -upon rules of behavior, contractual understandings, and mechanisms for dispute settlement and grievance handling that help to manage co n- flict.\" Id., at 51. III In sum, the Board analyzed both the es sential purposes underlying the supervisory and managerial exclusions and the nature of the governance structure at Yeshiva University. Relying on three factors that attempt to encapsulate the fine distinction between those professional employees who are entitled to the NLRA's protections and those whose managerial r e- sponsibilities require their exclusion, FN19 the Board concluded *706 that Yeshiva's full -time faculty qua l- ify as the former rather than the latter. I believe the Board made the correct determination. But even were I to have reservations about the specific result reached by the Board on the facts of this case, I would certainly have to conclude that the Board applied a proper mode of analysis to arrive at a decision well within the zone of reasonableness. Accordingly, in light of the defer-ence due the Board's determination in this complex area, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. FN19. Contrary to the Court's assertion, see ante, at 863, the Board has not abandoned the \"collective authority \" and \"ultimate autho r- ity\" branches of its analysis. See Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 78 -857, pp. 11- 12, n. 8. Although the \" interest/alignment analysis \" rationale goes to the heart of the basis for the managerial and supervisory exclusions and therefore provides the strongest support for the Board's determination, the other two r a- tionales are significant because they hig h- light two aspects of the university decisionmaking process relevant to the Board's decision: That the faculty's influence is exercised collectively \u2014and only ollec- tively \u2014indicates that the faculty's reco m- mendations embody the views of the rank and file rather than those of a select group of persons charged with formulating and i m- plementing management policies. Similarly, that the administration retains ultimate au- thority merely indicates that a true system of collegiality is simply not the mode of go v- ernance at Yeshiva University. U.S.,1980.

NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD, Respondent Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh/Communications Workers of America, Local 38061, Intervenor. Nos. 05- 1060, 05- 1081. Argued Jan. 17, 2006. Decided Aug. 1, 2006. Background: University petitioned for judicial r e- view of decisions in which National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that university's full -time faculty could form union and that university committed unfair labor practice under National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by refusing to recognize and bargain with faculty's union. NLRB filed cross -application for enforcement. Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Griffith , Circuit Judge, held that: (1) NLRB's failure to explain basis for determination that university's faculty members could form union warranted remand for further proceedings, and (2) findings underlying NLRB's decision not to reopen and supplement the administrative record were not supported by substantial evidence. Petition for review granted and case remanded.

Yeshiva University, 444 U.S. 672, 100 S.Ct. 856, 63 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980) , the S u- preme Court first determined that faculty at colleges and universities may be managerial employees exempt from the protection of the National Labor Relations Act ( \"NLRA \" or the \"Act\"), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. Since Yeshiva, the ba ttle lines over organizing unions among faculty have been drawn with predictable ar- guments. College and university administrations ty p- ically argue that their faculties' involvement in aca- demic affairs is extensive and managerial. Unions argue it is limited and circumscribed. And so it is here. Petitioner Point Park University (the \" University \" or \"Point Park \") argues that the Act bars its faculty from organizing a bargaining unit because they are ma n- agers. The union argues they are not. Yeshiva and our explanation of its application in LeMoyne -Owen Co l- lege v. NLRB, 357 F.3d 55 , provide the National Labor Relations Board ( \"NLRB \" or the \"Board \") guidance how to resolve this type of dispute. Because neither the Regional Director nor the Board followed that guidance and thus failed to adequately explain why the faculty's role at the University is not managerial, we grant the University's petition for review, deny without prejudice the Board's cross- application for enforcement, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion so that the Board can provide such an expl a- nation or reconsider its conclusion. I. Point Park University, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has 3,200 students, 80 full -time faculty, and 560 employees. Founded in 1960 as Point Park College, it was chartered as a university in 2003 and renamed to reflect its new status. Students at the University pursue bachelors degrees in fifty majors and seven masters degrees through four schools: Arts and Sciences, Business, the Conservatory of Pe r- forming Arts, and the Adult and Professional Studies Program. Point Park's authority structure consists of a board of trustees, a president who also serves as a **399 *45 member of that board, a vice president of academic affairs who also serves as dean of the fac- ulty, an associate vice president of academic affairs, deans of the four schools, department chairs, program directors, and the faculty. In 2003, the Newspaper Guild of Pitt s- burgh/Communications Workers of America, Local 38061, AFL -CIO (the \"Union\" ) filed a petition with the Board seeking to represent a bargaining unit of all full-time faculty at Point Park. The University co n- tested the pet ition, arguing that all its full -time faculty members were managerial employees and that some of the full -time faculty were supervisors, FN1 both barred by the A ct from organizing a union. The R e- gional Director of Region Six of the NLRB convened nineteen days of hearings between November 12, 2003 and January 16, 2004 to consider the Union's petition. The Regional Director concluded that the full-time faculty were eligible for union representation and that the University had failed to prove, under Yeshiva, that the faculty \"exercise such plenary, a b- solute or effective authority or control to warrant their exclusion from the protection of the Act as managerial employees. \" The Regional Director also found that some faculty members were supervisors and thus barred by the Act from joining a union, while others were not. FN2 FN1. Those included: (1) Robert O'Gara, Frederick Johnson, Martin Greenberg, and Walter Zalot, who were program directors; (2) the unfilled position of Director of the MBA program; (3) Robin Walsh, Head of Page 5 457 F.3d 42, 180 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2072, 372 U.S.App.D.C. 396, 153 Lab.Cas. P 10,703, 211 Ed. Law Rep. 573 (Cite as: 457 F.3d 42, 372 U.S.App.D.C. 396) \u00a9 2012 Thomson Reuters. No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works. Graduate Studies; and (4) William Moushey, Executive D irector of the Innocence Inst i- tute. FN2. The Regional Director found that \"Robert O'Gara, Frederick Johnson, Walter Zalot and the Director of the MBA program are supervisors within the meaning of the Act\" and not allowed to organize, but was \"unable to determine on the record before [him] whether [Martin] Greenberg, a recently hired program director ... possesses any managerial authority \" and thus permitted \"Greenberg to vote subject to challenge in the election. \" The Regional Director co n- cluded that neither Robin Walsh nor William Moushey were supervisors or managerial employees. Petitioners do not dispute these findings and conclusions. The University filed with the Board a timely r e- quest for review of the Regional Director's decision, see 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.67 , arguing that the decision d e- parted from e stablished Board precedent and was clearly erroneous with respect to a number of facts not at issue here. The Board denied Point Park's request for review. After an election, the Union was certified as the exclusive collective bargaining representative. The University refused to recognize or bargain with the Union, and the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge in response. The Board's General Counsel issued a complaint against the University, alleging that it had violated Sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of t he Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (5) ,FN3 by \"fail[i ng] and refus [ing] to recognize and bargain with the Union. \" In defense of its conduct, Point Park challenged the Board's d e- cision to certify the Union and asked the Board to reopen the record to consider additional, newly di s- covered evidence. The Board g ranted the General Counsel's motion for summary judgment, ordered Point Park to bargain with the Union, and refused to reopen the record. FN3. Section 158(a) of Title 29, United States Code , provides that \"[i]t shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer -(1) to interfere with, rest rain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in [the Act]; [or] ... (5) to refuse to bargain colle c- tively with the representatives of his e m- ployees. \" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) . Point Park filed a timely petition for review with this Court, and the Board filed a cross -application for enforcement of the **400 *46 Board's order. Point Park's petition brings \"the entire proceed- ing-including the Regional Director's underlying d e- cision to certify the full -time faculty as a bargaining unit-before this court for review. \" LeMoyne -Owen, 357 F.3d at 60 (citing Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376 U.S. 473, 477, 84 S.Ct. 894, 11 L.Ed. 2d 849 (1964) ). II. The gravamen of Point Park's petition is that the Board erred in determining that the University's full-time faculty are not managerial employees under the Act and are thus entitled to form a union. We conclude that we are unable to review adequately the Board's decision because the Regional Director failed to follow our guidance in LeMoyne- Owen that he explain which factors he found \"significant and which less so, and why \" in determining, pursuant to Yeshiva, that Point Park's full -time faculty were not managerial employees. See 357 F.3d at 61 . A. The Supreme Court set off a seismic shift in the law of labor relations in American higher education when it held in Yeshiva that, in some circumstances, faculty members, who for many years the Board had thought were protected by the National Labor Rel a- tions Act, might instead be barred by the Act from organizing a union.FN4 The proper analysis, the Court held, turns on the type of control faculty exercise over academic affairs at an institution. A brief explanation of the history of the sometimes expanding, sometimes contracting protections of the Act by Congress and the Supreme Court will help explain why the correct a p- plication of Yeshiva 's analysis is so important to the proper resolution of this case. FN4. See Marina Angel, Professionals and Unionization, 66 MINN. L. REV. 383, 447-455 (1982). As enacted in 1935, the National Labor Relations Act broadly authorized \" any employee, \" excluding agricultural laborers and domestic servants, to organ- ize a union. See National Labor Relations Act of 1935, Pub.L. No. 74 -198, \u00a7 2(3), 49 Stat. 449, 450. The Supreme Court held that under this expansive la n- guage even supervisors enjoyed the protection of the Page 6 457 F.3d 42, 180 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2072, 372 U.S.App.D.C. 396, 153 Lab.Cas.

NLRB, 330 U.S. 485, 489-90, 67 S.Ct. 789, 91 L.Ed. 1040 (1947) (\"we see no basis in this Act whatever for holding that foremen are fo rbidden the protection of the Act when they take collective action to protect their collective interests \"). In quick response to the Supreme Court, Congress removed supervisors from the Act's protection, see Labor Management Relations (Taft -Hartley) Act of 1947, ch. 120, sec. 101, \u00a7 2(3), 61 Stat. 136, 137- 38 (codified as U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3) include .. . any individual employed as a supervisor \"), but also explicitly i n- cluded professional employees within the Act's reach, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 2(12) (codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 ) (authorizing professional employees to unionize where \"a majority of such professional e m- ployees vote for inclusion in such unit \"). From the time the Board first asserted jurisdiction over a un i- versity's faculty in 1971 until the Supreme Court d e- cided Yeshiva in 1980, the Board considered faculty members at institutions of higher learning \"profe s- sional employees \" whose union activities were pr o- tected by t he Act. See C.W. Post Ctr. of Long Island Univ., 189 N.L.R.B. 904, 905 (1971) . In 1974, the Supreme Court recognized another exception to the Act when it held **401 *47 in NLRB v. Bell A erospace Co. that \"Congress intended to exclude from the protections of the Act all employees properly classified as ' managerial. ' \" 416 U.S. 267, 275, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974) . Although the Act did not contain an express statutory exclusion for management employees like what Congress had provided for supervisors, the Court reasoned that they were \"regarded as so clearly outside the Act \" by the Congress that first created the Act \"that no specific exclusionary provision was thought necessary. \" Id. at 283, 94 S.Ct. 1757. Managerial employees, who cannot form or join a union, were those who \"form u- late and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative the d ecisions of their emplo y- er.\" Id. at 288, 94 S.Ct. 1757 (quotation marks omi t- ted). The key inquiry, the Court later explained, was whether employees were \" aligned with management. \" Yeshiva, 444 U.S. at 683, 100 S.Ct. 856 (citing Bell Aerospace, 416 U.S. at 286- 87, 94 S.Ct. 1757). Since Bell Aerospace, the Board's determinations in cases involving union petitions to organize have often turned on the distinction between professional employ ees, who may unionize, and managerial e m- ployees, who may not.FN5 Making that distinction requires the Board to conduct a fact -intensive inquiry into the specific responsibilities of employees. See Salinas Newspapers, 279 N.L.R.B. 1007, 1010 (1986) (\"[t]he Supreme Court and the Board, in determining managerial status, weigh the facts elicited to deter-mine whether or not the persons at issue are involved in the formulation, determination and ef fectuation of management policies \") (quoting Simplex Indus., Inc., 243 N.L.R.B. 111, 111 (1979) ); Curtis Noll Corp., 218 N.L.R.B. 1447, 1448 (1975) (\"Whether or not a pe r- son is ' managerial ' is to be determined on a case- by-case basis after close examination of the d u- ties performed by the person in question while oc cu- pying a position alleged to be ' managerial. ' \"). FN5. See, e.g., Neighborhood Legal Servs., Inc., 236 N.L.R.B. 1269, 1273 (1978) (\"professional employees plainly are not the same as manag ement employees either by definition or in authority, and managerial authority is not vested in professional e m- ployees merely by virtue of their professional status, or because work performed in that status may have a bearing on company d i- rection \"); Case Corp., 304 N.L.R.B. 939, 948 (1991) (\"technical and professional e m- ployees plainly are not the same as manag e- rial employees either by definition or in a u- thority \"); General Dynamics Corp., 213 N.L.R.B. 851, 857 (1974) (distinguishing professional employees from managerial employees who occ upy \"executive -type p o- sitions [and] are closely aligned with ma n- agement as true representatives of manag e- ment \"). Even after Bell Aerospace, the Board con tinued to find that full -time faculty at colleges and universities were professional, not managerial, employees. See, e.g., Goddard College, 234 N.L.R.B. 1111, 1113 (1978) (\"the discretion exercised by core faculty members, both individually and collectively, regar d- ing such matters as student recruitment and admi s- sions, completion of degree requirements, and curri c- ulum, clearly is indicative of professional, rather than managerial status \"); Ne. Univ., 218 N.L.R.B. 247, 257 (1975) (\"The existence of ... 'shared authority' may well indicate that faculty members are 'professionals, ' but it does not necessarily make them 'managerial. ' \").

No Claim to Orig. US Gov. Works. As long as faculty were understood to be profe s- sional employees, which they clearly are, and not also managerial employees under Bell Aerospace, the task of the Board was relatively straightforward. See id. That all changed with Yeshiva, when the Supreme Court applied the definition of managerial employee in Bell Aerospace to faculty at a college or university and **402 *48 held for the first time that some faculty members, even though they are professional emplo y- ees, may also be \" managerial employees, \" barred by the Act from union activities. 444 U.S. at 691, 100 S.Ct. 856 . [1][2] [3] Yeshiva imposed significant demands upon the Board in determining whether faculty members are \" managerial employees, \" holding that this mixed question of fact and law cannot be dete r- mined \"on the basis of conclu sory rationales rather than examination of the facts of each case. \" Id. In other words, context is everything. Every academic institution is different, an d in determining whether a particular institution's faculty are \"managerial e m- ployees \" excluded from the Act or \" professional e m- ployees \" included in the Act, the Board must perform an exacting analysis of the particular institution and faculty at issue. Th at analysis must look beyond self-serving descriptions of the role of faculty or the administration of a university. In Yeshiva, the Court looked repeated ly to the actual role of the faculty in the academic affairs of the university.FN6 The key inquiry is \"how a faculty is structured and operates. \" Id. at 690 n. 31, 100 S.Ct. 856 (emphasis added). Th e Board's task under Yeshiva is made more difficult by the fact, frankly acknowledged by the Court in Ye- shiva, that the Act is not easily applied to labor rela- tions in the university setting: FN6. See id. at 676, 100 S.Ct. 856 (\"Through these meetings and committees, the faculty at each school effectively determine its curri c- ulum, grading system, admission and m a- triculation standards, academic calendars, and course schedules. \") (emphasis added); id. at 686, 100 S.Ct. 856 (\"They effectiv ely decide which students will be admitted, r e- tained, and graduated. \") (emphasis added); id. at 691, 100 S.Ct. 856 (\"[T]he faculty of Yeshiva University, in effect, substantially and pervasively operat[e] the enterprise. \") (citation omitted, quotation marks omitted, and emphasis added). The A ct was intended to accommodate the type of management -employee relations that prevail in the pyramidal hierarchies of private industry. In contrast, authority in the typical mature private university is divided between a central administration and one or more collegial bodies.... Although faculties have been subject to external control in the United States since colonial times, traditions of collegiality continue to play a significant role at many universities, including Yeshiva. For these reasons, the Boar d has recognized that principles developed for use in the industrial setting cannot be imposed blindly on the academic world. Id. at 680 -81, 100 S.Ct. 856 (internal citations, quotation marks, and footnote omitted). Thus, the Board must determine whether the faculty in question so controls th e academic affairs of the school that their interests are aligned with those of the university or whether they occupy a role more like that of the pr o- fessional employee in the \" pyramidal hierarchies of private industries. \" See id. That is by its very nature a fact-bound inquiry. [4] The Court also noted that the core professional activities of faculty that are common at most colleges and universities -\"determin[ing] the content of their own courses, evaluat[ing] their own students, and supervis[ing] their own research \"-are not enough, by themselves, to remove faculty from the protection of the Act. Id. at 690 n. 31, 100 S.Ct. 856 (emphasis added). The Court determined, however, that the fac- ulty at Yeshiva University were involved in activities far beyond the core professional activities of a typical faculty -activities that fit the Bell Aerospace definition of \"managerial employees. \" As the Court explained: *49 **403 The controlling consideration in this case is that the faculty of Yeshiv a University exercise authority which in any other context unquestionably would be managerial. Their authority in academic matters is absolute. They decide what courses will be offered, when they will be scheduled, and to whom they will be taught. They deb ate and determine teaching methods, grading policies, and matriculation standards. They effectively decide which students will be admitted, retained, and graduated. On occasion their views have determined the size of the student body, the tuition to be cha rged, and the location of a school. Page 8 457 F.3d 42, 180 L.R.R.M.

Id. at 686, 100 S.Ct. 856. This is the heart of the Court's decision in Yeshiva. The faculty's \" authority \" in the \"academic matters \" mentioned -the Yeshiva factors -has become the template for Board analysis of whether faculty are managerial employees. Specif i- cally, the Board must consider the degree of facul ty control over academic matters such as curriculum, course schedules, teaching methods, grading policies, matriculation standards, admission standards, size of the student body, tuition to be charged, and location of the school. See, e.g., Duquesne Univ., 261 N.L.R.B. 587, 589 (1982) ; Loretto Heights College, 264 N.L.R.B. 1107, 1119 (1982) . Like Point Park University, LeMoyne -Owen College sought review of a Board decision that its faculty were not managerial employees and were thus entitled under the Act to organize a union. See LeMoyne -Owen, 357 F.3d at 61. The College had argued to the Regional Director and the Board that its faculty were indistinguishable from faculty the Board had held to be managerial employees in previous cases. In ruling against the College, neither the R e- gional Director nor the Board discussed these prece- dents. [5] We found such silence insufficient and r e- manded the case for the Board to provide a more fu l- some explanation of its decision. Although an \" agency is by no means required to distinguish every precedent cited to it by an aggrieved party, \" id. at 60, we held that where \" a party makes a significant showing tha t analogous cases have been decided differently, the agency must do more than simply ignore that arg u- ment, \" id. at 61. We then stressed the need for a clear explanation by the Board when applying Yeshiva 's multi -factor test: The 'open -ended rough -and-tumble of factors' Yeshiva launched the Board and higher educa- tion can lead to predictability and intelligibility only to the extent the Board explains, in applying the test to varied fact situations, which factors are significant and which less so, and why.... In the absence of an explanation, the 'totality of the circumstances' can become simply a cl oak for agency whim -or worse.... [The Board] may have an adequate explanation for the result it reached [but] we cannot ... assume that such an explanation exists until we see it. Id. (citation omitted and emphasis added). That is where we find fault with the Board's analysis here. B. [6][7] [8] Becaus e Congress has delegated to the Board responsibility for determining the appropriate bargaining unit, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(b) , we \"accord deference to the Board's exercise of its authority. \" LeMoyne -Owen, 357 F.3d at 60. We cannot be def- erential, however, where the Board fails to adequately explain its reasoning. Id. at 61. The Supreme Court has held that when the \"Board so exercises the di s- cretion given to it by Congress, it must 'disclose the basis of its order ' and 'give **404 *50 clear indication that it has exercised the discretion with which Co n- gress has empowered it. ' \" NLRB v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 380 U.S. 438, 443, 85 S.Ct. 1061, 13 L.Ed.2d 951 (1965) (citation omitted). We are , however, \" indul- gent toward administrative action to the extent of affirming an order where the agency's path can be 'discerned ' even if the opinion ' leaves much to be desired. ' \" WAIT Radio v. FCC, 418 F.2d 1153, 1156 (D.C.Cir.1969) (citation omitted); see also NTSB, 439 F.3d 715, 717 (D.C.Cir.2006) . Without a clear presentation of the Board's reasoning, it is not possibl e for us to perform our assigned reviewing function and to discern the path taken by the Board in reaching its decision. See Metro. Life Ins. Co., 380 U.S. at 443, 85 S.Ct. 1061 . [9] Nor can our Court fill in critical gaps in the Board's reasoning. We can only look to the Board's stated rationale. We cannot sustain its action on some other basis the Board did not mention. See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196- 97, 200, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (\"It will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency's action; nor can a court be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive. \") This is not a new concern, but it is central to our performance of the l imited role Congress has assigned us in reviewing agency action. See id.; SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94- 95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) ; Village of Winnetka, Ill. v. FERC, 678 F.2d 354, 357 (D.C.Cir.1982) . Here, both the Board and the Regional Director failed to do what Yeshiva and LeMoyne -Owen man- date: explain \"which factors are significant and which less so, and why \" in their determination that the fa c- ulty at Point Park were not \"managerial employees. \" Page 9 457 F.3d 42, 180 L.R.R.M.

See LeMoyne -Owen, 357 F.3d at 61. Volume alone is insufficient. The Regional Director, whose findings and conclusions regarding the role of Point Park's full-time faculty the B oard adopted with only limited discussion and no stated analysis, produced a 108-page decision with 59 pages of factual findings, and 16 pages of legal analysis that identified and relied upon a host of factors. Some findings suggest that the faculty are m anagerial employees, while others su g- gest they are not. In analyzing these findings, the Regional Director mentioned some of the academic factors relied upon by the Supreme Court in its ma n- agerial analysis in Yeshiva, including: (1) control over curriculum and course schedules; (2) control over teaching methods; (3) control over grading policies; and (4) cont rol over which students will be admitted, retained, and graduated. In addition, the Regional Director referred to various non -academic factors that the Supreme Court listed in Yeshiva but which the Supreme Court described as \"features of faculty au- thority \" upon which it did not need to \" rely primarily, \" 444 U.S. at 686 n. 23, 100 S.Ct. 856: (1) control over hiring; (2) control over tenure; (3) control over sa b- baticals; (4) control over terminations; and (5) control over promotions. Finally, the Regional Director touched upon several factors relied upo n in previous Board decisions: (1) control over salary and benefits; (2) statements made by the Administration; and (3) the size of the University's administrative component. Yet nowhere in his lengthy decision did the R e- gional Director state, as we held in LeMoyne -Owen that he must, which factors were \"significant and which less so, and why. \" 357 F.3d at 61. While the Regional Director stated many of the Yeshiva factors, he failed to explain which factors he primarily relied upon and his reasoning for doing so. Faced with this **405 *51 \"open -ended rough- and-tumble of factors, \" we cannot assume that the Regional Director had an \"adequate explanation for th e result [he] reached ... until we see it. \" Id. The closest the Regional Director came to providing such an explanation was his statement that Point Park' s \"faculty ... undoubtedly has an important consultative role, but based on the record developed, it cannot be concluded that they exercise such plenary, absolute or effective authority or control to warrant their exclusion from the protection of the Act a s managerial employees. \" This passing observ a- tion, stated in the form of a conclusion, does not su b- stitute for the fact- specific analysis called for by Ye- shiva and LeMoyne -Owen. The Board knows how to perform such an analysis, see Duquesne University, 261 N.L.R.B. at 589 (\"In sum, it is evident from the record that the managerial auth ority possessed by the Duquesne law school faculty is nearly identical to that possessed by the faculty in Yeshiva in such c ritical academic matters as curriculum, grading systems, and admission and matriculation standards. \"), but ce r- tainly did not do so here. Had the Regional Director, or the Board, stated with clarity which factors were significant to the outcome and why, we could have performed our r e- view. Distinguishing between excluded managers and included professional employees is a fact -intensive inquiry that presents special challenges in the unique and often decentralized world of academia. Yeshiva identified the relevant factors that the Board must consider. See 444 U.S. at 691, 100 S.Ct. 856. LeMoyne -Owen held that the Board must clearly ex- plain its analysis. See 357 F.3d at 61. The failure to provide such an explanation is grounds for remand to the Board, see id., which we do here. C. One remaining issue requires our attention. In October 2003, Point Park served a subpoena on the faculty seeking a variety of books and records. One month later, in advance of th e Regional Director's hearing, the Union responded on behalf of the faculty providing some, but not all, of the materials sought. The Union represented that it would make further determinations whether it possessed additional r e- sponsive materials. The Regi onal Director announced his decision in April 2004. In August and September 2004, the Union, responding to an unrelated request, produced documents, sought by the October 2003 subpoena, that had not previously been produced. On September 13, 2004, as part of its answer to the Board's complaint, Point Park asserted that the Board should reopen the hearings before the Regional D i- rector to take additional evidence and supplement the record in light of this timely sought but late -produced material. Point Park r epeated this request in its N o- vember 27, 2004, response to the motion for summary judgment. On February 17, 2005, the Board denied Point Park's request, holding that Point Park failed to \"act with reasonable diligence \" by not (1) seeking to e n- force its su bpoena when the Union responded with a partial production and (2) moving to immediately reopen the hearing when it received the belated pr o- Page 10 457 F.3d 42, 180 L.R.R.M.

NLRB, 347 F.3d 955, 961 (D.C.Cir.2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We \" may not find substantial evidence 'merely on the basis of evidence which in and of itself justified [the agency's decision], without taking into ac count contradictory evidence or ev i- dence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn.

The Board's findings are not \"supported by su b- stantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. \" See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f) . The Board, in concluding that \"a reasonably diligent party would have sought e n- forcement, \" did not address that the Union had, in fact, already informed Point Park that after it had made its initial production in response to the October 2003 subpoena, it would make a continuing determination whether it possessed any additional documents r e- sponsive to the subpoena. In addition, t he Board, in concluding that Point Park had \" waited over 2 months ... to seek to reopen the record, \" ignored Point Park's September 13, 2004 request to do so. The Board does not explain why this request, made within weeks of the Union's belated production of the new evidence, does not constitute a timely request to reopen the record. Because the Board's decision did not \"tak[e] into account contradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn, \" Uni- versal Camera Corp., 340 U.S. at 487, 71 S.Ct. 456, its findings ar e not supported by substantial evidence.

Yeshiva University , 444 U.S. 672 (1980). In his original decision and direction of election, the Regional Director found that the faculty members were not managerial employees, and, after an election, the Petitioner was certified as the ircollective - bargaining representative .The underlying issue ultimately was presented to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which found that the Board had \"failed to adequately explain why the faculty's role at the University is not manager ial.\" PointPark University v. NLRB, 457 F.3d 42, 44 ( D.C. Cir. 2006). The c ourt instructed the Board to identify which of the relevant factors set forth in Yeshiva University , supra, are significant and which less so in its determination that the Employer's faculty are not managerial employees and to explain why the factors are so weighted . Following the court's remand, the Regional Director issued a Supplemental Decision onRemand. The Employer sought review of that decision, which the Board granted on November 28, 2007. To aid the Board in properly addressing the c ourt's remand, the Board invites the parties and amici to file briefs that address the court's instruction that the Board explain the weight of the various factors identified by the Supreme Court in Yeshiva and their application to this 2case.1 Specifically, the briefs should address some or all of the following questions : (1) Which of the factors identified in Yeshiva and the relevant cases decided by the Board since Yeshiva are most sig nificant in making a finding of ma nagerial status for university faculty members and why? (2) In the areas identified as \"significant,\" what evidence should be required to establish that faculty make or \"effectively control\" decision s? (3)Are the factors identified in the Board case law to date sufficient to correctly determine wh ether faculty are managerial ? (4) If the factors are not sufficient , what additional factors would aid the Board in making a determination of managerial status for faculty? (5) Is the Board's applic ation of the Yeshiva factors to faculty consisten twith its determination of the managerial status of other categories of employees and, if not, (a) may the Board adopt a distinct approach for such determinations in an academi c context or (b) can the Board more closely align its determinations in an academic context with its determinations in non -academic contexts in a manner that remains consistent with the decision in Yeshiva? (6)Do the factors employed by the Board in determining the status of university faculty members properly distinguish between indicia of managerial status and indicia of professional status under the Act? (7) Have there been developments in models of decision making in private universities since th e 1 On December 12 , 2007, the Employer filed a brief on r eview of the Regional Director's Supplemental Decision on Remand. The Peti tioner did not file a brief on r eview. Given the amount of time that has passed since the r equest f or review was granted and the absence of a Brief on Review from the Pe titioner, the Board has decided to solicit additional briefing. We acknowledge, as our dissenting colleagues point out, that this case has suffered from considerable delay already. However, given the nature of the D.C. Circuit's remand of the case, we believe that allowing a short period of time for additional briefing will aid the Board in deciding the important issues at stake.3issuance of Yeshiva that are relevant to the factors the Board should consider in making a determination of faculty managerial status? If so, what are those developments and how should they influence the Board's analysis? (8) As suggested in footnote 31 of the Yeshiva decision, are there useful distinctions to be drawn between and among different job classifications within a faculty --such as between professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and lecturers or between tenured and untenured f aculty--depending on the faculty's structure and practices ? In answering these questions, the parties and amici are invited to submit empirical and other evidence. Briefs not exceeding 50 pages in length shall be filed with the Board in Washington, D.C. on or before July 6, 2012. The parties may file responsive briefs on or before July 20, 2012, which shall not exceed 25 pages in length. No other responsive briefs will be accepted.

After the Board granted reviewin November 2007 , the Petitioner did not avail itself of its opportunity to file a brief . Further, no additional organizations have asked to participate as amici during the lengthy pendency of this case despite the publicity surrounding it .2 Under these circumstances, we find it unwise to further delay the processing of this case to solicit additional briefing.

BRIEF OF PETITIONER, NEWSPAPER GUILD OF PITTSBURGH COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA, LOCAL 38061 AFL- CIO AND AFL- CIO JULY 6, 2012 1 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BEFORE THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD POINT PARK UNIVERSITY, Employer, and 6-RC-12276 NEWSPAPER GUILD OF PITTSBURGH, COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA, LOCAL 38061, AFL-CIO, Petitioner. BRIEF ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER NEWSPAPER GUILD OF PITTSBURGH, CWA, AFL-CIO, AND THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS AS AMICUS CURIAE The petitioner Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, CWA, AFL-CIO, and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Indus trial Organizations, as amicus curiae, submit this joint brief in response to the National Labor Relations Board's invitation to address the correct applicati on of the Supreme Court's decision in NLRB v. Yeshiva University , 444 U.S. 672 (1980). After nine years of litigation, encompassing 20 da ys of hearings spanning three months, two Regional Director reports running to some 171 pages between them and a trip to the D.C. Circuit, the Board is n o closer to determining whether the full-time faculty of Point Park University are \"managerial employees\" under Yeshiva than it was when the hearings closed in early 2004 . 2 The President of the University and the faculty me mbers were not confused about the \"managerial\" status of the Point Park pro fessors. The President informed faculty members that she was under no obligation to follow or implement their suggestions with regard to academic policy. She re sponded to the professors' protests over this approach by bluntly stating, \"Th is is not a democracy.\" DDE 30. 1 The President instructed the faculty's one repres entative to the University's Board of Trustees - who had no voting power - that he attended Board meetings as an employee and was not to speak unless spoken to. DDE 6 n. 17. And, when the faculty representative protested unilateral changes by the President to previously agreed-upon academic policies at a meeting of the D eans Council to which he had been invited, the faculty representative was told n ot to attend future meetings. Tr. 3814-15. The professors understood that they had b een marginalized in many respects, most especially with regard to influencin g University academic policy. See DDE 30. This was no doubt one of the reasons that the faculty voted by a greater than three-to-one margin - 49 to 14 - in fa vor of union representation. The sum and substance of the matter is that all th e days of hearing and pages of analysis have not allowed the Board to determine conclusively what was plain to 1 \"DDE\" refers to the Regional Director's Decision a nd Direction of Election (April 27, 2004).

The proceedings in this case thu s amply demonstrate how \"[t]he open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors on wh ich Yeshiva launched the Board and higher education,\" Lemoyne-Owen College v. NLRB 357 F.3d 55, 61 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (citation and quotation marks omit ted), has caused the Board - and consequently the reviewing courts - to miss the forest for the trees. The Board should use this case for a considered reappraisal o f the role of the so-called \"Yeshiva factors\" in determining the \"managerial\" status of college professors under the National Labor Relations Act. 1. THE \" YESHIVA FACTORS\" DO NOT CONSTITUTE A LEGAL TEST FOR DETERMINING WHETHER PROFESSORS ARE EXEMPT \"MANAGERIAL\" EMPLOYEES. The \" Yeshiva factors\" are nothing more than the concrete set of circumstances identified by the Supreme Court to su pport its conclusion \"that the faculty of Yeshiva University exercise authority wh ich in any other context unquestionably would be managerial.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 686. Before the Supreme Court's Yeshiva decision, the Board did not attempt to analyze wha t sort of faculty authority might be \"managerial\" in natur e, because, in the Board's view, the fact that, \"[i]n carrying out the[ir] duties an d responsibilities, the faculty acts as a group, on the basis of collective discussion and consensus\" precluded treating the faculty as \"managerial\" employees. C.W. Post Center , 189 NLRB 904, 905 4 (1971). The Supreme Court rejected that per se rule in Yeshiva . 444 U.S. at 678. Following the Supreme Court's Yeshiva decision, the Board did not undertake its own analysis of what type of authorit y would make college professors \"managerial\" employees. Rather, the Boa rd simply treated the circumstances cited by the Court in Yeshiva as \"the criteria for collegial governance\" that would cause \"faculty to be 'manage rial.'\" Bradford College , 261 NLRB 565, 566 (1982). On that approach, whether a college's faculty members would be categorized as \"managerial\" depended on th eir authority \"to make[] decisions and effective recommendations . . . in th e critical areas relied upon by the Supreme Court in Yeshiva University .\" Thiel College , 261 NLRB 580, 586 (1982). See, e.g., id. at 583-85 (considering the faculty's authority in each area). The Yeshiva opinion was intended to provide \"a starting point only\" and states that \"other factors . . . may enter into the analysis.\" 444 U.S. at 691 n. 31. As the instant case demonstrates, marching through the \" Yeshiva factors\" in a mechanical fashion to determine how the authority o f a particular college faculty matches up point-by-point with the authority exerci sed by the Yeshiva faculty has not served the Board - or the college administratio ns and professors - well. Nothing in the Yeshiva opinion suggests that the Board is required to add ress the \"managerial\" status of college professors in this m anner. To the contrary, the holding of Yeshiva is that the \"managerial\" status of college faculty members must 5 be determined on the same basis as is applied in ot her contexts. See 466 U.S. at 686 (\"The controlling consideration in this case is that the faculty of Yeshiva University exercise authority which in any other co ntext unquestionably would be managerial.\"). That is, the \" Yeshiva factors\" represent an application of the Board's more general analytical approach to determi ning managerial status in the concrete circumstances presented by the Yeshiva case, not a separate test unto itself. 2 Moreover, nothing in the circuit court decisions f ollowing Yeshiva , including the decisions of the D.C. Circuit in LeMoyne-Owen College and in this case, requires the Board to determine the \"managerial\" st atus of a college faculty through a point-by-point comparison with the factor s treated as significant by the courts in Yeshiva . To the contrary, the import of the D.C. Circuit decisions is that 2 In endorsing the traditional approach to determin ing managerial status in the university context, the Court expressly recogni zed that \"[t]here . . . may be institutions of higher learning unlike Yeshiva wher e the faculty are entirely or predominantly nonmanagerial.\" Id. at 690-91 n.31. In fact, in the three decades since Yeshiva , the trend has been \"that the faculty role in univ ersity governance is decreasing\" as \"[t]he pressures for efficiency and the achievement of performance goals are encouraging college and university presid ents to focus more on the management of their institutions and less on the mo re collegial processes of academic decision making.\" William L. Waugh Jr., \" Issues in University Governance: More 'Professional' and Less Academic,\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 84 (January 2003). A recent study of federal data supports this conclusion, confirming t hat colleges have added managers and support personnel at a rate that \"far outpac[es] the growth in student enrollment and instructors.\" Jeffrey Brainard, Pau l Fain & Kathryn Masterson, \"Support-Staff Jobs Double in 20 Years, Outpacing E nrollment,\" The Chronicle of Higher Education (April 24, 2009). 6 the Board needs to explain what is \"'significant . . . and why,'\" Point Park University v. NLRB , 457 F.3d 42, 50 (D.C. Cir. 2006), quoting LeMoyne-Owen College , 357 F.3d at 61, in deciding whether particular fa culty members are or are not \"managerial\" employees. If the Board is going to continue to test the \"man agerial\" status of college professors by comparing them to the Yeshiva faculty on the basis of the particular factors listed in the Yeshiva decisions, the D.C. Circuit requires the Board to do what the Regional Director did so ably in his Suppl emental Decision on Remand, i.e. , group the points of comparison hierarchically int cannot impro ve upon the Regional Director's detailed application of this multifactor approach and explanation of which Yeshiva factors were significant and why. We submit, however, that the Board is not bound to continue that approach and is free to take a more analytical approach to a pplying the Supreme Court's Yeshiva decision by undertaking a thorough reconsideration of the question of what authority would make college professors \"managerial \" employees. This reconsideration should begin with the statutory lan guage and the Supreme Court's articulation of the \"managerial\" employee exception . Against that background, the Board should rethink its approach to determining th e \"managerial\" status of 7 college faculty members based on the legal analysis underlying the Yeshiva decision, rather than the particular factual circum stances of that case. 2. THE NLRA'S BROAD STATUTORY DEFINITION OF COVERED \"EMPLOYEES\" EXPRESSLY ENCOMPASSES \"PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES,\" SUCH AS PROFESSORS. The proper starting point is the statutory language . The National Labor Relations Act has two definitions clearly indicatin g that employees performing the work typical of college professors are intended to be covered by the Act. NLRA \u00a7 2(3) provides generally that \"[t]he o f \u00a7 definition the Act squarely applies to 'any employee .'\" Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB , 467 U.S. 883, 891 (1984). The Supreme Court has observ ed that a \"broad, literal interpretation of the word 'employee' is consistent with several of the Act's purposes, such as protecting the right of employees to organize for mutual aid without employer interference and encouraging and p rotecting the collective- bargaining process.\" NLRB v. Town & Country Electric, Inc. , 516 U.S. 85, 91 (1995) (quotation marks and citations omitted). What is more, the Act specifically defines a categ ory of \"professional employee\" and grants those \"professional employees\" the right to vote on whether they will be separately represented from nonprofess ionals in collective bargaining. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(b)(1). Among the employees include d in the category 8 \"professional employees\" are those \"engaged in work [] predominantly intellectual and varied in character . . . involving the consist ent exercise of discretion and judgment . . . [and] learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study in a n institution of higher learning.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(12). Given that statutory definiti on, it is hardly surprising that \"faculty members employed at institutions of higher learning have long been considered 'professional employees' protected by th e Act.\" David Wolcott Kendall Mem. School of Design v. NLRB , 866 F.2d 157, 160 (6th Cir. 1989). While the NLRA defines the term \"employee\" broadly , \"the Act's definition also contains a list of exceptions.\" Town & Country Electric , 516 U.S. at 90. Significantly, none of the express statutory except ions apply to the Park Point faculty. As a general matter, the Supreme Court has caution ed \"that administrators and reviewing courts must take care to assure that exemptions from NLRA coverage are not so expansively interpreted as to d eny protection to workers the Act was designed to reach.\" Holly Farms Corp. v. NLRB , 517 U.S. 392, 399 (1996). This warning applies a fortiori to the application of implied exemptions, such as the one created for \"managerial\" employees. \"Because managerial employees are not excluded from coverage under the NLRA by any express language, but rather by an implied exception to the statute, the exception must be 9 narrowly construed to avoid conflict with the broad language of the Act, which covers 'any employee,' including professional emplo yees.\" David Wolcott Kendall Mem. School , 866 F.2d at 160 (citation omitted). 3. THE IMPLIED \"MANAGERIAL\" EXEMPTION APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE SO MUCH MORE CLEARLY \"MANAGERIAL\" THAN THE EXPRESSLY EXEMPT \"SUPERVISORS\" THAT NLRA COVERAGE WOULD BE INCONCEIVABLE. The NLRA, as enacted in 1935, \"did not expressly me ntion the term 'managerial employee.' After the Act's passage, ho wever, the Board developed the concept of 'managerial employee' in a series of cases involving the appropriateness of bargaining units.\" NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co. , 416 U.S. 267, 275 (1974). The early Board cases \"established tha t 'managerial employees' were not to be included in a unit with rank-and-file emp loyees\" but left unclear whether \"all 'managerial employees' [are] entirely outside the protection of the Act, as well as inappropriate for inclusion in a rank-and-file b argaining unit.\" Id . at 275-276. In Bell 'managerial empl oyees' . . . are excluded from the protections of the Act. \" 416 U.S. at 274. The Court found the exclusion of \"managerial employees\" to be implicit in the express exclusion of \"supervisors\" that Congress enacted in 1947 to overrule the Supreme Court's holding in Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB , 330 U.S. 485 (1947), that the NLRA covers foremen. 416 U.S. at 277-284. In this regard, the Bell Aerospace 10 Court expressly relied upon \"the portion of Mr. Jus tice Douglas' Packard dissent relating to the organization of executives,\" id ., at 284, which the Court understood to have been ratified by the 1947 Congress. See id . at 278-279 (setting out the relevant portion of Justice Douglas' dissent). The basic point of Justice Douglas's Packard dissent was that \"if foremen are 'employees' within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act, so are vice-presidents, managers, assistant managers, supe rintendents, assistant superintendents\" and that \"once vice-presidents, ma nagers, superintendents, foremen all are unionized, management and labor wil l become more of a solid phalanx than separate factions in warring camps.\" Bell Aerospace , 416 U.S. at 278, quoting Packard , 330 U.S. at 494 (Douglas, J., dissenting). In Ju stice Douglas' view, this would \"obliterate the line betw een management and labor\" in labor relations with the result that \"the basic opp osing forces in industry [would be] not management and labor but the operating grou p on the one hand and the stockholder and bondholder group on the other.\" Ibid . Against that background, the Bell Aerospace Court understood the 1947 amendment excluding \"supervisors\" as \"intended to e xclude from the protection of the Act those who comprised a part of 'management' or were allied with it on the theory that they were the one[s] from whom the work ers needed protection.\" Id . Bell Aerospace , 416 U.S. at 288-289 n. 16, quoting Retail Clerks v. NLRB , 366 11 F.2d 642, 644-645 (D.C. Cir. 1967). The Court reas oned that the 1947 amendments did not include an express exception for nonsupervisory \"managerial employees,\" because \"Congress recognized there were other persons so much more clearly 'managerial' that it was inconceivable that the Board would treat them as employees.\" Bell Aerospace , 416 U.S. at 284. Consistent with Bell Aerospace 's reading of the 1947 amendments, the Board has held that \"managerial status . . . is res erved for those in executive-type positions, those who are closely aligned with manag ement as true representatives.\" General Dynamics Corp. , 213 NLRB 851, 857 (1974). Of particular pertinen ce here, the Board has specified that \"managerial auth ority is not vested in professional employees merely by virtue of their pr ofessional status, or because work performed in that status may have a bearing on company direction.\" Id . at 857-78. Rather, the status of \"managerial\" employe e is reserved to \"true representatives of management in the traditional se nse,\" id. at 858, i.e. , \"faculty . . in activities far beyond the core professi onal activities of a typical faculty,\" Point Park , 457 F.3d at 48. 4. PROFESSORS ARE EXEMPT \"MANAGERIAL\" EMPLOYEES ONLY IF THEY EXERCISE NEARLY ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY IN DETERMINING THEIR EMPLOYER'S ACADEMIC PROGRAM. In Yeshiva , \"[t]he . authority which in any other context un questionably would be 12 managerial.\" 444 U.S. at 686. In this regard, the Court emphasized that the faculty's \"authority in academic matters is absolut e,\" so that, \"[t]o the extent the industrial analogy applies, the faculty determines . . . the product produced, the terms upon which it will offered, and the customers who will be served.\" Ibid . The authority of the Yeshiva faculty derived from t he fact that the University \"depend[ed] on the professional judgment of its fac ulty to formulate and apply crucial policies constrained only by necessarily ge neral institutional goals,\" because their \"professional expertise [wa]s indispe nsable to the formulation and implementation of academic policy.\" Id . at 689. The Tenth Circuit accurately described the pertine nt aspect of the relationship between Yeshiva's faculty members and the college administration: \"[T]he administrative staff at Yeshiva was fairly s mall, at least in relation to the university's overall size, and there was no eff ective buffer between the faculty and top management. The university was, in effect, compelled to rely upon the faculty for advice, recommendations, establishment of policies, and implementation of policies. As a res ult, the Yeshiva faculty was by necessity aligned with management.\" Loretto Heights College v. NLRB , 742 F.2d 1245, 1254 (10th Cir. 1984) (citations a nd quotation marks omitted). As a direct result of its almost total reliance on the expertise of the faculty when it 13 came to framing academic policy - such as the schoo l's \"curriculum, grading system, admission and matriculation standards, acad and course schedules\" - the administration of Yeshiva Universi ty was essentially the \"executive arm of the faculty.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 676 & n. 4 (quotation marks omitted). At the same time that it explained what made the f aculty \"managerial\" employees, the Yeshiva Court also emphasized: \"We certainly are not suggesting an application of the managerial exclusion that would sweep all professionals outsid e the Act in derogation of Congress' expressed intent to protect them. * * * O nly if an employee's activities fall outside the scope of the duties rou tinely performed by similarly situated professionals will he be found aligned wit h management.\" Id . at 690. Elaborating on this caution, the Court explained, \" It is plain, for example, that professors may not be excluded merely because they determine the content of their own courses, evaluate their own students, and super vise their own research.\" Id . at 690 n. 31. And, with regard to framing the col lege's academic policies, the Court explained that a merely \"advisory role\" was \" not managerial.\" Id . at 683. Under Yeshiva , the central inquiry in determining whether colleg e professors are exempt \"managerial\" employees is whether the pr ofessors' \"authority in 14 academic matters is absolute,\" 444 U.S. at 686, so that the college administration functions essentially as the \"executive arm of the faculty,\" id . at 676 n. 4 (quotation marks omitted). Professors will natural ly influence their college's academic policy simply by engaging in their ordinar y teaching duties (which includes determining not only the content of the co urses they are assigned to teach but which courses in their field will be offered) a nd making known to the college administration their views on related academic matt ers. But Yeshiva makes clear that influence of this sort does not make the profe ssors \"managerial\" employees. Rather, the faculty members must either have direct control over academic policy or their recommendations with regar d to academic policy must be so routinely followed by the administration that th ey are effectively in control. That being so, a particularly important aspect of determining whether the professors at a particular college are \"managerial\" employees is the relative size and nature of the college administration. If \"the administration is fairly large in relation to the size of the College\" and \"possess[e s] the professional expertise [that is] indispensable to the formulation and implementa tion of academic policy[,] [t]he availability of this expertise within the ranks of the administration obviates the College's need to rely extensively on the professio nal judgment of its faculty in determining and implementing academic policy.\" Loretto Heights College , 742 F.2d at 1254 (quotation marks omitted). Inclusion of academic personnel, such as 15 deans and department chairs, in a college administr ation indicates that the faculty does not control academic policy, because the point of including academics in the administration is to give it independent capacity t o determine academic policy. If a college \"has an effective buffer between the facult y and top management in the form of [personnel who] perform administrative duti es and are part of the administration,\" while \"possess[ing] the profession al expertise that [is] indispensable to formulation and implementation of academic policy,\" then the nonadministrative teaching faculty are not \"managerial\" employees. St. Thomas University , 298 NLRB 280, 287 (1990). Equally important is the extent to which the colle ge administration acts independently of the faculty in formulating academi c policy. To the extent that the administration formulates academic policy without f aculty advice - or, even more tellingly, contrary to faculty advice - the adminis tration's actions conclusively demonstrate that the faculty members' role in formu lating academic policy is at most \"merely advisory and thus not managerial.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 683. Even where the administration's formulation of academic policy is always in accordance with faculty advice, it must be shown that the admi nistration is carrying out the faculty's directions - and not simply seeking the f aculty's advice - for that circumstance to establish that professors are \"mana gerial\" employees. Finally, the Board must remain cognizant of the Su preme Court's 16 admonition that \" [o]nly if an employee's activities fall outside the scope of the duties routinely performed by similarly situated pr ofessionals will he be found aligned with management.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 690 (emphasis added). As the Court explained, this means \"that professors may no t be excluded merely because they determine the content of their own courses, ev aluate their own students, and supervise their own research.\" Id . at 690 n. 31. It is pertinent in this regard, th at professors determine the content of their courses n ot only by formulating the specific contents of their assigned courses but als o by participating more generally in the determination of what other courses in their field will be offered by their department. 5. THE PROFESSORS AT POINT PARK DO NOT EXERCISE SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY OVER ACADEMIC POLICY TO BE EXEMPT \"MANAGERIAL\" EMPLOYEES. Under the legal analysis articulated by the Court i n Yeshiva , the Point Park faculty members clearly do not come within the impl ied \"managerial\" exemption from the NLRA's broad statutory definition of cover ed \"employees.\" In 2002, Point Park was substantially restructured as part of the school's transition from a college to a university, so that its six academic departments were folded into four newly created schools, each of whi ch was headed by a Dean appointed by the University President or someone in her administration. DDE 30- 32, 59-61. Notably, faculty members were not invol ved in the decision to change 17 the structure of the school nor were they involved in Point Park's application for university status. DDE 9. The four Deans sit on a Deans Council along with th e Vice President for Academic Affairs and two directors. DDE 4. The Ch airs of each Department within a particular school - who are stipulated to be part of President Henderson's management team and thus were not included in the u nit of teaching faculty that voted on union representation - report to the parti cular Dean for their school. DDE 4. 3 As a result of the restructuring, an extensive aca demic managerial staff encompassing at least 20 administrators - including the President, the Vice President of Academic Affairs, the Associate Vice P resident of Academic Affairs, the Deans, the Department Chairs and various Direct ors - runs the academic program of the University. The existence of such a n extensive academic administration - including persons, such as the Dea ns and Department Chairs, who are directly involved in the University's day-to-da y academic life - reduces the dependence of the college administration upon the t eaching faculty in setting academic policy. 3 In its Request for Review, p. 12 n. 7, the Univer sity asserts that the \"Department Chairs are members of the faculty.\" Th at the Chairs may be both part of the faculty and part of the University managemen t, as the parties have stipulated, merely demonstrates \"that a rational li ne could be drawn between . . . faculty members, depending upon how a faculty is st ructured and operates.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 691 n. 31. 18 As the Regional Director explained: \"[Faculty] input on academic matters became more di luted as the Administration added even more administrators to it s substantial administrative staff. After restructuring the inst itution, the Administration had not one, but two buffers between it and the fac ulty. The department chairs and all but one program director were one bu ffer and the newly- created deans comprised a second buffer.\" DDE 10. The ratio of academic administrator to full-time te aching faculty was 1 to 4. Supp. Dec. 10 n. 11. What is more, the hierarchy of authority clearly i ndicates that the teaching faculty are not \"managerial\" employees. The teach ing faculty report to their respective Department Chairs, who report to their r espective Deans, who report to the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs, who reports to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, who reports to the President. DDE 4. Within this chain of command, the teaching faculty can hardly b e characterized as \"so much more clearly 'managerial' [than the academic admini strators to whom they report] it [would be] inconceivable that the Board wou ld treat them as employees.\" Bell Aerospace , 416 U.S. at 284. The administration of Point Park University not on ly has the capacity to formulate academic policy independently of the facu lty but has frequently acted 19 independently in formulating academic policy. For example, the University administration unilaterally implemented academic pr ograms in Sports and Arts and Entertainment, and created the Innocence Institute. DDE 14-17. It unilaterally refused to implement academic programs approved by the faculty, including faculty-suggested programs in construction manageme nt, vocal performance and counseling. DDE 15. The administration also unila terally altered existing academic programs without faculty consultation - or , in some cases, over faculty objection - such as the Government and Internationa l Studies Department, the International Masters of Business Administration pr ogram, and the English as a Second Language program. DDE 17-18, 24-25. And, t he administration unilaterally altered degree requirements by adding a required freshman seminar, changing the requirements for an education degree, and unilaterally redesigning the honors program. DDE 19-21. Moreover, unlike the case in Yeshiva , Point Park's administration's authority extends to many of the core professional activities typically exercised by faculty, such as course content and student evaluations. Fo r example, the university administration unilaterally developed and implement ed policies on online course offerings and independent studies, DDE 21-22, decre ed the use of a plus/minus grading system despite faculty opposition, DDE 26-2 7, changed individual student grades without following established procedures for faculty participation, DDE 27, 20 denied bonuses to professors who issued what the ad ministration considered too many A's, DDE 59, and imposed syllabi requirements, DDE 59. The fact that the University administration has ac ted independently of the faculty in determining so many aspects of academic policy - as well as unilaterally determining many core faculty professional matters - conclusively demonstrates that the faculty's \"authority in academic matters i s [ not ] absolute.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 686. Rather, \"the role of the faculty is m erely advisory and thus not managerial.\" Id . at 683.

AMICUS BRIEF OF NATIONAL EDUACATION ASSOCIATION (UNDATED) UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BEFORE THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD POINT PARK UNIVERSITY , Employer , and NEWSPAPER GUILD OF PITTSBURGH/COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA, LOCAL 38061, AFL BRIEF OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION ____________________________________________________ Alice O'Brien Philip A. Hostak Kristen Hollar National Education Association 1201 16th Street NW, Suite 820 Washington, DC 20036 Tel. (202) 822- 7035 Fax: (202) 822- 7033 Attorneys for Amic us National Education Association 1 The National Education Association (\"NEA\") submits this brief in response to the Notice and Invitation to File Briefs issued by the National Labor Relations Board (\"Board\") inviting interested amic i to file briefs addressing issues raised by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's remand order in Point Park Univ. v. NLRB , 457 F.3d 42 (D.C. Cir. 2006) . That order instru cts that the Board \"explain the weight of the various factors identified by the Supreme Court\" in NLRB v. Yeshiva University, 444 U.S. 672 (1980) , and, more specifically, \"explain 'which factors are significant and which less so, and why' in determin[ing] that the faculty at Point Park were not 'managerial employees.'\" Point Park , 457 F.3d at 49, 50 (citation omitted). STATEMENT OF INTEREST OF AMICUS NEA is a national labor organization representing more than three million education employees , many of whom are employed in colleges and universities. NEA is strongly committed to preserving the collective bargaining rights of education employees in both public and private school systems \u2014including employees of private colleges and universities. Accordingly , amicus NEA strongly believes that the judicially created managerial exception to the coverage of the National Labor Relations Act ( \"NLRA\" or the \"Act\"), as applied to university faculty in Yeshiva , must be analyzed judiciously so as to keep faith with the Supreme Court's teaching in Yeshiva while at the same time ensur ing that the managerial exception is not given such overly broad application as to deny protection to workers that the Act was intended to cover. STATEMENT OF FACTS Point Park University is a private liberal arts university in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania with about 3,200 students and a full -time faculty of 80 instructors, assistant processors, associate professors, and professors . Point Park Univ., Case No. 6 -RC-12276, Regional Director's Decis ion and Direction of Election at 5, 7, 15 (N.L.R.B. Region 6, April 27, 2004) (hereinafter 2 \"Dec. & Dir. of Election \"). The institution was originally founde d in 1960 as Point Park College . As explained in more detail below, the college 's administration \u2014without faculty approval or input \u2014substantially restructured the institution in 2002 in order to effectuate the administration's plan to transform the institution into a university. The administration, then successfully applied for a charter to operate as a university the following year . Dec. & Dir. of Election at 7-8; Point Park Univ., Case No. 6 -RC-12276, Regional Director's Supplemental Decision on Remand at 5, 7, 15 (N.L.R.B. Region 6, July 10, 2007) (hereinafter \" Supp. Dec. \"). 1. The Institution's Governance and Operation s A. Govern ance Point Park's Board of Trustees is vested with ultimate authority to govern and manage the university. Dec. & Dir. of Election at 10. The Board of Trustees consists of thirty -five voting members, including the U niversity President; the President of the Faculty Assembly sits as an ex officio member of the Board of Trustees but has no voting rights . Id. Apart from this non-voting member, the faculty has no other representation on the Board of Trustees. Id. at 10 - 11. Between meetings, the Board of Trustees' authority is exercised by its Executive Committee, which consists of no less than six trustees and the university president. Id. at 11. Apart from the Executive Committee, the Board of Trustees has six other standing committees \u2014 the Finance Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Development Committee, the Nominating Committee, Planning and Facilities Committee, and the Academic and Student Affairs Committee. Id. Faculty are represented only on the latter -most committee, which consists of at least four trustees appointed by the Chair of the Board of Trustees, plus two faculty members. Id. Thus, in the one standing governance committee in which the faculty has any 3 voice at all, faculty representatives are in the minority, with their votes outnumbered by Trustee votes by a ratio of at least 3:1. B. Administration The day -to-day operations of the university are managed by a staff of twenty administrators, including the University President, four vice -presidents , several associate and assistant vice -presidents, the Dean s of Enrollment Management and Community Outreach, the academic deans of each of the university's four schools, the academic chairs of the various departments within those schools , and s everal program directors . Id. at 12 -13. The ratio of administrators to full- time faculty is 1:4. Supp. Dec. at 10 n.11. The administration sets tuition and fee levels, establishes enrollment targets, and engages in fundraising. Dec. & Dir. of Election at 12. The University's budget is prepared by the Vice -President of Finance and Operations with no faculty input; the Vice- President of Finance and Operations submits the budget to the Board of Trustees' Finance Committee and ultimately to the full Bo ard of Trustees for a vote. Dec. & Dir. of Election at 12. The university's enrollment goals are set by the Dean of Enrollment Management, also without faculty input. Id. Those enrollment goals \u2014which effectively determine the size of the student body a nd thereby directly impact the delivery of educational services by the faculty \u2014are a particular point of contention between the university's administration, which has pursued an expansionary enrollment policy, and the faculty members, who favor more modest enrollment targets that they believe more suited to the university's facilities, but who lack any voice in the shaping of enrollment policy. Id. at 13. Academic policies are set by the Vice- President of Academic Affairs, upon recommendations by two sta nding committees: The Deans Council and the Graduate Council. Id. at 13. The Deans Council consists of the deans of the four schools, plus two program 4 directors, the Director of Library and the Director of Honors Program. Id. The Graduate Council cons ists of the directors of each graduate program, who report to the chairs of the various departments within which the graduate programs operate. Id. at 14. C. Faculty Point Park's full -time faculty members act through their governing body, the Faculty Assembly, which meets monthly throughout the academic year. Dec. & Dir. of Election at 15- 16. The Faculty Assembly has nine standing committees, including, of particular relevance here, the Curriculum Committee, whose function is to make recommendations to the Faculty Assembly concerning such matters as adding new courses, programs, and majors as well as structural changes in existing degree programs and course offerings that have the potential to have effects beyond a single department. Id. at 16 & n.32. \"The normal process\" by which changes are made to undergraduate programs is as follows: Since the 2002- 03 restructuring, proposals would originate at the school level , whereas before the restructuring, such proposals would originate from the departme nts. Dec. and Dir. of Election at 17 & n.34. Any such proposal is referred to the Faculty Assembly's Curriculum Committee, which is empowered to either reject the proposal or recommend it to the full Faculty Assembly for a vote. If the proposal is appr oved by the Faculty Assembly, it is then referred to the Vice- President for Academic Affairs, who can either reject the proposal or submit it with a recommendation for approval to the University President. Id. at 17 & n.35. Graduate programs originate fro m the administration, which submits a statement of design to the Pennsylvania Department of Education and then completes a program proposal to the Graduate Council. Dec. & Dir. of Election at 18. If the Graduate Council approves the program, the proposal then goes to the Faculty Assembly's Curriculum Committee. Id. If the Curriculum Committee approves the program, it is then submitted to the full Faculty Assembly 5 for a vote. Id. Programs approved by the Faculty Assembly are then submitted to the Vice - President of Academic Affairs and the University President, who have final authority to approve the program ; if the President approves, the program must be resubmitted in its final form to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Id. 2. Decis ion-Making Regarding the Overall Nature and Direction of the Institution and the Structure of Departments and Academic Programs Notwithstanding the fact that Point Park's bylaws ostensibly require faculty consultation \"[f]or decisions that affect programs , curricula, or faculty,\" Dec. & Dir. of Election at 17, the reality is that major decisions regarding course offerings, the structure of degree programs and departments, and the even the very nature of the institution have routinely been made by the admin istration either without faculty consultation or contrary to the stated position of the faculty. Most importantly, in the period from 2002 to late 2003, the administration of the institution \u2014then operating as Point Park College \u2014began a major restructuri ng that culminated in the transformation of the institution from a college to a university . Before 2002, the college was organized into academic departments and programs , each headed by a department chair or program director; the department chairs and pro gram directors reported directly to the Vice- President for Academic Affairs, who, in turn, reported to the University President . Supp. Dec. at 9 & n.9. In 2002, the administration, without faculty input or participation , created a new layer of administra tion above the department chairs and program directors by creating four schools , each headed by a dean \u2014the School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Business, the Conservatory of Performing Arts, and the School of Adult and Professional Studies . Id. at 10. After this restructuring, there were \"not one but two buffers\" between the faculty and the administration: \"The department chairs and all but one program director ... and the newly created deans.\" Id. Consequently, a substantial amount of a uthority sh ifted from the department 6 chairs and program directors to the deans of the four schools , thereby \"dilut[ing]\" the faculty's \"input on academic matters .\" Id . After this restructuring , the administration of what was then Point Park College applied for accr editation as a university. This action, too, was undertaken without faculty input; indeed, the faculty was not informed of the administration's decision to seek university status until after the application was completed. Supp. Dec. at 9 -10 & n.10. The application was finally approved in October of 2003. Dec. & Dir. of Election at 7-8. The administration also made substantial changes to departments and academic programs without consulting the faculty. In 2001, for instance, the administration dismantled the Government and International Studies Department and reassigned the courses previously taught by faculty members from that department to the Business Department and the Humanities Department. Id. at 14. Although this action required the Business and H umanities Departments to offer additional courses, the faculty was not consulted before the administration implemented this change. Id. In the same year, the administration also merged the International Master in Business Administration (\"I nternationa l MBA\") degree program with the Master of Business Administration (\"MBA\") program. Id. at 15. The result of this merger was to cease offering the International MBA degree program altogether, in favor of offering an \"international business track\" within the MBA program , and to eliminate twenty -two international business course offerings. Id. The administration effected this change without any consultation with the faculty. Id. Also in 2001, the administration created a new program within the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication called the Innocence Institute of Western Pennsylvania, thereby creating new curriculum and independent study opportunities. Id. Again, the faculty was not consulted on the creation of this new program. Id. at 16. 7 And in 2002, amidst the restructuring of the entire institution, the University President decided to contract out the English as a Second Language (\"ESL\") Program \u2014previously run by the Humanities and Human Sciences Department \u2014to a private, for -profit compa ny, Berlitz/ELS Educational Services, Inc., and to reduce the number of ESL courses offered to international students. Supp. Dec. at 16. This action was taken without faculty input and over the objection of the chair of the Humanities and Human Sciences Department. Id. In the same year, the administration, again acting unilaterally, changed the course requirements for students seeking an undergraduate degree in Early Childhood Education and Elementary Education by adding a required course and rejected t he recommendation of the National Collegiate Honors Council to offer a separate curriculum for students in Point Park's Honors Program. Id. at 17 -18. 3. Decision -Making Regarding Academic Policies In the area of academic policy, too, the administr ation of Point Park frequently acted unilaterally with respect to purely academic matters. As explained above, the administration's unilateral restructuring of programs and departments led to the elimination of more than twenty academic courses, the elimi nation of the International MBA degree program, and the contracting out and consequent reduction in ESL offerings. Of equal moment, i n those instances in which the administration did consult with the faculty concerning changes to existing academic program s or the creation of new programs \u2014as ostensibly required under the institution's bylaws \u2014the administration frequently acted contrary to the faculty's recommendations. With respect to undergraduate programs, the Regional Director found that \"the outcome of 4 out of 14 undergraduate programs, or approximately 29 percent of the undergraduate programs about which there is evidence in the record, was not decided on by the faculty.\" Id. at 12. This included the administration's decisions not to offer three deg ree programs recommended by the Faculty Assembly and its creation of a new undergraduate degree program without faculty 8 approval. Id. ; Dec. & Dir. of Election at 18. As to graduate programs, \"the faculty's recommendation ... was not followed [by the admini stration] nearly 17 percent of the time.\" Supp. Dec. at 13; Dec. & Dir. of Election at 18- 19. The administration showed a marked tendency to disregard the faculty's purported control over curriculum as outlined in the university's Faculty Handbook. S upp. Dec. at 20. Notably, in 2003, the administration unilaterally established new policies concerning online courses, \"special delivery courses,\" independent study courses, and faculty -led study abroad programs. Id. Specifically, the administration uni laterally created a stipend for the development of online courses, required that faculty add fourteen hours of \"special delivery courses\" taught outside the classroom, required approval by deans of all independent study courses, and suspended study abroad programs. Id. at 20 -21. Decisions regarding admissions, enrollment targets, and tuition levels, as noted above, are structurally committed to the administration, and nothing in the actual practice of the institution shows that the administration chose to share that authority with the faculty. Id. at 23 - 25, 32- 33, 35. The administration's tendency to act unilaterally on academic matters even reached into such areas as the development of course syllabi and the assigning of student grades. In 2003, faculty members were provided with a detailed model syllabus developed by the administration for the redesign of all classes , whereas faculty members previously were required to prepare a syllabus for each course, without being subject to any particular model. Supp. Dec. at 30. At the same time, the administration required faculty to assign library work and research for all students and established attendance and grading policies directing faculty members to decreas e student grades by a set number of points f or missing a specified number of classes, and to reduce students' grades by one full letter grade for all late assignments \"without exception.\" Id. 9 Administrative interference in grading also took the form of altering grades assigned to individual stude nts by faculty members. The V ice President for Academic Affairs unilaterally ordered the registrar to change a student's grade in an MBA course from a B - to an A and to change in another graduate student's grade to an A+ in order to rais e the student's gr ade-point average to 4.0. Id. at 27. And the same Vice -President approved a committee's determination to change the grades of eighteen students in a n undergraduate business class, even though the committee process did not comport with the university's pr ocess for student appeals of grading decisions. Id. 4. Decision -Making Regarding the Terms and Conditions of Faculty Employment The Point Park administration also displays a penchant for unilateral actions concerning the terms and conditions of facul ty employment to a significant degree . The administration, for instance, repeatedly flouted the Faculty Handbook's guidelines as to faculty hiring by directly appointing tenure -track faculty, and in one instance promoting an existing faculty member to c hair a department, without convening a search committee of faculty members. Id. at 36 -37. As with appointments, the administration in three instances directed the award of tenure despite Faculty Handbook requirements mandating that a departmental review committee be established to review tenure requests. Id. at 43 -44. These three incidents constituted about seventeen percent of all tenure decisions during the relevant period. Id. at 44. The administration also routinely ignored faculty input in the sele ction of deans and department chars. Id. at 40 -41. Significantly, in 2002, amidst the overall restructuring of the institution, the University President and the Vice -President for Academic Affairs decided to implement, for the first time in the institu tion's history, a comprehensive personnel manual for the entire university and engaged 10 an outside consultant to draft the policies \u2014which has resulted in six separate draft volumes. While the administration has allowed faculty an opportunity to comment on the draft policy, it has set a tight deadline, and of course failed to involve faculty in the initial decision to promulgate such policies or to hire a consultant rather than develop them in -house. Id. at 47. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the administration implemented a merit pay system despite the fact that the Faculty Assembly voted the proposal down twice , and also implemented a corresponding evaluation system for that purpose . Id. at 47. PRIOR PROCEEDINGS In late 2003, the Newspape r Guild of Pittsburgh, affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, AFL -CIO, petitioned the Board to represent a unit consisting of approximately 77 full -time faculty members at Point Park University, teaching artists, and laboratory associates, but excluding the university's president, vice -presidents, associate and assistant vice -presidents, deans, department chairs, and part -time faculty. Dec. & Dir. of Election at 5. The university's administration argued that all members of the petitioned -for unit are managerial employees excluded from the Act's coverage. After a twenty -day hearing and full briefing by the union and the university, the Regional Director issued his 109- page Decision and Direction of Election, concluding that the university's full-time faculty were not managerial employees and that the proposed bargaining unit was an appropriate one. The university sought review by the Board, which the Board denied by order dated June 23, 2004, without issuing a written opinion. After the bargaining unit's members voted in favor of the union's representation in Board- supervised election, the union was certified as the bargaining agent for the unit. The university refused to bargain in order to test the certification, and the union filed unf air labor practice charges alleging a violation of the duty to bargain. The 11 Regional Director filed a complaint, which the Board resolved against the university on summary judgment. The university then filed a petition for review with the U.S. Court of appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The court granted the petition on the ground that \"the Board and the Regional Director \"failed to ... explain which factors are significant and which less so, and why' in their determination that the faculty at Point Park were not 'managerial employees.'\" Point Park , 457 F.3d at 50 (citation omitted). Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the Board to provide such an explanation. Id. at 50 -51. The Board, in turn remanded the case to the Regional Director, who issued his Supplemental Decision on July 10, 2007, in which he offered a fuller legal analysis based on the same record. This review proceeding followed. ARGUMENT I. INTRODUCTION The D.C. Circuit's remand order in this case presents the Board with an opportunity both to clarify its application of the Supreme Court's teaching in Yeshiva in a way that is responsive the D.C. Circuit's direction that the Board \"explain 'which factors are significant and which less so, and why ,'\" Point Park , 457 F.3d at 50, and to build on the Yeshiva factors, consistent with the Supreme Court's admonition that the factors it identified \"are a starting point only, and that other factors not present here may enter the analysis in other contexts,\" 444 U.S. at 690 n.31. In this regard , we suggest that the Board take due account of the substantial changes to the landscape of academia that have that have occurred in the decades since the Supreme Court issued its Yeshiva decision \u2014many of which are amply reflected in the record here . Accordingly, we suggest that the Board develop a decisional matrix for evaluating whether faculty members in a particular institution of higher education are professional employees protected by the NLRA that eschews the 'laundry list' approach but instead foc uses 12 on the locus of decision- making in broad areas. Briefly stated, our suggested approach is this: Analysis must begin, but certainly not end, with a careful consideration of the governance and administrative structure s of the institution , with an eye to the question whether the overall structure suggests a hierarchical organization or a collection of collegial bodies with broadly shared authority between faculty and administration. While this is a necessary starting point, it is by no means the most i mportant consideration. Far more significant is how the actual, operational decisions are made i n three critical areas: ( a) decisions as to the structure of the institution's academic programs and/or the overall nature and direction of the institution; ( b) decisions as to the institution's academic policies; and ( c) decisions as to the terms and conditions of faculty members' employment. Consideration of the actual decision- making process in these areas should be the backbone of the Board's analysis. And on such analysis, the full-time faculty included within the Regional Director's Decision and Direction of Election easily qualify as professional employees entitled to the protections of the Act, rather than managerial employees who are excluded from the Act. We will detail our proposed approach in Part II below, but in order to place the discussion in its proper context, we will first discuss the development of the managerial exception, with particular focus on its application in higher education setti ngs, and then survey broad developments in academia that post -date the Yeshiva decision that are pertinent to t he issues to be decided by the Board. 1. The managerial exception to the NLRA's coverage is not state d in the text of the Act , but in NLRB. v. Bell Aerospace Co. Div. of Textron, Inc ., 416 U.S. 267 (1974) , the Court concluded\u2014based on an analysis of the legislative history of the Taft -Hartley Act of 1947 and Board decisions prior to Packard Motor Car , 64 N.L.R.B. 1212 (1945), enforced 157 F.2d 80 (6th Cir. 1946), judgment aff'd 330 U.S. 485 (1947) \u2014\"that Congress intended to exclude from 13 the protections of the Act all employees properly classified as 'managerial.'\" Id. at 275. In reaching this conclusion, the Court placed particular emphasis on t he legislative rationales underlying the Act's express exclusion of supervisory employees (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3)).1 The Court found that the two houses of Congress, while in disagreement over the precise shape that the supervisory exclusion should take, shar ed the concern that in Packard Motor Car , the Board had broadly read the Act \"to include those clearly within the management hierarchy\" and thereby potentially \"depriv[ing] employers of the loyal representatives to which they were entitled\" in such a way as to impair productivity and \"upset the balance of power between labor and management.\" Bell Aerospace, 416 U.S. at 281. The Bell Aerospace Court did not endeavor to define the precise scope of the managerial exclusion, although it did approvingly quote the Board's definition of \"managers\" as set forth in another case: \"those who 'formulate and effectuate management decisions by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer.'\" Id. at 288, quoting Palace Laundry and Dry Cleaning, 75 N.L.R.B. 320 (1947). Having done so, however, the Court closed its discussion of the issue by saying \"the Board 'is now free to ' read a new and more restrictive meaning into the Act.\" 416 U.S. at 289 (citation omitted). The Court revisited the mana gerial exclusion in the higher education context in NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ ., 444 U.S. 672 (1980) . There, the Court further sharpened the definition of exclusion, holding that managers \"exercise discretion within, or even independently of, 1 The Act defines \"superv isor\" as: any individual having the authority, in the interest of an employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward or discipline other employees, or responsibility to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires use of independent judgment. [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11).] 14 established employ er policy and must be aligned with management.\" Id. at 683. The Court elaborated that an employee is \"aligned with management\" if he or she \"represents management interests by taking or recommending discretionary actions that effectively control or imple ment employer policy.\" Id . The Court in Yeshiva noted that these benchmarks were difficult to apply in the academic context because, in contrast to the \"purely hierarchical\" structures common in industrial organizations , private universities typically have \"shared authority\" structures pursuant to which \"authority ... is divided between a central administration and one or more collegial bodies.\" Id. at 680. The Court also recognized the difficulty of distinguishing between explicitly -covered professionals2 and those endowed with managerial status.3 Ultimately, however, the Court did not delve too deeply into this issue, as it concluded that the faculty members at Yeshiva were clearly manager ial because, in matters essential to the operation of the univers ity, they \"exercise[d] authority which in any other context unquestionably would be managerial.\" Id . at 686. The Court summed up the evidence as follows : [The faculty members'] authority in academic matters is absolute. They decide what courses will be of fered, when they will be scheduled, and to whom they will be taught. They debate and determine teaching methods, grading policies, and matriculation standards. They effectively decide which students will be admitted, retained, and graduated. On occasion their views have determined the size of the student body, the tuition to be charged, and the location of a school. .... To the 2 The Act defines \"professional employees\" as those who perform work \"predominantly intellectual and varied in character ... involving the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance ... requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acq uired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study ... or from training\" the output of which \"cannot be standardized in relation to a given period of time.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(12). 3 As the Board has acknowledged, \"managerial author ity is not vested in professional employees merely by virtue of their professional status, or because work performed in that status may have a bearing on company direction.\" General Dynamics Corp ., 213 N.L.R.B. 851, 857- 58 (1974). 15 extent the industrial analogy applies, the faculty determines within each school the product to be produced, the terms upon which it will be offered, and the customers who will be served. [ 444 U.S. at 686.] The Board had argued that even though the faculty's members effectively control academic matters at Yeshiva, they should not be excluded from the Act because the \"independent pr ofessional\" judgment they exercise mitigates the concerns over divided loyalty that underlie the managerial exception. The Court rejected that approach, reasoning that \"[t]he problem of divided loyalty is particularly acute for a university like Yeshiva, which depends on the independent professional judgment of its faculty to formulate and apply crucial policies constrained only by necessarily general institutional goals.\" Id. at 865- 66. Furthermore, a s a factual matter, t he Court rejected the union's c ontention that the faculty's role was \"merely advisory\" and that the administration had the power to override the professional advice offered by the faculty, concluding that \"the fact that the administration holds a rarely exercised veto power does not dim inish the faculty's effective power in policymaking and implementation.\" Id. at 683 n.17. In this regard, the Court pointed out that the record revealed, inter alia , the following: \"budget requests prepared by the senior professor in each subject receiv e the 'perfunctory' approval of the Dean '99%' of the time and have never been rejected by the central administration\"; that the deans of two of Yeshiva's colleges \"regard faulty actions as binding\"; that \"[o]ne Dean estimated that 98% of faculty hiring re commendations were ultimately given effect\"; that \"[t]he President has accepted all decisions by the Yeshiva faculty as to promotions and sabbaticals, including decisions opposed by the Dean.\" Id. at 675 - 77 nn.3,4,&5. At the same time, the Court took pa ins to outline the limits of its holding . The Court made clear that its decision was not intended to \"sweep all professionals outside the Act in derogation of Congress ' expressed intent to protect them\" and that f aculty members who merely 16 engaged in \"the routine discharge of professional duties in projects to which they have been assigned\" were not managerial employees, even if their inclusion in a bargaining unit involved \"some divided loyalty.\" Id. at 690. In other words, that faculty members are performing the traditional role of professors is not enough, without more, to confer \"managerial\" status. Of critical significance here, the Court further stressed that its analysis was \"a starting point only, and that other factors ... may enter into the analys is in other contexts.\" 444 U.S. at 691 n.31. For example, the Court said that there may be \"institutions of higher learning unlike Yeshiva where the faculty are entirely or predominantly nonmanagerial .\" Id. The Court went on to note that \"[t]here may be faculty members at Yeshiva and like universities who properly could be included in a bargaining unit\" but expressed no opinion on that issue because it was \"clear that the unit approved by the Board was too broad.\" Id. . Of equally critical importa nce at this juncture, the Court acknowledged the dissent's point that the \" shared governance \" structure on which the Court's decision rests was becoming less common in universities , even at that time , while pointing out that any such shift was \"neither universal nor complete\" and stressing that , in any event, the Court's \"decision must rest on the record before us.\" Id. at 689 n.29. 2. Board decisions subsequent to Yeshiva have , to say the least, not displayed a consistent approach. There is general agreement across existing decisions that the kind of \"absolute\" faculty control over academic matters that drove the Court's decision in Yeshiva need not be shown, s ee, e.g., Lewis & Clark College , 300 NLRB 155, 163 fn. 41 (1990) , and Lemoyne- Owen College , 345 NLRB 1123 (2005), and that academic factors are generally more significant than non -academic factors in the analysis because \"the 'business' of a university is education.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 688. 17 However, this is largely where the decisions cease to ag ree. As Board Member Johanson noted in University of Dubuque , 289 NLRB 349 (1988), the Board \"has failed to develop an integrated body of law\" charting the point short of \"absolute\" control at which faculty members are \"expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer\" \u2014thereby becoming managers \u2014rather than acting in their own interests. Id. at 355 (member Johansen dissenting) In a number of cases, however, the Board has given (in our view, appropriate) weight to significant \" non-academic\" factors going to the structure and overall direction of the institution \u2014all of which have inevitable consequences for the academic enterprise even if they do not constitute \"academic policy\" in a narrow sense . For example, in Cooper Union of Science & Art , 273 NLRB 1768 (1985) , enforced 783 F.2d 29 (2d Cir. 1986) , the Board, in finding that the faculty were not managerial employees, gave considerable weight to the fact that the institution had engaged in major restructuring without faculty input . The Board stressed that the administration had, without consulting the faculty and over faculty objections, engaged in two restructurings : In the first, it \"increase[ed] class size, increase[ed] the student -faculty ratio, increase[ed] teaching loads, severely limi t[ed] grants of tenure, reduc [ed] the number of full -time faculty through attrition, and increase[ed] the proportion of adjunct faculty ,\" and in the second \"eliminated the divisions and the division head positions, leaving the schools the primary structura l academic units. \" Id. at 1770- 71. See also University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB 83, 83 (1997) (emphasizing that the administration was not only the driving force behind academic policy but also \"unilaterally established a law school\" and \"eliminated entir e degree programs\" without faculty input). Other cases suggest that that the locus of decision -making with regard to academic polic ies, narrowly construed as those relating to curriculum, course schedules, teaching methods, grading policies, admissions and graduation standards, student body size, and tuition rates \u2014the 18 factors that , to be sure, primarily drove the Yeshiva decision \u2014are perhaps the only factors of significance. See, e.g. , Livingstone College , 286 NLRB 124 (1987) (\"Given that the business of a university is education, it is the faculty members' participation in formulating academic policy that aligns their interest with that of management. . .\") . In New York Univ. Med. Ctr ., NLRB 887 (1997), the Board endeavored to succinctly explai n its method for evaluating faculty bargaining cases where the managerial exception was at issue, but managed instead to underscore this tension in its case law. There, the Board concluded that \"[w]here faculty members have been afforded protection under t he Act, the Board has relied on the fact that the administration either unilaterally or effectively made the decisions essential to university operations.\" At the same time, however, the Board noted that it had denied NLRA coverage to a group of faculty m embers in University of Dubuque , 289 NLRB 349 (1989), where faculty members were generally in the minority on committees that formulated academic policies, 4 and where \"the administration vetoed a majority of the faculty members ' recommended decisions.\" Id. at 350, citing New York Univ. Med. Ctr ., 324 NLRB at 910. As the dissent in Dubuque noted, denying the protection of the Act to employees is \"a serious matter .\" 289 NLRB at 354 (Member Johansen, dissenting). Implicit exclusions such as the managerial exclusion \"must be narrowly construed to avoid conflict with the broad language of the Act, which covers 'any employee,' including professional employees.\" David Wolcott Kendall Mem. School , 866 F.2d at 160 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court itself has agreed with this general principle, noting that \"administrators and reviewing courts must take care to 4 For example, three faculty members were on the nine -member committee that set admission, retention, and student discipline policies; three faculty members sat on the seven- member committee that made policy related to the distribution of financial aid; and five faculty members sat on the sixteen -member committee on Educational Policies. In the cases of the admissions and financial aid committees, the faculty members were appointed by the university president rather than the faculty. Dubuque , 289 NLRB at 350. 19 assure that exemptions from NLRA coverage are not so expansively interpreted as to deny protection to workers the Act was designed to reach.\" Holly Far ms Corp. v. NLRB , 517 U.S. 392, 399 (1996). 3. Underlying all this ferment in the case law is historical reality: While both Yeshiva and Board decisions after Yeshiva have rested on a strong a view of the \"shared governance\" university , the landscape of higher education is changing rapidly. Universities ever less frequently resemble the collegial institutions referenced in Yeshiva . As institutions of higher education have become increasingly similar to large businesses, power over both academic and non-academic decision -making has become more centralized in administrative bodies , with a corresponding reduction in faculty authority. See Benjamin Ginsberg, The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All- Administrator University and Why it Matters , at 1 -7 (Oxford University Press, 2011) . These administrative bodies often contain large numbers of specialized personnel, such that faculty recommendations are not implemented in many areas deemed important in Yeshiva \u2014if, indeed, professional advice in these areas i s sought from faculty at all. Id. The result of these changes is that an increasing portion of universities are not \"like Yeshiva,\" 444 U.S. at 689, and faculty members at such institutions serve in an advisory role, at best, not a managerial role. Unive rsities also increasingly rely on contingent faculty, including part -time and adjunct employees. See Michael W. Klein , Declaring an End to \"Financial Exigency\"? Changes in Higher Education Law, Labor, and Finance, 1971 -2011, 38 J. C ollege & U inv. L. 221, 271- 72 (2012) (\"Between 1995 and 2007, contingent faculty came to outnumber tenured faculty. .... By 2007, the proportion of tenure and non- tenure faculty was reversed. Only 21.3% of faculty were full -time tenured, and 9.9% were full -time tenure -track. \" (footnotes omitted)). Such contingent faculty members are truly confined to \"the routine discharge of professional duties in 20 projects to which they have been assigned\" and cannot reasonably be considered managerial. Yeshiva, 444 U.S. at 690. The advent of online distance learning is creating a sea change from real-time, in -person course offerings to virtual, online offerings. See Laura N. Gasaway , Impasse: Distance Learning and Copyright , 62 Ohio St. L.J. 783, 784 (2001) (noting that \"[t] he number of dist ance education courses and degree programs offered in the United States grew by 72% from 1995 to 1998,\" such that \"[a] lmost 1,700 institutions offer about 54,000 online courses with a total student enrollme nt of approximately 1.6 million\" (footnotes omitte d)). This development also has the potential to create a disconnect between many faculty members and their employing institution's governance structures. Particular care should be taken to ensure that the managerial exception is not applied too broadly i n these settings. Given the inconsistent application of the managerial exception and the realities of private university governance more than thirty years after Yeshiva , this case presents an important opportunity for the Board to clarify its interpretati on of that case in a manner that remains true to the mandates of the NLRA. A rigorous analysis is needed that can serve as a blueprint for future cases in determining whether faculty members are managerial so that those who are properly covered as professi onals under the act are not deprived of their statutory right to organize. II. THE BOARD MUST DEVELOP A RIGOROUS ANALYSIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER FACULTY MEMBERS ARE MANAGERIAL THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH YESHIVA AND THE PURPOSES OF THE NATIONAL LABOR REL ATIONS ACT The Board should develop an integrated theory of the application of Yeshiva to present - day institutions of higher education by honing the approach in Yeshiva in a way that ensures that only faculty members who exercise broad authority in areas critical to the university's operations as an educational institution are classified as managerial \u2014that is, only those faculty members who, like the faculty in Yeshiva , have actual control over \"the product to be produced, the terms 21 upon which it will be of fered, and the customers who will be served.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 686 n.17. This will require a detailed analysis of which factors or areas of control \"are significant and which less so, and why,\" Point Park , 457 F.3d at 50, as well as what factors shoul d be considered in determining whether the faculty members in question exercise an adequate level of control in each of these areas and in the institution as a whole that it \"pervasively operate[s] the enterprise.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 691. As noted above , this case presents the Board with an opportunity both to clarify its application of Yeshiva in a way that is responsive the D.C. Circuit's remand order and to build on the Yeshiva factors, consistent with the Supreme Court's admonition that the factors i t identified \"are a starting point only, and that other factors not present here may enter the analysis in other contexts,\" 444 U.S. at 690 n.31. Consequently, it is eminently possible to keep faith with the Court's teaching in Yeshiva while accounting for the substantial changes to the landscape of academia that have that have occurred in the decades since the Supreme Court issued its Yeshiva decision \u2014changes that are evident in the record in this case. A. Which Factors Are Significant, Which Less So, And Why We propose that the Board develop a decisional matrix for evaluating whether faculty members in a particular institution of higher education focus ing on the locus of decision- making in broad areas , prioritized according to those that have the grea test impact on the creation and delivery of the institution's product \u2014educational services. This case is a particularly apt vehicle for developing such a decisional matrix both because the record here reflects the historical trends in academia and because the Regional Director's Supplemental Decision on Remand and the earlier Decision and Direction of Election here go a long way toward providing the Board with an outline for \"explain [ing] 'which factors are significant and which less so, and why,'\" Point Park, 457 F.3d at 50. As t he court in Yeshiva observed , \"the business of a university is 22 education\" and its \"vitality\" depends on the academic policies the school chooses to implement. Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 688. Based on this cogent observation, the Regional Director's Supplemental Decision suggest s that the most logical way to prioritize the Yeshiva factors is to place the most emphasis on those with the greatest and most direct impact on \"the creation and delivery\" of the \"product\" of that business. Supp. Dec. at 57. Hence, we provide a slightly modified and supplemented reiteration of the Regional Director's analysis below. 1. The Institution's Formal Governance and Administrative Structure The analysis must begin with a careful consideration of the governance and administrative structures of the institution, with an eye to the question whether the overall structure suggests a hierarchical organization or a collection of collegial bodies with broadly shared authority between faculty and administration. To be sure, the formal structure of the institution is not the most significant factor in the analysis; rather, it is the actual operational decision -making within the institution that largely determines whether faculty can properly be considered either \"managerial employees\" or \"professional employees.\" But it is well -nigh impossible to analyze an institution's actual operations without first getting a handle on the institution's formal structure. See Cooper Union of Science & Art , 273 NLRB 1768, 1768 (1985) (\" We review first the formal governance structure for faculty participation in institutional decision making and then actual governance practice.\"). In this regard, we believe that the following features of formal governance structures are the most important: (a) the degree of faculty representation, if any, on the governing board and governance committees; (b) the size of central administration relative to the faculty; ( c) the number of layers of authority between the faculty and the institution's g overning board; and (d) the authority granted to administrators. See generally Elmira College , 309 N.L.R.B. 842 264 NLRB 1107 (1982) . In this case, these factors suggest that faculty at Point Park are not managerial employees: Faculty have no voting representatives on Point Park's Board of Trustees, but only a single, non- voting representative, and they have only a small minority of voting members on one of the eight standing governance committees, the Curriculum Committee. T he size of the central administration at Point Park, while not large in absolute terms, is certainly outsized in relation to faculty, as there is one administrator for every four faculty members . Cf. Lore tto Heights College, 264 NLRB at 1121 (a cadre of three administrators for every faculty member provided an \"effective buffer between the faculty and top management\"). S ince Point Park's restructuring, there are multiple layers of administration between the faculty and the Board of Trustees (the department chairs, the deans of the schools, the Vice -President of Academic Affairs, and the President) . Broad, unshared authority is committed to administrators regarding the university budget, tuition rates, and enrollment targets. 2. The Actual Operational Decision -Making of the Institution As noted above, although an examination of the institution's formal governing structures is a necessary and first step, and is not insignificant in its own right, it is har dly the most important part of the analysis. Rather the heart of the analysis should be, as Yeshiva and post - Yeshiva Board cases have recognized, a thorough consideration of the locus of actual, operational decision- making within the institution \u2014\"the law of the shop,\" to borrow a phrase from the industrial context . Although this much is clear, the Board's challenge \u2014as the D.C. Circuit's remand order makes plain \u2014has lain in articulating which types of decisions are the most significant and why. We believ e that the path forward can be drawn from existing case law and the Regional 24 Director's decisions in this case, provided that the Board eschews the case -by-case 'laundry list' approach \u2014which, due to the peculiarities of each particular case and each particular institution does not always provide adequate guidance in other cases \u2014and instead focus on three broad areas of decision -making , prioritized according to their effects on the delivery of educational services : (a) decisions as to the structure of the i nstitution's academic programs and/or the overall nature and direction of the institution; ( b) decisions as to the institution's academic policies; and ( c) decisions as to the terms and conditions of faculty members' employment. Needless to say, given the variation among institutions, the precise contours of decision- making in these broad areas will doubtless vary from case to case, but we believe that these three areas are critical to the determination whether faculty are, in fact, managerial. (a) Decisio n-Making Regarding the Overall Nature and Direction of the Institution and the Structure of Departments and Academic Programs It would be difficult to posit a set of decisions that have more impact on the delivery of educational services than fundamental d ecisions as to the overall nature and direction of an institution of higher education as well as more granular decisions about the structure of academic departments and programs. To be sure, such decisions were not part of the record in Yeshiva , and thus did not feature in the Court's articulation of the factors driving its conclusion that Yeshiva faculty were managerial employees, but we believe that, where applicable, such decisions fall comfortably within the \"other factors not present [at Yeshiva that] may enter into the analysis in other contexts.\" 444 U.S. at 690 n.31. Decisions as to the overall nature and direction of an educational institution \u2014like the Point Park administration's decision to transform the college into a university \u2014are quintessent ial managerial functions. They are, in the higher education context, equivalent to the types of decisions that Justice Stewart, in his now -canonical concurrence in Fibreboard Paper 25 Products Corp. v. NLRB , 379 U.S. 203 ( 1964) , identified as constituting \" the core of entrepreneurial control ,\" in the industrial context \u2014i.e. , \"[d] ecisions concerning the commitment of investment capital and the basic scope of the enterprise.\" Id. 223 ( Stewart , J., joined by Douglas and Harlan, JJ., concurring) . Just as such decisions \" are fundamental to the basic direction of a corporate enterprise ,\" id., so, too, decisions as to the nature and direction of an institution are fundamental to the educational enterprise conducted by higher education institutions . Here, the Poi nt Park administration's unilateral decisions to restructure the institution and thereby transform from a liberal -arts college, with semi- autonomous departments reporting directly to the college's top administrators , into a university in which departments are subordinate to schools and the school report up the administrative chain, were obviously fundamental to the academic enterprise. Consequently, the complete exclusion of faculty from any input into those fundamental decisions at Point Park points strongly toward the conclusion that Point Park's faculty are not managerial. But such fundamental restructuring and reorienting decisions are not the only types of decisions that fall into this category. Decisions regarding more modest structural changes \u2014e.g., the creation, merger, or elimination of academic programs, or the decision to contract out educational services to a private vendor, all of which occurred at Point Park without faculty involvement \u2014also are inherently managerial. Cf. Fibreboard, 379 U.S. at 210- 11 (\" To hold, as the Board has done, that contracting out is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining would promote the fundamental purpose of the Act by bringing a problem of vital concern to labor and management within the framework esta blished by Congress as most conducive to industrial peace. \"). And again, the Point Park administration's unilateral actions in these areas also points strongly to the conclusion that the faculty are not managerial employees. See Cooper Union of 26 Science & Art, 273 NLRB 1768 (1985) , enforced 783 F.2d 29 (2d Cir. 1986) ; University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB 83, 83 (1997) ; St. Thomas Univ., 298 NLRB 280 (1990). (b) Decision -Making Regarding Academic Policies Of no less significance are decisions regarding aca demic policies \u2014the types of decisions that form what the D.C. Circuit has aptly called \"the heart of the Court's decision in Yeshiva .\" Point Park , 457 F.3d at 403. As these traditional Yeshiva factors are well -nigh universally considered of paramount importance in the Board's post -Yeshiva case law, we need not elaborate on their significance to the delivery of educational services by the institution. To reiterate, the Court concluded that Yeshiva's faculty were \"clearly managerial\" because their authorit y over the following academic polices was \"absolute\": They decide what courses will be offered, when they will be scheduled, and to whom they will be taught. They debate and determine teaching methods, grading policies, and matriculation standards. They effectively decide which students will be admitted, retained, and graduated. On occasion their views have determined the size of the student body, the tuition to be charged, and the location of a school. .... To the extent the industrial analogy applies, the faculty determines within each school the product to be produced, the terms upon which it will be offered, and the customers who will be served. [ 444 U.S. at 686.] While there is no need to elaborate on the importance of these factors, the key question arising in most contemporary colleges and universities will turn on the degree of administrator or faculty control over these decisions. See David M. Rabban, Distinguishing Excluded Managers from Covered Professionals Under the NLRA , 89 Colum. L. Rev. 1775, 1800 (1989) (\"The crucial issue in distinguishing between professionals and managers ... is not whether professional work has a direct impact on company policy, but rather who makes the effective decision to accept or reject professional advice. This deci sionmaker, who may or may not have professional training, is a manager.\"). As the Board's cases recognize, faculty need not have \"absolute\" authority over 27 such decisions to be considered managerial, but lines must be drawn where there are still vestiges of the \"shared control\" model. While the degree of faculty control over matters related to programs of study and curriculum is of signal importance, it must be emphasized that \"professors may not be excluded merely because they determine the content of their own courses, evaluate their own students, and supervise their own research\" still stands. Yeshiva at 690 n.31. Rather, it is control of overall educational policy that is significant. By the same token, where the administration has established a pattern of overriding faculty members on basic pedagogical matters, the inference may be drawn that faculty power is extraordinarily weak. 5 In this regard, Point Park is an instructive case. While it certainly cannot be said that Point Park's faculty m embers are excluded from decision -making on all matters of educational policy to the same degree that they are from restructuring decisions, the record nevertheless discloses a pattern of unilateral actions by the administration on matters ranging from cou rse offerings to individual students' grades. As explained above, decisions regarding admissions, enrollment targets, and tuition levels, as noted above, are structurally committed to the administration, and are effected by the administration without fac ulty input in actual practice. And t he administration's unilateral restructuring of programs and departments resulted in the elimination of more than twenty academic courses, the elimination of the International MBA degree program, and the contracting out and consequent reduction in ESL offerings. In those instances in which the administration did consult with the faculty concerning changes to existing academic programs or the creation of new programs , the administration 5 In St. Thomas Uni v., for example, the fact that faculty members were severely constrained in drafting syllabi, selecting course materials, and changing course grades was seen as an indication that they were not managers. 298 NLRB at 283. 28 frequently acted contrary to the faculty's recommendations : The administration rejected approximately 29 percent of the faculty's recommendations as to undergraduate programs nearly 17 percent of the faculty's graduate program recommendations. The administration unilaterally establish ed new policies concerning online courses, \"special delivery courses,\" independent study courses, and faculty -led study abroad programs , created grading policies tied to student absences, and established a model syllabus. The administration's interference in academics even reached the arena of individual student grades, with the Vice President of Academic Affairs ordering the alteration of numerous individual students' grades. (c) Decision -Making Regarding the Terms and Conditions of Faculty Members ' Employment Finally , the Board should also take into account decisions concerning the terms and conditions of faculty members' employment. Although this factor relates to subjects that are critical in bargaining and of obvious importance to faculty members qua employees, it should receive the least weight in the consideration of managerial status. That is because according these factors greater significance would run the risk that the judicially created \"managerial exception\" would become redundant of t he statutory exemption of supervisors. And the weeding out of supervisory employees can be accomplished by application of the proper exception. That said, a similar pattern of unilateral action by Point Park's administration is evident in this decision -making area as well. The administration, for instance, repeatedly flouted the Faculty Handbook's guidelines by directly appointing tenure -track faculty, and in one instance promoting an existing faculty member to chair a department, without convening a s earch committee of faculty member, and by directed the award of tenure despite Faculty Handbook requirements mandating that a 29 departmental review committee be established to review tenure requests. The administration also routinely ignored faculty input i n the selection of deans and department chars. And, in 2002, amidst the overall restructuring of the institution, the administration began the process of drafting and implementing university -wide personnel policies without involving faculty in the decisi on to adopt such new policies. A nd, perhaps most importantly, the administration implemented a merit pay system despite the fact that the Faculty Assembly voted the proposal down twice, and also implemented a corresponding evaluation system for that purpose. Thus, even though these decisions are not entitled to the same weight as the classes of decisions discussed above, they likewise point decidedly toward the conclusion that the faculty members at Point Part are not managerial employees. B. The Board S hould Issue Broad Guidelines as t o the Level of Control Necessary for Faculty t o be Considered Managerial Once the Board identifies and prioritizes the subject areas as described above, it is faced with what is perhaps an even more important \u2014and more daunt ing\u2014task. Existing decisions have often failed to articulate factors to be considered in determining the level of control exercised in each of these areas, as well as how to determine the overall balance of power between the faculty and the administration . This is understandable; given the Court's finding of \"absolute\" control in Yeshiva , no further analysis was apparently seen by the Court as necessary. However, as existing decisions seem to agree that something less than \"absolute\" control can indicate managerial status, it is critical that the Board identify factors to be considered on the \"level of control\" issue as well as the weight given to the various areas of control as explained above. 30 Existing cases on faculty bargaining and the Regional Director's Supplemental Decision on Remand allow us to draw out a number of factors that ought to be considered in determining control , some of which overlap with the analysis of the areas of control discussed above . These are: ( 1) the institution's governing documents, ( 2) the size and sophistication of administration and closeness of its relationship to the faculty (3) which party prevails in the event of a conflict , (4) the specific makeup and power of faculty committees, (5 ) whether the administration makes important decisions that impact academics without consulting the faculty or in circumvention of regular processes, (6) what has changed in the overall balance of power between the faculty and the administration, and how the changes were implemented. It bears reiteration at the outset that, like the areas -of-control analysis, this analysis must focus on the level of control that the faculty in fact exercises. T he institution's governing documents serve again as an entry point , but they should not be taken at face value. In Yeshiva , the Court looked to the actual authority exercised by the faculty and whether its actions were \"regard[ed] as binding,\" 6 not to the \"rarely exercised veto power\" that governing documents gave to the administration. Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 683 n.17 (1980). \"The relevant consideration\", said the Court, is not some theoretical \"final authority\", but \"effective recommendation or control\" \u2014that is, whose decisions were implemented. Id . This distinction is important regardless of wheth er it is the faculty or the administration that appears to hold official final authority. In Bradford College , 261 NLRB 565 (1982), for example, the Board found that the 6 In Yeshiva , the Court noted that some witnesses in the case could not recall a single occasion when a faculty recommendation was overruled. Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 677 n.4- 5. See also University of Great Falls , 325 N .L.R.B. 83 (1997) (stating that there must be \"clear evidence that faculty recommendations [a]re generally followed.\"); Florida Mem 'l College , 263 NLRB 1248 (1982) (no managerial status where faculty recommendations were frequently overruled and were nothing more than \"a sophisticated version of the familiar suggestion box.\"), ov erruled in part on other grounds , Detroit College of Bus ., 296 NLRB 318 (1989). 31 faculty were non -managerial where governance documents indicated they had substantial authority, but in practice they had little.7 In determining the level of credence to give to governing documents, the Board should consider whether the policies and procedures contained therein are followed in practice. Even where the policies are follow ed, it is important to consider who initially drafted the documents, who has the right to revise them, and whether this revision right has been exercised. If the governing documents favor faculty power, but that power has been reduced by the administration 's unilateral revision of the documents, it may be a sign that the faculty does not truly serve in a managerial capacity. The size and sophistication of the administration should be a primary consideration in any analysis of control. In Yeshiva there were deans at each of the university's subsidiary schools, but the faculty committees were much larger by comparison, the deans were not experts in academic policy, and the administration therefore depended on faculty expertise in order to make policy. Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 689. By contrast, in Loretto Heights Coll ege, 264 NLRB 1107 (1982), the college had roughly one administrator for every three faculty members, and this created an \"effective buffer between the faculty and top management\" that supported a find ing that unit members were non -managerial. The Tenth Circuit enforced the Board's ruling, further noting that, unlike in Yeshiva , \"[t]he availability of this expertise within the ranks of the administration obviates the College's need to rely extensively on the professional judgment of its faculty in determining and implementing academic policy.\" Loretto Heights College v. NLRB , 7 \"In sum, while the faculty and division chairs have the written right to make recommendations, the record shows that such recommendations were often ignored or reversed by the president, by the academic dean, or by both with respect to curriculum, admission policies, graduation of students, course loads, course scheduling, grading of students, faculty hiring or retention, tuition, and faculty salaries.\" Bradford College , 261 N LRB at 566- 67. But see University of Dubuque , 289 NLRB 349 (1989). 32 742 F.2d 1245, 1254 (10th Cir. 1984). This \"effective buffer between the faculty and top management\" also proved to be important in assessing the level of authority in St. Thomas Univ ., 298 NLRB 280 (1990). The authority and membership of decision- making bodies should also be considered in great detail. Formerly, in \"mature universities\" like Yeshiva , such committees held consider able sway. In today's \"big business\" university, this may not be the case. If faculty members do not comprise a majority of the group, \"control\" over any policies made by the group cannot fairly be considered probative of faculty managerial status. In addition, it is important to consider whether the administration has the power to reorganize or dissolve such committees, to set their agendas, see Kendall Sch. of Design, 279 NLRB 281 (1986) , or prevent them from meeting \u2014and whether it has exercised this p ower, either directly or indirectly by reorganizing committees' parent departments , see Cooper Union of Science & Art , 273 NLRB 1768, 1770 (1985) ( holding that faculty members were employees where t rustees restructured academic organization over strong fac ulty opposition), enforced , 783 F.2d 29 (2nd Cir. 1986) . Finally, if important decisions that would ordinarily fall within the committee's jurisd iction are decided by the administration before the committee is consulted or entirely outside of the committe e system, this would be a strong indicator that the committees are \"merely advisory,\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. 672, 683 n.17, non- managerial. See St. Thomas Univ., 298 NLRB 280 (1990) (holding that faculty were not managerial where a faculty committee w as established to make recommendations on academic matters, but its recommendations were seldom implemented, and the administration often made academic policy on its own without consulting the committee). A related consideration is whether it is the opini on of the faulty or the administration that tends to prevail in the event of a conflict. In the absence of conflict, it is likely that the administration will rely on the informed recommendations of professional educators. If the 33 administration acts contrary to this advice when issues that are most significant to the academic interests of the school arise, it may be that it sees faculty power as a privilege that it can choose to deny. See, e.g., Kendall Sch. of Design, 279 NLRB 281, 293 (1986) (\"Where fa culty views are known to conflict with the Administration 's, it is the latter's views which predominates. \"). This factor is not limited to decisions directly concerning academics. Contrary to the assertions of the American Council of Education and other s in their amicus brief, structural changes should not be divorced from an analysis of faculty control. As explained above, t here may be numerous academic consequences to such decisions, especially where academic departments are restructured, as in the in stant case. The level of faculty control over the growth of the administration and the appointment of key administrative heads \u2014such as president s, vice - presidents, provosts, dean s, and department chairs \u2014is relevant for similar reasons. Particular attention should be paid to these factors where they result in a change in faculty power vis -\u00e0-vis the administration. Finally, in every case, the Board should also consider the dynamic nature of university governance. This includes an inquiry into how the facult y obtained whatever power it possesses, as well as whether, why, and to what extent that power has changed. There may be cases where universities that had small administrations and large and influential faculties at one time, but have since changed dramati cally. III. Given the Existing Inconsistencies in Board Law, Decisions t hat h ave Strayed from the Principles of Yeshiva Ought to be Overruled. The Court of Appeals remanded this case to the Board because the university made \"a significant showing that an alogous cases have been decided differently\" and the Board did not rebut that showing to the Court's satisfaction. Point Park Univ. v. NLRB , 457 F.3d 42, 49 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Given the inconsistencies between Board decisions to date as explained supra, t his 34 problem is likely to recur even if NEA's recommended analysis \u2014or any other analysis that comports with Yeshiva \u2014is applied. Accordingly, it is essential that the Board overrule decisions that directly conflict with the limited application of the manage rial exception articulated in Yeshiva . Most notably, i n Dubuque , 289 NLRB 349, the faculty exercised partial control in less than half of the areas mentioned in Yeshiva , and were generally in the minority on policymaking committees. In Lewis and Clark College , 300 NLRB 155 (1990), the Board assigned managerial status to the faculty in spite of its observation that the administration had unilaterally created \"umbrella committees\" within the institution's governance structure. These committees implemented new programs into the curriculum over faculty objection. And in Livingstone College, 286 NLRB 1308 (1987), faculty members were excluded on the basis of managerial status due to their influence in academic matters, even though they possessed no authority in non-academic matters. While non- academic matters may not always command the same importance as purely academic matters in some settings, as this case demonstrates, non -academic matters can and should be highly significant, particularly where an institu tion engages in restructuring that affects the delivery of educational services . Those decisions quite simply cannot be squared with a proper understanding of the Court's holding in Yeshiva , and indeed cannot be squared with many of the Board's own precedents. See St. Thomas Univ., 298 NLRB 280 (1990) ; University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB 83, 83 (1997) ; Cooper Union of Science & Art , 273 NLRB 1768, 1773 (1985) , Florida Mem'l Coll ege, 263 NLRB 1248 (1982). Accordingly, t he Dubuque , Lewis and Clark College , and Livingstone Coll ege decisions are due to be overruled. 35 CONCLUSION NEA hopes that this amicus brief proves helpful to the Board's deliberations in this case and respectfully requests that it adopt the recommendations herein.

Its purpose is to advance academic freedom and shared universit y governance, define fundamental professional values and standards for higher education, and ensure higher education's contribution to the common good. AAUP's policies have been reco gnized by the Supreme Court and are widely respected and followed in Ameri can colleges and universities. See, e.g., Bd. of Regents v. Roth , 408 U.S. 564, 579 n. 17 (1972); Tilton v. Richardson , 403 U.S. 672, 681-82 (1971). In cases that implicate AAUP policies or otherwise raise legal i ssues important to higher education or faculty members, AAUP frequently submits amicus briefs in the Supreme Court, the federal circuits, and the National Labor Relations Board. See, e.g., Grutter v. Bollinger , 539 U.S. , 474 U.S. 214 (1985); NLRB v. Yeshiva University, 672 (1980); of , Urofsky v. Gilmore , 216 F.3d 401 (4th Cir. cert. denied 531 U.S. 1070 (2001); Columbia Union Coll. v. Oliver , 254 F.3d 496 (4th Cir. 1999); Smith v. Virginia Commonwealth Univ. , 84 F.3d 672 (4th Cir. 1995); Brown University, 342 NLRB 483 (2004); and New York University, 332 NLRB 1205 (2000). By participating as an amicus in this case, AAUP seeks to assist the National Labor Relations Board in developing the legal definition of empl oyee status in a manner that accurately reflects employment relationships in unive rsities and colleges and that resp ects the rights of college and university employees to exercise their rights to organi ze and engage in coll ective bargaining. 3 STATEMENT OF FACTS This case is before the National Labor Rela tions Board for decision following remand by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for clarification of the reasons for the Board's conclusion that the Po int Park University faculty members are not managerial employees. Point Park University v. NLRB , 457 F.3d 42 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Following the court's remand, the Regional Direct or issued a Supplemental Decision on Remand finding that the Point Park University faculty me mbers are not excluded managerial employees. On November 28, 2007, the NLRB granted the Empl oyer's request for review of the Regional Director's Supplemental Decision. On May 22, 2012, the NLRB issued a Notice and Invitation to File Briefs, inviting the parties and amici to \"address the court's instruct ion that the Board expl ain the weight of the various factors identified by the Supreme Court in Yeshiva and their application to this case.\" Point Park University, 2012 NLRB LEXIS 292 (May 22, 2012). In its Notice, the Board instructed that the briefs should address some or all of eight listed questions. 4 ARGUMENT I. Introduction This amicus brief responds to Questions 3, 4, and 7 listed in the NLRB's Notice and Invitation to File Briefs. These questions were chosen as being particularly relevant to addressing the changes in the university cont ext since the Supreme Court's decision in NLRB v. Yeshiva University, 444 U.S. 672 (1980). Section II of the brief, responding to Questions 3 and 4, enumerates additional factors relevant to dete rmining whether a party has met its burden of proving that faculty are managerial employees. Section III of the brief, responding to Question 7, provides a detailed analysis of the reasons for adding the factors enumerated in the response to Questions 3 and 4. II. Response to Questions 3 and 4: Question 3: Are the factors identified in the Board case law to date sufficient to correctly determine whethe r faculty are managerial? Question 4: If the factors are not sufficient, what additional factors would aid the Board in making a determination of ma nagerial status for faculty? The determination of whethe r faculty members are managerial employees should be considered in the current context of universities in the United States, which includes major changes in university structure and authority. 1 During the three decades since NLRB v. Yeshiva University, 444 U.S. 672 (1980), was decided, the cont ext in universities has changed in 1 The term \"university\" is used in this brief to refer to colleges and universities. At certain points in the brief, the term \"college\" refers to colleges or schools, such as the college of arts and sciences, within a university. 5 fundamental ways. Rather than relying on facu lty expertise and recommendations, universities have increasingly relied on e xpanded administrations to make unilateral decisions, often influenced by considerations of revenue gene ration. Administrators have become more top- down in managing the university, which underm ines faculty effective recommendation and control over academic matters. Increasingly, un iversity administrations ignore or override written university policies and faculty handbooks that set forth a shared governance model recognizing faculty authority on matters of acad emic concern. A pattern has emerged of university administrators making unilateral deci sions, without approval of faculty governance bodies, on matters central to academic work, including: developing curriculum; creating, restructuring, or discontinuing academic progr ams; changing academic degree requirements; changing grades and grading systems; subcont racting out the work of existing academic programs; and procedures for f aculty hiring and retention. These significant changes shoul d be considered as factor s relevant to determining whether faculty are Section 2(12) professional em ployees with Section 7 rights or whether they are managerial employees excluded from the pr otections of the NLRA. Taking account of the changed context calls for consideration of th e following additional factors in determining whether a party has met its burden of proving that faculty are managerial employees: the extent of university ad ministration hierarchy; the extent to which the administration ma kes academic decisions based on revenue generation or other market -based considerations; the degree of consultation by the administ ration with faculty committees or other faculty governance bodies over acad emic and nonacademic matters; 6 whether the administration treats faculty r ecommendations as advisory rather than as effective recommendations; whether the administration r outinely approves nearly all faculty recommendations without independent ad ministrative review; whether conflict between the administrati on and the faculty reflects a lack of alignment of administration and faculty interests. The response to Question 7, below, provides su pport for the addition of these factors in the managerial employee determination. This di scussion includes a description and analysis of changes in management structures that have expanded university administrations, increased top- down decision-making by the administration, and encouraged choices about academic matters based on external market forces. As discusse d below, these changes in the dist ribution and exercise of authority in the uni versity reveal a changed relati onship between the administration and the faculty, one in which th eir interests ar e not aligned. III. Response to Question 7: Question 7: Have there been developments in models of decision making in private universities since the issuance of Yeshiva that are relevant to the factors the Board should consider in making a determination of faculty managerial status? If so, what are those developments and how should they influence the Board's analysis? A. Overview of nationwide trends that h ave changed the context of the university. In Yeshiva , the Supreme Court applied the Bell Aerospace definition of managerial employees as those who \"formulated and eff ectuated management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer.\" Yeshiva University, 444 U.S. at 682, quoting 7 NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co ., 416 U.S. 267, 288 (1974). The Yeshiva Court further developed this standard by explaining that managerial em ployees \"exercise discretion within, or even independently of, established employer policy an d [are] aligned with management...by taking or recommending discretionary actions that effectively control or implement employer policy.\" 444 U.S. at 683. The Yeshiva Court recognized that this analysis of faculty employment status is a dynamic process, stating that th e factors the Court relied on provi de \"a starting point only, and that other factors not present here may enter into the analysis in other contexts.\" 444 U.S. at 690, n. 31. During the three decades since Yeshiva was decided, the contex t of the university has changed in fundamental ways, with major alterations in the structure and pr actices of universities across the United States. As the context ch anges, so should the evaluation of faculty employment status under the NLRA.2 The significant changes in the university structure and management model should be considered as factor s relevant to determining whether faculty are Section 2(12) professional employees with Sec tion 7 rights or whether they are managerial employees excluded from the protections of the NLRA. As the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals stated in Point Park University v. NLRB , 457 F.3d 42, 48 (D.C. Cir. 2006), in determining whether faculty are managerial employees: [C]ontext is everything. Every academic in stitution is different, and...the Board must perform an exacting analysis of the particul ar institution and faculty at issue. That analysis must look beyond self-serving descript ions of the role of the faculty or the 2 The AAUP continues to adhere to its long-standing position that facu lty engage in shared governance as part of their non-managerial responsibilities as prof essional employees under Section 2(12) of the NLRA. As argued in this amicus brief, however, under the standards developed by the Supreme Court in Yeshiva , within the changed context of current universities most faculty should be determined to be non- managerial professional employees covered by the NLRA. 8 administration of a university. In Yeshiva , the Court looked repeatedly to the actual role of faculty in the academic affairs of the unive rsity.... The key inquiry is \"how a faculty is structured and operates.\" Nationwide patterns since 1980 show that the context has transformed through universities' increasing use of a corporate business model that goes well beyond Justice Brennan's observation in Yeshiva that universities have become \"big business.\" 444 U.S. at 703. As Andrew Meyer, the chairman of Suffolk Univer sity's Board of Trustees has stated, \"Suffolk has gone through a transition. This is a new chapte r in the history of the university. We need people who understand that runni ng an institution of higher e ducation today means running a business.\" 3 While the extent to which particular uni versities embrace a co rporate business model will vary, the influence of the model has increased the likelihood that university administrations adopt and implement corporate management practices . Various reasons have been identified to explain the influence of the corporate business model, including \"competition for students and research dollars and resulting pressures on universiti es to 'market' themselves; increasing costs, overall, of operating the university; rising costs of research in the sciences and engineering; the growing media use of competitive rankings in U.S. News & World Report and other outlets as indicators of presumed educational quality; a nd the privatization of public functions, with a 3 Mary Carmichael, \"New guiding hands at Suffolk : School set to add 12 trustees with business focus,\" Boston.com (Oct. 4, 2011), available at http://articles.boston.com/ 2011-10-04/news/ 30243289_1_board- members-higher-education-pappas-consulting-group 9 decrease in public f unding to universities.\"4 It is striking how wide spread and similar the structural changes are in universities nationwide.5 The application of a corporate model of management has resu lted in significant changes in university institutional stru cture and distribution of author ity. There has been a major expansion of the administrative hierarchy, whic h exercises greater unilateral authority over academic affairs. This organizational structure stands in stark contrast to the Yeshiva majority's description of the university as a collegial institution primarily driven by the internal decision- making authority of its faculty. Further, uni versity administrators increasingly are making decisions in response to external market concerns, rather than consulting with, relying on, or following faculty recommendations. Thus, univers ity decision-making is increasingly made unilaterally by high-level administra tors who are driven by external market factors in setting and implementing policy on such issues as program development or discontinuance, student admissions, tuition hikes, and university-industry re lationships. As a result, the faculty have experienced a continually shrinking scope of influence over academic matters. 4 Faculty Senate Committee to Review Faculty Governance: Final Report and Recommendations 6 (March 7, 2007), available at http://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/pdfs/GOVERNANCE372007.pdf 5 These national trends have been described and anal yzed by many commentators in articles, books, and studies of the current university structure. See, e.g., Ellen Schrecker, T HE LOST SOUL OF HIGHER EDUCATION : CORPORATIZATION , THE ASSAULT ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM , AND THE END OF THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY (New York: New Press 2010); Gaye Tuchman, WANNABE U: INSIDE THE CORPORATE UNIVERSITY (University of Chicago Press 2009); Jennifer Washburn, U NIVERSITY INC.: THE CORRUPTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION (New York: Basic Books 2005); Sheila Slaughter and Larry L. Leslie, A CADEMIC CAPITALISM : POLITICS , POLICIES , AND THE ENTREPRENEURIAL UNIVERSITY (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 1998); Risa L. Lieberwitz, Faculty in the Corporate University: Professional Identity, Law and Collective Action, 16 C ORNELL J. L. & PUB. POL'Y 263 (2007); Joan Wallach Scott, The Critical State of Shared Governance , available at http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2002/JA/Feat/Scot.htm 10 The Yeshiva Court limited the scope of the mana gerial exception, st ating, \"It is plain...that professors may not be excluded [a s managerial employees] merely because they determine the content of their ow n courses, evaluate their own st udents, and supervise their own research.\" 444 U.S. at 690 n. 31. In today's universities, wh ile faculty may have effective control over their own courses and research, their sphere of infl uence on other academic matters has been eroded through the administration's appli cation of the goals and ma nagerial practices of the corporate business model. Moreover, faculty loss of influence over programmatic and other academic matters reduces faculty influence even in their individual academic course content and research. The scope of the managerial exception as applied in universitie s should be narrowed to reflect the scope of actual au thority in practice. As th e Sixth Circuit, interpreting Yeshiva, stated, \"[T]he [managerial] exception must be narrowl y construed to avoid c onflict with the broad language of the Act, which covers 'any empl oyee,' including professional employees.\" Kendall Memorial School v. NLRB, 866 F.2d 157, 160 (6th Cir. 1989). The party asserting managerial status must carry the burden of proving that faculty fall within th is narrow manageri al exception. This is essential to protect the rights of faculty in universities, as overly broad application of the managerial exception will result in the exclusion of an entire class of professional employees from the NLRA. University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB 83, 93 (1997), affd. 331 NLRB 1663 (2000), reversed on other grounds 278 F.3d 1335 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Faculty in public and private universities ha ve experienced the impact of the corporate business model and its erosion of shared governan ce. Public university faculty, however, have an effective means to respond to these changes by exercising their statut ory rights to unionize 11 and collectively bargain.6 Faculty unionization in public universities ha s led to successful collective bargaining to address terms and conditi ons of employment across a range of academic and economic issues. This experience teaches th at collective bargaining by faculty unions has not resulted in problems of conflicted loyalties. Rather facu lty unions and administrations have engaged in collective bargaining as a constructiv e means to address their different positions about terms and conditions of employment.7 Within the current context of private universities, the interpretation of faculty employee status shou ld be informed by the long-term experience of successful collective bargaining relati onships in public universities. This is consistent with the Yeshiva majority's clarification that \"[w]e certainly are not sugge sting an application of the managerial exclusion that woul d sweep all professionals outside the Act in derogation of Congress' expressed intent to protect them.\" 444 U.S. at 690. Protecting faculty rights as professional employees requires a full consideration of social and institutional changes since Yeshiva was decided. Most importantly, the influence of the co rporate business model has resulted in fundamental changes in power and authority in the university that are not fleeting or ephemeral. They are embedded structural changes that favor top-down decision-making authority by 6 See, Richard Hurd & Amy Foerster, 23 Director y of Faculty Contracts and Bargaining Agents In Institutions of Higher Education 135 (1997) (listing thirty-four states with public sector collective bargaining legislation covering higher education faculty , including one state without legislation but with collective bargaining permitted by State Governing Board policy. 7 See the following chapters in A CADEMIC COLLECTIVE BARGAINING (Ernst Benjamin and Michael Mauer, eds. 2006): Ernst Benjamin, Introduction (pp. 9-20); Ernst Benjamin, Faculty Bargaining (pp. 23-51); Martin J.

One outcome of this institutional shift is a growing conflict between university ad ministrations and faculty over unilateral actions taken by administrators either without consultati on with faculty or over riding faculty governance bodies' recommendations. Thus, contrary to the circumstances informing the Court's conclusion in Yeshiva, the faculty's interests in many universities to day are not aligned with the interests of the administration. These changed circumstances should be assessed as f actors relevant to the fact-based inquiry in evaluati ng whether the employer has met its burden of proving that faculty are managerial employees. The consequences and outcomes of the use of the corporate business model in the university are detailed below, reve aling the specific patterns of the changes, the widespread impact on universities nationwide, and the corrosiv e effect on faculty influence in the university. B. Universities' increasing use of a co rporate business model and the significant expansion of university administration h ave eroded faculty effective control and effective recommendations ov er academic affairs. 1. In the three decades since the Yeshiva decision, the university context has changed through the expanded the size and power of university administration. The influence of the corporate business model on universities has led to a major expansion of university administration, accomp anied by the increased top-down authority exercised by high-level administrators. Betw een the years of 1976 and 2009, the number of full- 13 time executives and managers grew by 129 percent, while full-time faculty grew by 68 percent.8 Breaking this down by sector is even more re vealing. From 1976 to 2009, the number of full- time executives and managers at private colleges and universities increased by 200 percent, more than double the 83 percent rate of growth at public colleges and universities.9 These positions include a proliferation of executive-level administ rators in university admi nistration. In addition to the Provost, academic affairs are governed by Vice Provosts, Associate Provosts, and Vice Presidents. It is important to emphasize that this expansion of admini stration has occurred not simply in public university systems featuring mu ltiple campuses throughout the state, but also, as noted above, in private universities with a singl e campus location. For example, at Stanford University, in addition to the President and Pr ovost, there are three Vice Provosts, eight Vice Presidents, and eight Deans.10 At Cornell University, in addi tion to the President and Provost, there are three Senior Vice Provosts (one who is also a Vice President and another who is also a Dean), four Vice Provosts (one who is also a Dean), two Vice Presidents, the Head of the University Library, and twelve Deans .11 At MIT, there is a President, Chancellor, Provost, four Associate Provosts, an Executive Vice-President and Treasurer, six Vice Presidents, and eight 8 Data compiled by John W.

Along with the increase of high-level admini strators, the administrative apparatus has expanded. From 1976 to 2009, the number of full-time non-faculty professional positions increased by 345 percent overall, with growth of 499 percent in that category at private institutions.13 Between the years of 1947 to 1995, while overall university spending increased by 148 percent, administrative spendi ng increased by 235 percent, as compared with instructional spending increases at only 128 percent.14 A 2010 study reported that in the period 1998 to 2008, U.S. private colleges increased spending on admi nistration and staff support by 36 percent, but increased spending on inst ruction by only 22 percent.15 It is noteworthy that during these years, as expenditure on instruction has gone down, the percentage of lower-wage nontenure-track faculty has increased significantly. Between 1976 and 2009, the number of part-time faculty positions has grown by more than 256 percent overall, with the rate of growth in private colleges and universities at 331 percent.16 Currently, nearly 40 percent of full-time faculty positions and 70 percent of all faculty positions in post- secondary institutions are nontenure-track.17 The 12 MIT Organization Chart, available at http://orgchart.mit.edu/ 13 Curtis, supra notes 8 and 9. 14 Benjamin Ginsberg, T HE FALL OF THE FACULTY : THE RISE OF THE ALL-ADMINISTRATIVE UNIVERSITY AND WHY IT MATTERS 33 (Oxford University Press 2011) (citing as the source for the data: Calculated from National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) , Digest of Education Statistics, 2006, Table 346). 15 Id. at 27, citing, Sam Dillon, \"Share of College B udgets for Recreation is Rising,\" New York Times, July 10, 2010, A13 (describing the Delta Cost Project). 16 Curtis, supra notes 8 and 9. 17 Ernst Benjamin, The Eroding Foundations of Academic Freedom and Professional Integrity: Implications of the Diminishing Proportion of Tenured Faculty for Organizational Effectiveness in Higher Education, 1 AAUP JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM , at 4 (2010), available at http://www.academicfreedomjournal.org/Previous/VolumeOne/Benjamin.pdf ; The Coalition for the Academic Workforce (CAW) reports that as of 2009, \"when graduate student teaching assistants are Continued 15 reduction of tenure-track positions along with the expansion of nontenure-track positions further dilutes the effectiveness of faculty governance. The vast majo rity of nontenure-track faculty are not included as full participants in faculty governance bodies.18 Further, nontenure-track faculty are in precarious positions without the job secu rity of tenure, making it difficult for them to meaningfully assert rights of academic freedom.19 The proliferation of high-level administrators and their professional staff has multiple effects. First, the growth of administration ex pands the hierarchical nature of decision-making, concentrating power at the top level of the cen tral university administration and the college administrations. This upward movement of po wer to the administrativ e hierarchy, in turn, undermines the \"shared governance\" model of co llegial decision-making by funneling authority away from the faculty influence over academic matters.20 Shared governance is also eroded by administrators taking unilateral actions without consu ltation with faculty governance bodies such included, [contingent employees constitute] more than three-quarters of the instructional workforce.\" Coalition for the Academic Workforce, A Portrait of Part-Time Facu lty Members: A Summary of Findings on Part-Time Faculty Respondents to th e Coalition on the Academic Workforce Survey of Contingent Faculty Members and Instructors (2012), at 5, citing, Laura G.

As the Regional Director observed in Point Park University , the restructuring involved in making the transition from College to University expanded the administration and created a \"buffer\" between academic policy decision-making and the faculty. Case 6-RC-12276, Regional Director's Supplemental Deci sion on Remand (July 10, 2007), at 10. The administration made unilateral decisions about academic matters, including creating and discontinuing academic programs. As a result, faculty influence over decisions about academic policy and programs has been diminished, often placing the faculty in the position of merely being notified of decisions unilaterally reached by the administration. Fu rther, these unilateral decisions about academic programs have a direct impact on faculty control over their courses and curriculum, as top-down administrative changes in academic programs force faculty to alter their course offerings to fit the new shape of academic programs. The growth in university administration, which creates a \"buffer\", can also be described as an increased stratification in the university employment structure. The proliferation of administrators at high levels of the university hierarchy has solidified a class of long-term university administrators who could be called \"manag erial professionals,\" in contrast to the rest of the faculty, who remain \"practicin g professionals.\" David M. Rabban, Distinguishing Excluded Managers From Covered Professionals Under the NLRA, 89 Colum. L. Rev. 1775, 1834 (1989). These \"managerial professionals\" in the administration \"have positions of bureaucratic power within [the university's] formal hierarchy,\" while the faculty as \"practicing professionals\" do not. Id. Although many of the individu als holding these bureaucratic managerial positions were originally in facu lty positions, their entry into the central administration removes them from the normal pr ofessional faculty activities of teaching and 17 research. This separation from the classroom a nd research may be for a period of years or even as a permanent shift into the uni versity administration and an upw ardly mobile career path in administration at other universities.21 Most importantly in this increased stratif ication, the growing number of \"managerial professionals\" in the administration have b een given enhanced authority and power over academic matters in a way that erodes effectiv e recommendations or control by the \"practicing professionals\" in the faculty. While \"manager ial professionals\" would be excluded from the NLRA as managerial employees, faculty \"pract icing professionals\" should be protected as professional employees under Section 2(12). Fu rther, \"[e]xcluding [only the] managerial professionals would reflect the key concern about divided loyalties that generated the unwillingness to allow protected bargaining by managers and supervisors.\" Rabban, supra , at 1855. As the Tenth Circuit explained, \"The availabi lity of this expertise w ithin the ranks of the administration obviates the College's need to rely extensively on the profe ssional judgment of its faculty in determining and implementing academ ic policy. Under these circumstances while significant faculty input undoubtedly remains benefici al to the College, it is not necessary that the faculty be 'aligned with management'... [and] presents no problem of divided loyalty equivalent to that found in Yeshiva. \" Loretto Heights College v. NLRB , 742 Cir. 1984); St. Thomas University , 298 NLRB 280, 287 (1990). This growing separation of power and functions of admi nistrators and faculty has important implications for faculty employee status under the NLRA. As uni versity restructuring shifts power and authority, the legal principles of employee status, defined in Yeshiva , must be 21 Tuchman, supra note 5, at 69-82. 18 applied to the evidence that accurately demonstrates \"authority in practice.\" University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB at 93; St. Thomas University , 280 (1990); Bradford College , 261 NLRB 565 (1982). While the extent of changes may differ from one university to another, the nationwide patterns show that the context has changed as universities have expanded the size of administrations and their unilateral authority ove r academic affairs. These circumstances should be assessed as part of the f act-based evaluation of whether th e employer has met its burden of proving that faculty are ma nagerial employees. 2. The expanded size and authority of university administration has decreased faculty authority to effect ively control or make effective recommendations about academic affairs. In applying Yeshiva, the NLRB has emphasized that \"ne ither the Board nor the Court requires that a faculty possess absolu te or plenary authority in orde r to be found to be managerial; the standard set forth in the Court's decision is ' effective recommendation or control.'\" Lewis and Clark College , 300 NLRB 155, 163 n. 41 (1990). \"Effec tive recommendation authority is found where nearly all recommendations are routin ely approved by the ad ministrative hierarchy, without independent review.\" University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB at 93. Further, \"the presence of a large administrative staff...cr eate[s] an effective buffer between the top management and the lowest echelon, eliminating th e need for the institution's administration to rely on the faculty for advice, recommendations , and the establishment and implementation of policies.\" University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB 1245, 1254 (10th Cir. 1984). As the statisti cs show, university administrations have continued to expand and provide a multi-lay ered buffer between the top managerial administrators and the faculty. In this context, it is crucial to require the university to go beyond 19 conclusory assertions that the faculty are managerial because they may make recommendations to the administration on academic affairs. Rather the university must demonstrate that \"nearly all [faculty] recommendations are routinely appr oved by the administrative hierarchy, without independent review.\" University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB at 93. In today's universities, the expanded scope and authority of bureaucratic \"managerial professionals\" in university administrations have reduced faculty participation to an advisory capacity in many instances. In Manhattan College , Case 2-RC-21735, 1999 NLRB LEXIS 903, n.21 (Nov. the Regional Dir ector observed that \"the Yeshiva Court specifically noted that the Board failed to advance the argument that the role of the faculty was merely advisory, and thus not managerial.\" Further, the Yeshiva Court \"distinguished between situations where faculty authority is advisory and where faculty effectively recommends action, notwithstanding the administration's rarely exercised veto power.\" Manhattan College , at n.21, discussing Yeshiva University, 444 U.S. at 684, n. 17. In Manhattan College , the Regional Director relied on this distinction to find that the faculty wa s not managerial, based on the evidence that although \"the Manhattan College facu lty have a substantial role in the development of policy in academic and other spheres...this role is fundame ntally advisory in nature.\" 1999 NLRB LEXIS 903, at 22 A three-member panel of the NLRB denied Manhatta n College's appeal of the Regional Director's decision, finding that the appeal \"raises no substan tial issues warranting review.\" Courtney Leatherman, NLRB Lets Stand a Decision Allowing Professors at a Private College to Unionize, CHRON . HIGHER EDUC., Jul. 7, 2000, at A14. 20 (a) Increasing university administ rative authority over academic matters. University administrations increasingly make unilateral decisions a bout academic matters, either by excluding faculty from the deci sion-making process or by treating faculty recommendations as merely advisory, particularly when they disagree with the administration's position. As the Regional Director stated in Point Park University , based on Yeshiva and its progeny, he \"considered authority over academic matters to be the most critical to the determination of managerial status.\" Ca se 6-RC-12276, Regional Director's Supplemental Decision on Remand (July 10, 2007), at 57. Faculty authority over academic matters, as Yeshiva recognized, refers to far more than the course content and research of a particular faculty member. Rather, the scope of academic ma tters includes the creation, alteration, and discontinuance of academic programs, given the im pact of such decisions on the curricular and course content that make up the academic program. The Board has held that faculty were non- managerial based on the administration's actions of unilaterally creating and discontinuing academic pr ograms without faculty approval or over faculty opposition.

In St. Thomas University , the Board found that faculty were not managerial based in part on the administration's practice of submitting faculty proposals on curriculum or academic policy for 21 independent approval by a committee of the dean and five division chairpersons, which often ignored or overrode the faculty. 298 NLRB at 287. In Point Park University , the administration's conduct es tablished a pattern of making unilateral decisions concer ning academic programs, including: discontinuing some undergraduate programs; approving a new underg raduate program; dismantling an academic department; restructuring a graduate program; cr eating a new institute with an existing academic department; subcontracting out the work of an existing academic program; changing requirements for two academic programs in the Education department; designing and designating a new required course for university freshmen; developing policies for on-line courses; and developing new requirements for sp ecial delivery courses, indepe ndent studies, and faculty-led trips abroad.

The Regional Director described the ad ministration's failure to respect th e Point Park University faculty's recommendation authority: \"Abandoning th e program obviously includes abandoning the courses which made up that program, all of which courses should have been previously reviewed and recommended by the Curriculum Committee and the Faculty Assembly in accordance with the process by which an undergra duate program becomes a part of the curriculum.\" Regional Director's Supplemental Decision on Remand, at 57. 23 23 Other examples of unilateral decisions on academic ma tters include actions by the administrations at Yale University, George Mason University, Be nnington College, and University of Dubuque: At Yale University, \"[s]ince January [2012], faculty dissatisfaction over a number of issues has coalesced into a semi-organized movement calling for a larger ro le for faculty in the governance of the university.\" The issues concern faculty reservations about the Ya le-National University of Singapore new joint venture; the university's shared-services plan, whic h centralizes some business and financial functions; and a Graduate School dean's report, which encouraged \"best practices\" that many faculty Continued 22 In addition to administrators' unilateral actions concerning the creation, content, and discontinuance of academic programs, administra tors have made unilateral changes in other types of academic affairs. In Point Park University , the Regional Director found that the administration unilaterally changed student ad mission standards in two academic programs; created a new grading system to be used as a pilot program; changed grades the faculty had assigned; imposed syllabus requirements; a nd decreased bonuses to faculty who, in the administration's view, gave too many grades of \"A\".

In 1999, the University of Dubuque terminated the tenured appointments of two professors based on the administration's assertion of a financial exigency. Ho wever, the board of trustees and administration did not consult with faculty governance bodies prior to de veloping a plan that determined that there was a financial exigency and that academic programs woul d be discontinued and faculty terminated; did not provide a meaningful faculty role in the decisions to discharge the two professors; and did not provide the professors with academic due process hearings.

As Yeshiva recognized, \"It is plain...that pr ofessors may not be excluded [as managerial employees] merely because they determ ine the content of their own courses, evaluate their own students, and supervise their own research.\" 444 U.S. at 690 n. 31. Yet, at Point Park and other universities, administrators' unilateral actions have eroded faculty authority even in realms that the Yeshiva Court considered non-mana gerial professional work. In some cases, a university administration' s unilateral actions have violated the university's own policies or regul ations providing for faculty governance rights. At Adelphi University, university governance documents provide faculty with broad ri ghts to participate in university matters. Yet, duri ng the 1990s, the president and board of trustees ceased communicating with the faculty through the governance process. For example, the board of trustees created a confidential academic plan, ex cluding faculty from participation in developing or commenting on it.24 Similarly, in Bradford College, the NLRB concluded the faculty were not managerial where the administration failed to follow college documents giving faculty substantial governance authority. Faculty recommendations \"were often ignored or reversed by the president, by the academic dean, or by both\" on academic matters that included \"curriculum, admission policies, graduation of students, course loads, course scheduling, [and] grading of students... .\" 261 NLRB at 566-567. These examples reinforce that the employer has the burden of proving managerial status based on authority in practice, rather than simply pointing to general descriptions of university policies. 24 Larry G. Gerber, College and University Government: Adelphi University (New York): A Special Report from Committee T , Academe, Vol. 83, No. 3 (May - Jun., 1997), pp. 69-71. 24 The Board's observation in University of Great Falls captures the problem of the administration's exercise of its authority to ove rride or ignore the recommendations of faculty governance bodies: \"[M]any of the recommendations of [the faculty status committee] are not routinely accepted but rather ar e independently reviewed and ev aluated, particularly by the provost, as they travel up the administrative hierarchy. Where the provost strongly has opposed a faculty status committee recommendation, higher administrators have approved the provost's recommendation over that of the committee.\" 325 NLRB at 96. (b) Increasing university administra tive authority over nonacademic matters. Further examples reveal the increasing use of top-down administrative authority in areas that the Board has described as \"nonacademic,\" including faculty hiring, tenure and promotion. University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB at 93; Lewis and Clark College, 300 NLRB 155, 161 (1990). Although the Yeshiva Court did not \"rely primarily\" on such nonacademic factors in determining managerial status, 444 U.S. at 686, n.23, the Board has considered them relevant, while according them \"less weight.\" University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB at 93. As the Board has noted , \"while curriculum is a key academic matter, in no case have faculty been held managerial solely because of their particip ation in recommending curricular matters.\" University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB at 96. In finding the Bradford College faculty to be non-managerial, the Board relied, in part, on the administrati on's responses ignoring or reversing faculty recommendations on nonacademic matters of \"faculty hiring or retention, tuition, and faculty salaries.\" Bradford College, 261 NLRB at 566-567. At Adelphi University, despite university governance provisions giving faculty the right to participate in the selection of academic 25 administrative officers, the university president excluded faculty from giving any input in many of his major appointments, including provosts and deans.25 At Bennington College, in 1994, the board of trustees and the presid ent unilaterally decided on and impl emented a plan to abolish its \"presumptive tenure\" system under which facult y had been reviewed every five years, substituting one to five y ear individual contracts.26 The administration instituted this change by dismissing one-third of its faculty, eliminated many of the faculty governing bodies, and changed standards for hiring and retention.27 At Clark Atlanta Universit y, the administration unilaterally discharged one-fourth of its facu lty, stating that it was on the basi s of an \"enrollment emergency.\" The administration took this action, however, w ithout consulting with the faculty, without substantiating the asserted \"emergency,\" and w ithout following due process provisions of the university's own regulations.28 In Point Park University , the Regional Director conclude d that \"just as with academic matters, the faculty herein do not effectivel y recommend or control nonacademic matters,\" finding that the administration failed to follow the procedures outlined in the Faculty Handbook, including hiring some faculty members withou t a search committee.

Other university administrations have also emphasized that their managerial authority supersedes the Faculty Handbook. For example, a lthough the preface to th e Cornell University Faculty Handbook states that the Handbook is issued by the Office of the University Faculty, the following caveat is also included: \"STATEMENT FROM UNIVERSITY COUNSEL: This handbook describes various Cornell University policies and procedures of interest to the University Faculty. The handbook, however, is not intended to create a contract between the university and its employees or to set fo rth terms or conditions of employment.\"29 (c) Increasing conflict between administration and faculty. The use of a corporate business model of top-down management and the corresponding erosion of the shared governance model has led to increased conflict between university administrations and faculty. Faculty governan ce bodies, including committees, senates, and councils, have protested administ rative failures to consult with them or administrative decisions overriding faculty governance recommendations. For example, a Cornell University faculty senate committee report in 2007 recounts a series of administration de cisions made without adequate consultation with the faculty senate , including the creation of a new faculty of computing and information science, the reorganiza tion of the division of biological sciences, and 29 Faculty Handbook 2010 (Ei ghth Edition), available at http://theuniversityfaculty.corne ll.edu/handbook/handbook_main.html 27 the creation of a for-profit di stance learning corporation.30 At Bennington College, the Bennington Academic Freedom Committee and the AAUP engaged in activities to protest the administration's unilateral actions in 1994 to abolish its \"presumptive tenure\" system.31 At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in 2006, the Board of Trustees ordered the Faculty Senate to revoke its amendment to expand Senate membership to include clinical faculty. Following the Rensselaer President's rejection of the Senate's request to convene a joint committee to resolve the issue, the Provost unila terally suspended the Faculty Senate for failing to comply with the Board of Trustees' order. This action led to an extended peri od of conflict, during which the administration took control from the Senate of the election process for faculty committees (including the curriculum committee) and for the responsibility over the c ontents of the Faculty Handbook.32 In NLRB v. The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, 783 F.2d 29, 32 (2d Cir. 1986), the Second Circuit considered \"faculty-adm inistration conflict arising out of the [administration's] unilateral changes\" in conc luding that the faculty was not \"aligned with management\" and thus, not managerial.

Faculty perceptions reflect th e conflict between the cor porate business model and the shared governance model. The results from a 2007 international survey reveal that most U.S. faculty perceive that they have little influence over key academic policies at the level of their college and in the central university administra tion. Seventy-three percent of faculty responded that they are very or somewhat influential in helping to shape key acad emic policies at their departmental level.33 That percentage drops at the school/college-level to 37 percent and even further at the university level, where 21 percen t responded that they are very or somewhat influential in shaping key academic policies.34 Sixty-four percent of facu lty agreed that \"there is a top-down management style\" in their university , while only 31 percent agreed that \"there is collegiality in decision-making processes\" and only 30 percent agreed that \"there is good communication between management and academics.\"35 Faculty sense of affiliation with their university is also droppi ng. In a comparable survey in 1992, 90 percent of facu lty responded that their affiliation with their unive rsity was important or very important, while in 2007, only 61 percent responded positively to this question.36 This contrasts with a continued high degree of a sense of affiliation of faculty with their discipline, at 96 percent in 1992 and 92 percent in 2007.37 These data support a conclusion that the shifts toward top-down management and away 33 William K. Cummings and Martin Finkelstein, Global Trends in Academic Governance, Academe Online (Nov.-Dec. 2009) (Table 3), available at http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2009/ND/Feat/Cumm.htm 34 Id. 35 Id. at Table 4. 36 Id. at Table 5. 37 Id. 29 from shared governance contribute to faculty perceptions that facu lty and administrative interests are not aligned.38 Rather faculty interests lie with thei r professional discipline, but diverge from their institutions. 3. Summary: Factors relating to expande d administration size and authority. As this discussion has demonstrated, the gr owing influence of th e corporate business model on universities has led to a major expansion of university administration, accompanied by increased top-down authority ex ercised by high-level administrators. This has resulted in institutional changes in the relationship between administration and faculty. The proliferation of administrators at high levels of the university hierarchy has solidified a class of long-term university administrators - \"managerial prof essionals\" - who have been given enhanced authority and power over academic matters in a way that erodes effective recommendations or control by the \"practicin g professionals\" in the faculty. As the administration expands, its decisions rely more heavily on th e expertise of the \"managerial professional\" administrators. Although the \"practicing professionals\" in the faculty may con tinue to have a substantial role in the development of academic policy and practice, this role has become more advisory in nature. Unilateral decision-making by the administration and the corresponding er osion of the shared governance model has led to conflict between admi nistration and faculty. These institutional shifts in power and authority should be co nsidered in the fact-based evaluation of whether the employer has met its bu rden of proving that faculty are managerial 38 Cummings and Finkelstein state: \"Academics both in the United States and around the world believe that they do not have a sufficient role in decision making, though American faculty feel less powerful in a number of respects than their colleagues in other matu re systems of higher education. Additionally, in most countries, faculty do not believe that the cu rrent decision-making processes have led to much improvement in their working conditions.\" Id. at 2. 30 employees. Additional fact ors relating to the growth of admini stration size and authority are: the extent of university administration hierarchy; the degree of co nsultation by the administration with faculty committees or other faculty governance bodies over academic and nonacademic matters; whether the administration treats faculty recommendations as advi sory rather than as effective recommendations; whether the administ ration routinely approves nearly all faculty recommendations without independent administra tive review; and whether conflict between the administration and the faculty reflec ts a lack of alignment of admini stration and faculty interests. 4. University administrations increasingly re spond to external market forces rather than faculty views and recommendations. In applying the corporate business model, university administrators have relied increasingly on external market forces to make decisions based on revenue generating potential of academic programs. This has eroded the shared governance model by shifting control and influence over academic policy and programs from the faculty to the ad ministration. In the competition for market position, university administra tors have turned to public relations firms to develop the university's \"brand\" in a way that will appeal to st udents as \"customers\" purchasing education as a product.39 This commercial image of education has been one of the bases for expanding the administration, with a multiplici ty of new \"nonacademic\" units to address administrative areas such as fina nce, student affairs, and housing.40 Yet these \"nonacademic\" units have an impact on traditional \"academic\" concerns, including issues about budgetary 39 See, Susan C. Aldridge, Strategy Matters More Than Budget in Student Recruiting, Chronicle of Higher Education (Oct. 31, 2010); Lloyd Thacker, Confronting the Commercialization of Admissions, Chronicle of Higher Education (Feb. 25, 2005). 40 See, Ginsberg, supra note 14, at 27-36; Faculty Senate Committee to Review Faculty Governance: Final Report and Recommendations 6 (March 7, 2007), available at http://theuniversityfaculty.corn ell.edu/pdfs/GOVERNANCE372007.pdf 31 priorities. As universities face continuing fina ncial pressures, administrators control the management of finances and the budget, with a marked reduction of faculty consultation or participation in setting budget polic ies that affect academic matters.41 Faculty influence decreases, as well, with the growth of th e ranks of lower paid nontenure-track faculty.42 The erosion of faculty govern ance of academic programs has occurred, in part, through changes in the various budget models that univ ersities have been a dopting. The traditional model was incremental budgeting where only new re venue is allocated. However, more and more universities are moving to models like Responsibility Center Management, which \"exemplifies the attempt to introduce business pr inciples into higher education\" by making each college within the university a profit center.43 The central administration maintains control by imposing a tax on the colleges to carry out \"strategic initiatives.\" At the same time, colleges receive most of the revenue but also ha ve all expenses, including space, police and administrative costs allocated to them. Each college receives revenues based on student credit hours and research funding. Colleges receive high er revenue for their own majors, giving them an incentive to offer as many courses as they ca n within their own colle ges. Thus, engineering schools have an incentive to teach English and mathematics as well as engineering; business 41 Joan Wallach Scott, The Critical State of Shared Governance , available at http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2002/JA/Feat/Scot.htm 42 See, Benjamin, supra note 17 (nearly 40 percent of full-time faculty positions and 70 percent of all faculty positions are nontenure-track). 43 David L. Kirp, The Corporation of Learning: Nonpro fit Higher Education Takes Lessons from Business, Research & Occasional Paper Series: CSHE.5.03, Center for Studies in Higher Education, at 4- 5 (May 2003), available at http://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/docs/ROP.Kirp.5.03.pdf Universities have also changed their reporting in financial stat ements to make them much closer to financial statements used by for-profit businesses. S ee, Mary F. Foster and James E. Shiah, FASB Changes Reporting Standards for No t-for-Profit Organizations, JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE 381, 382 (Spring 1994). 32 schools have incentives to teach writing, philoso phy, mathematics and statistics. This budgetary model encourages deans to make unilateral decisions to create, develop, or eliminate programs based on their revenue generating potential regard less of the faculty's aca demic concerns. This budgetary model also changes the communal academic culture of the university by discouraging collaboration between faculty across colleges for research and in formulating interdisciplinary programs. 44 Other budgetary decisions by university administ rations have also invaded faculty control over academic programs. The market potential in the sciences has led to budgetary priorities favoring expansion of the science disciplines as compared to the humanities. Since the enactment of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which encourages commercialization of federally funded research, there has been an expansion of university technology tran sfer offices, directed and operated by non-faculty administ rators the infrastr ucture and \"scour [university] labs\" 45 for commercially profitable discoveries.46 Between 1998 and 2003, U.S. 44 See, John D.

Such access includes corporat e representatives on panels making decisions about whether to fund faculty research propos als, a function which had traditionally been reserved for faculty peer review.49 Corporate donors also influen ce the dissemination of research results through arrangements fo r non-exclusive or exclusive lice nsing of patented academic research results. Examples include the 1982 Washington University-Monsanto agreement for $23.5 million of corporate funds over five years in exchange for exclusive licensing rights to patents resulting from biomedical research; the 1994 MIT-Amgen agreement for $30 million of corporate funding to the Department of Biol ogy and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences over a ten-year period in exchange for resulting patents to be owned jointly by MIT and Amgen;50 and a 2008 Harvard-GlaxoSmithKline five-y ear $25 million agreement for stem cell research, which will include joint projects, Gl axo first rights to non-ex clusive licensing, and a 47 Josephine Johnston, Health Related Academic Technology Transfer: Rethinking Patenting and Licensing Practices, 9 INTERNATIONAL J.

The extent to which the administration makes academic decisions based on market potentia l should be considered as a f actor in the determination of whether faculty are managerial employees. In co nsidering this factor, the fact-based inquiry should include the extent to which faculty govern ance bodies actually exercise the authority to make \"effective recommendations\" about univers ity market ventures, including university- industry agreements. As discussed above, facu lty do not make effective recommendations if they are relegated simply to an advisory capac ity, where the administration will seek, accept, or reject faculty recommendations depending on whethe r they comport with th e administration's or external industry partner's position C. An accurate assessment of faculty st atus under Section 2(12) should take into account factors related to the university' s use of the corporate business model of decision-making. Erosion of faculty influen ce and faculty governance bodies means erosion of faculty academic freedom as a term and condition of employment. Faculty rely on academic freedom as the term and condition of employment central to their ability to have autonomy and independence in their teaching and research, and in their collective influence on academic matters through governance bodies. The fundamental structural changes in the distribution of authority in the university, however , have led to established pattern s of administrators' unilateral 51 AAUP Recommended Principles & Practices to Guide Academic-Industry Relationships, supra note 46, at 191. 35 actions on academic and nonacademic matters. These structural changes have weakened academic freedom and shared governance as term s and conditions of employment that faculty can rely on as a predictable and regular part of their profession al work. Administrators have made it increasingly clear that they will consult w ith faculty when they please, fail to consult with faculty when they please, accept or reject faculty input and recommendations when they please, and even dissolve faculty governance bodies when they please. As a result, administrations increasingly make and implement unilateral decisions when they please. The faculty does not make \"effective recommendati ons\" or have \"effective control\" over many academic and nonacademic matters. These conditions show that administration and faculty interests are not aligned. Thus, the determination of whether faculty members are managerial employees should consider the changed relationship between the faculty and the administration. As discussed above, this assessment is consistent with the emphasis on context in Yeshiva and in the D.C. Circuit's decision in Point Park University . The Regional Director wi ll, of course, engage in fact-finding on a case by case basis to determin e whether the employer has met its burden of proving that faculty at a specific university ar e managerial. But the current widespread conditions of universities make it necessary to e xpand the parameters of that determination to assess whether the faculty actually exercises managerial authority. Taking account of the changed context would include consideration of the following factors in the determination of whether faculty are managerial employees: the ex tent of university admini stration hierarchy; the extent to which the administration makes academ ic decisions based on revenue generation or other market-based considerati ons; the degree of consultation by the administration with faculty 36 committees or other faculty governance bodies over academic and nonacademic matters; whether the administration treats faculty recommendations as advisory rather than as effective recommendations; whether the administrati on routinely approves nearly all faculty recommendations without independent administra tive review; and whether conflict between the administration and the faculty reflects a lack of alignment of administra tion and faculty interests. In applying these factors, the conclusion th at faculty are non-managerial professional employees should not depend on evidence of the mo st extreme loss of faculty authority over academic matters. The current cont ext in universities reveals a ra nge of situations where faculty governance has been eroded through administrative unilateral decision-making and disrespect for faculty recommendations. In enforcing the Bo ard's decision finding Loretto Heights College faculty to be non-managerial, the court noted that the faculty di d \"play a substa ntial role in College governance, participating in decision making and implementation in a wide range of areas.\" 742 F.2d at 1252. At the same time, the court concluded that \"w hile faculty members do take part in the formulation and implementati on of management policy, their role does not...rise to the level of 'effective recommendation or control'... .\" 742 F.2d at 1252. The faculty did not, therefore, meet the Yeshiva standard of \"in effect, substant 444 matters...absolute.\" 742 1255, quoting Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 686. Thus, in applying the relevant fact ors in the current university context, the Board can reasonably conclude that faculty are non-managerial professional employees across a range of cases where faculty participate actively in university affairs but do not \"substantially and pervasively operate the enterprise.\" 37 Even with an expanded range of faculty dete rmined to be non-managerial professional employees, there will still be a need to determin e whether certain positions are managerial. In addition to high-level administrators, in some cas es department chairs and program directors will be found to be managerial employees. Where the pa rties do not agree, this determination will be made, of course, through a fact -based inquiry by the Regional Director. Having made these employee status determinations, the most re levant issues will involve bargaining unit determinations, for example, whether tenure-tr ack/tenured faculty members and nontenure-track faculty should be included in a single bargaining unit. These community of interest issues will be determined, as in all cases , through the labor organization' s petition for election, followed by either agreement of the parties or a Regional Director's decision based on evidence gathered at a representation case hearing. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the AAUP respectfully urges the NLRB to expand the factors used in determining whether university faculty are managerial employees. These factors, as listed and analyzed above, would take into accoun t the current context of universities, including the major institutional changes in university structure and authority since the Yeshiva case was decided.

R ecent developments in decision-making research support the need for protecting, ra ther than limiting, the right to shared governance in the workplace, which is ofte n codified through union representation and collective bargaining. By particip ating as an amicus in this case, Dr. Hoerger seeks to assist the NLRB in understanding recent developments in models of decision making, which support a narrow interpretation of the scope of Yeshiva , NLRB v. Yeshiva University, 444 U.S. 672 (1980). 3 ARGUMENT I. Introduction Recent developments in social science research on models of decision making make clear the societal benefits of shar ed decision making (shared governance), and given the increasingly top-down stru cture of American universities, Yeshiva should be interpreted narrowly, classifying faculty employ ees as \"managers\" only where particular universities can clearly demonstrate the abse nce of a top-down hierarchy. This amicus brief responds to Question 7 listed in the NL RB's Invitation to File Briefs. The AAUP's amicus brief, dated June 29, 2012, responds to Questions 3, 4, and 7, emphasizing the rise of top-down decision making by administrativ e management at private universities. There, they request the inclusi on of \"the extent of universit y administration hierarchy\" (p. 5) when considering whether faculty ought to be classified as non-managerial professional employees. As that brief describe s, this top-down administrative structure is often driven by external market forces. Recen t developments in social science research take their argument one step further - top-down administrative decision-making structures have inherent fl aws, even when motivated by benevolence toward employees. II. Response to Question 7: Social Scien ce Research on Models of Decision Making Question 7. Have there been developm ents in models of decision making in private universities since the issuance of Yeshiva that are relevant to the factors the Board should consider in making a determination of faculty managerial status? If so, what ar e those developments and how should they influence the Board's analysis? 4 Overview In order to contextualize the changes in decision making at priv ate universities, it is important to understand more gene rally the rapid advances made since Yeshiva in social science research on models of deci sion making. This research demonstrates the inherent flaws of top-down decision making and supports the AAUP's request for the inclusion of \"the extent of university administration hierarch y\" (p. 5) when considering whether faculty may be classified as non-managerial professional employees. Sample Decisions When discussing decision-making models, it is important to consider a range of decisions individuals may desire to make. In the context of private universities, relevant decisions include choices about health insu rance plans, retireme nt plans, course scheduling, policies for admitting students, tenu re and promotion policies, and the like. As the AAUP's amicus brief makes clear, th ese and other decisi ons are increasingly being made unilaterally by administrative managers, rather than through a shared decision-making process that includes bot h the administration and non-managerial professional faculty employees. 5 Social Science Models of Decision Making Research by myself 1 and others 2 indicates that when i ndividuals face decisions, they often predict how their various options will impact their we ll-being (referred to throughout as \"well-being prediction\" 3). As an example of well-being prediction, an individual might predict whethe r they would be better off w ith Health Insurance Plan A or Health Insurance Plan B, admitting two highl y-qualified graduate students this year or 1 Hoerger, M., Quirk, S.

Individuals will differ in each of these preferences. The problem is that well-being predicti on is challenging, which leads people to make decisions that fail to optimize future well-being. 4 For example, people avoid exercise, vaccinations, and can cer screenings because they overestimate the distress evoked by these behaviors and underestimate their potential bene fits for well-being.5 Similar examples of faulty well-being pr ediction can be found in society's high divorce rate, consumer dissatisfaction with purchasi ng decisions, as well as workplace managerial policies, that even when good-intentioned, fost er employee dissatisfaction. In fact, well- being prediction goes into the architecture of decision making , decisions about what options should exist, what health insura nce plans should be made available, what retirement options should be available, what course scheduling options should be available, and the like. Because well-bei ng prediction is challe nging, these decisions warrant careful consideration. 4 Wilson, T. D., & Gilb ert, D. T. (2005). Affective fo recasting: Knowing what to want.

Health Psychology, 30 , 67-74. 7 Well-being prediction is challenging, but social science research shows that people are better off predicting their own well-being than predicting somebody else's.6 Accordingly, when it comes to well-being prediction, an indivi dual faculty member should be better than administrative manage ment at accurately predicting what that faculty member will want. The implication is that faculty employees should have a say in the decisions that affect thei r lives, have a say in the arch itecture of decision making, as even a benevolent-but-top-down administrativ e decision-making stru cture has inherent flaws - a problem that has increased within th e private university administrative structure over the past three decades. Simply put, when it comes to well-being prediction, individual faculty members have a much bett er idea than administrative management of what health plan they would prefer, or wh en they would want to hold office hours, meaning that a top-down hierarchy can inf lict unnecessary harm. In fact, well-being prediction tends to be at its best when made through a shared process, where multiple individuals can offer perspectives 7 -- the very stance argue d by the AAUP. Thus, in considering Yeshiva , faculty should be classified as non-managerial professional employees, unless an employer fulfills the burden of specifically demonstrating the absence of top-down decision making. 6 Igou, E.

Given the increasing administrative hierarchy since Yeshiva , it is recommended that faculty at private universities be classified as non-manageri al professional employees, unless specific employers can provide evidence indicating the absence of a to p-down administrative hierarchy.

Amici Amici are academics long engaged in the study and analyses of systems of work organization and employee representation. (A list is appended at the close.) They will address the issues put by the Board, particularly in questions (5) and (6), from the perspecti ve of neither \"labor\" nor \"management\" as organized int erests but as impartial scholars of industrial relations. They are uniquely qualified to bring their decades of experience and thought to bear, to assist the Board in accommodating the Labor Act to th e emerging needs of the modern workplace. Summary of Argument The Board's invitation for the submission of Amicus briefs anticipates its engagement with systems of worker involvement in the formulation and effectuation of employer policies: of whether those so engaged are exempted from the coverage of the National Labor Relation Act because they are managers, or possibly, statutory supervisors. In a post -industrial society where increasing managerial responsibilities are delegated to front -line workers and where work itself is more knowledge -driven, the roles of managers and supervisors under the law merit close consideration. The law on the s upervisory exemption is crisp: Anyone who possesses the necessary modicum of effective authority over a list of enumerated subjects is a statutory supervisor where that authority is possessed \"in the interest of the employer,\" whether or not any palpable c onflict with the duty of loyalty that person owes to the employer would be divided as a result of unionization. Congress has made that determination categorically. But the principle is subject to two corollaries. First, to act \"in the interest\" of the em ployer means that the employer has the power to hold the person accountable for the exercise of those responsibilities. If the person is not accountable -- as neither a shop steward under a collective bargaining agreement nor a 2 member of a safety committe e would be -- she or he cannot be a supervisor. Second, an employee whose performance of admittedly supervisory functions is segregable from her ordinary duties and comprises only an insubstantial amount of her time is not a supervisor: she can bargain co llectively with regard to her terms and conditions of employment for the non - supervisory portion of her job. Even if supervisory roles are shifting from a command -and- control model to a coaching -and-mentoring model in some workplaces and even if unilatera l management actions increase the coincidence of interest between front -line workers and supervisors, the plain language of the Act requires continued exclusions of supervisors from collective bargaining coverage. In sharp contrast, the law on managerial status is amorphous. A manger must be \"aligned\" with management, must \"formulate\" or \"effectuate\" managerial policy, and at a high level. To decide whether that is so , the Board must consider the employee's actual job responsibilities, authority, and \"re lationship to management.\" This test is fashioned, akin to the statutory supervisory exemption, to ensure against a division of loyalty. But, in contrast to the supervisory exemption, where the statute sets out precisely what is to be considered, the dir ection to examine the \"relationship to management\" necessar ily implicates a more far ranging examination. Nor does the Yeshiva Court's treatment of the participation of faculty in policy formulation relieve the Board of that engagement. On the contrary, the Court's statement that \"some\" lessened degree of accountability will not result in non -managerial status necessar ily requires the Board to weigh the entire scope of accountability as well other aspects of the employee's relationship to management. In one instance, however, the law of supervisory and managerial exemption should coincide. And that is where the employee performs a managerial function that is segregable 3 from her normal responsibilities and consumes an insubstantial amount of her work time . Thus, the classifications of a group of employees as \"managers\" is highly consequential and a determination that must be made in context. In fact, the context for industrial relations is changing. The pyramidal structure of command and control preva lent in 1935, and 1947, is flattening. Employers have come to see the need to secure employee participation and involvement, their knowledge and insight, on a range of issues \"outside the box\" of wages, hours, and working conditions. As front -line employ ees assume expa nded managerial functions in a growing number of leading -edge workplaces, it is only individuals whose work is entirely managerial who are clearly to be excluded from coverage under the Act. For many other types of employees, including facu lty in higher education, Amici submit that there is ample play in the statutory joints to accommodate the Act to this manifest need. Argument I. High Performance or Knowledge -Driven Systems that Involve Employees and Their Representatives in the Management of the Company are an Important Advance in Industrial Relations As the NLRB considers the specifics of the Point Park case and the broader standards concerning managerial and professional work, it is important to consi der the degree to which managerial res ponsibilities are routinely placed on the shoulders of front -line workers and their union representatives in settings that are unambiguously covered under the NLRA. These instances suggest that the standard for coverage under the NLRA should be very broad with respect to professional work and that many managerial functions are now routinely handled by front -line workers in a wide range of industries . Moreover, the NLRB, like any other regulatory body, has a responsibility to adapt to changes in workplace practices as they evolve, consistent with the full range of principles and purposes of the law it enforces. There is clear and 4 unambiguous evidence that the distinction between \"managers\" and \"employees \" as originally envisioned at the time of the passage of the NLRB has changed in response to the changing organ ization of work, especially in knowledge based organizations. The line between these two categories of workers is now blurr ed to the point it no longer serves the law's original purpose . While there is continued debate among scholars on the specific way to characterize the present post -industrial era, it was over a quarter century ago that compelling evidence was presented on our entering a \"second industrial divide\"1 that posed transforma tional challenges for the American sy stems of industrial relations .2 Observers initially focused on the new ways that information technologies were \"informating\" work in ways that led employers to rely more heavily on employees to change their work proces ses and to use the data and information produced by new technologies to participate in the control (e.g., reduce variances and error rates) of operations and to track and improve organization performance .3 A wave of scholarship documented how clusters of work practices, including employee involvement in business decisions (particularly front -line decision making concerning product and service quality), accounted for high performance work systems.4 The distributed knowledge of the front -line workforce has come to be seen as central to the capacity of organizations to \"l earn\" from 1 Michael Piore & Charles Sabel, The Second Industrial Divide: Possibilities for Prosperity (New York: Basic Books 1984). 2 Thomas A. Kochan, Harry C. Katz & Robert B.

Rel. Rev. (1995). 5 experience5 and this \"knowledge -driven\" nature of work has been documented as diffusing across national boundari es.6 The legal implications of these changes in the nature of work itself were highlighted in 1994 by what was termed the \"Dunlop Commission\" on la bor law reform,7 which concluded that the doctrines used to distin guish between supervisors/managers and employees needed to be updated to \"define employees and employers i n ways consistent with economic reality .\" Specifically , the Commission concluded that public policy needed to update: . . . the definitions of supervisor and manager to insure that only those with full supervisory or managerial authority and responsibility are excluded from coverage of the law. We further recommend that no individual or group of individuals should be excluded from coverage under the statute because of participation in joint problem -solving teams, self -managing work groups, or internal self-governance or dispute resolution processes.8 To understand the shift around increased managerial content in front -line work , cons ider the origins of what is presently the nation's largest labor -management partnership, which involves over 90,000 health care professionals belonging to a coalition of unions at Kaiser Permanente. As Kochan and co -authors9 document , over a decade ago, former union leader Peter diCicco recalled a meeting with top management leaders in the context of escalating adversarial conflict: \"We went to that meeting ready to blast Kaiser Permanente for its behavi or.\" diCicco added, \"At the top of our list was patient care. That's w here the frustration was greatest among our members .\" Thus, the core concern was not wages, hours or working conditions, but the very business itself, \"patient care.\" As the authors note, \" the labor leaders 5 Ikujiro Nonaka , The knowledge -creating company , 69 Harv. Bus. Rev. 96-104(1991). 6 Joel Cutcher -Gershenfeld et a l., Knowledge -Driven Work: Unexpected Lessons from Japanese and United States Work Practices (Oxford University Press 1998) . 7 U.S. Dep' t of Labor, U.S. Comm'n on the Future of Worker -Management Relations \u2014Final Report (Dec. 1, 1994). 8 Id. at 9. 9Thomas A. Kochan et a l., Healing Together: The Labor -Management Partnership at Kaiser Permanente (Cornell University Press 2009) . 6 were in for a surprise. \" CEO Lawrence opened t he meeting with a statement that diCicco recalls disarmed them. \"He said all the things we were pre pared to say . . . It was clear that there was almost t otal alignment of objectives .\"10 That interchange gave birth to a labor management partnership at Kaiser that has now lasted fourteen years. Over 3,000 unit based teams composed of service workers, technicians, nurses, administrators, and physicians work together to imp rove health care quality, cost control, use of electronic records technologies for preventive care, etc. Moreover, specialized joint labor management committees provide advice on marketing, new hospital design, planning, and organization, and other strategic concern s of shared interest to managers, physicians, and employees. Thus, the changing nature of work begins with alignment of labor and management around working together to advance strategic organizational objectives. Note that there are enduring areas of conflicting interests on aspects of wages, hours, and working conditions, but even these are address ed using a more problem -solving oriented approach to collective b argaining .11 It is instructive that the parties at Kaiser Permanente have even developed a visual image to reflect the efforts that do and do not fit into what they term the \"NLRA box,\" which is as follows: Inside and Outside the NLRA Box Source: Kaiser Permanente and the Coalition of Unions 10 Id. at 2. 11 Id. 7 Kaiser Per manente is not the only health care setting where unionized professional workers have responsibility for strategic managerial decisions. At the University of Massachusetts Memorial health care complex the union representing the front -line service workers ( food service, etc.), SHARE, is widely regarded for its success in imp roving patient satisfaction in parts of the hospital where managers, docto rs and nurses all had previously had little success. The negotiated contract language supporting what is termed \"Joint work on Patient Satisfaction and Process Improvement,\" reads as follows: UMass Memorial and SHARE recognize our joint interest in improving patient satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and doing other joint process improvement projects. We agree to continue and expand our joint work in these areas. UMass Memorial leadership and SHARE leadership will work together to enable this to happen - working with the employees and their managers to overcome obstacles to releasing SHARE Reps, and being flexible in balancing the needs of these projects with the other needs of the departments. A joint union -management oversight committee will meet regularly to assess progress and to remove barriers.12 This reflects a fundamental feature of new work systems, which i s the degree to which knowledge , information, skills, and processes integral to continuous imp rovement in business operations are distributed widely and deeply within organizations in ways that cut across traditional \"employee -supervisor -manager\" job tit les. This contrasts with the model forged in the industrial revolution where superv isors were the experts and empl oyees were to follow direction. In the auto industry, the concept of \"kaizen\" (roughly translated as \"conti nuous improveme nt based on knowledge\" ) was first pioneered, as documented in The Machine that 12 Agreement between UMass Me morial & SHARE, Oct. 1, 2007 -Sept. 30, 2011, available at http://theshare union.org/SHARECONTRACT2007 -2011.pdf 8 Changed the World , based on the Toyota production system .13 This model placed substantial managerial responsibility for continuous improvement on front -line workers, but only on a very narrow range of issues associated with the work in their defined work area. The Saturn Corporation was founded in the mid -1980s with a central role for a broader form of front -line employee engagement with the business operations and union -management partners hip in running the busin ess.14 This includes a \"self -directed\" team -based work system, consensus decision making, groups of one hundred workers led by a union -management pair of \"advisors.\" At the highest levels, union leaders shared responsibility with management for new product development, selection of suppliers, marketing, and work force selection, training and development.15 Thus, it is important to recognize independent (if , at times, fragile) emergence of such models in the U.S. context. The case of Saturn and others like it make clear that distinctions between production and managerial work can't be make without appreciating the larger institutional context in which labor -management have structured their relations. If they have adopted a full partnership model, that will shape all the roles within it. Even w ithout an overarching co -determination model akin to Saturn, the work itself of union members in the auto industry has expanded to include managerial functions. T he UAW and Ford are widely regarded for having jointly implemented a Quality Operating System that helped the auto maker jump from near the bottom in product quality to world -leading quality.16 This has included \"charters\" at multiple levels with precisely defined roles and responsibilities 13J. Womack & D. Roos, The machine the changed the world (MacMillan 1990). 14 Saul A. Rubinstein & Thomas A. Kochan , Learning from Saturn: Possibilities for Corporate Governance and Employee Relations (Cornell University Press 2001) . 15 Despite the advantages of the Saturn model (and a similar partnership at the New United Motors Manufacturing, Inc. [NUMMI] joint venture between GM and Toyota) in terms of product quality and employee engagement, the full partnership model was threatening in important ways to the both the UAW and General Motors leadership. Id. As a result, individual work practices diffused across the lar ger organization, but the full model was not embraced. 16 Joel Cutcher -Gershenfeld, Bargaining When the Future of an Industry is at Stake: Lessons from UAW -Ford Collective Bargaining Negotiations , 27 Negotiation J . 115-45 (2011) . 9 on quality, including work teams with responsibility for providing input on what is termed \"design for manufacture\" in engineering decision making. For example, the charter for the UAW -Ford National Quality Committee17 includes the following mission statement: The UAW -Ford National Quality Co mmittee is committed to driving \"Best -In- Class\" quality through the joint efforts of the UAW and Ford. We will partner with and support front -line operations in their quest to deliver World Class quality to our customers by: Supporting Divisional and Local joint quality efforts Helping to standardize quality principles and practices across the business Ensuring a climate of fairness and respect These elements will help to sustain and grow the business, while enabling the personal growth, development and ad aptability of the workforce. Underlying the UAW -Ford National Quality Committee charter is a strategic decision by the parties, made in the 2003 national negotiations, to have all quality activities at all levels of the corporation under one set of govern ing committees (at corporate, divisional and plant levels). Thus, there are no separate managerial forums for quality. Labor and management individuals serving on the national committee have detailed roles and responsibilities, including the following wi th respect to plant -level committees (with are also joint committees with union and management members): Roles and Responsibilities with Respect to the Facility Quality Committees: Overall responsibility to implement and support the \"Best -In-Class\" Quality Program as listed in Appendix Q, through the Divisional and Facility Committees Communicate quality objectives and strategies under the \"Best -In-Class\" Quality Program through the Divisional Committees to Facility levels Provide tools, coaching and other support, as appropriate, to enable the implementation of quality objectives and strategies through Divisional Committees to Facility levels to include, but not limited to, Joint Alignment and Implementation Coach Local/Facility compliance to the Local Qual ity Committee (LQC) Effectiveness Assessment 17 Correspondence with Dan Brooks, former UAW Co -Chair of the U AW-Ford National Program Center & Marty Mulloy, Vice President, Global Labor Affairs, Ford Motor Company , UAW -Ford National Quality Committee Charter . 10 Serve as a resource to Facilities, through Divisions in meeting Quality goals and objectives Certify local UAW Quality Representatives Provide support and training for the Quality Operating System Coordinators (QOSC) Identify leading Quality best practices - internally and externally Provide NQC training as requested Provide reward and recognition as appropriate Notice that these roles and responsibilities include overall responsibility for the corporation's \"best in class\" quality program, enabling quality goal accomplishment, certification of local UAW quality representatives, training and development, and rewards and recognition. These are all managerial functions that are now shared equally between labor and management. In the airline industry, the most heavily unionized airline, Southwest Airlines, is also the most profitable (with a valuation that exceeds that of nearly all other airlines combined). At the heart of this success story, is a model of work force engagement in the business operation that involves new forms of \" relational coordination .\"18 The many professional roles, including pilots, flight attendants, customer service agents, ramp agents, and mechanics work collectively and seamlessly with supervisors and managers on mission critical tasks, such as the rapid \"turning\" of a plane coming and going at the gate. The key to this success is that no one function or level acts in territorial ways about \"its work\" and instead al l roles share all responsibility for the business operation of turning around planes safely, efficiently, and in ways that preserve/support high levels of customer satisfaction. An attempt to segment work by profession or to draw a line around what is or isn't managerial would undercut the very essence of what has been t ermed \"the Southwest Way.\"19 18 Jody Hoffer Gittell Airlines Way: The Power of Relat ionships for Superior Performance (McGraw Hill 2003). 19 Id. 11 The same trend in blurring lines between supervisors and employees is not only occurring in the public sector, it is being actively encouraged in education via federal government \"Race to the Top\" incentives and federal mediation/facilitation efforts. At the heart of the reform efforts are improved teacher evaluation, professional development, curriculum innovations, and reassignments, transfers, and discipline/d ischarge decisions and processes. Increasingly \"peer review\" models are being used to carry out these interrelated processes in which senior teachers evaluate, coach, and mentor teachers along with assistant principals, principals, and other administrativ e personnel. Consider the following language from the collective bargaining agreement between the San Juan teachers and the school administration: The District and the Association agree to take responsibility and be held accountable for the improvement of the quality of teaching and learning which represents an expanded role in public education. It is in the best interest of the San Juan Schools that the District and the Association cooperatively engage in activities and communication which demonstrate mut ual respect for all stakeholders and results in the improvement of student achievement through development of common goals, a cooperative, trusting environment and teamwork. It is the [parties'] belief that actively and constructively involving all releva nt stakeholders contributes significantly toward achieving these goals. Shared responsibility and accountability for results are at the core of a continuous improvement model. Joint responsibility for student success means that educators share in celebra ting what works and share in identifying together areas that are not working and are in need of improvement.20 Here the teachers are joining with management to take shared responsibility for the central public goods at stake in the operation - the educati onal mission. Note the emphasis on \"shared responsibility and accountability,\" which are the essence of the managerial function and which are central to the teacher's professional identities. Language similar to the above can be found in a growing numb er of schools21 and form the basis for much of what is being advocated and 20Joel Cutcher -Gershenfeld and Saul A. Rubinstein, Innovation and Transformation in Public Sector Employment Relations: Future Prospects on a Contested Terrain , Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol . (Symposium Issue, forthcoming). 21 Saul A. Rubinstein & John E. McCarthy. Collaborative School Reform: Creating Union -Management Partnerships to Improve Public School Systems, Rutgers University School of Management and labor Relations 12 put in place in charter schools, some of which are unionized and some of which are not. Thus, if a non -union charter school faculty sought union representation, the traditional supervisor - employee distinction would be of no value in assuring that teachers as professional employees were afforded the right to representation.22 It is clearly in the national interest to continue to work collaboratively across the traditional \"superv isor-manager -employee \" boundar ies in education. The expansion of front -line worker responsibilit y has long been documented in nonunion work settings .23 Indeed, key elements of high performance work systems have been examined across both unionized and non -union settings ,24 confirming that the increased responsibility for managerial functions can be found in both contexts. Consider professional work at the MIT- Broad Institute, which won the ra ce to sequence the human genome. Tasks had been organized in a linear assembly line fashion for the first five years of operations. An exponential reduction in the cost per sequence pair of DNA happened, however, aft er the work was restructured into a team -based work system with weekly \"kaizen\" meetings that also included test equipment manufacturers .25 While there are many documented examples of workplaces where front -line workers have responsi bility for managerial d ecisions, the full high performance model still represent s a (Oct. 2010 ). See a lso Barry Bluestone & Thomas Kochan, Toward a Grand Bargain: Collaborative Approaches to Labor -Management Reform in Massachusetts (The Boston Foundation Oct. 2011 ). 22 Indeed, the federal government, through the U.S. Department of Education and the Federa l Mediation and Conciliation Service are actively promoting and facilitating diffusion of this new model of collaboration and joint decision making. A joint statement of these agencies with the two nat ional teachers' organizations, and national organizations of school superintendents and board members was signed at a May 23 -24, 2012 conference. The statement can be found at www2ed.gov/documents /labor -management -collaboration/vision -statement -sigs.pdf . 23 Richard E. Walton, From control to commit ment in the workplace , 63 Harv. Bus.

At stake in the NLRB's consideration of professional a nd managerial work is both the changing nature of work and the connection of new forms of work to the continued realization of key objectives of the NLRA, namely to increase employee purchasing power, to promote orderly and efficient interstate commerce (i.e., adapt to the changing organization of business in ways that promoted efficiency and economic growth) , and to provide employees a voice on the terms and conditions of employment. When front -line workers and professional employees have increased man agerial responsibility it has the potential to increase their purchasing power and to further balance the power of labor and management. When a sharp distinction for coverage under the NLRA is drawn based on having even substantial degrees of managerial r esponsibility, vast segments of the U.S. workforce that unambiguously should be covered under the act (such as auto workers, nurses, teachers, professors, and airline crews) would be in tension as their responsibilities have expanded. These are not isolat ed exceptions, but emblematic of larger shifts in the nature of work itself. There are clearly supervisory and managerial jobs in which the work in its entirety is supervisory and managerial. Drawing distinction short of this standard will encounter diff iculty given that increasingly knowledge -driven nature of work in leading organizations across a wide array of industries and sectors. 31 Richard M. Locke et al., Does monitoring improve labor standards? Lessons from Nike , 61Indus. & Lab. Rel. (2008) . 32 H.C Katz & O.R. Darbishire, Converging Divergences: Worldwide Change in Employment Relations (ILR Press 2000) . 15 II. Employee Participation in Policy Formulation and Effectuation Alone Does Not Result in Managerial Status: the Touchstone is of an Impermissible Division of Loyalty A. The Analytical Framework In NLRB v Bell Aerospace Co , 410 U.S. 267 (1974), the Court looked to the policy undergirding the statutory exclusion of supervisors to drive inexorably to the e xclusion of managers: Neither should be made subject to any division in the duty of loyalty they singularly owe to their employers. The extension of a statutory right to engage in concerted activity for protection from management, or to bargain collectivel y with, it by the firm's executives, responsible for the exercise of managerial power for the hierarchy, would blur \u2014the term the Court used was \"eviscerate\" \u2014the very distinction between management and labor that the statute allowed companies to create and rely upon.33 Thus a line has to be drawn to distinguish an \"executive officer\" (416 U.S. at 289), \"executives who formulate and effectuate management policies\" (416 U.S. at 286), from employees. In the line -drawing process the Court commanded close attenti on to the employee's \"actual job responsibilities, authority, and relationship to management .\" 416 U.S. n. 19 at 290 (emphasis added). The scope of the former two are clear. The third draws attention specifically to the nature of the individual's precis e relationship to higher authority that would be threatened by engagement in collective bargaining. More on that needs be and will be said below. But first it should be stressed that the Bell Aerospace Court was concerned that the Board's approach would blur the distinction between labor and management that companies relied upon in structuring their employment relations and which the Labor Act sanctioned; that 33 NLRB v Bell Aerospace Co ., supra n.13 at 284: The Wagner Act was designed to protect 'laborers' and others clearly within the managerial hierarchy. Extension of the Act to cover true 'managerial employees' would indeed be revolutionary, for it would eviscerate the raditional distinction between labor and management. If Congress intended a result so drastic, it is not unreasonable to expect that it would have said so expressly. 16 is, a system of managerial command and control. But much has changed in the nearly 40 years since Bell Aerospace was decided. Companies have come to adopt \"high performance\" systems in the unionized setting, with union participation and support, that flatten the hierarchy and devolve decision -making to employees, their work groups and representatives . See Section I, supra . This sea -change in industrial relations poses the obverse of the issue addressed in Bell Aerospace : not whether the Board's construction of the Act will blur a managerial distinction that employers maintain and claim in order to r etain hierarchical control; but, whether the Board can adapt the Act to those situations where it is management that has blurred the distinction, where it is willing to concede to employees as employees a capacity to influence key company policies because doing so yields benefits in efficiency, job satisfaction, productivity, and profits. That issue is beclouded as a result of NLRB v. Yeshiva University , 444 U.S 672 (1980). As Paul Weiler so aptly put it, the premise upon which the Court proceeded was the importance of ensuring that the allegiance of every manager adheres to the enterprise he serves, rather than to a union which might be serving him. This sentiment is most plausible in the case of the traditional hierarchical firm, in which there is assumed ly a major conflict of interest between labor on one side and capital on the other. This premise is much less plausible, though, in situations in which contemporary collegial approaches to production have been adopted, and in which the firm seeks in effect to involve all employees in at least some aspect of management of the enterprise. Paul Weiler, Governing the Workplace 216-17 (1990). \"Beclouded\" because even as the Yeshiva Court struggled with a \"collegial approach to production,\" albeit in higher education, not manufacturing, and sought to place it within the Bell Aerospace framework, the Court's actual treatment was a tissue of ambiguity, of begged questions. What is one to make of a college or university faculty that customarily participates, and significantly so, in the formulation and execution of basic day -to-day educational policies: admission standards, curriculum, degree requirements, and the like. The faculty's rol e in these 17 matters has long been understood in the academic world \u2014 in public and private institutions alike \u2014as reflecting widely shared principles of good governance. And so did this Board, which held the bringing to bear of professional judgment in matte rs of educational policy was not managerial in the industrial sense used by the Bell Aerospace Court. As the Board well knows, however, the Yeshiva Court disagreed. Instead, the Yeshiva Court drew an industrial analogy: those who satisfied the institution 's degree requirement were its product; completion of the curriculum was the process by which the product was produced; admissions standards governed the selection of the institution's raw materials, and so forth. And so the Court opined that, \"To the exte nt to which the industrial analogy applies, the faculty determine...the product to be produced, the terms on which it will be offered, and the customers who will be served.\" 444 U.S. at 686. But, when confronted with the argument that in making those determi nations the faculty is not acting for the managerial hierarchy in the industrial sense but rather is exercising an independent professional judgment the Court responded in a critical passage that needs to set out at length: It may appear, as the Board con tends, that the professor performing the governance functions is less \"accountable\" for departures from institutional policy than a middle -level industrial manager whose discretion is more confined. Moreover, traditional systems of collegiality and tenure insulate the professor from some of the sanctions applied to an industrial manager who fails to adhere to company policy. But the analogy of the university to industry need not, and indeed cannot, be complete . It is clear that Yeshiva and like universities must rely on their faculties to participate in the making and implementation of their policies. The large measure of independence enjoyed by faculty members can only increase the danger that divided loyalty will lead to those harms that the board traditio nally has sought to prevent. Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 689 -90 (footnotes omitted) (emphases added) Note that the pivotal issue was posed but not confronted, and so no dispositive guidance was given. It was ducked, left for another day, which is now. If a \"large measure of 18 independence\" is accorded, in the sense that the employee is \"less\" accountable to the corporate hierarchy in the industrial sense, how can loyalty to the employer \u2014which Bell Aerospace and Yeshiva teach is the critical question \u2014possibly be divided?34 Importantly, the Court does not say that the industrial analogy has no application, nor that it would be irrelevant if no sanctions were available to control managerial discretion. It says that the analogy merely need not be \" complete \" and that the unavailability of \" some of the sanctions\" applicable to an industrial manager is irrelevant. I n effect, the Court has returned the resolution of these questions to the Board, with virtually no indication of where or how the lines are to be drawn. B. The Board Has Failed to Pursue the Question \u2014and so the Meaning \u2014of the Putative Manager's \"Relationsh ip to Management\" Thus far, the Board has read Bell Aerospace and Yeshiva to render the issue of the putative manager's relationship to management to be irrelevant sub silentio . The question has never been mentioned, let alone analyzed. The entirety of the Board's treatment has been devoted exclusively the first two prongs of Bell Aerospace's three pronged test: to just how much recommendatory authority the faculty member has, over what issues, and to what effect, to place her in one box to the other. It is instructive that the Regional Director's decision in this case devotes over eighty pages of exacting exposi tion to these questions without even once mentioning whether the president or a dean can sanction a faculty member due to displeasure 34 Robert A. Gorman & Matthew W. Finkin, Basic Text on Labor Law: Uni onization and Collective Bargaining 51 (2d ed. 2004) (footnotes omitted): If college professors (or other professional employees) who effectively recommend a variety of ostensibly \"managerial\" policies are not answerable to higher management for the recom mendations they make, one would ordinarily be hard pressed to see how they could be considered \"managerial.\" Nor would the extension of the Act to them seem to pose the kind of a threat of divided loyalty that both the statutory exemption of supervisors a nd the judge -made exemption of managers was intended to forestall. In consequence, the reach of the managerial exemption not only with respect to faculty in private universities but with respect to professional employees generally remains clouded. 19 with her recommendation let alone examine the consequences of any want of accountability to the question of the duty of lo yalty. Nor is this singularity of the Board's focus under Yeshiva unique to the faculty setting. FHP, Inc ., 274 NLRB 1141 (1985). A decision that is at once the prime example of this singularity of focus and a reductio ad absurdum of it is the Board's d ecision in College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery , 265 NLRB 295 (1982) [COMS], a \"telling example of the 'Catch -22' situation that professional [or other] employees since Yeshiva may face if they attempt to gain more input into work place decision mak ing.\" U.S. Dept. of Labor, U.S. Labor Law and the Future of Labor -Managemen t Relations, Bureau of Labor -Management Relations and Cooperative Programs Report No. 113 (Feb. 1987) at p. 67. In the COMS case, a faculty secured collective representation; the a dministration d id not assert managerial status, nor, apparently, could it due to the want of any participative governance. The faculty then bargained for a committee structure to give it a role in educational policy formulation and execution that it had n ot had theretofore. The Board then held the faculty to be managerial as a result of the bargain made with the faculty union: The Yeshiva decision does not expressly or impliedly distinguish situations in which managerial authority was gained through collec tive bargaining from situations in which such authority was more freely granted, and we do not believe that such a distinction is required by the Act. Accordingly, we must look to the extent of managerial authority held by college faculties rather than the manner in which such authority was obtained. COMS , supra , at 298. The Board did not think it relevant to inquire any further into whether and how the faculty's \"relationship to management\" was such as to have possibly compromised its duty of loyalty by serving on committees their union created by collective agreement with the administration . 20 It is obvious to Amici that employee participation in key areas of managerial decision making \"outside the box\" \u2014business strategy, marketing, product selection, quality standards, and the like occurring today in high performance workplaces (Section I, supra )\u2014which is the product of collective bargaining does not convert the employee participants in those co -operative engagements into non -employee managers. Such a result would be ant ithetical to the very purpose such systems are bargained for . Nor should the result differ if the participatory system were to be the product of company policy rather than the product of an arms -length bargain. The reason why that sho uld be so turns upon the concept that the Court held to undergird the managerial exemption: the need for undivided hierarchal loyalty. That, Bell Aerospace tells us, requires an assessment not only of the employee's \"job responsibilities and authority\" \u2014which the Board has taken to be the only issue s to be addressed \u2014but also of the employee's \"relationship to management,\" which the Board has thus far ignored. The Board's neglect of the critical element is in sharp contrast to the Board's close attention to it in deciding the issue of supervisory status on which the Bell Aerospace Court drew so heavily by analogy to exempt managers. To obviate the evil of divided loyalty Congress excluded not just those who have power, or effective recommendatory power, to ma ke a variety of decisions affecting employee status \u2014to hire, fire, assign, or responsibly direct the work of others. It limited the exemption only to those who possessed that authority in \"the interest of\" the employer. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (11). Accordingly, the supervisory exemption requires an assessment of the employee's \"relationship to management,\" just as the Bell Aerospace Court required in making the judgment of managerial status. But here, as Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., 348 NLRB 688 (2006), evidences, the Board has paid close attention to that relationship, in particular in the matter of accountability. Citing well establish authority, the Board in that case emphasized that 21 to be responsible for the performance of a duty is to be answerable, to be acco untable, to the managerial hierarchy for it. Id. at 691-92. And to be \"accountable\" means \"that there is a prospect of adverse consequences for the putative supervisor if he/she does not\" act as the hierarchy would wish. Id. at 692. Whence the conflict th at would follow should the supervisor become unionized. To be sure, Oakwood Healthcare discusses this issue only with respect to the element of \"responsible direction\" under \u00a7 2(11). But such is an inextricable component of the requirement that all the p utative supervisor's actions be \"in the interest of the employer.\" To act in that interest, in the statutory sense, is to be accountable for its exercise. Let us take the example of union stewards. Collective agreements commonly provide that union stewa rds will be on company -paid time when performing those duties \u2014i.e., winnowing out frivolous or unjustified claims of breach of contract or company rules, bringing unforeseen or novel problems to managerial attention, and securing adherence to company polic ies by both employees and management, all in aid of managerial objectives set out in the collective agreement and collateral company policies. But because of their \"relationship to management\" in the performance of these functions, absent engagement in su ch misconduct as would be cause to dismiss any employee, e.g. bribery or the falsification of company records, they cannot be dismissed for excessive zeal or an overabundance of militance. As such is not their relationship to management they cannot be sup ervisors \u2014or managers. As the Court put it: The interpretation of the \"in the interest of the employer\" language mandated by our precedents and by the ordinary meaning of the phrase does not render the phrase meaningless in the statutory definition. The l anguage ensures, for example, that union stewards who adjust grievances are not considered supervisory employees and deprived of the Act's protections. NLRB v Health Care & Retirement Corp ., 511 U.S. 571, 579 (1994). 22 To take another example, collective agreements commonly provide for employee safety committees and often clothe them with considerable authority. Employees who serve on these bodies are not rendered members of management thereby: even as their decisions are obviously for the benefit of, \"in the interest of,\" the company in that sense, they do not function in the shadow of \"adverse consequences\" should management be displeased with actions they take in that capacity. Sanction for managerial displeasure with what to management might be a too aggressive an approach to safety and health would be a violation of the collective agreement, not the exercise of managerial accountability. Nor, again, is it necessary that that authority be conferred by collective agreement in order for the employee exe rcising it to be non -managerial for the Board's error has lain in collapsing the possession of influential authority into a conclusive if tacit presumption of a relationship of accountability and control. To stay with job safety and health for a moment, o ver a dozen states have mandated employee -management safety committees. See Cynthia Estlund, Regoverning the Workplace 172 -80 (2010). These commonly require an equal number of managerial and non-management employee representatives. E.g., N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 95-252 (d) (2) (2011) (italics added) (\" Employee safety and health representation shall be selected by and from among the employer's non-managerial employees....\"); OR. Rev. Stat \u00a7654.182 (1) (a) (2011) (\"to ensure equal members of employees ... and employer representation \"). These laws authorize these bodies to take specific and sometimes far -reaching action: to conduct inspections, review incidents, and recommend safety improvements. N.C. Gen. Stat . \u00a7 595-252 (c) (4); O R. Rev Stat. \u00a7 654.182 (d). The exerc ise of discretion effectively to recommend the content of company safety and health policies and effectively to oversee its execution would surely seem to come within Yeshiva's definition of management. But these non -managerial representatives are 23 not con verted into members of management merely by performing these functions alone. These employee -participative systems require independence from management, not accountability to it. Today, even in the absence of an express statutory anti -retaliation clause, the discharge or discipline of an employee for doing what the statute authorizes her to do, for performing these duties, would be in violation of public policy and actionable in tort on that ground. Such, indeed, would seem to be the general state of th e common law. See Restatement (Third) Employment Law \u00a7402 (b) (2011) commented on at 13 Emp. Rts. & Emp. Poly. J. 183-203 (2009). Suppose, then, that in a jurisdiction lacking such a statute a company were to see it to its interest to establish such a committee. In fact, \"thousands of non -union health and safety committees are currently operation within firms' internal compliance pr ograms.\" Regoverning the Workplace , supra , at 177. And assume further that as a matter of company policy such bodies were clothed with independence equal to that statutorily commanded elsewhere or ensured by collective agreement, for the effectiveness of the safety program and its credibility turn upon both the reality and perception of the employee participants' independence from management.35 It should follow that employees serving on such bodies as part of their duties, working, as union stewards are, on Company -paid time, could not suffer \"adverse consequences\" for their efforts. And absent that accountability, as Health Care & Retirement Corp. teaches, they cannot be made members of management by virtue performing those functions alone. 35 Davi d Weil, Are Mandated Health and Safety Committees Substitutes for or Supplements to Labor Unions? 52 Indus. & Lab. Rel. Rev. 339 (1999). 24 C. The Party Proposing that an Employee is a Manag er Should be Obligated to Prove How Statutory Coverage Would Create a Demonstrable Conflict in the Duty of Loyalty : Absent that Conflict the Employee Cannot Be a Manager The current state of the law is a mud dle. On the one hand, Bell Aerospace teaches that the determination of managerial status, resting on the need for undivided loyalty, turns on a three -pronged analysis: of how much power an employee has, over what issues, and, in exercising that power, of the employee's relationship to the hierarchy, which ordinarily would include the employee's accountability to the hierarchy. The Court echoed the latter is when it later expressly distinguished union stewards as non -managerial despite the rather effective influence they have. But on the other hand, Yeshiva says that, for faculty \u2014and, p otentially , others engaged in participative forms of institutional or corporate governance \u2014the analogy to industry need not be \"complete,\" that the lack of \"some\" degree of accountability is not dispositive. Maddeningly, however, the Court declined to breathe any hint of what the degree of incompleteness was, what the degree of unaccountability would be that would nevertheless not disprove a determination of managerial status. What is the Board to make of this? The short, if obvious answer is that one cannot fathom what the Court had in mind by these Delphic dicta. The total absence of guidance counsels the Board to adhere closely not on ly to the three - pronged test the Court set out in Bell Aerospace , but to the ground these tests are devised to address and which that Court in both Bell Aerospace and Yeshiva held to be determinative: whether coverage under the Act would deprive the employ er of the duty of loyalty the employee singularly owes to it when he or she participates in the formulation or effectuation of managerial policies. In the case of high executives \u2014whom Bell Aerospace addressed as the paradigmatic example of statutory exclu sion\u2014the answer would be obvious. In contested cases, however, 25 where the answer is far from clear \u2014as it is when the exemption confronts faculty participation in institutional governance or employee participation in high performance systems \u2014the party asser ting managerial status should be required to prove that statutory coverage would so demonstrably engender the conf lict the exemption contemplates as to warrant the employee to be held to be a manager \u2014 such being his or her \"relationship to management.\" This line of analysis is consistent with the Court to treatment of supervisors in NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp , supra . There , the Board argued that persons who met the statutory definition of a supervisor were nevertheless covered by the Act becau se the professional judgment required for their supervisory work posed no threat of divided loyalty. The Court denied the Board the power to take that approach as it would create an entirely new category not contemplated by the Act. \" The Act is to be enforced according to its own terms, not by creating legal categories inconsistent with its meaning as the Board has done in n urse cases.\" 511 U.S. at 580. In other words, insofar as division of loyalty is the problem \u00a7 2(11) was divised to solve , anyone who meets the tests set out in \u00a7 2(11) is irrebuttably presumed to be in such a position . The statute forecloses any examination of that issue . Here , the question is not whether a manager should have the right to engage in collective bargaining because doing so wo uld pose no conflict in loyalty: if there would be no con flict of loyalty the employee isn't a manager at all . Unlike the statutory supervisory exemption, the managerial exemption is judge -made; its categories are loosely defined, to say the le ast. O ne element of the analysis commands an examination of the putative manager's relationship to the hierarchy which necessarily includes the extent to which the duty of loyalty is implicated. As noted above, the Yeshiva Court adverted to that question but, by saying that the loss of some degree of accountability did not work against a finding of managerial status, the Court essentially 26 and necessarily requi red the extent and depth of accountability to be examined. In sum, that which the Act conclusively presumes for those who are supervisors is what is required to be decided for those who are managers. As the Board and the judiciary have acknowledged, the question is not whether the employee is aligned with management or effectuates employer policy simpliciter . All employees can be said to advance the company's mission and policies. The question is whether they are so aligned or so specially situated vis -\u00e0-vis the hierarchy that they sho uld not be covered by the Act. Accordingly the Board is called upon to address and explain how the employee's relationship to management drive s toward the extension or denial of managerial status, not to create some new category. Because the loss of statuto ry protection is at stake , the confl ict in loyalty should be demonstrable. The evidence should be more than speculative; more than a generalized suspicion. In the case of physicians at an HMO who serve on committees reviewing patient care, therapies, patient services, and work environment \u2014in FHP , Inc., for example \u2014the employer should be required to show how unionization would compromise the physicians' loyalty to the hierarchy in the matter of p atient care. If it would not, they would not be managers as defined by their relationship to it. Thus, evidenc e from analogous employment s in the public sector could readily be looked to: in the case of professors, whether collective bargaining by faculties in public universities , whose exercise of the same degree of influence or authority over basic education al policies is indistinguishable from th eir private sector counterparts has compromised their duty of loyalty in any way; in the case of teachers in private or charter schools, whether teachers in public schools who have collectively bargained for robust par ticipative governance 27 systems have compromised their duty of loyalty or management's ability to manage;36 in the case of employees in company -sponsored participative bodies, whether their unionized counterparts \u2014 at Kaiser Permanente or Ford \u2014have caused tho se managements a demonstrable loss of loyalty; and in the case of employed physicians, whether management of their unionized counterparts in public health services have experienced an unacceptable division of loyalty as a result of collective bargaining. As that is a question the claim of managerial status necessarily presents, there is every good reason for the Board to require that it be addressed directly: by the party asserting th at fact to be so and best positioned to prove it . NLRB v. Kentucky River Community Care, 532 U.S. 706(2001) . In this way, the Board will be able to distinguish the true manager while dispelling the pall of legal uncertainty that hangs over high performance systems under current Board doctrine. Section III, infra . III. An Employee Whose Time Spent in Participative Governance is Insubstantial in Terms of His or Her Primary Responsibilities is Not a Manager Section I, supra , pointed out that there has been a significant movement in the years subsequent to Bell Aerospace and Yeshiva to involve employees and their representatives \u2014as employees \u2014in formulating and effectuating their employers' policies. To consider these employees to be members of management in consequence of that participation would deprive them of the prot ection of the Labor Act and the benefits of collecti ve barg aining. Consequently, to extend managerial status on that basis would blunt the desire by unions and employees to participate in such systems, much to the Nation's disadvantage. This concer n was expressed clearly in the Dunlop Report, Section I, supra . As that Section noted, despite the benefits of high performance systems, adoption, though significant, has not been exponential; but the pace of 36 See supra text accompany note s 21 -22. 28 union -management cooperation can be explained in part by the pall of uncertainty cast by the current state of Board doctrine. A student comment captured the situation rather well: Unions would have to balance the desire of enabling their members to gain sufficient power to influence the policies of t he employer against the concern that units of workers who gain sufficient discretion at the bargaining table might eventually be decertified. A union would be most reticent when it perceives that the employer is most likely to seek decertification; these probably are situations in which labor relations have been problematic in the past \u2014precisely the situations in which such participative management agreements would have the most potential for benefit. Comment, Protecting Managerial Employees Under the Nat ional Labor Relations Act , 91 Colum. L. Rev. 405, 428 (1991) (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). See also Comment, The Managerial Exclusion Under the National Labor Relations Act: Are Worker Participation Programs Next? , 48 Cath. U. L. Rev. 557 (1998/99) . One factor that distinguishes the employee -participant from the true manager \u2014the \"executive\" that the Bell Aerospace Court said was at the center of the exemption's concern \u2014is that an executive is an executive all the time. A vice president for marketi ng, a director of product design is always a vice president for marketing or a director of product design. The job he or she holds is managerial. An employee who serves on a union -management committee on marketing or product design does so in addition to his or her normal job duties which do not involve engagement with policy issues. But the Board's treatment of the managerial status of those who participate in shared governance has ignored the difference: the fact that a majority of physicians have serv ed from time to time on a variety of committees concerned with the quality of patient care in addition to their normal care -giving functions was held , without more , sufficient to render the entire complement of physicians to be managerial. FHP, Inc ., supra. Not only did the Board omit any discussion of accountability, Section II, supra , it devoted no 29 consideration to how substantial a part of the physicians' time was consumed in that participation. Quite the contrary is so of the supervisory exemption, w here a supervisor's supervisory duties can also be segregable from and in addition to no n-supervisory job responsibilities . The Board has long acknowledged that the possession of segregable supervisory power which is exercised only a small amount of time does not render the employee a supervisor. The amount of time devoted to separate supervisory functions that, in the Board's view, will result in supervisory status has fluctuated over the years. See e.g. , Detroit College of Business , 296 NLRB 318 (1989) . But the basic principle has been consistently acknowledged. Where an individual is engaged a part of the time as a supervisor and the rest of the time as a unit employee, the legal standard for a supervisory determination is whether the individual spen ds a regular and substantial portion of his/her work time performing supervisory functions. Oakwood Healthcare, Inc. , 348 NLRB 686, 694 (2006) (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). In other words, those who spend an insubstantial portion of their time doi ng supervisory work pose no threat of divided loyalty, even though they are doing some genuine supervisory work , at least not so serious a threat as to deprive them of stat utory protection in their role as rank-and-file employees . Consequently, Amici are hard -pressed to see why an employee who does not spend a substantial portion of her time participating in collaborative bodies that formulate or effectuate company or institutional policies should not be treated similarly . Yet the Board has paid no at tention to this issue, perhaps due to the obvious fact that authentic managers are rarely, if ever, part -time in that capacity. Amici submit that not only professional employees but non -professionals as well who are alleged to be managers on the basis of participation in systems of shared corporate or institutional governance but which participation does not consume a substantial portion of their 30 time should not be denied the protections of the Act as employees . We believe that it would strain credulity t o conceive that a worker who spends a few hours a week or less to participate on a committee on product design, marketing, safety or environmental policy, would engender an intolerable conflict of loyalty with the company by virtue of union representation. Nor would a faculty member who, in addition to keeping up in her discipline, preparing for classes \u2014current and under development \u2014researching and publishing, counseling students, engaging in outreach and public service, and who serves on institutional com mittees, few of which deal with basic policy issues and which meet for only rela tively brief periods of time. Even a worker who is on assignment to product design operations for a defined period of time \u2014 say a period of months - - but will spend the prepo nderance of their career doing production work would not be consider ed to have changed jobs and left the bargaining unit. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. , 163 NLRB 723 (1967) (1968) aff'd 424 F .2d 1151 (7 th 1970) explained in Canonie Transp. Co. , 289 NLRB 299 (1988). This approach would merely extend well established doctrine regarding supervisors with dual responsibilities to the parallel situation of employees who participate in cooperative governance systems in addition to their nor mal duties. More important, it would effect a much -needed accommodation of the Act, consistent with extant doctrine, to facilitate the adoption of high performance or valu e-added workplace participation systems. Section, I, supra . Conclusion The course of action outlined in the foregoing is consistent with the Act, is well within the Board's authority to pursue, and will benefit the Nation by fostering a legal atmosphere conducive to the adoption of high performance workplace systems. Amici believe that the health 31 of the nation's economy and the well -being of its working force will be significantly advanced as a result. Respectfully submitted, Matthew W.

LEXIS 179, Dir. Dec. 2010) ................................ ................................ ........................... 6, 9 2 INTRODUCTION The central issue in this case is whether the ( Point Park ) University faculty members sought to be represented by the Petitioner are statutory employees or rather excluded mana gerial employees, consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in NLRB v. Yeshiva University , 444 U.S. 672 (1980). In his original decision and direction of election, the Regional Director found that the faculty members were not managerial employees, and, after an election, the Petitioner was certified as th eir collective -bargaining representative. The underlying issue ultimately was presented to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which found that the Board had \"failed to adequately explain why the faculty's role at the University is not manage rial.\" Point Park University v. NLRB , 457 F.3d 42, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The court instructed the Board to identify which of the relevant factors set forth in Yeshiva University , supra, are significant and which less significant in its determination that the Employer's faculty are not managerial employees and to explain why the factors are so weighte d. Following the court's remand, the Regional Director issued a Supplemental Decis ion. The Employer sought review of that decision, which the Board granted on November 28, 2007. To aid the Board in properly addressing the court's remand, the Board invites the parties and amici to file briefs that address the court's instruction that t he Board explain the weight of the various factors identified by the Supreme Court in Yeshiva and their application to these factors. Again, t he central issue in this case is whether the ( Point Park ) University faculty members sought to be represented by t he Petitioner are statutory employees or rather excluded managerial employees, consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in NLRB v. Yeshiva University , 444 U.S. 672 (1980). 3 In his original decision and direction of election, the Regional Director fou nd that the faculty members were not managerial employees, and, after an election, the Petitioner was certified as th eir collective -bargaining representative. The underlying issue ultimately was presented to the United States Court of Appeals for the Distr ict of Columbia Circuit, which found that the Board had \"failed to adequately explain why the faculty's role at the University is not manage rial.\" Point Park University v. NLRB , 457 F.3d 42, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The underlying issue ultimately was presen ted to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which found that the Board had \"failed to adequately explain why the faculty's role at the University is not managerial.\" Point Park University v.NLRB , 457 F.3d 42, 44 (D.C. Ci r. 2006). The court instructed the Board to identify which of the relevant factors set forth in Yeshiva University , supra, are significant and which less significant in its determination concerning whether Point Park's faculty are, or are not, managerial employees for the purposes of Section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act, and to explain why the factors are so weighted. Following the court's remand, the Regional Director issued a Supplemental Decision. Point Park sought review of that decision, wh ich the Board granted on November 28, 2007. The Board affirmed the Regional Director's decision that the Point Park faculty are professionals and not Managers, which are excluded from coverage under the NLRA. Point Park then appealed the Board's determina tion to the D.C. Court of Appeals , arguing that the Point Park faculty should be considered Managers and thus are NOT covered under the Act. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board and asked, considering the factors set forth by the Supreme Co urt in their Yeshiva decision, how the Board made its decision that the Point Park faculty are not Managers. 4 In requesting Amicus Briefs, the Board stated the purpose of the Briefs are, to aid the Board in properly addressing the court's remand, the Boar d invites the parties and amici to file briefs that address the court's instruction that the Board explain the weight of the various factors identified by the Supreme Court in Yeshiva and how the Board applied these factors in this case. Again, t he questi on presented by the D.C. Circuit is whether the full -time faculty of various Private Colleges and Universities fall within the Managerial exclusion the Supreme Court delineated in Yeshiva . This question turns on the decision making authority of the faculty and faculty committees. If the faculty has the authority to autonomously make academic decisions, the faculty should be considered managers. If the faculty does not have the authority to autonomously make academic decisions, and these decisions are made b y administrators, the faculty should NOT be considered managers. As stated by the D.C. Circuit, the Board did not state the factual basis why the Point Park faculty members were not Managers, in contrast to the faculty members at Yeshiva University et al. An investigation of a proposed faculty bargaining unit should answer the following questions, which were set forth in Yeshiva. Are t he individual schools or Departments within the Private College or Universit y substantially autonomous? Is each Department headed by a Department Head faculty member , and do the faculty members at each Department meet formally and informally to discuss and decide matters of institu tional and professional concern? 5 At the Departmental level , are formal faculty meetings convened regula rly pursuant to written bylaws? Does the faculty meet when convened by the Department Head, Dean or Director? Do the Departments also have faculty committees concerned with specia l areas of educational policy? Do faculty welfare committees negotiate with administrators concerning sala ry and conditions of employment? Through these meetings and committees, do the faculty and/or faculty committees at each department effectively determine its curriculum, grading system, admission and matriculation stand ards, academic calendars, and course schedules? Managerial Status of Faculty In determining the Managerial status of University faculty, one must remember that the common description of University governance has long been described as \"faculty governance. \" Therefore any decision by the Board should concern whether the faculty has decision making authority, either by individuals or by committees. The only variance from the Supreme Court's rationale in Yeshiva would be at a small or community college, where administrators make these decisions, and the responsibility of the faculty largely involves teaching. As an example, at most Colleges and Universities, the faculty members teach no more than three (3) or (6) hours per week, while at Community and other P rivate Colleges (i.e. Phoenix or Kaplan) the faculty members most often teach twelve (12) or more hours per week. In the newer Private Colleges and Universities such as Phoenix, Kaplan, et al., almost all decisions concerning academic topics are made by a dministrators. Again, t he first question the Board should ask in any determination related to Private College and University faculties is who makes academic decisions. Again, at the small or community college level, the faculty often teach 12 hours per we ek in classes 6 assigned by a Dean or other adminis trator and have few or no decision making responsibilities. At essentially all other Private College s and Universities, the faculty makes academic decisions. Also, it must be understood that many persons ha ve academic rank at a College or University, even though they are not \"classically\" teaching faculty. These include, among many others, coaches , librarians and administrators, or strictly researchers. Therefore a petition stating that the bargaining unit should include \"all faculty\" would be inappropriate, since it would include many administrators and other non -academic personnel that are clearly decision makers. Therefore, any coaches and administrators who have faculty rank clearly should not be includ ed in a bargaining unit. At the most basic level, most Private College and University decisions are made at the Departmental and at the individual faculty member level, with no oversight by any administrators. What specific topics a faculty member covers in a class is entirely at the discretion of the individual faculty member. The individual Departments are then made up by faculty with common teaching and research interests. These can range from the Sociology Department to the Engineering or Mathematics o r Psychology Departments. Many Private Colleges and Universities also have Medical or Law Schools. Among these Departments are Faculty with specific areas of expertise. The faculty members make all decisions based on what they teach, what research they do , and what areas of Service they engage in, as well as what furthers the mission of the university. Because of these diverse academic interests and academic assignments, a \"wall to wall\" bargaining would not be appropriate. Hiring is most often done firs t by a faculty committee and then voted on by all of the faculty in the Department. Terminations , or refusal s to grant tenure , are examin ed first 7 by a faculty committee and then by the faculty as a whole. Terminations for cause are done rarely, for very eg regious behavior, and these are done by the Departmental faculty. Most typically, faculty members have seven (7) years to meet the requirements for tenure, unless they are particularly outstanding in publishing and are granted early tenure by faculty conse nsus. Also. some faculty members are hired by the faculty at the Associate Professor, or Full Professor level and automatically are granted tenure upon their hire. These decisions are made by the faculty in the Department. Most non -tenured hires are for Assistant Professors , while tenured hires are typically for Associate or full professors . In addition, there simply is no community of interest among most of the various Departments. As stated earlier, the Departments vary from Engineering, to Sociology to Mathematics. There is simply no way to treat these Departments collectively, since the decision making is made at the Departmental or individual faculty member level, with no common base of academic expertise. Who should make more money, engineering, or business faculty, or liberal arts faculty. Thus, the faculty members regularly make numerous academic decisions and have the authority to make these decisions autonomously. Likewise, salary administration among faculty members is very complex and made by the faculty at the Departmental level ; subject only by administrative or budgetary caps. Other compensation is paid directly from Grants, or endowed chairs, with no contribution from the University. It would be impossible for a labor union to negotiate a salary administratio n schedule for a Private College or University on any reasonable basis; even at the Departmental level. It simply is too complex. There also is little continuity among the faculty, and the faculty would never agree to have salary administration, or any other academic decision, done by a Labor Union. As an example, physicians at Medical Schools 8 are paid by income derived from their work and also compensation for teaching. Also, faculty regularly receive awards from foundations that often have stipends attached. Also, there are wide ranges of salaries in the various Departments. Next, one must understand the nature of the Private College and University governance process and the significant decision making authority that faculty members have in the various Depart ments. Quite simply, the faculty is responsible for almost all academic decisions and have the authority to execute these decisions, which make them Managers, rather than \"simply cogs in a wheel\" or employees. In liberal arts Departments, there is some sal ary continuity among faculty members, but most often salary is based on the Department's desire to hire, or to keep, a faculty member who is well known in the field and/or has a significant amount of publishing in peer reviewed journals. Again, in Privat e Colleges and Universities, the authority for most decision making is by individual faculty members through intra -Departmental Committees, or the Department as a whole. These committees, or the individual faculty members themselves, are responsible for, a nd have the authority over, all academic aspects of Departmental governance. When the Departmental faculty make a decision, it is by consensus, with no input from any administrators. The Department heads are most often selected by the Department faculty an d are often filled on a rotating basis among the tenured faculty in the Department. Only in such institutions as some community colleges is hierarchical institutional governance found, with College or University Deans making decisions unilaterally. Thus, t he first thing to consider in a Representation case is whether or not decision making is done by Departmental Deans or at the faculty level in the Private College or University. 9 (1) Which of the factors identified in Yeshiva and the relevant cases decided by the Board since Yeshiva are most significant in making a finding of managerial status for university faculty members and why? The most significant factors are largely grouped around decision making and academic control. If the faculty at the individual or Departmental leve l have autonomy over deciding academic matters, they are Managers. If such decision making is made at the Administrative level, the faculty would be Professional, but not managerial. Thus, the first level of investigation should be to ask who makes decisi ons about academic matters, the faculty, or some other Administrators. In Yeshiva , the Supreme Court reviews several Board decisions, which sets the groundwork for such consideration. These include: In Yeshiva , the Supreme Court found that faculty membe rs at Yeshiva University were managerial employees who were excluded from coverage under the Act. The Court defined managerial employees as those who \"formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their em ployers.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 682. The Court held that managerial employees \"must exercise discretion within, or even independently of, established employer policy and must be aligned with management,\" and that they must represent \"management interests by taking or recommending discretionary actions that effectively control or implement employer policy.\" Id. at 683. The most basic aspect of a Representational investigation at Private Colleges and Universities is to ask the faculty who decides the content of their courses, or their area of expertise, or are they autonomous in making these decisions. 10 In Yeshiva , the Court formulated critical areas of inquiry from previous Board decisions. The controlling consideration in this case is that the faculty of Yeshiva University exercises auth ority which in any other context unquestionably would be managerial. Their authority in academic matters is absolute. 1. They decide what courses will be offered , (Significant) 2. when they will be scheduled, and (Significant, although these are usually determi ned at the Departmental level. ) 3. to whom they will they teach. ( Significant, this is typically determined by the faculty at the Departmental level. ) 4.

(Significant, although this is usually determined at the admi nistrative level. ) When one con siders the function of a university, it is difficult to imagine decisions more 11 managerial than these. 2010 NLRB Reg. Dir. Dec. LEXIS 179, 65 -66 (NLRB Reg. Dir. Dec. 2010) Managerial Status In considering the managerial status of a Private College or University faculty such as in NLRB v. Yeshiva University , 444 U.S. 672 (1980 ), the Supreme Court defined managerial employees to be those who formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employers . The Court noted that managerial employees must exercise discre tion within, or even independently of, established employer policy, must be aligned with management, and must represent management interests by taking or recommending discretionary actions that effectively control or implement employer policy. The Board ha s held that the party seeking to exclude individuals as managerial has the burden of coming forward with the evidence necessary to establish such an exclusion . Quite simply, Managers are those who formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making ope rative the decisions of their employers , 261 NLRB 569, 572 fn. 17 (1982). Applying its managerial test to the faculty members in Yeshiva , the Supreme Court found the m to be managerial employees, based on their extensive authority over academic matters such as the school's curriculum, academic calendar, course schedules, student admission, student retention, matriculation standards, teaching methods and grading policie s. The Court noted that, on occasion, faculty views had determined the size of the student body, the tuition to be charged, and the location of a school. While the Court also 12 noted the faculty's predominant authority in nonacademic matters, such as hiring, tenure, sabbaticals, termination and promotion, which it found to have both managerial and supervisory characteristics, the Court did not rely primarily on these features of faculty authority but rather on their authority over academic affairs. The Boar d has applied the Yeshiva decision in numerous cases in Private College and University settings, most of which involved the managerial status of rank -and-file faculty members rather than Department chairs or their equivalents. The Board has emphasized the importance of faculty control or effective control over academic areas as opposed to nonacademic areas, LeMoyne -Owen College , Id. at 1128 (2005)(emphasis in original). The Board has generally found rank -and-file faculty to be managerial when they exercis e substantial control over academic matters. This is almost universal in Private Colleges and Universities. Administrators should not have any input into academic matters. For example, administrator s have little knowledge relative to the Physics. Departmen t and should not have input in such academic matters. The Board Has Made the Following Determinations in applying Yeshiva. In Livingston College , 286 NLRB 1308, 39 -40 (1987), the Board found faculty members to be managerial employees where they exercised substantial authority over curriculum, degree requiremen ts, course content and selection, graduation requirements, matriculation standards and scholarship recipients. The faculty members participated in academic governance through membership on various standing committees and by virtue of a faculty -wide vote on recommendations proposed by these committees. The Board placed only limited significance on the fact that the faculty had virtually no input into nonacademic matters such as the budget process, tenure decisions and selection of 13 administrators, and no auth ority in the hiring and firing of faculty. In Elmira College , 309 NLRB 842 (1992), the Board found faculty members to be managerial where committees comprised predominately of faculty members established the curriculum, had final authority to add new cour ses, to make changes in course content and level, to determine whether a particular course satisfied the College's requirements, and to approve student petitions to waive academic requirements, The faculty, through individual faculty members, divisions, or committees, approved degree candidates, student grading, course scheduling, class size, number of course sections, student advising, transfer course credits, and student retention and discipline related to academic performance. The Board held that, withou t more, the nature of faculty involvement in academic matters conclusively established their managerial status. In addition, however, they exercised considerable authority concerning the hiring of faculty and tenure decisions, although they had no authorit y over salaries. Faculty recommendations concerning both academic and nonacademic matters were generally followed by the college president. In LeMoyne -Owen College , 345 NLRB 1123 (2005), the Board found the faculty to be managerial where, through individ ual faculty members, a curriculum committee, an academic standards committee, and a faculty assembly composed entirely of faculty members except for two administrators, the faculty made or effectively controlled decisions with regard to curriculum, courses of study and course content, degrees and degree requirements, major and minors, academic programs and academic divisions, the addition and deletion of courses, teaching methods, grading, academic retention, lists of graduates, selection of honors, admissi on standards, syllabi and textbooks. The faculty also made effective decisions in some nonacademic area s, including tenure standards, tenure selection, and the faculty evaluation process. 14 However, the Board has found rank -and-file faculty to be non -manager ial in circumstances where they do not have substantial control over academic matters. In Carroll College, Inc. , 350 NLRB No. 30 (2007) vacated on other grounds 585 F.3rd 568 (D.C. Cir. 2009), the Board found faculty to be non -managerial where proposals made by a faculty committee regarding degree requirements, curriculum, and the addition and deletion of majors and courses are independently reviewed by the college administration and have been rejected by the administration. In Florida Memorial College , 263 NLRB 1248 (1982), the Board found faculty to be non -managerial where the curriculum was not within the faculty's absolute control and all curricular proposals had to be approved by the administration. Accord, University of Great Falls , 325 NLRB 83 (1 997); St. Thomas University , 298 NLRB 280 (1990). The Employer bases its contention that the Department heads are managerial largely on their role as members of the School Committee. I find that the Employer has failed to establish that the Department hea ds are managerial employees. I base this conclusion on the lack of control by Department heads over academic matters as members of the School Committee. The issue, then, is whether, by their role on that committee, the Department heads effectively recommen d or determine academic policy or action as described in Yeshiva. 2010 NLRB Reg. Dir. Dec. LEXIS 139, 36 -42 (NLRB Reg. Dir. Dec. 2010) In determining the appropriateness of a unit in a college or university environment, the Board applies the rules traditionally used to determine the appropriateness o f a unit, as set forth above. Livingstone College , 290 NLRB 304 (1988); Harvard College (1984); Cornell University , 183 NLRB 329, 336 (1970). In this regard, a campus or college -wide unit, like a plant -wide unit, is viewed by 15 the Board as p resumptively appropriate under the Act. Livingston College , supra; Western Electric Co ., 98 NLRB 1018 (1952). (This is NOT appropriate in a College or University setting, where there is a wide range of expertise from one Department to another.) See also \u00a7 9(b) of the Act. The burden of proving that the interests of a given classification of employees are so disparate from those of others that they cannot be represented in the same unit rests with the party challenging the unit's appropriateness. Greenhor ne & O'Mara, Inc ., 326 NLRB 514 (1998). In the instant case, the Employer has not met its burden of showing that the petitioned -for unit is inappropriate. Applying Yeshiva and its progeny to the facts in this case, we find that the faculty at LeMoyne -Owen College are managerial employees. Whether acting as individual faculty members, through committees, or in the faculty assembly, n15 we find that the faculty make or effectively recommend decisions in the majority of critical areas identified in Yeshiva and subsequent decisions interpreting and applying it. See e.g., Elmira College , 309 NLRB 842 (1992); Lewis & Clark College , 300 NLRB 155 (1990); American International College , University of Dubuque , 1123, 1128 -1129 (N.L.R.B. 2005) An election by secret ballot shall be conducted among the employees in the unit found appropriate, as early as possible, but not later than 30 days from the date below. The Regional Direc tor for Region 1 shall direct and supervise the election, subject to the National Labor Relations Board Rules and Regulations, Series 8, as amended. Eligible to vote are those in the unit who were employed during the payroll period ending immediately 16 befor e the date below, including employees who did not work during that period because they were ill, on vacation, or temporarily laid off. Also eligible are employees engaged in an economic strike which commenced less than 12 months before the election date an d who retained their status as such during the eligibility period and their replacements. Those in the military services of the United States may vote if they appear in person at the polls. Ineligible to vote are employees who have quit or been discharged for cause since the designated payroll period; employees engaged in a strike who have been discharged for cause since the commencement thereof and who have not been rehired or reinstated before the election date; and employees engaged in an economic strike which commenced more than 12 months before the election date and who have been permanently replaced. Those eligible shall vote whether or not they desire to be represented for collective -bargaining purposes by Milk Wagon Drivers and Creamery Workers Unio n, Local 380 , a/w International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America. 261 N.L.R.B. 565, 568 (N.L.R.B. 1982) The Board has been criticized for its lack of a consistent approach to the faculty managerial issue. n6 The 18 (?) Yeshiva criteria provide a valid and valua ble starting point for Board analysis. The Supreme Court highlighted the 18 criteria for a reason, the reason being to examine the entire gamut of faculty authority. The Yeshiva faculty possesses authority over 100 percent of this range, while the Dubuque faculty possesses authority over 44 percent of this range. The Yeshiva faculty were managerial employees, the Dubuque faculty are not. Accordingly, I would dismiss the unit clarification petition as to the faculty members. Dubuque University 289 N.L.R.B. 349 (N.L.R.B. 1988) 17 DIRECTION OF ELECTION An election by secre t ballot shall be held among the employees in the unit found appropriate, as early as possible but not later than 30 days from this date. The Regional Director shall direct and supervise the election, subject to the Board's Rules and Regulations. Eligible to vote are those employed during the payroll period ending immediately before this date, including employees who did not work during that period because they were ill, on vacation, or temporarily laid off. Also eligible are employees engaged in an economi c strike that began less than 12 months before the election date and who retained their employee status during the eligibility period and their replacements. Those in the military services may vote if they appear in person at the polls. Ineligible to vote are employees who have quit or been discharged for cause since the payroll period, striking employees who have been discharged for cause since the strike began and who have not been rehired or reinstated before the election date, and employees engaged in a n economic strike that began more than 12 months before the election date and who have been permanently replaced. Those eligible shall vote whether they desire to be represented for collective bargaining by St. Thomas University Faculty Association, a Chap ter of the United Faculty of Florida/NEA. To ensure that all eligible voters have the opportunity to be informed of the issues in the exercise of their statutory right to vote, all parties to the election should have access to a list of voters and their a ddresses that may be used to communicate with them. Excelsior Underwear , 156 NLRB 1236 (1966); NLRB v. Wyman - Gordon Co ., 394 U.S. 759 (1969). Accordingly, it is directed that an eligibility list containing the names and addresses of all the eligible voters must be filed by the 18 Employer with the Regional Director within 7 days of the date of this Decision On Review, Order and Direction of Election. The Regional Director shall make the list available to all parties to the election. No extension of time to fil e the list shall be granted by the Regional Director except in extraordinary circumstances. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be grounds for setting aside the election if proper objections are filed. St. Thomas University, Incorporated , Employe r and St. Thomas University Faculty Association, a Chapter Of The United Faculty Of Florida/NEA Petitioner 298 N.L.R.B. 280, 287 (N.L.R.B. 1990) IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FINDINGS Based upon the entire record in this matter and in accordance with the discussion above, I conclude and find as follows: 1. The hearing officer's rulings made at the hearing are free from prejudicial error and are hereby affirmed. 2. The Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act and it will effectuate the purposes of the Act to assert jurisdiction in this case. 3. The Petitioner is a labor organization within the meaning of Section 2(5) of the Act and claims to represent certain employees of the Employer. 4. No question affecting commerce exists concerning the representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning of Section 9(c)(1) and Section 2(6) and (7) of the Act. V. ORDER IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition herein be, and it hereby is, dismissed. 2008 NLRB Reg. Dir. Dec. LEXIS 12, 25 -26 (NLRB Reg. Dir. Dec. 2008) 19 There is no specific evidence concerning whether the Thiel College teachers are involved in decisions regarding academic calendars, student absence policies, enrollment levels, tuition, and the location of a school. However, art. II, B, of the faculty constitution, set forth in full supra, would appear to empower the faculty to make decisions in these areas. In addition, the Court clearly indicated that the faculties of only some of the 10 schools of Yeshiva covered by the petition effectively determined questions in these areas. 444 U.S. at 677. Last, we do not regard facult y involvement or lack of involvement in these areas as vitally significant. Like the teachers in Yeshiva University , the faculty herein controls the College's curriculum; each department makes recommendations regarding course offerings (and course conten t) which are reviewed by the faculty curriculum study committee, and which are ultimately approved or disapproved by the faculty through the faculty council. It also implements the curriculum in setting up course schedules and dividing the teaching load among the various departments' professors. Through the faculty council and its academic standing committee it supervises the overall academic performance of the College, including grade levels and academic standards. The faculty also determines who will be admitted and readmitted to the college; it establishes the academic requirements for obtaining degrees; and it certifies to the board of trustees, for its approval, those students eligible for graduation. In addition, each department prepares its own annual budget, which apparently is normally accepted by the College. The faculty is also involved in long -range financial and economic planning for the College. The faculty participates in setting its own salary and benefit le vels, and adjusts faculty and stude nt grievances. Finally, the Thiel College faculty makes effective decisions on hiring, tenure, sabbaticals, terminations, and promotions. 20 Although, as in Yeshiva , ultimate authority is vested in the board of trustees, we conclude that the faculty of Thiel College , like that of Yeshiva University , does not have professional interests separate from those of its employer, and that it necessarily plays a large role in operating the College. Thiel College , like Yeshiva University , \"requires faculty participati on in governance because professional expertise is indispensable to the formulation and implementation of academic policy,\" and therefore must depend upon its teaching staff \"to participate in the making and implementation\" of its policies. n35 Thiel Coll ege 261 N.L.R.B. 580, 586 (N.L.R.B. 1982) Again, almost all Private Colleges or Universities, the Departments are too distinct to fit under a \"plant -wide rule.\" In most Departments, the academic duties are quite distinct among each other. There simply is not a sufficient community of interest between the Engineering Department and the Sociology Department to make a plant -wide rule practical. They have distinct and significantly different products to present to the students. In addition, Business or Engineering School faculties have distinct salary requireme nts, that would be impossible to collectively bargain. (2) In the areas identified as \"significant,\" what evidence should be required to establish that faculty make or \"effectively control\" decisio ns? The Board asked, in its request for Amicus Briefs, wh ether or not the decisions of the Departments, or individual faculty members, can be effectively vetoed by the Deans or other University personnel, or whether the individual faculty members or Faculty Committees make, in essence, final decisions by the con sensus of the faculty committees. To designate whether or not decisions are signific ant, what evidence is required. ? As stated above, any documents or interviews of faculty and administration members relating to decision making authority should be conside red. In this regard, 21 first, a faculty committee most often makes hiring decisions. This can be confirmed through interviews with faculty members and administrators. In the typical hiring process, the faculty reviews any resumes the Department receives, sel ects the applicants to bring onto campus, sets up interviews and invites the other members of the Departmental faculty to interview the applicant, and, make what is in essence, the final decision. Also, the faculty decides who meets the criteria for tenure in the Department. They effectively control these areas of decision making, because, unless outlandish, the decisions are never vetoed by the administration. (3) Are the factors identified in the Board case law to date sufficient to correctly determine whether faculty are managerial? YES - As laid out in Yeshiva . First, it is necessary to understand the governance process at a University before one can decide whether or not the individual faculty members have a managerial role. Decisions at Private Col leges and Universities are made by individual faculty members or by consensus by the Departmental faculty and/or faculty committees. Once a decision has been made, the Department Head transmits the decision for information only, typically to a Dean, who has no authority to veto any faculty decisions. As stated earlier, in Yeshiva , the Supreme Court listed the following factors that faculty must have to be considered Managers: (1) control over curriculum and course schedules; (2) control over teaching meth ods; (3) control over grading policies; and (4) control over which students will be admitted, retained, and graduated. 22 In addition, the Regional Director referred to various non -academic factors that the Supreme Court listed in Yeshiva , but which the Supreme Court described as \"features of faculty authority\" upon which it did not need to \"rely primarily,\" 444 U.S. at 686 n.23: (1) control over hiring; (2) control over tenure; (3) control over sabbaticals; (4) control over terminations; and (5) control over promotions. Finally, in Yeshiva , the Regional Director touched upon several factors relied upon in previous Board decisions: (1) control over salary and benefits; (2) statements made by the Administration; and (3) the size of t he University's administrative component. These are not relevant to this determination. (4) If the Yeshiva factors are not sufficient, what additional factors would aid the Board in making a determination of managerial status for faculty? None. These ar e sufficient. (5) Is the Board's application of the Yeshiva factors to faculty, consistent with its determination of the managerial status of other categories of employees and, if not, They are consistent, however in most other businesses, individual e mployees are not give autonomous decision making authority. (a) may the Board adopt a distinct approach for such determinations in an academ ic context or Yes - It is necessary, as described above. The Board must first verify and recognize the nature o f University Governance, including the autonomous decision making authority 23 of individual faculty members and the Committees they serve on. (b) can the Board more closely align its determinations in an academic context with its determinations in non -acad emic contexts in a manner that remains consistent with the decision in Yeshiva ? NO - Autonomous individual and Departmental authority to make all academic related decisions is unique to Colleges and Universities. As long as the Board recognizes the auton omous decision making authority of individual faculty members and the Committees they serve on, they must use different criteria. (6) Do the factors employed by the Board in determining the status of university faculty members properly distinguish between indicia of managerial status and indicia of professional status under the Act? Yes - As long as the Board recognizes the autonomous decision making authority of individual faculty members and the Committees they serve on. (7) Have there been developme nts in models of decision making in private universities since t he issuance of Yeshiva that are relevant to the factors the Board should consider in making a determination of faculty managerial status? NO If so, what are those developments and how should they influence the Board's analysis? NON E24 (8) As suggested in footnote 31 of the Yeshiva decision, are there useful distinctions to be drawn between and among different job classifications within a facult y--such as between professors, associate professor s, assistant professors, and lecturers or between tenured and untenured faculty -- depending on the faculty's structure and practices? No - Typically, in performing an analysis of the factors described above, all faculty have the same decision making autho rity, regardless of their rank . The only difference is when tenured faculty decide whether Assistant Professors are granted tenure. Conclusion The Supreme Court was correct in the Yeshiva case. When the Region re ceives a Petition concerning a P rivate Coll ege or University, their investigation of the bargaining unit should be for a single academic Department and the major aspect of the Investigat ion should be whether or the faculty or faculty have the right to make academic decisions without further Administrative Review. /s/ Bruce F.

INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE The American Council on Education (\"ACE\") represents 1,800 accredited, degree - grant ing colleges and universities and higher education -related associations, organizations and corporations. Founded in 1918, ACE serves as the nation's unifying voice for higher education. ACE serves as a consensus leader on key higher education issues and seeks to influence public policy through advocacy, research and program initiatives. The National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (\"NAICU\") serves as the unified national voice of private, nonprofit higher education in the United State s. Founded in 1976, NAICU currently has nearly 1,000 members nationwide, including traditional liberal arts colleges, major research universities, special service educational institutions, and schools of law, medicine, engineering, business and other prof essions. NAICU represents these instit utions on policy issues primarily with the federal government, such as those affecting student aid, taxation and government regulation. Founded in 1956 , the Council of Independent Colleges (\"CIC\") is the major nation al ser- vice organization for small and mid -sized, independent, liberal arts colleges and universities in the United States. CIC has nearly 700 members and affiliates including liberal arts, comprehe n- sive and international institutions, as well as higher edu cation -related ass ociations. CIC works to - 2 - support college and university leadership, advance institutional excellence and enhance pr ivate higher education 's contributions to society . The Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Pennsylvania (\"AICUP\") is the only statewide organization that serves exclusively the interests of private higher education within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. AICUP provides its 8 8-member private colleges and universities with services and programs tailored spe cifically to the needs and situation of independent higher education. The College and University Professional Association for Human Resources (\"CUPA - HR\") serves as the voice of human resources in higher education, representing more than 11,000 human -resour ces professionals at over 1,700 colleges and universities across the country, inclu d- ing 90 pe rcent of all United States doctoral institutions, 70 percent of all master's institutions, more than half of all bachelor's institutions and nearly 500 two -year an d specialized institutions. Higher educatio n employs 3.3 million workers nationwide, with colleges and universities in all 50 States. The Association of American Universities (\"AAU\") is an organization of 59 United States and two Canadian major research i nstitutions committed to developing strong national and institutional policies supporting research and both graduate and undergraduate education. PRELIMINARY STATEMEN T When this case began almost a decade ago, it presented a relatively straightforward que s- tion: are Point Park University's full -time faculty members \"managerial e mployees\" who fall outside the scope of the National Labor Relations Act (\"Act\"), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-169? See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co. , 416 U.S. 267, 275 (1973) (implying from the Act's stru cture and history that \"Congress intended to exclude from the protections of the Act a ll employees pro p- erly classified as 'managerial'\"). That question is relatively straightforward because the S u- - 3 - preme Court of the United States has instructed the Board to consider well -defined factors in making the managerial dete rmination in the context of higher education. See NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ. , ysis, the Court held [in Yeshiva ], turns on the type of control faculty exercise over ac ademic affairs at an inst itution.\" Point Park Univ. v. NLRB , 457 F.3d 42, 46 (D.C. Cir. 2006) . The Regional Director and the Board originally determined that Poi nt Park University's full-time faculty members do not fall within the judicially implied exclusion for managerial employees. Importantly, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Colu m- bia Circuit reversed the Board's determination n early six years ago and r emanded this matter for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion , explaining that \" Yeshiva ident i- fied the relevant factors that the Board must consider .\" Point Park Univ. , 457 F .3d at 51 (em- phasis added) . As the Board 's call for amicus briefs concedes, the D.C. Circuit instructed the Board to \"identify which of the relevant factors set forth in Yeshiva . . . are significant and which less so . . . and to explain why the factors are so weighted .\" Notice, 2012 WL 1865034 , at *1 (emphasis added). Many of t he Higher Education Amici have filed multiple amicus briefs during this case's lengthy history. The last of those briefs was filed on August 24, 2007, and suppo rted Point Park University's request for Board review following the Regional Director's Suppleme ntal Decision on Remand, which was issued on July 10, 2007. Although the Board granted Point Park Unive r- sity's request for review on N ovember 28, 2007, the Boa rd failed to take any further action in this matter for over four years until, on May 22, 2012, a narrow majo rity of the Board invited third parties to address the following eight que stions: - 4 - (1) Which of the factors identified in Yeshiva and the relevant cases decided by the Board since Yeshiva a r e m o s t s i g n i f i c a n t i n m a k i n g a f i n d i n g o f managerial status for university faculty members and why? (2) In the areas identified as \"significant,\" what evidence should be required to establish t hat faculty make or \"effectively control\" decisions? (3) Are the factors identified in the Board case law to date sufficient to co r- rectly determine whether faculty are managerial? (4) If the factors are not suff icient, what additional factors would aid t he Board in making a determin ation of managerial status for faculty? (5) Is the Board's application of the Yeshiva factors to fa culty consistent with its determination of the managerial status of other categories of employees and, if no t, (a) may the Board adopt a distinct approach for such determ i- nations in an academic context or (b) can the Board more closely align its determinations in an academic context with its determinations in non - academic contexts in a manner that remains co nsistent with the decision in Yeshiva ? (6) Do the factors employed by the Board in determining the status of unive r- sity faculty members properly distinguish between indicia of managerial status and indicia of professional status under the A ct? (7) Have there been developments in models of decision making in private universities since the issuance of Yeshiva that are relevant to the factors the Board should consider in making a determination of faculty manag e- rial status? If so, what are those developments and how should they infl u- ence the Board's analysis? [and] (8) As suggested in footnote 31 of the Yeshiva decision, are there useful di s- tinctions to be drawn between and among diffe rent j ob classifications within a faculty \u2014such as between professors, associate professors, assi s- tant professors, and lecturers or between tenured and u ntenured faculty \u2014 depending on the faculty's structure and practices? Notice , 2012 WL 1865034 , at *1 -2. But see id. a t * 2 ( M e m b e r s H ay e s & F ly n n , d i s s e n ting) (concluding that it is \"unwise to further delay the processing of this case to solicit additional briefing\") . As set forth below, many of the Higher Education A m i c i address ed the narrow issues raised by the D.C. Circuit's mandate in their submission four years ago. Therefore, while the - 5 - Higher Educ ation Amici reiterate those arguments and refer the Board to the prior amicus brief, they will not burden the Board by repeating those arguments in detail in this brief. Instead, the Higher Education Amici wish to emphasize that the breadth of the Board 's call for argument and evidence from third parties and its very timing violates the D.C. Circuit's mandate. The D.C. Circuit did not remand this case for the Board to engage in de facto rulema k- ing outside the factual record presented by this case, let alone to conduct such rulema king six years after the D.C. Circuit issued its mandate. Accordingly, the Board should comply with the D.C. Circuit's mandate without further delay and reverse the Regional Director's supplemental decision, which, as explained in detail by the 2007 amicus submission, misapplied Yeshiva and Board precedent under Yeshiva . I. USING ADJUDICATION INSTEAD OF RUL EMAKING TO PROMULGATE STANDARDS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY BEYOND THE FACTS OF THIS CASE WOULD NOT ONLY CONSTITUTE AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION, IT WOULD VIOLATE THE D.C. CIRCUIT'S MA NDATE The \"choice between rulemaking and adjudication lies in the first instance within the Board's discretion.\" Bell Aerospace , 416 U.S. at 294. However, like all grants of discretion, there \"may be situations where the Board's rel iance on adjudication [instead of r u l e m a k i n g ] would amount to an abuse of discretion or a violation of the Act .\" Id.; see, e.g. , Pfaff v. U.S. Dep't of Housing & Urban Dev. , 88 F.3d 739, 748 (9th Cir. 1996) (fin ding ag ency abuses its discretion when, among other things, the \"new standard, adopted by adjudication [i nstead of through rulemaking], departs radically from the agency's previous interpretation of the law\" and \"is ve ry broad and general in scope and prospective in application\"); 1st Bancorp oration v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys. , 728 F.2d 434, 43 7 (10th Cir. 1984) (reversing agency orders because they were \"merely a vehicle by which a ge neral policy would be changed\" by the - 6 - agency, which should have been accomplished, if at all, through rulemaking, not adjudication); Ford Motor Co . v. FTC , 673 F.2d 1008, 1009 (9th Cir. 1981) (explaining \"agencies can proceed by adjudication to enforce discrete violations of existing laws where the effe ctive scope of the rule's impact will be relatively small; but an agency must proceed by rulemaking if it seeks to change the law and establish rules of widespread appl ication\"). The Board's recent use of calls for amicus briefs to conduct de facto rulemaking is both troubling and the subject of pending judicial proceedings. See Specialty Healthcare & Rehab. Ctr. of M obile, 356 NLRB No. 56, at *2 (Dec. 22, 2010) (asking amici to address, among other things, whether a unit of all employees performing the same job is a presumptively appropriate bargaining unit), cross -appeals pending sub nom. Kindred Nursing Ctrs. E., LLC v. NLRB , Nos. 12-1027 & 12 -1174 (6th Cir.) . Calls for amicus briefs do not satisfy the procedural and substa n- tive requirements imposed by the Administrative Procedure Act 's rulemaking requirements, nor do they render harmless the agency's error in using adjudication instead of rulemaking. See Specialty Healthcare , 356 NLRB No. 56, at *4 -6 (Member Hayes, dissen ting). More important, h owever, is the fact that the breadth of the Board 's call for amicus briefs in this case violates the D.C. Circuit's mandate. \"The decision of a federal appellate court,\" the D.C. Circuit e xplained long ago, \"establishes the law binding further action in t he litigation by another body subject to [the appellate court's] a uthority.\" City of Cleveland, Ohio v. Fed. Power Comm'n , 561 F.2d 344, 346 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (footnote omitted). \"The latter is without power to do anything which is contrary to either the letter or spirit of the mandate co nstrued in the light of the opinion of the court deciding the case, and the higher tribunal is amply armed to rectify any deviation through the process of mandamus.\" Id. (internal quotations, alteration and footnotes omitted). \"These principles, so familiar in operation within the hierarchy of judicial benches, - 7 - indulge no excepti on for reviews of administrative agencies .\" Id. (emphasis added and footnotes omitted); accord Ithaca College v. NLRB , 623 F.2d 224, 228 (2d Cir. 1980) (\"Of course, we do not expect the Board or any other litigant to rejoice in all the opinions of this Court. When it disagrees in a particular case, it should seek review in the Supreme Court. . . . [T]he Board cannot, as it did here, choos e to ignore the decision as if it had no force or effect. Absent reve r- sal, that dec ision is the law which the Board must follow.\"). The D.C. Circuit instructed the Board to \" identify which of the relevant factors set forth in Yeshiva . . . are significant a n d which l e s s s o . . . and to explain why t h e f a c t o r s a r e s o weighted. \" Notice , 2012 WL 1865034, at *1 (emph Point Park Univ. , 457 F.3d at 49 -50. However, all of the questions posed by the Board 's call for amicus briefs, save for the first, suggest that the Board intends to use this case as a vehicle to address issues that far exceed the scope of the D.C. Circuit's mandate. For example, the Board 's call for third parties to submit their views as to whether there are \"useful distinctions to be drawn between and among different job classifications within a faculty,\" Notice , 2012 WL 1865034, at * 2, injects a co m- pletely new issue into this case that none of the parties aske d the Board to d ecide a n d i s n o t presented by the record . Accordingly, the Board should comply with the D.C. Circuit's mandate without further delay and without conducting de facto rulemaking well outside the scope of the D.C. Circuit's mandate and the fac tual record presented by this case.* * The act of asking third parties to answer the first question regarding t he relative weight of the Yeshiva factors itself violates the D.C. Circuit's mandate given the e xtraordinary delay in posing the question. See In re Core Commc'ns, Inc. , 531 F.3d 849, 857 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 2008) ( e x p l a i n i n g \" t i m e l i n e s s [ o f a n a g e n c y ' s r e s p o n s e ] i s i m p l i c i t i n e v e r y r e m a n d b y t h i s court\" and issuing writ of mandamus because agency failed to respond to mandate in a timely manner); In re People's Mojahed in Org. of Iran , --- F.3d ---, No. 12 -1118, 2012 WL 1958869, at (continued) - 8 - II. EVEN IF THE BOARD 'S CALL FOR AMICUS BRIEFS DOES NOT VIOLATE THE D.C. CIRCUIT'S MANDATE, THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS POSED DO NOT ALTER THE CONCLUSION THAT POINT PARK UNIVE R- SITY'S FULL -TIME FACULTY MEMBERS ARE MANAGERIA L EMPLOYEES A. Effective Authority in Matters of Curriculum and Course Selection Are of Paramount Importance Under Yeshiva In question 1, the Board asks : \"Which of the factors identified in Yeshiva and the rel evant cases decided by the Boar d since Yeshiva are most significant in making a finding of man agerial status for university faculty members and why?\" Notice , 2012 WL 1865034, at *1. The 2007 amicus submission explained that Yeshiva and subsequent B oard decisions \"reflect a hie rarchy of academic factors relevant to managerial status: (i) faculty authority over the cu rriculum and course offerings is paramount among the factors relevant to managerial status; (ii) authority relating to course scheduling , grading, graduation, student admission and retention policies, matriculation standards, and teaching methods are important, but not determ inative; and (iii) authority regarding such other factors as tuition or faculty hiring and tenure are of lesser significance.\" 2007 Amicus Br. at 2. In other words, \"faculty authority in matters of curriculum and course selection is, for all practical purposes, a sine qua non of man agerial status.\" Id. at 12. \"[G]raduation policies, course scheduling, grading, stude nt admission and rete ntion policies, matriculation standards and teaching methods are also important and relevant consider ations, and faculty should ordinarily have authority in a majority of these areas to be considered manag e- *6 (D.C. Cir. June 1, 2012) ( p e r c u r i a m ) ( i s suing writ of mandamus where agency failed to comply with appellate court's mandate in less than two years). As Board Members Hayes and Flynn noted in their dissent from the Board's call for amicus briefs, it is \"unwise to further delay the processing of this case to solicit additional briefing\" where, among other things, the Board already has the 2007 amicus submission and the union voluntarily chose not to file a brief after the Board granted Point Park University's request for review almost five years a go. Notice , 2012 WL 1865034, at *2 (Members Hayes & Flynn, dissenting). - 9 - ment.\" Id. \"[O]ther conside rations, ranging from the academic calendar and course enrollment levels to faculty status matters, remain relevant considerations but were not central to the S u- preme Court's holding in Yeshiva and should not be determinative.\" Id. Noth ing in the intervening years has altered the above conclusions, nor has the pa ssage of time affected the validity of Yeshiva itself. Given the breadth of the Board 's questions, it bears emphasizing that Yeshiva remain s the law of the land until the Supreme Court ove rturns Yeshiva or Congress amends relevant provisions of the Act . Neither has o ccurred. B. In Determining Effective Authority, the Board Should Continue to Evaluate All Releva nt Evidence and Avoid Imposing an Evidentiary Burden That U n- dermines Yeshiva In question 2, the Board asks : \"In the areas identified as 'significant,' what evidence should be required to establish that faculty make or 'effectively control' decisions?\" Not ice, 2012 WL 1865034, at *1. Yeshiva i t s e l f e s t a b l i s h e s t h e l e g a l f r a m e w o r k o n t h i s i s s u e . T h e \"relevant consideration is effective r e c o m m e n d a t i o n o r c o n t r o l r a t h e r t h a n f i n a l a uthority.\" Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 683 n.17 (emphasis added). For example, the fact that the faculty's autho r- ity in certain areas may be circumscribed by fiscal or other long -range policy concerns does not diminish the faculty's effective power in polic ymaking and implementatio n. See id. at 683 n.17, 688 n.27. Moreover, the Board has consistently rejected a \"mechanical application of Yeshiva , i.e., counting and compa ring the number of areas in which faculty have input with the number of such areas in (D.C. 2004) (\"LeMoyne - Owen I \"); see also Univ. of Dubuque , 289 NLRB 349, 353 (1988) (explaining that a mechanical application of Yeshiva \"fails to ta ke into account the many different combinations and permut a- tions of influence that render each ac ademic body unique\"). Therefore, it would likewise be improper for the Board to set rigid standards for determining effective recommendation , espe- - 10 - cially in an environment such as higher education, where the prevalence of collegial decisio n- making requires an institution -specific inquiry rather than a wooden application of bright -line rules . As noted above, the most significant area for consideration is authority over curriculum and course offerings. In all areas, however, the Board should continue to use objective evidence such as historical data with respect to institutional decisionmaking (e.g., how often faculty re c- ommendations are a ccepted by an institution' s administration or governing body). See Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 688 n.27 (\"[I]nfrequent administrative reversals in no way detract from the instit u- tion's primary concern with the academic responsibilities entrusted to the fa culty.\"). The Board should also continue to use subjective evidence such as non -faculty members' perceptions r e- garding the influence of faculty recommendations. See Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 676 n.4 (crediting testimony of deans and other administrators regarding the influence of faculty recommend a- tions), 677 n.5 (same). Care should be taken not to impose an evidentiary burden that is so high that it essentially negates the judicially implied exclusion for managerial employees first reco g- nized by Bell Ae rospace and later applied to higher education by Yeshiva . C. The Factors Identified By Existing Precedent Are Sufficient to Accurately Determine Whether Faculty Are Managerial Employees In question 3, the Board ask s: \"Are the factors identified in the Board case law to date sufficient to correctly determine whether faculty are managerial?\" Notice , 2012 WL 1865034, at *1. Question 4, in turn, asks: \"If the factors are not sufficient, what addition al factors would aid the Board in making a determination of managerial status for faculty?\" Id. The Supreme Court in Yeshiva identified the factors the Board is to consider. A s t h e D.C. Circuit explained in applying Yeshiva to this case , the Board \" must consider the degree of faculty control over academic matters such as curriculum, course schedules, teaching methods, - 11 - grading policies, matriculation standards, admission sta ndards, size of the student body, tuition to be charged, and loca tion of the school.\" Point Park Univ. , 457 F.3d at 49 ( e m p h a s i s a d d e d ) . Even if one assume d for the sake of argument t h a t the Yeshiva f a c t o r s a r e n o t e x c l u s i v e , t he Higher Ed ucation Amici are aware of no evidence that the Yesh iva factors are insufficient, nor are they aware of any request by the parties for the Board to identify add itional factors. That Congress has not amended relevant provisions of the Act i n t h e 3 2 y e a r s s i n c e Yeshiva w a s decided provides com pelling evidence that Yeshiva is consistent with cong ressional intent and cannot be altered in the absence of congre ssional action. See, e.g. , Bell Aerospace , 416 U.S. at 275 (citing congressional acquiescence as evidence previous interpretation of Act satisfied co n- gressional i ntent). D. Yeshiva Recognizes That Higher Education Is Unique In question 5, the Board asks if its \"application of the Yeshiva factors to faculty [is] co n- sistent with [the Board's] determinat ion of the managerial status of other categories of emplo y- ees and, if not, (a) may the Board adopt a distinct approach for such determinations in an ac a- demic context or (b) can the Board more closely align its determinations in an academic context with its determinations in non -academic contexts in a manner that remains consistent with the decision in Yeshiva ?\" Notice , 2012 WL 1865034, at *1. Yeshiva e xpressly recognized that the Act cannot be applied to higher education in the same manner that it would be to private industry generally. \"The Act was intended to accomm o- date the type of management -employee relations that prevail in the pyramidal hiera rchies of private industry,\" the Supre me Court Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 680. \"In contrast, autho r- ity in the typical 'mature ' private university is divided between a central admin istration and one or more collegial bodies. . . . This system of 'shared authority' evo lved from the medieval model of collegial decisio nmaking in which guilds of scholars were responsible only to themselves.\" - 12 - Id. \"Distinguishing between excluded managers and included professional e mployees is a fact - intensive inquiry th at presents special challenges in the unique and often decentra lized world of academia.\" Point Park Univ. , 457 F.3d at 51. Therefore , the Board \"must determine whether the faculty in question so controls the ac a- demic affairs of the school that their inter ests are aligned with those of the un iversity or whether they occupy a role more like that of the professional employee in the 'pyramidal hiera rchies of private industries.'\" Id. at 48 (quoting Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 680). \"That,\" the D.C. Circuit e x- plaine d in this case, \"is by its very nature a fact -bound inquiry.\" 1128 factors to detailed factual record focused speci fically on collegiate employer a t i s s u e ). If such an i n q u i r y prove s d i f f e r e n t i n t h e context of higher education than it does in the context of manufa cturing, retail , health care o r any of the other myriad areas subject to the Board's jurisdiction , it is simply a product of the fact that , as reco g- nized by Yeshiva , higher education does not fit within the mold of pyramidal hie rarchies found in private industry generally . See Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 681 (explaining that the \"principles deve l- oped for use in the industrial setting cannot be imposed blindly on the academic world\") (internal quotations and citation omitted). E. The Board's Professional -Status Question Is Misdirected In question 6, the Board asks : \"Do the factors employed by the Boar d in determining the status of university faculty members properly distinguish between indicia of managerial status and indicia of professional status under the Act ?\" Notice , 2012 WL 1865034, at *2. One of the central les sons of Yeshiva , however, w a s t h a t m e r e ly b e i n g a p r o f e s s i o n a l employee does not preclude one from being a managerial employee. The Supreme Court specifically rejected the Board's argument that the judicially implied excl usion for manag erial employees Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 683 -84. Furthermore, in light of the fact - 13 - that Point Park University does not challenge the professional status of its full -time faculty, it would be imp roper for the Board to use this adjudication as a means to address an issue not presented by this case. F. There Have Been No Significant Developments in Private Universities' Dec i- sion-Making Models Since Yeshiva In question 7, the Board asks : \"Have there bee n developments in models of decision making in private universities since the issuance of Yeshiva that are relevant to the factors the Board should consider in making a determination of faculty managerial status? If so, what are those d evelopments and how should they influence the Board's analysis?\" N otice, 2012 WL 1865034, at *2. As outlined below, research supports the co nclusion that faculties continue to exert the same amount of influence and control, if not more, o v e r t h e a s p e c t s o f i n s t i t u t i o n a l governance identified in Yeshiva and subsequent Board decisions as being indicative of manag e- rial status. For the past 150 years, starting with Harvard University in 1826, the decision -making model of s hared governance has been utilized at most private colleges and universities. Due to the development of the research institution, increased professionalism of faculty, rapid enrol l- ment growth, the chan ging composition of the student body, and the volatile political climate of the 1960s, the model of shared g overnance has developed to increase faculty voice in various areas of institutional governance. See Willis A. Jones, Faculty Involvement in Institutional Gover nance: A Literature Review , 6 J. Professor iate 117, 119 -35 (2011) . Shared governance was utilized at Yeshiva University, which prompted the Supreme Cour t to conclude that the unive rsity's full -time faculty were managerial employees. See Yeshiva , 444 U.S. at 680. Shared governance is still the general rule at institutions today. Approximately 90 pe r- cent of four -year institutions curren tly have faculty governing boards that participate in instit u- - 14 - tional governance. Jones , supra , at 120. Recent research studies and articles confirm that facu l- ties still have influence over areas such as curriculum, the establishment of te aching standards, academic performance, and standards for promotion and tenure. See id. at 124 (collecting and discussing recent studies on faculty influence on instit utional governance). \"Faculty appear to be given great decision -making authority over the areas in which they pr esumably have the most expertise.\" Id. at 129 -30. Setting budget priorities and evaluating pres idents and vice presidents are areas where faculty sometimes had the least control. Ho wever, one st udy found that even where faculty had little overall control or influence over budgeting, they were often consulted on specific areas such as salaries and the merger or discontinuation of programs. Id. at 125. Such findings align with Yeshiva and subsequent decisions holding that faculty need not play an excl u- sive role in governing the inst itution. Two studies \u2014the 2001 Survey of Higher Education Governance and the 2003 survey conducted by the Center for Higher Education Policy Analysis \u2014provide additional data on the distribution of power among various parties on campus. The 2001 Survey of Higher Education Governance asked respondents (governing boards, presidents, deans and division heads, depar t- ment chairs and faculty governance bodies) at both private and public institutions to evaluate how their relative formal powers have changed in the last two decades. Gabriel E. Kaplan, How Academic Ships Actually Navigate , in Governing Academia 165, 17 8 (2004) . The ove rwhelming majority of private faculty gover nance bodies (92 percent) responded that they had the same or more power now. Id. Only 8 percent of fa culty governance bodies responded that they had less power. Id. Another question revealed that 86 percent of respondents from private institutions felt that the main representative body of faculty either influenced or directly made poli cy at the institution. Id. at 181. Almost 90 percent of faculties (private and public) had determinative or - 15 - joint authority with the administration on content of the curriculum; 69.9 percent had determin a- tive or joint authority on facul ty appointments; and 66.1 percent had determinative or joint a u- thority on tenure dec isions. Id. at 184. The survey also included questions from a 1970 American Association of University Pr o- fessors survey in order to see how go vernance ha s changed and whether shared governance has deteriorated in the face of economic challenges. One author summarized a comparison of the relevant findings of the studies as fo llows: [F]aculty participation in governance of academic matters increased over ti me. In 1970, faculties determined the content of curriculum at 45.6% of the institutions, and they shared a u t h o r i t y w i t h t h e a d m i n i s t r a t i o n a t a n o t h e r 3 6 . 4 % . B y 2 0 0 1 , faculties determined curriculum content at 62.8% of the institutions, and they shared authority at 30.4%. In 1970, faculties determined the appointments of full - time faculty in 4.5% of the institutions, and they shared authority at 26.4%. By 2001, faculties dete rmined appointments of full -time faculty in 14.5% and shared authority in 58.2% of the i nstitutions. Judith Areen, Government As Educator: A New Understanding of First Amendment Protection of Academic Freedom and Governance , 97 Geo. L.J. 945 , 966 n.99 (2009) . Similarly, the Center for Higher Education Policy Analysis survey asked all respondents (faculty, academic vice presidents a n d s e n a t e l e a d e r s ) t o r e p o r t t h e perceived level of faculty influence in decision making for various domains. See C t r . f or H ig h er E d u c . P o l 'y A n a ly s i s , Challengers for Governance: A National Report (2003) . The survey revealed that 67 percent of faculty reported having formal authority over undergraduate curriculum, 59 percent of faculty reported formal authority over tenure and promotion standards, and 50 percent of faculty r e- ported formal authority over the standards for evaluating teaching. Id. a t 8. Further findings show ed that over 75 percent of faculty at baccalaureate, master's and do ctoral instit utions believe there is sufficient trust and 70 percent of faculties believe there is sufficient communic ation - 16 - between administrators, a necessary element of successful shared gover nance. Jones , supra , at 122. Accordingly, recent surveys and articles support the conclusion that faculties not only continue to be heavily involved in the governance of institutions on many levels and in mult iple forms, but that such involvement has increased since Yeshiva was decided . G. The Use of Facult y Job Classifications Would Be Neither Sound Policy Nor Factually Supportable G i v e n t h e L a c k o f S t a ndardization Throughout Higher Education Finally, in question 8, the Board asks i f t h e r e a r e \" u s e f u l d i s t i n c t i o n s t o b e d r a w n b e- tween and among differ ent job classifications within a faculty \u2014such as between pr ofessors, associate professors, assistant professors, and lecturers or between tenured and untenured fa c- ulty\u2014depending on the faculty's structure and practices.\" Notice , 2012 WL 1865034, at *2. It is well established that job classifications are an inaccurate guide for determining an employee 's status under the Act . See, e.g. , 1168 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (rejecting use of job classifications as means to determine supervisory status ); R o c h e l l e Waste Disposal, LLC v. NLRB , 673 F.3d 587 (\"In determining whether someone is a superv isor, job titles reveal very little, if anything.\" ). Using job classific ations would be particularly unwise in this context because there is no set defin ition in academia used to describe a particular job title. Academic titles, and the policies that govern them, v ary widely among different instit utions. \"[T]erminology varies, making it diff icult, in some cases, to define clearly who may be included in a generalization and who may not.\" David W. Leslie, Part-Time, Adjunct and Te mporary Faculty: The New Majority?, A Report of the Sloan Conference on Part -Time and Adjunct Fa c- ulty 2 1 n . 1 ( M a y 1 9 9 8 ) ( u n p u b l i s h e d m a n u s c r i p t ) . Because of this inconsistency, attempts to - 17 - create useful distin ctions between and among different job classifications is neither sound policy nor factually su pportable. One distinction that is often drawn between facu lty members is the difference in tenure status. Ho wever, this distinction does not accurately categorize different faculty, their level of commitment or their interests. For example, a survey of 25 universities revealed that a signif i- cant po rtion of non -tenure -track (\"NTT\") faculty, 44 percent, is working at their institution full - time. A full -time NTT faculty member will often have interests similar to a full -time tenure - track (\"TT\") faculty member. Furthermore, while the titles of assistant, associate and full pr o- fessor are usually reserved for TT faculty members, the titles of lecturer, instructor, and visiting and adjunct pr ofessor are usually reserved for NTT faculty members. Id. However, these titles are not used exclusively to refer to one or the other. For example, while \"Professor,\" \"Associate Professor\" and \"Assistant Professor\" are generally used to describe TT faculty, those titles a c- count for 18 percent of NTT fa culty. Id. Similarly, the title of \"Adju nct Professor\" is used at institutions for both TT faculty and NTT faculty. Id. There are also significant practical distinctions between adjunct professors at different i n- stitutions. For example, adjunct faculty may or may not be salar ied depending on the institution. At some institutions adjunct faculties are given fixed -length appointments, while at others they can be given an indefinite appointment. Policies regarding benefits for a djunct faculty also vary among institutions. Some institutions provide no benefits for adjunct faculty while others pr o- vide adjunct faculty the same benefits as they do for TT faculty. There are similar distinctions for the titles of \"Le cturer\" and \"Senior Lecturer,\" which represent 0.5 percent of TT fa culty and 46 percent of NTT faculty, and \"Instructor,\" which represents 0.3 percent of TT faculty and 10 - 18 - percent of NTT faculty with regard to such things as length of appointment and ben efits. See id. (discussing variati ons at different institutions). A survey conducted by Hart Research Associates on behalf of the American Federation of Teachers (\"AFT\") also found that part -time/adjunct faculty members vary considerably in the extent of their participation in institution al governance . Am. Fed'n of Teachers, A National Survey of Part -Time/Adjunct Faculty , 2 Am. Academic 3 (Mar. 2010) . The AF T sur vey co n- firms findings from an earlier study in which 42 percent of the adjunct fac ulty surveyed \"r e- ported that part -time faculty had either a full or proportional vote in departmental decisions. A quarter of institutions reported that they extended instit utional -level voting privileges to part - time faculty.\" J udith M. Gappa, Employing Part -Time Faculty: Thoughtful Approaches to Co n- tinuing Pro blems, Am. Ass'n Higher Educ. Bull. 3, 5 (Oct. 1984) (citation omitted). There are also personal accounts from part -time professors attesting to the difference in treatment of part -time faculty at different in stitutions. For example, at Ventura College, \"a d- juncts can control their own courses, participate in curriculum revisions, and vote in departme n- tal meetings.\" Scott Smallwood, United We Stand? , Chron. of Higher Educ., Feb. 21, 2003, at A10. However, the same professor teaching part -time at College of the Canyons \"can't choose [his] own books, and taking part in curriculum discussions is unheard o f . \" Id. T h e r efore, at some institutions, an adjunct faculty member will be more like a full -time TT e mployee. Ultimately, though, the lack of consistency makes it impossible to identify useful distin c- tions between types of faculty based solely on job classification. As the D.C. Circuit e xplained in this case, \"[e]very academic institution is different, and in determining whether a particular institution's faculty are 'managerial employees' excluded from the Act ,\" the Board \"must pe r- form an exacting analysis of the particular institution and faculty at i ssue.\" Point Park Univ. , - 19 - 457 F.3d at 48. Moreover, the union has pet itioned to represent all of Point Park University's full-time fa culty, not some subset of that group based on job classification. Therefore, the job - classification issue is not presented by this case. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Board should comply with the D.C. Circuit's mandate without further delay and rev erse the Regional Director's supplemental dec ision.
