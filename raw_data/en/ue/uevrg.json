However, there is uncertainty about its prevalence and the factors that modulate the relationship between FI and HRQoL, which reduces the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical and public-health interventions. Data was taken from the 2004 representative cross-sectional population South Australian Health Omnibus, n = 3015 men and women aged 15 and over. The main outc...

In the adult the most common diagnosis is malignancy, and both primary and metastatic tumors should be considered. Other frequent options are infectious processes. We present the case of an 88-year-old female patient with a submandibular mass with inflammatory signs, unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, with fine needle aspiration biopsy showing an inflammatory lesion. The mass developed over a month with associated anorexia resulting in admis...

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether this is a normal consequence of aging or a feature of age-related comorbidities. The World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of anaemia, although commonly used, was based on small epidemiological data and did not include individuals over 64-years-old. The aim of the present study is to evaluate haemoglobin levels and establish a reference range for a Brazilian population ...

The objective of this study was to investigate the frequency of onychomycosis in elderly institutionalized, and to verify the effects that the infection had in their daily routine. This study was carried in gerontological complexes of Goi\u00e2nia, Goias, Brazil, with 58 elderly who exhibited clinical suspicion of onych...

Furthermore, there is substantial agreement among all guidelines that serum 25(OH)D concentrations < 25-30 nmol/L should be avoided in all age groups. In addition, hypovitaminosis D is a world health problem, and Brazil has an elevated prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among its population. In general, a 25(OH)D level of less than 20 ng/mL has been associated with neuromuscular performance issues in elderly people i...

Cancer screening studies show religion as a potentially influential factor in individual screening. The present study was an exploratory analysis of religious involvement (RI) among older safety-net clinic patients who participated in 90-day follow up calls during an intervention trial. Results show RI among participants (n = 185) did not significantly predict "}
