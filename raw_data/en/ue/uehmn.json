Because many of the symptoms of ADD are treatable with medication, physicians are rarely willing to engage with the complex web of causal factors that contribute to an ADD diagnosis. The focus of upper cervical chiropractic ADD treatment is on removing pressures or misalignments in upper cervical vertebra. While symptom management is an obvious objective, this process also aims to remedy abnormal nervous system responses that are linked to ADD. We also focus on ADD treatment without medication. ADD Symptoms The symptoms of ADD can range from relatively innocuous inattention gaffes to downright incapacitating hyperactivity or impulsivity tendencies. To give you a better idea of the debilitating effect of an attention deficit (both at school and in the workplace), we've listed some of the most common symptoms of ADD: - Incessant fidgeting - General forgetfulness - Nonstop talking - Imprecise motor activity - Frequently misplaces important items - Finding it difficult listening to instructions - Finding it difficult to organize jobs, stay on task, and meet deadlines How the Upper Cervical Spine Affects ADD When it comes to mental disorders, the biggest mistake we can make is to presume that the problem is all in the head. Environmental factors, prior injuries, and musculoskeletal conditions can all contribute to ADD symptoms. Although further research is required, a growing body of work suggests that some cases of ADD may be connected to spinal cord impedances which prevent neural signals from travelling from the brain and initiating behavioral functions. This means that a misalignment in the spinal vertebra could disrupt the neurology-behavior relationship, potentially causing or exacerbating ADD symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. How Our ADD Treatment Works Our goal is to use non-invasive chiropractic techniques to remove any barriers between the brainstem and spinal cord. In order to achieve this goal, we must first test whether a patient has a misalignment in the upper cervical spine. To identify and locate a misalignment, we utilize a variety of objective chiropractic tests. If these tests indicate the presence of misaligned vertebra, we will follow up with a Cone Beam CT (CBCT) scan. Significantly less invasive than an X-Ray, CBCT scans allow us to get a more precise reading on the angle and direction of a misalignment. With this information, we will be able to put together a personalized consultation and adjustment program. If you're worried about discomfort, worry no more \u2014 all our chiropractors are trained to avoid adjustment techniques that pull, crack, or twist the neck and spine. While we're based in Las Vegas, Clark County, we offer ADD treatment in several neighboring states, including Arizona, California, and Utah.
