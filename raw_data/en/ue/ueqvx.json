The publication describes an original non -invasiv e method in non -human primate by positron emission tomography for spatio -temporal monitoring of the vaccine trafficking . The results show that the Nanotaxi\u00ae CHOLK a new type of vector derived from a natural sugar allows efficient delivery of mRNA in antige n-presenting cells at the injection site and in draining lymph nodes . Those professional cells are essential to the establishment of a strong adaptive immune response. This Nanotaxi\u00ae CHOLK consists of a single molecule that forms supramolecular assemblies with mRNA by a simple self-assembling process. The phys icochemical properties of CHOLK/mRNA assemblies lead to the ide al biodistribution in lymph nodes and the delivery of messenger RNA molecules within key cells of the immune system. Bruno Pitard , CSO and founder of In-Cell-Art, says \"Vaccination using nucleic acids such as messenger RNA (mRNA) for antigen expression generates considerable interest and expectation for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Nevertheless, the development of this new generation of vaccin es will not be achieved without new classes of vector capable of efficiently transporting the mRNA molecules within the cytoplasm of the cells of interest. Today, no mRNA - based vaccine has shown protection in phase 3 clinical trials. The induction of a robust humoral and cellular vaccine response involves the expression and presentation of the antigen to lymphocytes B and T in the lymph nodes . Today, as demonstrated in this article, and after 20 years of research in the field of macromolecular drug delivery , ICA has accumulated unique technical skills and resources that allow it to design a unique specific synthetic delivery system for the development of new generations of vaccines using messenger RNAs for antigen expression \" *this article appears in Nature Biomedical Engineering and can be found online at: https://doi.org/10.1038 /s41551 -019-0378 -3 About I n-Cell-Art In-Cell-Art (ICA) which is headquartered in Nantes (France) is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the preclinical and pharmaceutical development of nanocarriers named Nanotaxi \u00ae for macromolecular drugs. Its founder and research team, which includes a Nobel Laure ate, have designed new classes of vectors that are organized on a nanometric In-Cell-Art announces the publication in Nature Biomedical Engineering of a Nanotaxi\u00ae for messenger RNA vaccine scale, which enables them to cross the cell barrier efficiently and safely. ICA Nanotaxi\u00ae technology displays unique properties for development of: DNA Vaccine s ICA614 Nanotaxi \u00ae, an innovative DNA synthetic formulation, offers unique efficient and industrial features such as the dramatic enhancement of the immunogenicity of plasmid DNA -encoding tumours or pathogen -derived antigens, a reduction in the dose of plasmid DNA, as well as an excellent safety profile. ICA614 Nanotaxi \u00ae represents a crucial step in DNA vaccine development, and GMP fill/finish of ICA614 Nanotaxi \u00ae, as well as regulatory - evaluation of ICA614 Nanotaxi \u00ae alone HEPAVAC (Hepatocellular vaccine candidate) have been achieved successfully. mRNA Vaccine s Some other ICA Nanotaxi \u00ae are also being assessed in $33.1 million RN -ARMORVAX consortium, co -funded by US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) . The consortium would validate the new application of ICA Nanotaxi \u00ae for mRNA -based vaccines for infectious diseases in collaboration with CureVac and Sanofi -Pasteur. mRNA Replacement Therap ies Some other ICA Nanotaxi \u00ae are also developed to improve the l imited efficacy and stability of mRNA therapeutics , leading to the dramatic increase in therapeutic protein expression without DNA -encoded gene. Therapeutic antibodies In the absence of recombinant antigen, ICANtibodies allows, from an in silico DNA antigenic sequence, the production of the most ambitious functional antibodies against any natively expressed nuclear, cytoplasmic, secreted or membrane proteins.
