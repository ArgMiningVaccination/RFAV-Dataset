The current state of health for children in the United States, (the world's wealthiest nation with the world's most expensive healthcare system), is currently reaching scandalous proportions. Here is just a small sampling of this disturbing trend: - A staggering 400% increase in childhood asthma - Highest infant mortality rate (industrialized world) - 1 in 6 children now have a neurological disorder (ADD, ADHD, Dyslexia, Learning Disability, etc.) - 1 in 160 children now have autism - 5,000 to 10,000 children die each year from SIDS - A five-fold increase in infant food allergies - A 54% increase in childhood obesity - Childhood Diabetes rates are skyrocketing - 9 million children are now being prescribed neuro-trophic (anti-anxiety) drugs The frequency of autoimmune diseases in children right now is higher than it has ever been in the history of medicine! Diseases such as Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile Diabetes, Pediatric Asthma, Pediatric Crohn's Disease (inflammation and ulceration of the bowel), Guillain-Barre Syndrome (progressive muscle weakness) and many others are skyrocketing with a perplexed and sometimes indifferent medical community, freely admitting that they are \"baffled\". With no place to turn, families are increasingly calling out for help. For millions of families all over the world, Chiropractic is answering that call and coming to the rescue. We hope you will join this wellness revolution and become part of our Chiropractic family.
