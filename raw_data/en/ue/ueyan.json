A urinary tract infection, usually referred to as UTI, is a bacterial infection that affects the bladder and/or other parts of the urinary system, causing urinary urgency, often accompanied by a burning pain when you go to the bathroom. [Acupuncture and TCM](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=28133) is a good way to get to the root causes of [frequent urination](https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/frequent-urination/basics/causes/sym-20050712), including [recurrent UTIs](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.16315). Urinary frequency, or an unusual urgency to urinate, can be caused by several different health conditions. A common cause of bladder pain, pressure on the bladder, or a burning sensation when peeing is a bacterial infection in the urinary tract, or UTI. But there can be many other reasons for constantly feeling like you have to pee, including [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), interstitial cystitis (IC), pregnancy, prostate problems, [ovarian cysts](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and more. Over half of all adult women have experienced a UTI (also called cystitis) at some point in their lives. Many [women get UTIs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502976/) frequently, making them the most common type of non-hospital-related infection in the U.S. Up to 6% of all doctor visits are related to UTIs. A UTI can occur when bacteria, usually E. coli, gets into the urethra and travels up into the bladder, or further into the urinary tract. This can happen because of hygiene habits, after sex or exercising, or the use of contraceptives or period products. It can also happen when urine sits in the bladder for too long, or because a person has a weakened immune system. While UTI treatment at home remedies such as drinking cranberry juice are popular, most women recognize that once they get that constant urge to pee, they have no choice but to rush to the doctor for antibiotics. Typical [UTI medical treatment](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353453) almost always involves confirming the infection by lab analysis, and a prescribed course of antibiotics, along with analgesic medicine (such as Pyridium) to help the UTI pain in bladder. Unfortunately, many women keep getting UTIs. Infections that are [antibiotic resistant](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/antibiotic-resistant-urinary-tract-infections-are-on-the-rise-2019101417982) are increasingly common, and antibiotics do not get to the root of the problem. [Interstitial cystitis (IC)](https://www.ichelp.org/about-ic/causes-of-ic/), or [painful bladder syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-interstitial-cystitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), is a condition that causes a constant sensation of having to pee, or bladder pressure, even when there is no infection present. Recurrent UTI and IC are a significant source of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) for women, as they can cause almost constant pain and an inability to leave the house due to the constant urge to urinate. UTI in men is not as common as UTI in women. The more common cause of frequent urination in men is [benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), in which an enlarged prostate presses on the urinary organs, blocking the flow of urine, and causing backup that can lead to bacterial [urinary tract infection men](https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/urinary-tract-infection-in-men-a-to-z). Sometimes what feels like a UTI might be something else. Growths in the pelvic area, such as ovarian cysts, [uterine fibroids](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or tumors can cause pressure in the bladder, bladder pain, or urinary frequency at night. Even when there is no infection, there may urinary symptoms such as: - Strong urge to pee frequently (more than 8 times per day) - Difficulty urinating - Urine is different color than usual - Pain during peeing, or burning sensation when peeing - Nocturia, frequent urination at night The conventional medicine answer to UTI is antibiotic treatment, but this is not the only answer for everyone. TCM methods of acupuncture and herbs can help with improving the function of bladder and kidney systems, reducing symptoms from recurrent UTIs, as well as helping to address the deeper problems that cause inflammation and pressure in the bladder. Top 10 Urinary Frequency Causes There are many possible causes of [frequent urination](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15533-urination--frequent-urination). - UTI (urinary tract infection, also called cystitis, or bladder infection) - Kidney infection - when bacteria move further up into the urinary tract, the [kidneys](https://www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-disease/kidney-problems/kidney-infection.html)can become infected. Sometimes people with [nerve damage](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)in the spine cannot feel UTI symptoms (neurogenic bladder), so the infection becomes more widespread. [Bladder stones](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20354339)- when the bladder does not empty completely, urine can crystallize and form hard stones, causing pain during urination. - Interstitial cystitis (painful bladder syndrome) - a syndrome of urinary pain symptoms, the exact cause of which is unknown. Inflammation of the bladder lining may be due to trauma (from surgery or delivery/birth), overdistension, or dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles. - Prostatitis - inflammation of the prostate accompanied by irritation of the nerves in the area; not necessarily an infection, although a bacterial infection of the prostate can occur. - Urinary incontinence - leakage of urine, occurs when the urethral sphincter that controls the flow and stoppage of urine is weak. More common in women and older people. - Vaginitis - inflammation of the vagina, usually due to infection. [Candida, or yeast infection](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-candida-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), is one type of vaginitis. - Diabetes - can cause a variety of urinary problems, due to the body producing more urine to process blood sugar, and nerve damage that leads to urinary retention and incontinence. Constant thirst is also a sign of diabetic urinary symptoms. - Side effects of [cancer treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/)in pelvic area - [cancer treatments](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/urination-changes)that affect the pelvis, including radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and surgeries to remove pelvic organs, can all cause irritation or damage to the bladder. - Overactive bladder (OAB) - a group of symptoms, including frequent urination, leakage, nocturia (getting up to pee at night), and primarily, a strong urge to urinate often. Considered to be caused by inappropriate signalling of the nerves that communicate between the brain and the urinary tract organs. Causes of frequent urination vary somewhat according to biological sex. Frequent urination in men is often caused by prostate problems, while frequent urination in women may be due to pregnancy or other womens' health conditions related to the ovaries or uterus. Pressure on the bladder because of pregnancy, or from other organs, can also cause urinary frequency and discomfort. This can happen due to an anterior prolapse, when the pelvic floor is weakened, and the uterus, intestine, or bladder drop from their normal position. When a woman is pregnant, the heavy uterus often causes more frequent urination, or, in some cases, urinary retention. Damage or trauma to the pelvic floor can occur during delivery, so many women experience weak pelvic floor muscles, prolapsed uterus or bladder, and ongoing urinary urgency after they have had a baby. In men, an enlarged prostate or [prostatitis](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/p/prostatitis-(infection-of-the-prostate)) (infection and inflammation of the prostate) can put pressure on the bladder and other parts of the urinary system. A frequent need to pee can also be caused by drinking too much coffee or alcohol, or taking diuretics. Can Acupuncture Help Frequent Urination? In Chinese Medicine, urinary problems come under the classification of \"Lin Syndromes.\" Lin disorders generally involve painful, \"dribbling\" urination and are caused by disharmonies in the Bladder and Kidneys, as well as involving other major organs like the Heart, Liver, and Spleen. Dampness and Heat are the primary pathogenic factors, so we use acupuncture treatment and herbal formulations to clear heat and dampness from the body. Top 5 TCM differentiations of UTI: - Damp Heat - characterized by frequent urination, burning sensation when peeing, painful pressure in bladder, dark urine or cloudy urine that smells unusual, feelings of nausea, bitter taste in mouth - Heart Fire - frequency and urgency, thirst, hot, red face and chest, trouble sleeping/insomnia, irritability, anxiety, [heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Liver Fire - excess heat causes painful burning during urination, headaches, [ringing in ears/tinnitus,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/)constipation, feelings of anger and frustration, redness in eyes and face. - Fatigue Lin - covers urinary disorders that involve incomplete emptying of the bladder, due to prostate enlargement or prolapsed pelvic organs. - Stone Lin - obstructions of the urinary system due to buildup of minerals that create stones in the bladder, [kidney stones](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), etc. Patients who have problems with recurring UTIs may be resistant to the antibiotics they've been given. TCM herbs can be used as an additional or alternative remedy from antibiotics and help to strengthen the immune system overall. [One review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6481503/) of studies involving the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for UTIs concluded that the herbs, whether used alone or in conjunction with antibiotics, worked better than antibiotics alone. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447293/) showed that women who were prone to getting UTIs who were treated with acupuncture as preventative care only got a UTI one-third as often as women who didn't receive acupuncture. Acupuncture has also [been shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28326514/) to be highly effective for bladder pain due to interstitial cystitis. Studies have also shown that [TCM treatment](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1823-acupuncture-restores-urine-flow-blocked-by-enlarged-prostate) can relieve the blockage of urine caused by an enlarged prostate (BPH). Top 5 Tips for Preventing UTI What a relief! Now that you've gotten over that urinary tract infection, it's important to take steps to prevent getting another UTI. Here are some natural ways to prevent UTIs: - Drink more water - This may seem counterintuitive, as you don't want to have to pee even more. But you do want to be constantly flushing bacteria out of the urinary tract. Avoid drinks like coffee and soda, which can be irritating to the bladder. - Go when you feel you need to - Some therapies for overactive bladder or IC involve training yourself to hold urine, but for most people, this is not a good idea. Retaining urine for too long contributes to bacterial growth and causes overdistension of the bladder. - Hygiene - be sure to wipe from front to back when you go to the bathroom. Change clothes and underwear often, especially after sweating. During your menstrual period, change your pad and tampon frequently. - After sex - always go to the bathroom and urinate before falling asleep. - Avoid chemical products - Avoid using deodorants, douches, or scented wipes around the genital area. Consider whether contraceptive products like spermicides might also be part of the problem. Acupuncture Near Me for UTI While it is rare for a UTI to become so serious that you have a fever or become nauseated, urinary problems should be taken seriously before they become worse. If your UTIs keep coming back, or you constantly feel like you have to pee, it may be a sign that there is something deeper going on. As people age, urge incontinence, prolapsed organs due to weak pelvic floor muscles, and nerve damage can lead to more serious bladder problems. TCM provides a holistic way to treat urinary tract issues, as well as other, possibly hidden conditions in the pelvic region. Urinary urgency may be a signal of something else, so don't ignore it. Consult with your acupuncturist to find urinary frequency relief. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

[ The Ultimate Guide to the Acupuncture Point on Head for Headaches ](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) by Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Why does the TCM doctor always put an acupuncture needle in top of head? If you've had acupuncture before, it's likely that your acupuncturist used some acupuncture points on head during your treatments. Using pressure points on the head is something TCM doctors do often, because there are so many useful acupressure points on the head, especially acupuncture points top of head. There are head pressure points for [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), points to relieve [migraines](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), acupressure head points to help anxiety, fatigue, allergies, and many other conditions. Even if you're coming in for acupuncture to help some other condition, whether it's chronic pain, an autoimmune disease, heart problems, or kidney problems, probably at some point your acupuncture practitioner is going to use acupoints on head to help you relax during your treatment. Every single person who comes into our office for acupuncture is suffering from some form of stress, and using [certain points on the top of the head](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2016/4943204/) can help with [stress relief](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) right away. Other common reasons to use pressure points in neck and head include: - to fight [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - headache and migraine - allergies, [asthma](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-asthma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), problems, [common cold](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - anxiety [nervous disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3833481/) - thyroid disorders - hormone imbalances - more [mental focus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), improved memory and Meniere's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [toothache, dental pain, dental anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Why are pressure points on the head so powerful? To answer this question, let us explain a bit about the meridian system in TCM. TCM Meridian Head Points TCM is based on interdependent systems of organs and [energy channels](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2014/836392/) that run through the body. The channels are known as meridians, and along them flows Qi, the life energy that animates the body and all of its functions. There are 12 major meridians and 8 major vessels; the meridians are close to the surface of the skin, and the vessels, which essentially connect all the meridians, are deeper inside the body. While the way in which we think of the [meridian pathways](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2005290110600143) is more metaphorical than physical in nature, they can be considered roughly analogous to the circulatory system of blood vessels or the network of nerves of the nervous system as we think of them in conventional Western medicine. Along the meridians lie acupoints, specific points that we stimulate with acupuncture needles during acupuncture treatment or with the fingers and thumbs during acupressure massage. The interconnectedness of the organs, meridians, and individual points is the foundation of acupuncture theory. We use specific points on a meridian in order to address issues in a particular organ or organ system that corresponds (energetically) with that meridian. There are several pressure points for head and neck pain, points to help relieve allergies, pressure points for frontal headache, and more. Several of the major meridians originate or end in the head: - Gall Bladder (GB) meridian - points of the gall bladder meridian wrap around the side of the head, the forehead above the eyebrow, the temple, around the ear, and down the back side of the neck-just as the pain of a migraine often does. Then it continues down from the intersection of the neck and shoulder, zig-zagging across the torso, and finally running down the leg and ending in the fourth toe. This meridian is used to treat severe headaches, stress, tension that affects the shoulder and neck, and bile-related problems. - Large Intestine (LI) meridian - begins at the points of the index finger, travels up the arm, through the shoulder and neck, then comes up to the lower corner of the nose. This meridian is involved in \"letting go,\" both from the eliminatory organs of the lower body, and exhalations from the nose. - Stomach (ST) meridian - the ST meridian starts near the eye, swoops up to the side of the top of the head, comes down next to the mouth, and continues down through the neck, chest, center of the body, down the leg, ending at the point of the second toe. [This meridian](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/stomach-meridian)is used to treat Shen (spirit) disorders, like insomnia, anxiety, palpitations, memory problems, and blood deficiency. - Small intestine (SI) meridian - originates in the little finger, runs up the arm into the shoulder and then branches out, some of it going into the major organs of the heart, stomach, and small intestine; then other branches go up into the face, by the cheekbone and right in front of the center of the ear. The SI is used to treat fevers and mental health conditions, among other things. - Bladder (UB) Meridian - begins at the inner canthus of the eyes, goes up and over the top of the head, about an inch away from the midline on either side, and then all the way down the back and leg, ending in the little toe. Used to help with invasion disorders (wind, cold, heat etc.) that affect the eyes, sinus headaches, allergies, [stuffy head](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [neck pain and stiffness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Triple burner meridian, also known as San Jiao (SJ) - begins at the tip of the ring finger, then goes up the arm, through the shoulder and chest, up the side of the neck and comes up around the ear, and into the temple and outer brow bone. The San Jiao head points are used to work on dizziness, headaches, eye twitching, and [dental pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Conception vessel - also known as the Functional Channel, or the Front Channel, or Ren Mai, this vessel originates at the navel, then drops down to the perineal area, and runs back up the center of the front of the body, ending in a point on the chin, in the dip just under the lower lip. This vessel controls the Yin energy of the body and is essential to the health of the reproductive organs and [fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Governing vessel, also known as the Extraordinary vessel, the \"Sea of Yang\" or Du Mai - originates in the lower back near the kidneys, runs up the spine and around and over the top of the head, ending in the middle of the face. This vessel controls the Yang energy of the body, and in particular the kidneys, the back and spine. Top 10 Acupuncture Points on Head Of course, your acupuncturist will not only use acupoints on your head during a treatment session. We choose a variety of points that will work together to alleviate symptoms and help optimize the functioning of the organs. These specific head points may be used as part of a treatment to work on a specific symptom or condition: - Yin Tang, or the \"Hall of Impression\" - this is what is called an \"extraordinary point,\" meaning it doesn't really belong to a meridian; it stands on its own. Right in the third eye, it is used to reduce anxiety, [vertigo (dizziness)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), help promote better sleep, clear wind and congestion, and relieve sinus pain and headache. - DU21 - [Shen Ting](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Points/DU+24+(GV+24)/370), \"Spirit Court\" - Right in the front middle of the top of the head, about an inch above the hairline. This is one of the pressure points for frontal headache, also good for sinusitis, nosebleeds, anxiety, [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and sleep problems. - DU 20 - Baihui, or \"The meeting of the 100s\" - right in the very center of the top of the head, master of endocrine and nervous system, used for [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), fatigue, mental focus, relaxation, hypothyroid, adrenal problems, hormone imbalance, headaches. - Si Shen Chong - \"Four Alert Spirit\" - this is actually a set of four \"extraordinary points,\" which surround DU20. Very helpful for sleep disorders, [memory disorders](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), dizziness, and headaches. - GB20 - Feng Chi, \"Wind Pool,\" low back of the head, where the skull meets the neck muscles, helps headaches, migraine, [blurred vision](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-glaucoma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), fatigue, neck pain and stiffness. We may use this point when a patient has [a cold](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/); this is a point where cold wind can get into the body, and why it is important to wear a scarf to protect your neck when it's cold and windy out. - Taiyang \"Great Sun\" - Right in the depression of the temple, this point can help dizziness, one-sided headaches, migraines, sensitivity to light, and jaw pain, TMJ. - GV26 Shui Gou - in the mustache area, between the nose and mouth, right in the center of the crease, this point helps to calm the mind and restore mental focus. Also used as first aid when a person faints or is in shock. Helps stop hiccups. Helps with serious neurological disorders like [epilepsy, seizures](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Also good for low back strain. - LI20 Ying Xiang \"Welcome Fragrance\" - located in the lower corner of the nose, right in the nasolabial groove, used to alleviate congestion, allergy itching in the nose, and to clear the nasal passages. - ST8 - Touwei, about 5 finger widths above the eyebrow, dispels dampness, used for \"splitting headaches,\" frontal headache, migraines, headache with nausea and/or vomiting, vision problems, tearing eyes, eye twitching, dizziness/vertigo, hair loss. Helps with mental health, when a person is \"overthinking\" things, or having repetitive thoughts. - BL2 - Zhanzhu - located at the inner corner of the eyebrow, good for itchy, watery eyes due to allergies, other eyes problems like glaucoma, night blindness, and sinus headache. Facial Acupuncture Points As we have mentioned, some pressure [points on the face](https://www.healthline.com/health/pressure-points-for-face) are used to help relieve sinus congestion, nasal congestion, and other issues related to common colds and flus or allergies. Points on the face may also be used to help the [facial paralysis](http://koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201517058945069.page) of [Bell's Palsy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bells-palsy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Naturally, we also use acupuncture points on the face as acupuncture points for the face, that is, when we are striving for facial rejuvenation. This technique is sometimes called an acupuncture facial. Using points on the face can help to stimulate collagen production, help to tighten the skin, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and strengthen the facial muscles. People of all ages and genders can benefit from acupuncture skin care. Cosmetic acupuncture can [treat signs of aging skin](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aging-skin-with-cosmetic-acupuncture/) like sagging, puffiness under the eyes, and dryness. Self-Care With Acupressure Head Points What is acupressure? Acupressure is a form of massage that goes back thousands of years in Chinese Medicine. Stimulating the same points we needle in acupuncture treatment with your fingers and thumbs can be beneficial for different types of headaches and neck stiffness, to calm anxiety, and bring more mental clarity. Choose a time when your environment is quiet and free of distractions, the same as you would for a meditation practice or home workout. Be sure to breathe deeply and smoothly as you perform self-acupressure. Press firmly, applying deep pressure to a point in a small, gentle circular motion. Giving yourself an acupressure treatment only takes a few minutes, and it is a great way to take care of yourself between acupuncture sessions. Acupuncture Near Me for Headaches and More Every time you come in for acupuncture treatment, your TCM doctor is looking for ways to treat your overall condition, but also focusing on how you are feeling right now, today. Often, people are feeling tired and stressed, beyond and in addition to the health condition that caused them to seek out alternative medicine in the first place. Using points on the head that help fatigue, calm a racing mind, and reduce the physical effects of stress is one way that your acupuncturist is practicing preventative care, while at the same time, making sure you leave your treatment feeling rested and reenergized. The next time you come in for a visit, be sure to let us know how you're feeling, and feel free to ask us, \"What is that point on my head for?\" *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Herpes simplex is one of the [most common](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-05-2020-massive-proportion-world-population-living-with-herpes-infection) kinds of infectious disease, affecting several billions of people worldwide. It is estimated that about 66% of the world's population has had a HSV-1 infection at some point in their lives. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the viral infection that is associated with [oral herpes](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/herpes-hsv1-and-hsv2/oral-herpes) or orolabial herpes-the one that causes sores around the mouth, often referred to as \"cold sores\" or \"fever blisters.\" Herpes simplex virus type is the kind that causes genital herpes. Herpes virus is related to varicella-zoster viruses, the viruses that cause Chickenpox and [Shingles](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shingles-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). How do you get herpes? The skin infection caused by herpes simplex spreads from person to person through close contact. HSV-1, or oral herpes, can spread through sharing utensils, toothbrushes, or towels, or by touching one of the mouth sores, or kissing. HSV-2, or genital herpes, is usually spread through sexual contact is therefore considered a sexually transmitted disease (STD). In fact, either one of the two viral infections can cause sores on the mouth or genital area, or even on other parts of the body. If oral herpes, or HSV-1, gets into the eyes, it can cause serious damage, even causing scarring or permanent loss of vision. A person can pass herpes to another person even if they aren't having an active outbreak with visible sores. A pregnant woman can pass the herpes virus to her baby during birth, and the virus can also be passed during breastfeeding. Once a person has been infected with HSV-2, the virus stays in the body and can lie dormant, then resurface in periodic recurrent outbreaks. Initially, herpes skin disorders manifest in the skin cells, causing the red, painful, blister-like sores. After a while, the infection moves deeper, into the nerve cells, where it can lie dormant until something happens to activate it again, like an illness or stressful life event. Medical treatment for herpes simplex focuses on minimizing the pain of an outbreak of sores and attempting to prevent future outbreaks with antiviral medications. People who have genital herpes must take care to practice safe sex and avoid sex during outbreaks in order to prevent spreading herpes to their partners. People with herpes can suffer from [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) brought on by the knowledge that they may have to live with this highly contagious viral infection for the rest of their lives, and with the danger of possibly transmitting herpes simplex to others with whom they are intimate. Fortunately, TCM herbs and acupuncture offer an alternative medicine option for dealing with herpes simplex. TCM can help with quick healing of the burning sores that signify an outbreak, but can also work on a deeper level to strengthen the immune system so that it can fight the virus better from within. Top 5 Symptoms of Herpes Simplex [Signs of a herpes](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/herpes-simplex-symptoms) simplex infection depend on which type of viral infection you have, and where the infection spreads. Usually, symptoms manifest either around the mouth or genital area, but sometimes the herpes virus can spread to the eyes (herpes keratitis). The most common symptoms of herpes include: - Itching, burning, tingling around the mouth or genital area - Painful, fluid-filled blisters or sores around the mouth or genital area - Flu-like symptoms: fever, body aches, swollen glands - Trouble urinating, [burning sensation when peeing](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Pain in eyes, cloudy vision Once a person has had their first symptomatic period of a [herpes infection](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4248-genital-herpes-hsv-2), they may have recurrence of symptoms periodically-in some cases, frequently. The majority of people who have been infected with HSV-2 experience another outbreak within a year; some people experience recurrent outbreaks several times a year or as often as once a month. There are a few other skin conditions that might sometimes be mistaken for herpes simplex. Impetigo is a bacterial infection that can cause red sores to form around the mouth and nose. \"Jock itch\" is a fungal infection that can cause a red rash in the groin area. Folliculitis is when hair follicles become inflamed and form pimples with pus; this can happen in the facial or genital region due to shaving, but it can also be related to herpes, if the viral infection causes irritation and blockages in the hair follicles. Molluscum contagiosum is another viral skin infection that causes raised lesions to form; however, they are generally painless and flesh-colored, not similar to herpes lesions. [Bacterial vaginosis](https://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/default.htm), a common bacterial infection which can cause a burning sensation in the vagina, may increase a woman's chances of getting herpes and other STDs. What Triggers a Herpes Outbreak? The herpes virus is similar to the varicella virus (chickenpox) in that it stays in the body long after the initial infection, and can flare up and cause trouble later on. The varicella virus can lie dormant for many years, and then emerge as a case of Shingles late in life, causing a very painful rash. Herpes can cause rare or frequent outbreaks, depending on the severity of the initial infection, how or if it was treated, and what sort of care a person takes to prevent recurrences. A person who has experienced recurrent outbreaks may become aware of early signs that show up a few days before sores actually break out on the skin, such as tingling or shooting pain in the genital area or around the hips or legs. The things that can trigger a herpes simplex outbreaks include: - Illness, fever - Suppression or weakness of the immune system - Exposure to sunlight, changes of the season or temperature - Menstrual period, hormonal changes - Prolonged period of stress, emotional stress - Surgery, trauma Medical Treatment for Herpes Simplex The typical treatment for herpes simplex HSV-1 and famciclovir These medications may be taken intermittently, to help treat outbreaks when they occur, or, in some cases, may be recommended for daily usage to help prevent outbreaks from occurring. For some people, these medications help to reduce the frequency of outbreaks, and there is some evidence that they may help prevent a person's sexual partner from being infected. However, these antiviral medications do not help everyone who has herpes simplex. They can only reduce the spread of the virus in the body; they do not eliminate it completely. Some people may become allergic or resistant to the drugs. Some people experience side effects, including potentially serious kidney problems or unusual bleeding. TCM treatment with herbs and acupuncture can help to reduce the severity of herpes outbreaks and prevent recurrence, without any negative side effects. Can Acupuncture Help Herpes? From the TCM point of view, the redness and burning of the blister-like rash that accompanies viral infections like herpes and varicella is caused by heat and dampness. Clearing heat and damp from the liver and gallbladder will usually be one of the primary goals of acupuncture treatment and herbal supplementation, as this will help to quickly cool down an outbreak of the painful sores. Maintaining the health and balance of the liver system long-term will help to prevent future outbreaks. TCM also factors in emotional well-being when considering each individual's presentation of a disease. The flare up of herpes simplex viral infection is associated with stress and negative emotions, especially anger. Anger is connected to the Liver and Gallbladder, and also to the eyes, which is why sometimes the herpes skin disorder will manifest in the eyes. Learning lifestyle behaviors and dietary choices that will help to balance the emotions and reduce excess heat in the body will also help reduce the occurrence of herpes flare ups. Some herbal formulations work well to heal sores related to herpes outbreak. There are also specific Chinese herbs that function as \"antivirals.\" These [herbs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9950099/) can help control the virus in the body, which, when combined with treatment and herbs that strengthen the immune system, can be effective at reducing the risk of recurrent outbreaks of herpes. Acupuncture Near Me for Herpes Simplex While herpes simplex is often considered a disease one has to \"learn to live with,\" it is not necessary to suffer the pain and emotional burden of herpes simplex infection without relief. Alternative medicine for herpes in the form of acupuncture and herbs offers a holistic treatment option that can help relieve the physical symptoms of recurrent herpes outbreaks as well as associated mental and emotional struggles with shame, [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), depression, and relationship concerns. Boosting the immune system, strengthening the Qi and organ systems, reducing heat through proper nutrition, and relieving stress can all work to help people with herpes live free of the fear of the next outbreak. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Musculoskeletal Pain With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-musculoskeletal-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Do you experience unexplained pain all over the body? Muscle pain and tenderness, along with feeling tired all the time and having mood issues? Widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue or feeling exhausted may be a sign you have fibromyalgia. Alternative medicine methods like Acupuncture and TCM offer a way to help ease the [chronic pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658605/), [sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and emotional disturbances caused by [fibromyalgia](https://fibroandpain.org/fibromyalgia/what-is-fibromyalgia). Fibromyalgia (sometimes referred to as \"fibro\" or FM) is one of the [most common](https://fmaware.net/fibromyalgia-prevalence/) chronic pain conditions worldwide, affecting an estimated 10 million people in the United States alone. Still, this chronic condition is still not well understood by medical science. There are no definitive tests to show whether or not fibromyalgia is the cause of pain all over the body along with chronic fatigue, so many people go on having musculoskeletal problems and hurting all over without being diagnosed or treated. There are many people who have fibromyalgia who also suffer from [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) related to the illness. [Fibromyalgia](https://www.healthline.com/health/fibromyalgia) can dramatically impact a person's quality of life. While people of ages and genders can have fibromyalgia, it is much more prevalent among women. Fibromyalgia is considered to be a syndrome: a collection of symptoms that often occur together. Fibromyalgia is associated with other conditions like [lupus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lupus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [rheumatoid arthritis (RA)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-rheumatoid-arthritis-ra-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) syndrome (ME/CFS). It may coexist with these other chronic conditions, or sometimes be mistaken for one of them. However, fibromyalgia is now understood by medical professionals to be its own distinct condition with specific manifestations. People who have [RA have been shown](http://blog.arthritis.org/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-side-of-fibromyalgia/) to have an increased risk for also having fibromyalgia. But the quality and location of the musculoskeletal pain differentiates the two conditions. The pain of fibromyalgia shows up in the musculoskeletal system in the areas where there are large muscles, causing pain that may move around throughout the torso, [back, hips, thighs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hip-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and arms. Fibromyalgia pain is often described as a kind of \"tenderness,\" or when the body aches all over. \"Tender points\" all over the body are specific to fibromyalgia. This is [different from arthritis](https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/fibromyalgia?_ga=2.91328922.1871329779.1619451838-775333886.1619451838), which generally causes swelling and pain in the joints. Both RA and [lupus](https://www.hss.edu/conditions_Lupus-and-Fibromyalgia.asp) are understood to be caused by inflammation, while fibromyalgia is believed to be caused by a problem with the central nervous system (CNS), in which pain signals are amplified, causing extreme sensitivity and pain, even when there is no seeming reason for that area of the body to feel pain. Some of the fibromyalgia symptoms are very similar to those of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), which is also known as chronic fatigue (CFS). As with RA and lupus, the two conditions can overlap. The difference is that the overwhelming symptoms of ME/CFS are related to fatigue or post-exertional malaise (PEM), while the predominant symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread muscle pain and tenderness. Fibromyalgia seems to show up in some people due to a traumatic or triggering event. There can then be a fibromyalgia flare up due to the presence of other triggers later. Fortunately, acupuncture, herbs, and other forms of alternative medicine that fall under TCM can approach all of the different symptoms of fibromyalgia holistically. Acupuncture is widely accepted to be effective for helping musculoskeletal conditions of all kinds, as well as neurological problems, rheumatological conditions, sleep issues, and emotional and mental health disorders. Top 10 Symptoms of Musculoskeletal Pain As a syndrome, fibromyalgia may manifest as any combination of a few or several of a variety of symptoms. The most common symptoms of [fibromyalgia](https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm) include: - Widespread musculoskeletal pain: pain, tenderness, and/or stiffness in the muscles all over the body that may come and go or migrate from one area to another - Fatigue, exhaustion, extreme tiredness - Emotional and/or mental issues: depression, anxiety, PTSD - Sleep problems, hands and/or feet [TMJ,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)jaw pain - Digestive problems: [irritable [bloating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Bladder pain, interstitial cystitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Other more subtle signs of fibromyalgia can include: [ itching](https://www.prohealth.com/library/fibromyalgia-itching-causes-make-stop-91719) all over, a skin crawling sensation (like bugs crawling on skin), extra sensitivity to smells or temperature, a tendency to shiver, or dry eyes or eye pain. Top 5 Causes Musculoskeletal Pain Flares The [symptoms of fibromyalgia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354780) tend to come and go. Some days a person might feel almost totally fine, then other days, the fibromyalgia flares, causing more pain, exhaustion, and sometimes other symptoms. What triggers a fibromyalgia flare up? - Hormonal changes during menstrual cycle, [miscarriage](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-prevent-miscarriage-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), pregnancy, or postpartum - Prolonged [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - A sudden [traumatic event, PTSD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)trigger, [panic attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Changes in weather: temperature, humidity, barometric pressure - Lack of sleep When one of the 18 tender points of fibromyalgia is touched, it can trigger more widespread pain. These points include areas like: the front and sides of the neck, the base of the skull, the elbow, and the backs of the knees. What Is the Treatment for Fibromyalgia? Medical [treatment for fibromyalgia](https://fmaware.net/fibromyalgia-treatment/) typically involves a combination of medicine to alleviate pain with psychological support and lifestyle management. [Drugs](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/living-fibromyalgia-drugs-approved-manage-pain) like Lyrica, Cymbalta, and Savella are approved for prescription for patients with fibromyalgia. Lyrica and Cymbalta are also used to treat conditions that involve nerve damage or nerve pain, like [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), neuropathy, [shingles](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shingles-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), while Savella works in a way that is similar to antidepressants. Other [pain relievers](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-dependence-on-hydrocodone-and-other-opioid-pain-medication-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and/or antidepressant medications may also be prescribed to help people manage pain of fibromyalgia, help them sleep better, and boost mood. All of these medications can come with unwanted side effects, and they do not help to relieve pain in every case. People with FM pain will often receive counseling on how to manage their condition by being very careful not to exert themselves or become exhausted. Getting quality sleep and reducing stress can help to prevent fibro flare up. It can be hard for people to follow guidelines that ask them to make major lifestyle changes. Fortunately, acupuncture, herbs, and the patient support of a TCM practitioner can offer more help for people with fibromyalgia. Acupuncture for Musculoskeletal Pain Can acupuncture help fibromyalgia? Yes. TCM offers a comprehensive system for managing musculoskeletal pain and chronic pain, helping to heal nerve damage and restore central nervous system function, supporting mental health, relieving anxiety and depression, and addressing sleep problems. Whereas with conventional medicine, a patient might go from one doctor to another to handle all of these issues, the acupuncturist can address them all at once. The TCM point of view always takes into consideration the connection between what is going on physically with what is going on emotionally in each individual, so it is really an excellent way to help patients with fibromyalgia. Like Western medicine, TCM recognizes that sometimes fibromyalgia can be originally caused by a traumatic event or an extremely stressful time in one's life. Emotional upheavals cause stress to the liver, which in turn causes stagnation of blood and Qi. TCM also sees coldness and dampness as pathogenic forces that can have a profound effect on overall health. According to TCM, widespread musculoskeletal pain falls under the category of Bi Syndrome. In Bi Syndromes, cold and damp get into the body and take hold on a deep level, causing pain and stiffness. With [acupuncture treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4223771/) for fibromyalgia, we seek to clear cold and damp, and restore good flow of Qi and blood throughout the body. Acupuncture has an analgesic effect, relieving muscle pain without side effects. Moxibustion may be utilized to bring warmth to areas of the body. Cupping is another modality used to draw out damp cold and improve blood flow. Tai Qi and Qi Gong, gentle therapeutic movement practices that have been developed over 1000s of years as part of TCM, also may offer great benefits for people with FM. A [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6365227/) of over 400 studies of fibromyalgia treatment with TCM, acupuncture treatment was found to be effective for reducing both short term pain and long term pain. Another [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110829/) found that acupuncture and herbs worked better to reduce pain than standard medication therapy. Top 5 Tips for Managing Fibromyalgia Dealing with fibromyalgia and seeing significant improvement in fibro pain will probably involve making some lasting lifestyle changes. Making adjustments to your sleep habits, food choices, and your exercise routine can make a difference in preventing the next FM flare up. - Choose a gentle, enjoyable form of exercise. Start slowly, and gradually increase the amount you can exercise over time. Walking outdoors is a great option, as are Tai Qi and Qi Gong. - Limit or eliminate caffeine and alcohol. These substances can interfere with getting good sleep and exacerbate liver problems. Alcohol is not safe to consume if you are taking medications for fibromyalgia like Lyrica, Cymbalta, and Savella. - Avoid sugar, which may give you a short-lived good feeling, but will lead to a \"sugar crash,\" and feeling more exhausted than before. Any kind of simple carbohydrates, like foods made of white flour, or bottled fruit juices, can cause highs and lows in blood sugar. Avoid sugar substitutes and food additives like MSG, which can trigger reactions in some people. - Focus on eating complex carbohydrates, especially vegetables. These help you have a more sustained energy throughout the day. Nuts and seeds are also good. - Warm baths with Epsom salts can be very soothing. Getting enough sleep at night, and even resting or napping during the day, may be essential to your well-being if you have fibromyalgia. Develop habits that allow for plenty of rest and set yourself up for a good night's sleep. Acupuncture Near Me for Musculoskeletal Pain Many people who have fibromyalgia choose to try alternative medicine as a way of managing FM pain. Physiological conditions that stem from emotional stress are often not resolved through the use of medications. Acupuncture and TCM have a long history of helping people to heal from emotional disturbances that cause physical pain. Acupuncture treatment works to increase the flow of energy through the body and improve the connections between the brain and nerve endings. If you or someone you know suffers with fibro, consider acupuncture as a way to find relief from musculoskeletal pain and constant fatigue. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Irregular Heartbeat With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Does if feel like your heart \"skips a beat,\" or your heart is \"fluttering?\" Maybe you feel your heart beat is fast or slow, compared to your normal heart rate. Lots of things can cause your resting heart rate to be uneven. [Acupuncture](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28642714/) and TCM can be beneficial as both an adjunct or alternative to drug therapy for [paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3312232/), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and other types of arrhythmia that cause heart palpitations or a fast heart rate. The pulse rate is controlled by electrical impulses that originate in the sinus node, which is located in the right atrium, or upper chamber, of the heart. The feeling that your heart rhythm is off, or different from your normal pulse rate is called [Arrhythmia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668). The average resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. A fast heart rate-more than 100 beats per minute-is called [tachycardia](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/about-arrhythmia/tachycardia--fast-heart-rate). A slow heart rate-less than 60 beats per minute- is called bradycardia. It is natural to have a slightly high heart rate during or just after exercise, or or a slow heart rate during sleep or times of relaxation, as when meditating. In some cases, a rapid heartbeat is related to [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) or [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Sometimes a rapid or irregular heart rate may be related to caffeine consumption or a side effect of some medication. Other times, it may be a sign of heart disease or other chronic condition that needs to be addressed. Other symptoms related to irregular heartbeat include: shortness of breath, chest pain, sweating, and [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). The heart is composed of four chambers; the top two chambers are called the atria, into which blood is received, and the two bottom chambers, the ventricles, from which blood is pumped out to the lungs and the rest of the body. Medical science classifies deviations from a normal resting heart rate both according to their rapidity and the chamber of the heart that seems to be problematic. There are different medications available to help restore the regular rhythm of the heart, as well as [therapies](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16751-arrhythmia-treatments) that deliver electrical impulses to the heart through a catheter, and devices, such as pacemakers or defibrillators. In many cases, arrhythmia is not a serious problem. But in other cases, it can increase the risk of blood clots, [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and other life-threatening conditions. It is advisable to consult a medical professional if you are having an irregular heartbeat often enough to be concerned. Acupuncture and TCM offer a natural way to help restore heart function and a good resting heart rate without the unwanted side effects of medications or invasive procedures. Top 10 Types of Irregular Heartbeat There are many different terms that describe deviations from a regular, healthy heart rate. Some irregular heartbeat issues are due to congenital conditions, while others may occur due to trauma, disease, or aging. - Atrial flutter - an accelerated heart rate that occurs in an organized and rhythmic way due to rapid electric impulses in the atria. [Atrial fibrillation](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-atrial-fibrillation-afib-or-af)(AFib or AF) - a rapid heart rate, also caused by increased electrical impulses in the atria that happen in a chaotic, arrhythmic way. Fibrillation refers to the rapid and irregular movement of muscles. In the case of AFib, the upper chambers of the heart quiver quickly. This condition is associated with stroke. [AFib with RVR (rapid ventricular response)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5603354/)is a condition that occurs when patients are critically ill, often in the ICU, when the atrial fibrillation causes the ventricles to beat faster. - Ventricular fibrillation - rapid impulses in the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart) cause ineffective pumping of blood out to the body. - Supraventricular tachycardia - this refers to types of arrhythmia that originate in the atria (above the ventricles) and cause brief episodes of accelerated heart rate. - Ventricular tachycardia - a fast but regular heart rate that does not allow the ventricles to fill with as much blood as usual. - Sick sinus syndrome - more common among older people, this is when the sinus node is malfunctioning and may sometimes cause a fast heart rate, and other times, a slow heart rate. - Long QT Syndrome - a heart disorder found in people with a particular genetic mutation that causes rapid heartbeat and fainting spells. - Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome - some people are born with an extra electrical pathway that can cause extra or irregular signalling to occur. - Conduction Block - a block of the electrical pathways that sometimes results in a slower heart rate. [Premature ventricular contractions](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/p/premature-ventricular-contractions.html)- this is when an extra heartbeat beat originates from the ventricles, rather than the atria. It can feel like a \"skipped\" beat, or your heart pounding or jumping in your chest, but it is actually a kind of extra beat. This can happen occasionally due to drug stimulants like caffeine or nicotine, or other medications like decongestants or antihistamines. It can also be due to heart disease creating scarring in the ventricles or in the structural parts of the heart that hold the pathways for electrical impulses. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of blood clots and strokes because blood is not being effectively pushed from the atria into the ventricles, so blood pools or collects in the atria. What Causes Irregular Heartbeat? In general, most types of arrhythmia are caused by some disorder of the electrical conduction system that controls the beating of the heart valves, or weakness of the heart itself, which is known as [cardiomyopathy](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiomyopathy/what-is-cardiomyopathy-in-adults). Causes of tachycardia include: - Not enough blood nourishing the muscles of the heart. - Dilation or one or more valves of the heart, meaning that the muscle tissue becomes thinner and the chamber becomes enlarged. - Thickening of the walls of the heart chamber makes them stiff; this is known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. - Scar tissue makes the heart tissue more rigid (restrictive cardiomyopathy or dysplasia). This can happen due to inflammation, high levels of iron or protein in the tissues, sometimes as a side effect of cancer treatments (radiation and/or chemotherapy). Arrhythmic right ventricular dysplasia may be an inherited condition. Causes of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter include: - High blood pressure - damage to the heart from a heart attack or heart surgery - Coronary artery disease - Congenital heart defects - Hyperthyroidism - Lung disease, infections, or [pneumonia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pneumonia-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Sleep apnea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [snoring](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Smoking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or overuse of other chemical stimulants Chronic conditions like [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), obesity, metabolic syndrome, kidney problems, alcoholism, [Parkinson's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-parkinsons-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or a family history of heart problems increase a person's risk for developing an arrhythmia. Treatment for Irregular Heartbeat There are several different types of medications to treat irregular heartbeat. Tachycardia may be treated with [antiarrhythmic](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/prevention--treatment-of-arrhythmia/medications-for-arrhythmia) drugs, which work by suppressing or depressing the electrical impulses that are misfiring or transmitting signals too quickly. Beta blockers slow down the heart rate and reduce blood pressure by reducing the production of adrenaline. AFib treatment often involves anticoagulants or blood thinners, which prevent the formation of blood clots. In some cases, these medications can work to help people maintain a steady heart rate and prevent serious events like strokes. The downside is that they must be taken daily on an ongoing basis, and in some cases, they can actually cause the heartbeat to become even more erratic. Medical [procedures](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/arrhythmia-treatment) that are designed to help irregular heartbeat include: electrical cardioversion, in which an electric shock is used to help \"reset\" the heart rate, and ablation, in which the tissues that contain the electric impulse pathways are intentionally scarred in order to reduce their output. Implantable devices such as defibrillators or pacemaker monitor the heart rate and deliver small \"shocks\" to alter the rhythm of the heartbeat. For some people, these methods work to keep the heart functioning. In some cases, though, the surgery to implant the device causes complications or damage to critical tissues around the heart or lungs. Can Acupuncture Help Irregular Heartbeat? In conventional medicine, and indeed, in Western culture, the heart is seen as one of the most important, if not the most important, organ in the body. Not only does it supply the whole body with oxygenated blood, but it also is associated with our deepest emotions. [TCM also views](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/466695) the heart as a central organ that governs the blood and vessels, and also the mind and spirit.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science. Because science focuses on testing ideas about the natural world with evidence obtained through observation, these aspects of acupuncture can't be studied by science. Therefore acupuncture and Chinese herbs are often not supported by double-blind, randomized trials, and they are considered alternative medicine therapies in the United States. "}
