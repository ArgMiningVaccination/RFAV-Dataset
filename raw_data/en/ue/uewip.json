The case is the second involving a recent meeting of the American Heart Association. The abstract, titled \" [Mrna COVID Vaccines Dramatically Increase Endothelial Inflammatory Markers and ACS Risk as Measured by the PULS Cardiac Test: a Warning](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.144.suppl_1.10712),\" was presented at the AHA's 2021 Scientific Sessions in mid-November and was published in Circulation. The author was [Steven Gundry](https://gundrymd.com/), a cardiac surgeon by training who now sells dietary supplements on his website. [Gundry also](https://www.ifm.org/about/profile/steven-gundry-md/) sees patients at the Center for Restorative Medicine and International Heart & Lung Institute in California and [offers advice on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szsnEn7NG3M). But [critics](https://www.sheilakealey.com/nutrition-experts-shouldnt-trust-2/#Gundry) have [accused](https://www.truehealthinitiative.org/news/eat-your-beans-but-skip-reading-dr-steven-gundrys-the-longevity-paradox-flaws-and-fruits/) Gundry of peddling worthless \u2014 if ultimately expensive \u2014 advice. According to the abstract, which is riddled with errors, including the name of the test (it's [PULS](https://pulstest.com/news), not PLUS): Our group has been using the PLUS Cardiac Test (GD Biosciences, Inc, Irvine, CA) a clinically validated measurement of multiple protein biomarkers which generates a score predicting the 5 yr risk (percentage chance) of a new Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). The score is based on changes from the norm of multiple protein biomarkers including IL-16, a proinflammatory cytokine, soluble Fas, an inducer of apoptosis, and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)which serves as a marker for chemotaxis of T-cells into epithelium and cardiac tissue, among other markers. Elevation above the norm increases the PULS score, while decreases below the norm lowers the PULS score.The score has been measured every 3-6 months in our patient population for 8 years. Recently, with the advent of the mRNA COVID 19 vaccines (vac) by Moderna and Pfizer, dramatic changes in the PULS score became apparent in most patients.This report summarizes those results. A total of 566 pts, aged 28 to 97, M:F ratio 1:1 seen in a preventive cardiology practice had a new PULS test drawn from 2 to 10 weeks following the 2nd COVID shot and was compared to the previous PULS score drawn 3 to 5 months previously pre- shot. Baseline IL-16 increased from 35=/-20 above the norm to 82 =/- 75 above the norm post-vac; sFas increased from 22+/- 15 above the norm to 46=/-24 above the norm post-vac; HGF increased from 42+/-12 above the norm to 86+/-31 above the norm post-vac. These changes resulted in an increase of the PULS score from 11% 5 yr ACS risk to 25% 5 yr ACS risk. At the time of this report, these changes persist for at least 2.5 months post second dose of vac.We conclude that the mRNA vacs dramatically increase inflammation on the endothelium and T cell infiltration of cardiac muscle and may account for the observations of increased thrombosis, cardiomyopathy, and other vascular events following vaccination. The study was picked up by [several outlets](https://ahajournals.altmetric.com/details/117269479/news) that have a tendency to publish doubts about vaccines, as well as by more than 53,000 Twitter users, [according to Altmetric](https://ahajournals.altmetric.com/details/117269479/twitter). It also caught the attention of [Aseem Malhotra](https://twitter.com/GBNEWS/status/1463926037889396736), a [ British cardiologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aseem_Malhotra) who has been making claims about the heart risks of the Covid-19 vaccines, and who has alleged that he knows of researchers who are suppressing similar findings for fear of losing their funding. The [EoC states](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001051): This article expresses concern regarding abstract \"Abstract 10712: Mrna COVID Vaccines Dramatically Increase Endothelial Inflammatory Markers and ACS Risk as Measured by the PULS Cardiac Test: a Warning\" which originally published November 8, 2021; [https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.144.suppl_1.10712]. Soon after publication of the above abstract in Circulation, it was brought to the American Heart Association Committee on Scientific Sessions Program's attention that there are potential errors in the abstract. Specifically, there are several typographical errors, there is no data in the abstract regarding myocardial T-cell infiltration, there are no statistical analyses for significance provided, and the author is not clear that only anecdotal data was used. We are publishing this Expression of Concern until a suitable correction is published to indicate that the abstract in its current version may not be reliable. Gundry, through his assistant, told us that he had \"no comment\" on the journal's decision. Malhotra \u2014 a correction of whose we [covered in 2014](http://retractionwatch.com/2014/05/14/bmj-authors-take-back-inaccurate-statin-safety-statements/) and who has found himself in a \" [media war of words](https://inews.co.uk/news/health/statins-war-debate-matt-hancock-aseem-malhotra-rory-collins-271835)\" over his views on statins \u2014 did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We emailed Joseph Hill, the editor in chief of the journal, with questions about the notice. Hill didn't respond, but we received the following email from Michelle Kirkwood, the director of national science media relations at the AHA: The specific [abstract referenced]is under additional review by our Scientific Sessions Program Committee, and an [Expression of Concern]was posted on the abstract, as of 10:00 am CT, Nov. 24, 2021. The Expression of Concern indicates that the abstract, in its current version, may not be reliable. A correction from the research author has been requested and is due to the American Heart Association by 6:00 pm ET, Friday, Dec. 3, 2021. The author's corrections will undergo review before publication. Kirkwood added: Abstracts are brief summary documents, 400 words or less, describing the key details of a research project. Abstracts are considered preliminary research and represent the beginning of a scientific conversation on the findings, which may then, ultimately, result in a full manuscript published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The statements and conclusions of studies that are presented at the American Heart Association's scientific meetings are solely those of the study authors and do not necessarily reflect the Association's policy or position. The Association makes no representation or guarantee as to their accuracy or reliability. Scientific discovery must include room for robust discourse including alternate views and debate, testing of hypotheses from every possible angle, and review and feedback from experts around the world. This dynamic and rigorous process is critical to scientific and medical advancements. We agree. But we also think major medical and scientific societies should do at least a little vetting of abstracts before they accept, let alone publish, them \u2014 or make it far more clear that it \"makes no representation or guarantee as to their accuracy or reliability\" before, rather than only after, serious questions are raised. [See an [update on this post](http://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/03/aha-regrets-any-confusion-and-is-reviewing-meeting-policies-after-outcry-over-covid-19-vaccine-abstract/).] Take, for example, another abstract that was due to be presented at the same AHA meeting. The study in question claimed to show, according to an AHA press release, that \" [E-cigarette users face 15% higher risk of stroke at a younger age than traditional smokers](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/933457).\" But that press release was deleted \u2014 you can read an archived version [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20211108113941/https:/www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/933457) \u2014 with this note: This abstract will no longer be presented at Scientific Sessions 2021. Unfortunately, the researchers were not able to complete their presentation. That seemed puzzling. The AHA issued a press release about a presentation that hadn't even been submitted in full? Meanwhile, the UK's Science Media Centre [posted comments from experts questioning the abstract](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-unpublished-conference-presentation-claiming-e-cigarette-users-face-15-higher-risk-of-stroke-at-a-younger-age-than-traditional-smokers/), including one that suggested the abstract had similar problems to one about vaping and heart attacks that [ended up being retracted](http://retractionwatch.com/2020/02/18/journal-retracts-hotly-contested-paper-on-vaping-and-heart-attacks/). We asked corresponding author Urvish Patel, research scholar and chief education officer in the department of public health and neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, for an explanation. He told us that it was a problem with AHA's servers, and that an AHA journal has invited him and his co-authors to submit the paper: According to my timezone we were late by 8 min and that is due to servers issue of the AHA. Looks like server started working late night so AHA committee got it next morning. Manuscript Submission has invited by AHA Stroke journal. Stay tuned. Update, 2000 UTC, 12/1/21: Kirkwood added: Abstracts are not peer reviewed. Abstracts are curated by independent review panels who are blinded to the authors, and they receive consideration solely on the basis of their potential for contributing to the diversity of scientific dialogue that takes place during a given scientific meeting. This is a generally accepted practice within the scientific research community and a practice followed by the American Heart Association. Like Retraction Watch?
