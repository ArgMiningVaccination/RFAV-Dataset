It can affect any area of the body including the mouth, eyes, ears, scalp, food pipe, throat, anus, nails and genitalia. On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, itchy, flat bumps that develop over several weeks. In the mouth, vagina and other areas covered by the mucous membranes, lichen planus forms lacy white patches, sometimes with painful sores. Lichen planus isn't a contagious skin disease. According to a research study by Journal of Traditional Medicine & Clinical Naturopathy (JTMCN), lichen planus is an immune system disorder, estimated to affect 0.5% to 2.0% of the general population. It is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting mucosal and cutaneous tissues of the body. Oral lichen planus occurs more frequently than the cutaneous form and tends to be more resistant to any treatment Lichen Planus Symptoms The signs and lichen planus symptoms may vary depending on the areas affected by this skin disease.

Lichen planus is a progressive and chronic skin condition which has no specific cause; hence, it requires constitutional and holistic treatment. In the clinical research studies conducted by Journal of Oral Diagnosis (JORDI), homeopathic medicines were found to be highly effective in the treatment of oral lichen planus. Thus, homeopathic medicines have proven efficacy in the treatment of lichen planus. One should consider homeopathic medicines when lichen planus is detected at an earlier stage and not tampered with by other conventional medications. Homeopathy is well indicated for oral lichen planus, lichen planopilaris (scarring hair loss) and lichen planus pigmentosus, where the focus is to control the spread of the skin disease with reduction in the skin lesions. Homeopathic medicines target the altered immunity of the body and bring it back to normalcy, over a period of time.
