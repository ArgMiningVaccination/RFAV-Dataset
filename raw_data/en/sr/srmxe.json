In science class, westudied the material world, which we expected would someday be understoodand predicted down to the last molecule. In philosophy, we studied models ofreality, based on the rational mind, that took no notice of conditions male andfemale, sick and well, rich and poor. Yet every day in this divided world ofmind and body, our language betrayed the limitations of our categories. Myparents talked about our friend the grocer, who \"worried himself sick,\" andmy Uncle Carl believed that laughter could ease what ailed you. Over theyears, my interest in questions of mind, body, and health grew, both person-ally and professionally, and eventually led to HEALING AND THE MIND. I believe this series has particular relevance to young people. For them tounderstand the connection between emotions and health is important underany circumstances, but such understanding is imperative today, given the lifeand death implications of so many decisions confronting teenagers, from theuse of drugs to issues of sex. In the words of Vaclav Havel, \"Every educationis a kind of inward journey.\" The education young people receive today surelymust lead them into a deeper understanding of the inner sources of health. During the production of HEALING AND THE MIND, my colleagues andI made our own journey, one that sought to answer many of the questions thatprovoked our curiosity about the emerging field of mind-body medicine. Weencountered new questions, too for which there are not yet answers.If the series advocates anything, it is that the journey is worth making forwhat each of us might learn about this remarkable union of mind, body andspirit that is the human being. I invite you and your students to join us. Sincerely, Bill Moyers The HEALING AND THE MIND WITH Fetzer Institute,Mutual of America Life Insurance Company,Laurance S.

ABOUT KL AvenueKalamazoo, MI a nonprofit educational organization thatpromotes research into health-care methods that utilize theprinciples of mind-body phenomena. The Institute believes thatthe study of the mind's influence on the body and the relation-ship of the body, mind, and spirit can provide the basis fordeveloping scientifically sound approaches to health care thatexpand the scope of medical science and give individuals greatercontrol over their own health.The Institute works collaboratively with other research andeducational organizations and institutions. Its research interestsare aimed at exploring the relationship between the mind and thebody and its impact on health. Its educational activities aredirected toward the development of mind-body curricula formedical schools and health professionals and the dissemination ofresearch findings into the educational process.6 TO-HE TEACHER INTRODUCTIONIn Boston, a construction worker learns a form of Buddhist meditationthat he hopes will help alleviate his chronic pain. In China, a fullyconscious woman undergoes brain surgery in which acupuncture isused to minimize the need for anesthesia. In California, a group ofwomen with metastatic breast cancer attend a weekly psychotherapysupport group in hopes of easing anxiety and depression and enhanc-ing their lives. In Dallas, patients review their medical records in aprogram designed to help them become partners in their own healing.These are only some of the models today's Western medical practition-ers are examining in an effort to understand the healing connectionbetween the mind and the body.For thousands of years the connections between mind and body havebeen central to the healing traditions of many cultures. Westernmedicine, with its extraordinary advances in research and technology,has only recently begun to reconsider this relationship. Scientificresearch, for example, is examining the connection between theimmune system and the emotions; the effectiveness of traditionalhealing arts is being studied using scientific methods; and the effect ofnew clinical approaches, designed to help patients take an active rolein healing, are being carefully documented.In HEALING AND THE MIND WITH BILL MOYERS, a five-partseries premiering on public television in February, 1993, Bill Moyersexplores healing approaches that are outside the framework ofWestern allopathic medicine. \"The Mystery of Chi\" explores tradi-tional Chinese medicine and its fusion with Western practices inmodern China. The science of mind-body medicine is the subject of\"The Mind Body Connection,\" which examines current scientificresearch in the field. How people are using Eastern meditation andgroup psychotherapy to improve the healing capacities within theirbodies is explored in \"Healing From Within.\" \"The Art of Healing\"examines how hospitals are instituting new models of medical carethat can help patients become active participants in their own healing.The final program in the series, \"Wounded Healers,\" visitsCommonweal, a health education facility in northern Californiawhere people with cancer help each other to heal even when a curemay be impossible.USING THE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALSFor today's young person, health choices have life and death implica-tions. Drug and alcohol abuse as well as the threat of AIDS have putgreater pressure on educators to prepare students to face challengesand to make healthy choices. In this context, these educationalmaterials, which highlight the mind's role in health and healing, canplay a valuable role in high school classes. The underlying objectivesof the materials are-to provide students with new ways to look athealth and to give them information that can help them make good,informed choices that will contribute to their health and well-being.HEALING AND THE MIND is appropriate for health and sciencecurricula at the secondary level and can be integrated into socialstudies and guidance classes as well. The educational materials aredesigned to be used in conjunction with the programs, but can alsofunction as permanent reference units that can be used without theprogram component..ContentsThis High School Resource Package contains the following:o A Teacher's Guide that provides complete lesson plans for eachprogram in the series. Each lesson plan includes:A Topic Index that lists the corresponding curriculum areas foreach program.Background/Overview that offers a brief history and overview ofthe program's subject. This background information may beduplicated for students.Program Summary that gives a brief synopsis of the program.Goals that provide the teacher with outcomes for each lesson.Introducing the Program that recommends an approach forintroducing students to the basic theme of the program withoutrequiring any prior knowledge or preparation.Discussion Questions that help students assess the main points ofthe program and extend them to their own experience.Introduction to the Student Card that introduces students to theactivity on the student card accompanying the lesson.Activities that help students explore and extend the themespresented in the program.Suggested Reading that features books that not only correspond tothe program's theme but also may be of special interest to students.o A Glossary that provides definitions of terms that are used in theseries appears on page 12.o A Bibliography with books of interest to both teachers andstudents appears on page 13.o A Resources Section provides a list of journals, teacher trainingworkshops, and organizations that can offer more information onthe topics presented in the series.o Student Cards that can be duplicated and distributed to studentsare designed to give them additional information on a variety ofsubjects related to the programs. These four cards include: a healthinventory, a description of the functioning of the immune system,information on the healing traditions of other cultures, informationon how to take an active part in your own health, and an overviewof the rites of passage, as celebrated in different cultures, whichmark a person's journey through life.o A Poster is also provided for classroom display.PROGRAM SCHEDULINGThe programs are scheduled to be broadcast initially on the followingdates. Please check local listings for any scheduling changes. Contactyour local station for rebroadcast schedules.The Mystery of February p.m.All programs are 60 minutes long except for \"Healing From Within,\"which is 90 minutes in length.7 II BROADCAST DATE: MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 9:00 P.M.-HE MYS--ERY OF CH ACCOMPANYING STUDENT CARD: HEALING AROUND THE WORLDACKGROUND/OVERVIIEWChinese Medicine. The term sounds foreign, even exotic tomany Western minds, because we've learned to think ofmedicine as synonymous with European and Americanscience. For more than a decade, however, Western physicianshave been examining the centuries-old Chinese system and theunique insights and methods of treatment that it offers. Ingeneral, Chinese practitioners consider all aspects of apatient's life, including mental state, personality, and socialand physical environment, and their bearing on the person'shealth. They consider symptoms part of the pattern of aperson's life. In contrast, Western practitioners tend to focuson specific diseases and their causes.The Chinese system of medicine is based on severalimportant ideas.o Yin and Yang. In Chinese philosophy, these are the dy-namic, opposing but complementary forces that are present inall parts of the universeanimate as well as inanimateobjects, visible as well as invisible phenomena. For example,time has yin and yang aspects night and day; temperaturehasheat and cold; weight haslight and heavy. All foodshave yin and yang aspects, as do all organs of the body.o Chi or Qi (pronounced CHEE). In very simple terms, Chi issaid to be the human body's vital energy. From the perspectiveof Chinese philosophy and medicine, it is akin to \"matter onthe verge of becoming energy or energy at the point ofmaterializing\" into matter. Optimally, according to the Chinesemodel, Chi circulates freely throughout the body. When thebody's yin and yang properties are in balance, Chi flowssmoothly and the person is healthy. When yin and yang are outof balance, Chi is excessive, deficient or blocked and illnessresults.o Every aspect of nature, including a person's surroundings, issaid to have a direct impact on the body. In diagnosing anillness, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine asks questionsabout all aspects of the patient's life in order to discern a\"pattern of disharmony\" that would indicate the specificimbalance that is causing the illness.o Chi is said to travel over 14 major channels and numerousminor pathways, called meridians, in the body. Meridians donot correspond to any known system in Western medicine. InChinese medicine, the meridian system links the inside of thebody to the outside world. Nearly all acupuncture andacupressure points lie along meridians.o Chi energy can be directed through acupuncture oracupressure (a form of deep tissue massage), various forms ofmeditation, the heightening of consciousness, and herbalpreparations. These are the main treatments in Chinesemedicine. The aim of treatment is to rebalance yin and yangand unblock the flow of Chi.o Today the Chinese have a choice of medical treatments.They can be treated with traditional Chinese techniques, I2IPROGRAM SUMMARY Filmed on location in the People's Republic of China,\"The Mystery of Chi,\" Program Iof HEALING ANDTHE MIND, explores various aspects of traditionalChinese medicine. Dr. David Eisenberg, instructor inmedicine at Harvard Medical School and a staff internistat Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, guides Bill Moyersthrough some startling differences between Chineseand Western medicine. Eisenberg and Moyers inter-view Chinese doctors who combine Western ap-proaches to medicine with traditional Chinese meth-ods; they interview teachers of herbal medicine, acu-puncture, massage, and Tai Chi Chuan and witness anextraordinary demonstration by a Chi Gong master.The two Westerners pose probing questions about thenature of Chinese medicine, the possibility of integrat-ing its theory and techniques into Western medicalpractices, and the necessity of using the scientific methodto test its efficacy. Westerntechniques, or a combination of both traditionalChinese and Western methods. The patient's decision aboutwhich treatment to pursue is usually based on the specificillness that he or she is experiencing.Some Western health-care professionals use concepts andtechniques from Chinese medicine to treat their patients. Theychoose acupuncture, in particular, as a treatment for certainailments and diseases such as chronic pain and addiction.Another practice that is gaining acceptance among Westernpractitioners is the use of meditation and other mental tech-niques to reduce stress and promote health.GOALSto examine traditional Chinese medicine in which the mindand the body are considered one entity1>to recognize similarities and differences between Chineseand Western approaches to health and healing1>to expand awareness of ways in which the mind mayinfluence the body 1).to learn about the healing traditions of other cultures. 8At dawn people gather in aBeijing Park to perform theancient art of Tai Chi Chuan. BEFORE VIEWING AFTER VIEWING STUDENT CARDIntroducing the ProgramTell students that they are going to per-form a simple experiment. Ask each stu-dent to rub his or her palms togetherbriskly for 10 seconds. Then have studentshold their hands about 12 inches apart,palms facing each other. Suggest that theybring their hands slowly toward each otheruntil they almost touch and slowly backseveral times. Ask them to concentrate onthe sensation between their two palms andto describe what they feel. (Note: Somestudents may say that they feel nothing.Explain that some people feel nothing andthat that is no cause for concern.) Tell themthat several interpretations have been ad-vanced to explain the sensation: one is thatthe sensation is caused by the body's en-ergy field; another is that it is the result ofstimulated nerve endings in the hands. Havestudents discuss both interpretations andexplore the possibility that one or bothexplanations could be correct. After thediscussion, explain that the belief that eachbody has a vital energy called Chi is centralto Chinese philosophy and medicine. Tellstudents that the program they will see,\"The Mystery of Chi,\" explores some ofthe ways in which the Chinese system ofmedicine provides a unique, nonwesternframe of reference regarding the humanbody and the mind. Suggest that as studentswatch the program, they examine the ap-proach that Chinese medical practitionerstake toward health and healing.Terms/VocabularyYou may want to write the following termson the board in order to facilitate a discus-sion of the program: acupuncture, meridian,Tai Chi Chuan, Chi Gong, yin yang, scientificmethod. Definitions of these terms appearon page 12.Discussion QuestionsEncourage students to discuss the programand to share their observations. The fol-lowing questions may be used to guide thediscussion.Eili How does a Chinese medical practition-er view a patient? How does a Westernmedical practitioner view a patieni? Howmight a doctor's beliefs affect treatment?12 Why do you think the hospital featuredin this program has both a traditional Chi-nese medicine section and a contemporaryWestern medicine section?1:21 Do you think that most Westernerswould like to have a choice of medicaltreatments as the Chinese do? Do youthink that Westerners or their insurancecompanies would be willing to pay for suchtreatments? Explain.gal What aspects of Chinese medicine doyou think might be the easiest to adopt inthe West? What might be the hardest?El) Do you think the scientific methodshould be used to test Chinese therapiesbefore they are recommended or adoptedin the West? Is testing relevant or possible?How might such therapies be tested?Do you agree with the belief underlyingChinese medicine that one's mind influ-ences one's body, that is, can cause diseaseand promote health and healing? Why mightthis idea generate controversy?The student card, \"Healing Around theWorld,\" presents traditional healing as prac-ticed in several cultures throughout theworld. Introduce the material by havingstudents discuss some of the home rem-edies that their families may have used totreat illnesses. Ask them whether theybelieve the remedies work. Explain that inmany cultures the beliefs in specific medicalsystems are deeply rooted in the culturesthemselves. Duplicate and distribute \"Heal-ing Around the World\" to students. Afterthey have read the material, ask them tothink about whether a person's belief in amedical treatment can affect the person'srecovery.ACTIVITIES on Many Chinese practice Tai Chi as a wayof awakening and controlling their Chi.Some students may have studied a martialart or Tai Chi itself. Ask such students todemonstrate some of the basic movementsand to describe the philosophy of the art,or if possible, invite a martial arts instruc-tor to give a demonstration for the class, orsuggest that interested students visit amartial arts class.The idea of balance, as shown in theconcept of yin and yang, is central to Chi-nese medicine and philosophy. Have stu-dents examine aspects of balance in theirown livesfood, exercise, work (schoolwork, volunteer work, and work for in-come), social interactions, and entertain-ment or play. Encourage them to identifythose aspects that are in balance and thosethat are not in balance. Suggest studentswrite down their observations in theirjournals.EE In the film, the master painterdescribes how he uses his imaginationand Chi in his workhow mind andbody work together. Have studentsdescribe how mind and body worktogether in something they do well, suchas in an artistic, musical, or athletic skill.SUGGESTED READINGEisenberg, David, M.D. with Thomas LeeWright.

I3I BROADCAST DATE: MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1 0:00 P.M.THE MOND BODY CONNEOMN ACCOMPANYING STUDENT CARD: THE IMMUNE SYSTEMBACKGROUND/OVERVIEWThe mind's capacity to affect physical health has long beenacknowledged in a general way. But until recently medicalscience mostly regarded it as a complicating and amorphousfactorinvolving such vague elements as thoughts, emotions,and attitudesthat only got in the way of hard and clearscience. For example, physicians have known for centuriesthat a person's belief in a treatment is often as effective as themedicine used in the treatment. The effect called theplacebo effectis so powerful that medical science guardsagainst it when testing a new drug. People receiving a newdrug are always compared with people who receive only aplacebo, a dummy medication that has no medicinal valueto make sure the drug and not just the person's faith is havingan impact.Today scientific researchers have found new ways toexplore the mind's effect on the body and to measure it inobjective, quantifiable terms. Their work has begun to revealthe mind's contribution to health and disease. The mind-bodyconnection is becoming both an important part of modernmedical theory and a practical way to help people maintaintheir health.The recent investigations into the mind's influence on thebody into three areas: physiological research, clinicalresearch, and epidemiological research.Physiological research is aimed at determining the basicprocesses that connect the brain and nervous system with therest of the body. The key development of the last decade hasbeen the birth of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), the effort tounderstand the links between the brain and the immunesystem, the physiological system that protects the body frominfectious disease and plays a role in fighting cancer.Building on groundbreaking experiments done in the 1970sby Robert Ader, a psychologist, and Nicholas Cohen, animmunologist, researchers in PNI have uncovered a rich arrayof connections between the nervous system and the immunesystem. They have now shown that nerve cells connect directlyto organs of the immune system; that hormones responsive tostressful experience affect the immune response; and thatpsychological and social factors can affect the immunesystem's responsiveness. Additional research into the chemi-cals produced by the brain particularly a group of chemicalsknown as neuropeptidesis showing how the brain and theimmune system may communicate. There is now everyindication that the nervous system and the immune systemspeak the same chemical language and \"talk\" to each othercontinuously.Clinical researchers use psychological approaches to try toaffect physical health. The most acclaimed recent study of thissort was performed by David Spiegel, a psychiatrist, and hiscolleagues, who found that weekly group-therapy sessionsdramatically increased the life expectancy of women withadvanced breast cancer. Spiegel's rigorously controlled studywas the first to show that psychotherapy could extend the livesof at least some cancer patients. Other researchers are now 4PROGRAM SUMMARY In\"The Mind Body Connection,\" Program 2 ofHEALING ANDTHEMIND, Bill Moyers interviewsseveral scientists whose work challenges the centu-ries-old Western scientific model in which the bodyand the mind were considered separate entities.Using scientific methods, these scientists have foundbiochemical evidence that the mind and the bodyfunction as a single entity.Moyers asks Dr. Candace Pert about the implicationsof these findings for health and healing. The answersare startling yet harken back to the oldest folkwisdom. One of the most important findings is thatour thoughts and emotions influence our immunesystem, the body's first line of defense againstinfectious disease. For example, Dr. Robert Ader'sexperiments show that the immune systems of loweranimals can be trained both to be more susceptibleand to resist infectious agents. Research by Dr. DeanOrnish has demonstrated that changing behavior canreverse heart disease.As these scientists point out, their work is now atthe threshold of reintroducing the concept of \"mind\"back into medical science. As their work continues, itis likely to bring about a revolution in the wayWestern scientists think about mind and body. trying to duplicate those results and are testing psychologicalapproaches and stress reduction for people with physicalproblems as diverse as hypertension, migraine headaches,chronic pain, diabetes, and infertility.Epidemiological researchers study large groups of peopleand try to find social and psychological factors that areassociated with variations in illness and health. Numerousstudies have now shown that people with strong \"socialsupport\"those that have a tight network of family andfriendslive longer than people without such relationships.Of course, many critical questions remain open. Forexample, in PNI only a few studies have successfully shownan effect of stress on the immune system that is large enoughto increase the risk of illness. Similarly, although many studieshave shown a general association between psychologicalfactors and illness, few have succeeded in revealing thebiological links connecting them. Finally, there is still nocomprehensive theory of the mind's influence on health thatunifies the varied studies exploring the mind-body connectionno equivalent of the germ theory that underlies modernresearch into infectious disease.Even without such a theory, however, mind-body researchis providing dramatic new insights in many critical areas: thefunctioning of the immune system, the value of psychologicaltreatments for physical illness, and the link between socialconnections and health. It already has the potential to enhanceour health and our lives.iC BEFORE VIEWING AFTER VIEWING STUDENT CARDIntroducing the ProgramUse the following exercise to demon-strate the connection between mind andbody. Announce to your students thatthey are going to take a test. Ask themto follow normal test-taking procedures(i.e., clear their desks, put books on thefloor, etc.). Then ask students to des-cribe how they feel physically, that is,how do their palms and throats feel? Aretheir hearts beating faster? Are theirfaces turning red? You will probably get avariety of responses, including referencesto cold hands and feet, sweating palms,warm or hot faces, pounding hearts, andso on. Ask why they think their bodiesare reacting to a \"mental message.\" Havethem give other examples of ways inwhich they think the body and the mindare connected.After the discussion, point out thatscientists are exploring the relationshipbetween mind and body and have comeup with some interesting results that willbe described in the program they areabout to see, \"The Mind Body Connec-tion.\"Terms/VocabularyYou may want to write these terms onthe board in order to facilitate a discus-sion of biofeedback, endor-phin, 12.GOALS I> to recognize that mind and bodycommunicate with each otherI> to learn that emotions influencethe immune systemI> to examine research in the field ofmind-body medicineD to learn how the body's immunesystem operates.

BROADCAST DATE: TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 9:00 P.M.EA_ONG FROM WOTHON ACCOMPANYING STUDENT CARD: WELLNESS SELF-ASSESSMENTBACKGROUND/OVERVIEWDuring the last 75 years, the burden of disease in the UnitedStates has shifted from acute, life-threatening emergencies tochronic illnesses, including hypertension, arthritis, cancer,asthma, chronic pain, and, most recently, AIDS. Theseillnesses are prevalent, expensive, and lethal: More than 40million Americans suffer from hypertension; chronic painaccounts for $63billion a year of our national health bill; andcancer claims 520,000 lives annually.Thirty years ago itseemed that these conditions could not be significantly alteredby those who suffered from them. Now there is strong evi-dence that they are shaped and sustained, if not caused, at leastin part, by our environment and our interpersonal world, by theways we eat and exercise, work and play, think, feel, and act.We now know too that what we as individuals and societiescan make worse, we can also, in many cases, improve.One of our most powerful healing tools is our own mind.Since the 1960s, medical researchers have begun to map thepathways by which thoughts, emotions, and attitudes canaffect the body and its various systems. Researchers arebeginning to define routes by which anger and fear, despairand optimism can exert their influences on the central andautonomic nervous systems and through them on the heart andcardiovascular functioning, on the digestive, endocrine, andimmune systems.There are many ways to mobilize the mind to enhance thefunctioning and improve the health of the body. Since the1960s, researchers have used the technology of biofeedback todemonstrate the mind's capacity to regulate functions that hadseemed automaticamong them, skin temperature, contrac-tions of blood vessels, and the electrical patterns of the brain.Dr. Herbert Benson and his colleagues at Harvard have shownhow meditation can produce physiological and psychologicalbalance, which can, in turn, lower high blood pressure, decreasepain, and diminish the nausea that accompanies chemotherapy.Other researchers have demonstrated the reciprocal influenceof the body and the mind. Behavior that improves physicalfunctioning such as jogging on a regular basis can beas potent as antidepressants in relieving anxiety and depression.The mind can affect the body, and the body can affect the mind.In the last 15 years, clinicians, inspired by this research,have begun to create comprehensive programs in which peoplewith refractory conditions, such as chronic pain, cancer, AIDS,asthma, infertility, and anxiety can learn to help themselvesand one another. The results are impressive. People who jointhese programs may use less medication and have less pain.They are less likely to go to an emergency room seekingtreatment for an asthma attack, and have less trouble gettingpregnant. There are increases in the quality and, in some cases,the length of their lives. The mutual support that is given andreceived in the programs makes measurable improvements inthe physical well-being of the participants and in their outlookon their lives and illnesses. 6P OGRAN SUMMARY\"Healing From Within,\" Program 3 of HEALINGAND THE MIND, explores how Eastern meditationand Western group psychotherapy help people usetheir minds to improve the healing capacities withintheir bodies.Moyers visits the Stress Reduction Clinic at theUniversity of Massachusetts Medical Center to sharethe experiences of individuals suffering from severemedical problems as they learn to trust and practicea form of Buddhist meditation known as mindfulness.Their teacher is Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, founder of theclinic and an associate professor of preventive andbehavioral medicine. We observe these individualsover a period of eight weeks as they work to gaincontrol over their pain and anxiety by focusing theirminds' attention on their bodies. The concept ofmindfulness becomes clear as the participants learnto focus in on the present moment, observing theirbreathing, body sensations, their thoughts andfeelings, and then, learning to come to terms withtheir illness and their pain in new ways based ontheir experiences using meditation.Moyers then visits the Stanford Medical Center inPalo Alto, California, and follows one group ofwomen with metastatic breast cancer as they meet inweekly therapy sessions with psychiatrist Dr. DavidSpiegel. In an earlier study, Spiegel found that grouppsychotherapy appeared to prolong life in suchpatients. Under his guidance, the women cometogether to talk about their lives, their losses, andtheir disease. As they share their experiences ofillness, they seem to reduce their own and oneanother's anxiety and depression. In his conversa-tions withMoyers, Spiegel expresses his hope thatthis sharing will not only reduce anxiety and feelingsof helplessness but will also enhance coping skills andself-esteem.Although the program examines pain and illness thatmay cause death, it is ultimately uplifting, for theviewer recognizes that the people whom he or shemeets are learning that they do not have to feel likehelpless victims but can become active individualsworking to live and appreciate their lives as fully aspossible while facing the actuality of their situations. The success of these programs is encouraging healthprofessionals in public hospitals and in private offices through-out the country to develop similar programs that address thevariety of chronic illnesses that in different ways beset themand their patients.

The quality and quantity of services that hospitalsprovide increased dramatically as a result of the impact ofmajor medical advances beginning in the early 19th century.Those advances included the discovery and the use of anesthe-sia, the introduction of antiseptic techniques, the use of X-rays,and the establishment of nursing schools. Twentieth-centurytechnological improvements have also enhanced the ability ofhospitals to diagnose and treat a variety of diseases. Todayhospitals serve a much broader function by providing manyservices ranging from counseling to wellness clinics to healthfairs for both the ill and the healthy.The heart of any hospital transcends its technology. Thecore of a hospital's effectiveness is its staff especiallypatient-support servicesdoctors, nurses, technicians, andvolunteerson whose expertise and care the patient's lifedepends. Until fairly recently that care tended to focus ontreating disease as if it were separate from the person beingtreated. People entered hospitals where they became powerless\"cases\" controlled in a laboratorylike manner through theimposition of impersonal hospital procedures, rules, schedules,and technology. Now clinicians and researchers are demon-strating how the atmosphere and the style of treatment canpromote healing.Evidence that mind and the emotions play an important rolein health has motivated some hospitals to create environmentsthat support the emotional as well as the medical needs ofpatients. These efforts include the following:o decentralizing nursing care so that a patient is cared for by afew \"regular\" nurses rather than with an army of temporaryoneso helping patients learn more about their diseases, theprocedures involved in treating them, and how they canpromote their own recoveryo encouraging patients to ask questionso making the hospital environment appealing by creating ahomelike atmosphere, which includes comfortable furniture,flexible visiting hours, and fewer restrictions on who may visito expanding counseling and psychological and emotionalsupport provided for patientso allowing patients to see and discuss their medical recordso training health-care workers to use compassion whenworking with patients.The goal is to help patients become active participants intheir own recovery, which will produce faster rates of recov-ery, less anxiety when entering and leaving a hospital, andcontinued improvement after returning home. 8PROGRAM SUMMARYIn \"The Art of Healing,\" Program 4 of HEALING ANDTHE MIND , Bill Moyers visits several American hospi-tals that are altering their procedures and physicalenvironments in order to meet patients' emotional andpsychological needs as well as treat their illnesses. In hisinterviews with patients, doctors, nurses, and hospitalconsultants, Moyers explores such issues as the impactof serious illness on the family and how hospitals areaddressing the family's needs; how hospitals are helpingpatients allay the fear of illness; how health-care work-ers are being encouraged to listen and respond topatients; and how hospital staffs are attempting toreduce \"hospital anxiety\" by using art, humor, massage,hand-holding, and other forms of person-to-personbonding. These new models of medical care are helpingpatients heal faster, leave the hospital earlier, and dobetter when they get home. GOALS I> to recognize the new methods that hospitals are using intreating patients and their familiesI> to understand that every individual has a responsiblity forhis or her healthI> to recognize the importance of patients' emotional well-being to their overall health and recoveryt> to understand the value of family support in a person'srecovery from illness. In an effort to help people take part in theirown health and well-being, a nurse shows asix-year-old girl how to read her temperature. 141 BEFORE VIEWING AFTER VIEWINGIntroducing the ProgramIn \"The Art of Healing\" we see howtouchfrom therapeutic massage tothe cradling of a premature infant isused to help people heal. The followingactivity involving a handshake can helpstudents recognize the various feelingsthat can be communicated by touch.Have students work in pairs. Ask themto stand or sit so that one partner's backis aligned with the chalkboard. Tell theclass that you are going to write thenames of three emotions or feelings onthe chalkboard and that you want theother partner, the person facing theboard, to communicate each of thosefeelings, one at a time, to his or herpartner with a handshake or by touchingthe partner's hand in some other way.Write the following on the board: fear,compassion/reassurance, joy. Have partnersdiscuss their reactions after each touch.Then ask partners to change places andrepeat the activity to show the followingfeelings: anger, sorrow, victory. Whenstudents have completed the activity, askthem to discuss their feelings: how theyfelt as initiators and recipients of eachtouch.Explain that many hospitals are helpingpatients to heal in ways that are new tohospital settings. Health-care profession-als are using touch, compassion, andother forms of communication to helppatients recover more quickly.

Introduce thestudent card by having small groups ofstudents discuss the responsibilities ofboth a doctor and a patient. Have oneperson from each group share thegroup's conclusions with the class. Allowtime for class discussion. Then duplicateand distribute \"Taking Charge of YourHealth.\"ACTIVITIES al Using what they have learned fromthe program and the student card,\"Taking Charge of Your Health,\" stu-dents should work in groups of three torole-play the situation described below.Make up sets of index cards featuring thefollowing information, and give one setto each group. Ask each group memberto take and read only one card.Card I: Dr. OrtegaMrs. Hanson has been complaining of occa-sional severe stomach pain. You would likeher to undergo some tests so that you candetermine what is wrong and how to treather. She seems resistant to the idea.Your goal is to allay her fears and convince15her to be tested. You will begin the roleplay by initiating a dialogue with Mrs.Hanson.Card 2: Mrs. HansonYou have been experiencing occasionalsevere stomach pain. You tell your husbandthe condition is not serious and will passsoon, but secretly you are frightened thatsomething is terribly wrong. You want tobe cured but, because of previous hospitalexperiences, are afraid of going to thehospital for tests.Your goal is to find out all you can aboutyour condition and persuade the doctor toprescribe medicine you can take at home.Dr. Ortega will begin the role play.Card 3: Mr. HansonYour wife has been experiencing severestomach pain. You are very worried, eventhough she says it is nothing. You believethat she needs to be tested to find out whatis wrong. You like the doctor and want tocooperate in every way possible.Your goal is to support your wife emotion-ally and to convince her to undergo appro-priate tests. Dr. Ortega will begin the roleplay.Allow groups ten minutes to enact theirrole plays. Then allow each group time todiscuss the role play and determine whetherthey interacted in constructive, supportingways. Allow groups time to share theirobservations with one another.1:21 Design a project in which individualsor groups of students research andreport on the services provided by areahospitals. Students can begin by contact-ing the public-relations officer at thehospital or by interviewing people whohave been patients at the hospital.Suggest that they research the following:emergency-room care, aftercare, patient-support services, support groups/programs, social workers, nutritionalcounseling, and the like.

Many believe that to overcome sickness, all weneed do is fix the broken part. However, many medical profes-sionals are recognizing the need to treat illness as more than anisolated physical problem. They realize the importance oftreating the whole person. They also make a distinction betweencuring and healing. \"Curing\" describes an external process usedto treat a specific disease. Even patients who have a terminalillness and cannot be cured, these medical professionals say, canoften be healed.Some health-care experts, such as Michael Lerner of theCommonweal Cancer Help Program, distinguish healing fromcuring. Lerner says, \"Healing is a process of becoming whole.It can happen at a physical level, as in wound healing. It canalso occur at an emotional and spiritual level. It is a movementtoward wholeness that seeks out physical recovery wheneverpossible.\"Psychotherapists and physicians with this view of health notonly encourage patients to get conventional treatments, butalso promote other therapies including diet, exercise and theexploration of feelings, beliefs, and attitudes towards life.From the perspective of these health-care professionals, illnesscan become an agent of transformation. This process canpromote an expanded self-knowledge and understanding of lifeeven while, in the case of terminal illness, revealing thepainful reality of approaching death.Healing can be fostered through a number of approachesthat complement conventional therapies. They can increase aperson's sense of well-being and decrease his or h& fear. Suchapproaches include non-competitive physical exercise, dance,poetry, art, and group discussions of the experience of illnessitself. Leaders in the field advocate the following approaches,among others, to facilitate healing:o Meditation and yoga help people relieve stress and anxiety,develop inner peace, understand the body's needs, andexperience the psychological well-being that can result fromrelaxation and gentle physical exercise.o Expression through the visual arts, poetry, and dance can betherapeutic. For the ill, these art forms help expand self-awareness and restore a sense of wholeness by providingopportunities to creatively explore and communicate thedifficult experience of illness and explore its personal meaning.o Support groups provide a place for participants to overcomethe sense of loneliness and isolation that frequently accompa-nies serious illness. In such groups, people share their anxi-eties, hopes, feelings of guilt, questions, and strengths. Thissharing is a source of empowerment that enables the partici-pants to better deal with their illness and their lives.Such approaches can play an important role in overcomingthe stress and psychological pain of traumatic illness. They canhelp the seriously and terminally ill confront sickness andmortality and draw on the strength and inner resources whichare part of every human being.liolPROGRAM SUMMARYIn \"Wounded Healers,\" Program of HEALINGAND THE MIND, Bill Moyers visits Commonweal, ahealth education and research center in Bolinas,California, that offers week-long stress-reductionand healing retreats for people with cancer. Hewitnesses the experience of a group of people asthey learn to navigate the life passage called cancer.As these people meet together under the guidanceof Michael Lerner, Ph.D., founder and president ofthe Commonweal Cancer Help Program, and RachelNaomi Remen, M.D., its medical director, they sharefeelings of isolation, guilt, fear, rage, despair, hopeand love.At Commonweal they talk openly and emotionallyabout their illness, their medical treatment and theeffect of both on their bodies and spirits. As thesessions progress, we see how this sharing andbonding allows them to find new meaning in theirexperience and helps them to heal themselves andeach other. In a remarkable scene, Lerner andRemen share with the group their personal experi-ences and feelings about serious illness and death.Their intimacy provides a breathtaking contrast tothe way many doctors distance themselves frompatients as individual human beings.\"Wounded Healers\" witnesses the healing ap-proaches offered at Commonweal. The programilluminates how the gentle touch or voice of anotherhuman being can both reassure and ease emotionalpain and perhaps even strengthen the will to live. Italso shows that massage, yoga, art, experiencingnature, and simply walking on the beach with a new-found friend can all contribute to the healingprocess.The program often evokes deep sadness, yet it hasmoments of humor and optimism. Our last image ofthe participants is one in which they are smiling andhugging, filled with love and hope. NOTE: Please preview \"Wounded Healers\" beforeshowing it to your class. This program may be emotion-ally distressing for some students. They may react byacting out or getting extremely upset. Students need tobe aware of these possibilities and given permission to\"tune out\" or leave the classroom, if they cannot dealwith the subject matter. The program may seem sad atthe start but students who see it to the end will receive apowerful message about the importance of love andrelationships and the strength of the human spirit. BEFORE VIEWING AFTER VIEWING ACTIVITIESIntroducing the ProgramThis activity will allow students to expresstheir feelings about serious illness, death,and their own strengths in a non-threatening way. It will also bring intofocus the universality of these feelings.Distribute index cards to students. Askthem to write a sentence describing theirdeepest feelings about terminal illness ordeath as it relates to them or to thoseclose to them. Also ask them to write asentence describing one inner strengththat empowers them. Remind them notto write their names. Collect the cards,shuffle and redistribute them. Have eachstudent, in turn, read aloud the card heor she has received. Have students dis-cuss their reactions to the feelings ex-pressed by their classmates. Ask studentshow their strengths might help them todeal with a serious illness or a loss.Tell students that the program they willsee, \"Wounded Healers,\" visits theCommonweal Cancer Help Program,where participants come, not to becured, but to search for emotional andspiritual healing.GOALSit. to recognize the difference betweencuring and healingto understand that many people sharesimilar feelings and fear about illnessand deathto understand the importance ofrelationships and giving and receivinghelp in the healing process.Discussion QuestionsEncourage students to discuss theprogram and share their observations.The following questions may be used toguide discussion.II What part of this program was themost difficult for you to deal with? Whatpart did you like the best? What did yousee that you haven't seen before?Ell Is there a difference between curingand healing?

Did you learn somethingabout relating to people who are ill?What would you do if someone close toyou became ill?ED Are you able to ask for and receivehelp the way the people in this film do?Are you willing to give support? What, ifanything, stands in your way?STUDENT CARDThe student card, \"The Circle of Life,\"will introduce students to the rituals andcelebrations that various culturescelebrate to mark passages through life.Before distributing the card, havestudents discuss milestones in their livesand the ceremonies that mark them.Students may mention such ceremoniesas baptisms, bar mitzvahs, sweet-sixteenparties, graduations, and marriages. Askthem to think about how participation inthese .eremonies marks an individual'snew relationship to the community.Discuss how feeling part of a community(either through formal ceremonies,organized group participation, orpersonal relationships) might have a rolein healing. At this time duplicate anddistribute \"The Circle of Life\" (twosides).

ManyAfricans believe that illness is the resultof a disharmony between a person andthe spirits, a family or a community. Tobe healed a person requires the servicesof an intermediary who is in touch withthe spirit world. This person may per-form a ritual and may prescribe herbalcures.Traditional healing is practiced both invillages and in urban areas. In urbanareas Africans can choose between tra-ditional healers and licensed doctors,nurses, and other health-care workerswho practice modern western medi-cine. In Zimbabwe, for example, thereare more than 24,000 traditional heal-ers and 11,000 registered practitionersof Western medicine.

NATIVE AMERICANSAND HEALINGWholeness or unity between mind andbody is the underlying principle in thehealing tradition of Native Americans.For thousands of years before the ar-rival of Europeans in America, NativeAmericans developed and refined theirvast knowledge of medicine that wasderived from a rich spiritual connection(especially to nature) and from knowl-edge of hundreds of prairie, swamp, andforest plants. Key figures in NativeAmerican heal ing are the shamans (triballeaders) and medicine men. Healingmethods almost always involve the useof prayer, ceremony and ritual and mayinclude dance, singing, smoking a cer-emonial pipe, sitting in a sweat lodge,the use of various symbols or articlesthat are believed to have special pow-ers, and drinking herbal teas. The pur-pose of ritual is to engage the spirits andhelp the patient embark on a new path-way to unity. STUDENT CARD FOR USE WITH \"THE MYSTERY OF CHI\" THE HEALING ARTOF INDIAAyurveda is a form of medicine widelypracticed in India. It means \"life\" (ayus),\"science\" or \"knowledge\" (veda), and isthousands of years old. The underlyingidea of Ayurveda is that health is theresult of balance between the spirit andthe body. The goal of ayurvedic treat-ment is to restore the balance andenable the patient to achieve \"rightliving\" rather than just freedom fromillness. Every aspect of a person's life istaken into account when he or she isbeing treiied.Each person is classified as a type, ordoshaair, fire, or water. Dependingon a person's dosha, a doctor ofAyurveda may prescribe various typesand combinations of massage; herbalpreparations (applied externally or takeninternally); changes in diet, sleeping po-sition, and/or personal hygiene; activi-ties to induce sweating (i.e., a steambath); breathing practices; and medita-tion.

A HEALER AMONGLATINOSIn Latin America and among Latinos inthe United States, a person who is illmay visit a curandero, a lay healer, whomay prescribe herbal teas and provide aritual ceremony involving the burning ofcandles. Just as important as the ritual,however, is the spiritual connectionbetween the patient and the curandero,a trusted member of the community.Botanicas, small stores found through-out Latin America and the UnitedStates, sell merchandise intended tohelp people improve their health, finan-cial condition, love life or other aspectsof their lives. Potions, charms, herbs,incense, statues of saints and other holypeople, and shark jaws are among themerchandise sold.22HOMEOPATHY INEUROPEAN COUNTRIESHomeopathy is a form of treatment inwhich diseases are believed to be curedby using small amounts of substancesthat would bring about in healthy peoplethe very symptoms the patient is exper-iencing. For example, to treat fever adoctor of homeopathy would give apatient a remedya small dose of anextract from a plant, an animal, or a drugthat would raise the patient's bodytemperature. In homeopathy, a symp-tom is a sign that the body is curing itself.This viewpoint differs from Westernmedicine (allopathic medicine) that at-tempts to eliminate symptoms.Homeopathy, which originated in Ger-many in the 1800s, was widely practicedin the United States, Europe and SouthAmerica before 1900 and is still popularamong many people today.

A highly intricate sys-tem made up of cells that carry out specific tasks,your immune system has the ability to identify any-thing that is \"self\" and everything that is \"not self.\"Scientific research has found that the brain commu-nicates with the immune system by means of neu-ropeptides, chemicals produced by nerve cells in thebrain and in other parts of the body. Neuropeptidesseem to fluctuate with emotional states. Scientiststherefore conclude that the emotions can influencethe immune system. ENEMYVirus unit of genetic material that mustenter a cell in your body in order toreplicate (other enemies include bacteria,fungi, and protozoa).DEFENDERSMacrophage a scavenger cell thatlooks for and collects invaders andcellular waste.When it finds an enemy,it alerts Helper T-cells.Helper T-Cell recognizes the enemyand calls B- and Killer T-cells in thespleen and lymph nodes to fight theinvaders.Killer T-Cell kills cells invaded by anenemy as well.

HEALINGand the i'V\\ INDOdmrkSTUDENT CARDTAKNG CH&AME OF WITH \"THE ART OF HEALING\" Youcan take a more active role inkeeping yourself healthy, and evenhelping yourself recover more quicklywhen you are ill or injured. It is oftenhard to feel in control when you are notwell. First, you feel sick. Second, youmay know very little about the illness orinjury, the treatment, and the length oftime it will take you to recover. Some ofus surrender our responsibility to aphysician in the hopes that he or she willtake charge of our recovery. Yet it isoften our feelings of utter dependenceon a physician that make us feel help-less. It doesn't have to be that way.Whether we are healthy or ill, we canand should be active participants in ourown health and healing.Realizing that we can make choicescan help us take control of our well-being. There are many decisions that wecan make. Among them are when toseek help, which physician to choose,and what type of treatment to pursue.Here are some points to consider whenmaking choices about your health:Choose a doctor you feel com-fortable with. A doctor is a trainedmedical specialist who can do some-thing that you cannot do diagnoseyour illness, and prescribe treatmentand medication,if necessary. Eventhough a doctor has specialized knowl-edge, he or she does not know yourbody and your life as well as you do.That is why it's important to think ofyour relationship with your doctor asa partnershipboth of you will worktogether to help you stay healthy orrecover if you become ill or sustain aninjury.You also have the choice to changedoctors if you are not satisfied. If youdo not get the kind of information youneed, if you think you are not gettingbetter, if you are confused and wor-ried, discuss these problems with yourdoctor. If you still feel dissatisfied, youhave the right to change doctors.Be completely honest with yourdoctor both in answering any ques-tions and in filling out the medical his-tory form. This is important informa-tion the doctor needs to know in or-der to help you remain healthy or helpyou recover your health.Ask questions. You should receiveas much information about your illnessas your doctor can give you. You shouldask what illness you have, what causesit, what treatments are possible, whattreatment the doctor recommends,what side effects you may experience,and how long the treatment will last.Such information should be explainedto you in language that you can under-stand. If you don't understand some-thing, ask the doctor to repeat it orexplain it in simple language..Educate yourself about the illnessor injury. Learn as much about it asyou can. Find books and articles inyour local library, or contact nationalfoundations or agencies. Knowing aboutyour disease or injury will help youmake decisions and will give you asense of control.Make decisions. Take part in all de-cisions about your health. If you re-quire hospitalization or medical tests,you should know why and what thecost will be. Before you agree to behospitalized, or take a specific test ormedication, learn what other optionsare available to you. In an effort to helppeople take part in theirown health and well-being, a nurse shows asix-year-old girl how toread her temperature.Follow the treatment. Once youunderstand what it is and agree to it,follow the treatment your doctor pre-scribes. Often when patients learn thattheir ailment isn't serious, they are sorelieved that they fail to follow theprescribed treatment for the lesser ail-ment. Also, tell the doctor about anyproblems that develop after you havebegun treatment.Ask for help. If you are ill dr injuredand need help, seek assistance fromfamily or friends. Allowing someone tohelp you can be as simple as asking fora box of tissues or as complex as ask-ing someone to accompany you tothe hospital for testing. Obtaining sup-port reaffirms your belief that peoplecare about you and your well-being.TAKING INVENTORYTake a look at the choices you makethat affect your health.

Those who face serious illnessreflect on their lives and their lifepassages as they search to heal them-selves. They strive to understand theirillness as part of the life experience. Inmany cultures, a person's journeythrough life is honored by celebrationsand rituals. The ceremonies of birth,initiation, marriage and death each marka rite of passage in this circle of life. BIRTH AND CHILDHOODThe rituals welcoming children into theworld mark a time of great joy andsolemnity as new life is received into thecommunity. Baptism in the Catholic re-ligion is a community affair in which thenewborn, bathed in holy water, iscleansed of original sin and welcomedinto the church community.In the Cameroon rainforest, newbornsare welcomed through a ceremony ofannointment. A family matriarch rubsthe baby with the juice from the ngeletree that is both medicine and \"holywater.\"INITIATION AND ADOLESCENCEAdolescence is a pivotal stage in thepassage from childhood to adulthood.In many cultures there is a ceremony ofinitiation into the adult world whichconsists of an ordeal or trial throughwhich adolescents learn and accept whatis expected of them. In the Candombl\u00e9culture of Brazil, a boy becomes a mem-ber of the community through an an-cient ceremony that takes place overseveral months and involves intensepreparation. During this time, the boy isbelieved to be possessed by a spirit thathelps him pass into adulthood and bereceived by society with a new status.Young women in the African country ofZaire receive their initiation at the on-set of menstruation. While secluded ina menstrual hut for up to a month, theseyoung women are taught by olderwomen about sex and child rearing. Atthe conclusion of this instruction, theyoung women are reintroduced tothe community as new women andpotential brides.

In Western cultures, the bride isshowered with rice in a tradition thatdates back to the Middle Ages. It sym-bolizes the community's wishes for thenew couple to experience fertility andgood fortune.

These rites helpthe survivors make the transition fromanger and grief to acceptance as well asto confront their own mortality. In theChinese traditions of Taoism, Buddhismand Confucianism, death is considered apassage to rebirth.
