BraceAbility.com ranks 85th among [Medical Supplies](/categories/medical-supplies) sites. I will admit I was skeptical when I ordered the pelvic floor brace about six months ago. The brace was to be used to enhance my pessary's performance that I have been wearing for the last couple of years. My vaginal prolapse is Dr. rated as a stage III, with the rectal prolapse right behind as a stage II. The prolapses were really affecting my lifestyle so I ordered the pelvic floor brace from Braceablity. I was right on the bubble for ordering one size and when it came it was too small. I packaged it back up, and requested the next size up. They promptly sent me the next size and took the return with no hassles. I am so satisfied with how well the brace is working! I can't believe that it has made such a difference in my daily life of daily landscaping and gardening, also I am a beekeeper and can again lift 50lb honey supers at age 61. My lifestyle has been improved dramatically by this brace, who would of guessed it? Not me, the world's biggest skeptic. They proved me wrong, and I'm so happy about it.

Products used: None- the air cast was too uncomfortable and damaged from being smashed into a box that's too small. They sent brace 5 sizes to small, charges ne more for shipping ($37) More than cost of grace. They said to return for correct size, the size o ordered. Then emailed and said it was a glitch, that it refunded. Only partial refund. Then when I pushed issue they said brace had body odor, I never even tried it on it was 5 sizes too small! They kept mu money. SCAM, do not buy ANYTHING from this Co. Filed fraud case with BBB. Tip for consumers: DO NOT PURCHASE Anything!! Scam!! Products used: BrsceAbility shoulder brace Where do I begin? This company is clearly scamming people. The brace i received was in fact new but 100% useless. It provided ZERO support for my knee. After walking a few minutes, it would always end up down at my ankle. No matter how I adjusted it, it would not saty up. Their customer service is non-existent. Apparently, if you wear the brace for more than 5 seconds they will not refund your money. I would advise people to avoid this company like the plague. Products used: knee brace This company is a scam. They tell you how to measure your knee. If your size is in-between what they offer they tell you to guess and pick a size in-between. Brace kept falli g down my leg enven thought staps were as tight as possible. Then they make you pay for the return. Terrible. Don't order. If you must, see if amazon offers it. At least they'll let you return it for free. Products used: Knee brace Wearing the brace for less than a month the Dorsiflexion strap ripped off at the top of boot. Vanessa customer relations rep asked me to send pictures which I did no response sent follow up email again no response might make a brace out of 2 X 4's and leather straps at least it wont break I wish zero stars was an option. I ordered a brace according to their size chart and upon receipt, the brace was huge. I couldn't even close it! No biggie. They offer what I thought to be a fairly simple exchange policy so I followed the steps. 5 days later I get an e-mail stating my exchange was denied due to the brace being stained. I requested a copy of the image and there is nothing there! They will not exchange, refund or ship the \"defective\" brace back. My guess is to resell at full profit. The company is a joke. Do not order. Tip for consumers: Suggested sizing is too big. Size down at least 1 size. I purchased two braces of different sizes because I was borderline on their size chart. First off, one was out of stock but they never told me and it stayed listed as in stock on website. Eventually I got them to ship one but it was too big. I got the second and it was fine. I returned the first one but got an email saying it was used and worn. I tried it on one time and put it back in the original bag. They lure you with free returns and then don't accept them. Products used: Knee brace. But they refused to honor return policy Order at your own risk! Order at your own risk! Order at your own risk! Order at your own risk! Order at your own risk! Order at your own risk! I ordered their back brace. It was too large and offered very little support. I put it right back in the packaging it had been shipped in and called the company. I opted out of them sending me a return mailing label for an $8.00 charge. At this time, I do not have my printer set up for lack of room. So, my son-in-law took it to our local post office and shipped it back to them. After 18 days of not hearing anything, I called them and was told that I returned it dirty and with hair on it and they would not be giving me a refund. I didn't wear the brace. Only tried it on for maybe 30 seconds. It was NOT dirty. Hair on it? What hair? No pets in here and my hair is always pulled up. I believe they took something round, like a saltshaker, dipped it in dirt and made the mark on the back of the brace and then swiped a finger across it as well. I filed a dispute with my cc company and with the BBB. I am also posting about this experience on my facebook page and on my blog. Tip for consumers: Don't order from Brace Ability. Products used: Back brace. WORST BRACE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED APPEARED TO BE USED, ALL STRETCHED OUT! TRIED TO RETURN IT FOR A REFUND, REFUSED MY RETURN, NOW WILL NOT COMMUNICATE WITH ME AT ALL. TURNED THEM OVER TO THE BBB IN THEIR AREA, VERY BAD AND DECEPTIVE COMPANY IN MY OPINION! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY WASH USED BRACES AND IN MY OPINION RESALE THEM, THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THEY DO NOT WANT TO RETURN THEM BACK TO YOU AFTER REFUSING YOUR REFUND REQUEST! BUYER BEWARE, VERY BAD COMPANY! HERE IS WHAT THEY WROTE TO ME AND NOW THEY WILL NOT COMMUNICATE: Used/Worn: The item was visibly used or worn, beyond just trying on the brace. This could include scuffs or dirt marks, pet hair, body dander, etc. We clean all of the products when they're returned, and if our standard cleaning procedures cannot return the item to \"like new\" condition, it will be denied. ASK YOURSELF WHY THEY CLEAN THEM? TRUTH IS I NEVER WORE THAT BRACE, JUST TRIED IT ON! Tip for consumers: BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY, IN MY OPINION THEY ARE NOT HONEST!! DON'T PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THEM, THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOUR MONEY AND KEEP YOUR ITEM. IT IS MY OPINION THAT THEY SELL PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED; ONCE RETURNED THEY WASH THEM, WHY? READ WHAT THEY TOLD ME:Used/Worn: The item was visibly used or worn, beyond just trying on the brace. This could include scuffs or dirt marks, pet hair, body dander, etc. We clean all of the products when they're returned, I BELIEVE I PURCHASED A USED BRACE!!!! Products used: NONE, SENT BACK I ordered an item in the size recommended by their size chart. In fact, based on reviews, I ordered a size smaller. The item was HUGE and there is no way it can be used. They wanted me to pay to return it and now they refuse to communicate at all. Never, never again.
