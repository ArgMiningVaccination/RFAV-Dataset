This report updates vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates including all COVID-19 vaccines available through August 14, 2021, and examines whether VE differs for adults with increasing time since completion of all recommended vaccine doses. VE before and during SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant predominance, which coincided with an increase in reported COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections, were compared (3,4). Methods for the HEROES-RECOVER Cohorts have been published previously (1,2,5). Health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers in eight U.S. locations across six states were tested weekly for SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and upon the onset of any COVID-19-like illness. Weeks when the Delta variant accounted for 50% of viruses sequenced, based on data from each respective location, were defined as weeks of Delta variant predominance. Vaccination was documented by self-report and verified by provision of vaccine cards or extraction from electronic medical records or state immunization registries. Among 4,217 67 (2%) Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccines. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate ratios of unvaccinated to fully vaccinated (14 days after receipt of all recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses) infection rates, adjusted for occupation, site, and local viral circulation (6), and weighted for inverse probability of vaccination using sociodemographic characteristics, health information, frequency of close social contact, and mask use. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.\u00a7 During the 35-week study period, 4,136 participants with no previous laboratory-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection contributed a median of 20 unvaccinated days per participant (interquartile range [IQR] = 8-45 days; total = 181,357 days), during which 194 SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified; 89.7% of these infections were symptomatic. A total of 2,976 participants contributed a median of 177 fully vaccinated days (IQR = 115-195 days; total = 455,175 days) with 34 infections, 80.6% of which were symptomatic. Adjusted VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 69%-88%). The VE point estimate was 85% among participants for whom <120 days had elapsed since completion of full vaccination compared with 73% among those for whom 150 days had elapsed; however the VE 95% CI were overlapping, indicating the difference was not statistically significant ( [Table](#T1_down)). During Delta variant-predominant weeks at study sites, 488 unvaccinated participants contributed a median of 43 days (IQR = 37-69 days; total = 24,871 days) with 19 SARS-CoV-2 infections (94.7% symptomatic); 2,352 fully vaccinated participants contributed a median of 49 days (IQR = 35-56 days; total = 119,218 days) with 24 SARS-CoV-2 infections (75.0% symptomatic). Adjusted VE during this Delta predominant period was 66% (95% CI = 26%-84%) compared with 91% (95% CI = 81%-96%) during the months preceding Delta predominance. During December 14, 2020-August 14, 2021, full vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines was 80% effective in preventing RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among frontline workers, further affirming the highly protective benefit of full vaccination up to and through the most recent summer U.S. COVID-19 pandemic waves. The VE point estimates declined from 91% before predominance of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant to 66% since the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant at the HEROES-RECOVER cohort study sites; however, this trend should be interpreted with caution because VE might also be declining as time since vaccination increases and because of poor precision in estimates due to limited number of weeks of observation and few infections among participants. As with all observational VE studies, unmeasured and residual confounding might be present. Active surveillance through the cohort is ongoing and VE estimates will be monitored continuously. Although these interim findings suggest a moderate reduction in the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing infection, the sustained two thirds reduction in infection risk underscores the continued importance and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.
