This balance is formed from chakras that live within us. Each one is the center of spiritual power in the human body. There are generally considered to be seven main chakras that keep our mind and body aligned. Starting from the root chakra (sits at the base of the spine) to the crown chakra (located at the top of the head), this energy flows through our body and can actually have a massive effect on our mental and physical health. Think of chakras like another organ system. We need every organ to function properly so that our body can perform to its fullest. When our chakras are balanced, our body is in harmony, and we feel energized, elevated, and whole. When they're not balanced, we experience a multitude of physical, mental, and emotional imbalances; anything from low back pain and immune disorders to low self-esteem and indecision. Aiding these symptoms by practicing chakra-healing techniques allows the body to heal fully and naturally with results that benefit you every day of your life. In order to balance your chakras, you can practice various forms of healing exercises such as meditation, massage, and yoga. Chakra meditation and yoga should always involve thoughts and movements that assist in bringing your attention to yourself and to a state of pure awareness. While these two techniques assist in your mental health, massage helps focus on your physical health by targeting muscles and joints that are tense, strained, or out of alignment. Our [chakra-healing course](http://healinghandsschool.com/classes-massage-therapy.php) introduces students to the energetic system of the body and its energy centers referred to as \"chakras.\" Students learn various techniques for balancing their own chakras as well as those of their clients'. Through lecture, demonstration and guided hands-on practice, students will learn how to use crystals, sound therapy, visualization meditations, color therapy and hands-on energy work to facilitate healthy energy flow. By understanding how to balance these energy centers the \"life-force energy\" can flow unimpeded. Our students are able to gain valuable new \"tools\" for keeping the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance.
