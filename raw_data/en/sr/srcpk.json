They are writtento enable nurses and midwives to reflect on the key points associated with medicationmanagement and the related principles, and thus support effective, safe and ethicalpractice. The professions' responsibilities, activities and accountability involvingmedications are intrinsically linked to the individual's scope of practice. It is, therefore,important to consider the guidelines outlined in this document in association with the Scope of Nursing and Midwifery Practice Framework (An Bord Altranais, 2000), which provides the foundation for this guidance document. The scope of practice for nursesand midwives in Ireland is determined by legislation, EU directives, internationaldevelopments, social policy, national and local guidelines, education and individuallevels of competence. The fundamental concepts of accountability, autonomy,competence and delegation that are considered in determining scope of practice alsorelate to the professions' role in medication management. Medication management, broadly defined, is the facilitation of safe and effective use of prescription and over-the-counter medicinal products (Bulechek and McCloskey, 1999).The nursing, midwifery, medical and pharmaceutical professions are all participants inmedication management and contribute to patient/service-user care. Medicationmanagement is a comprehensive intervention which encompasses the knowledge ofnurses and midwives (and that of other health care professionals) and the activities thatare performed to assist the patient/service-user in achieving the greatest benefit andbest outcomes involving medications (Naegle, 1999). The responsibilities of medicationmanagement incorporate the assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation ofthe nursing and midwifery process in collaboration with other health care professionalsin providing care. The nurse/midwife should have knowledge of the relevant statutes and legislation regarding the practices of prescribing, dispensing, storing, supplying and administeringscheduled medicinal products. (This includes controlled, prescription-only and over-the-counter medications). There is an obligation to practice according to the legislationgoverning nursing and midwifery practice, and the current standards and policies ofregulatory bodies and health service providers 1. Nurses and midwives should be aware of their legal and professional accountability with regard to medication management. Itis acknowledged that local need may dictate specific policies and protocols authorisingthe practices of individuals involved with medicines. The health service provider andhealth care regulatory and professional organisations have a responsibility to thepatient/service-user to assure safe and effective medication management practices. GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 51Appendix A sets forth the relevant legislation and statutes and Appendix B details the pertinent An Bord Altranais documents relating to medication management by nurses and midwives. It is best practice that policies and protocols are devised collaboratively by nursing, midwifery, medical, pharmacy and management staff where health care is provided.Consultation with the drugs and therapeutics committee (where available), or similargovernance structures, and other relevant personnel is advised in determining localpolicies and protocols involving medicinal products. Medication management practicesshould be audited on a regular basis to ensure effective and safe patient/service-usercare.GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 6AN BORD ALTRANAISGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 7SECTION 1 Medication Management - General Principles andResponsiblities 1.1 Legislation The activities associated with medication management involve the nursing, midwifery,medicine and pharmacy professions and the patient/service-user. Medicinal productslegislation authorises the registered medical practitioner or dentist to prescribemedication through the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, 2003 (Statutory Instrument (SI) 540 of 2003). More recently, the Irish Medicines Board Act (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006 (No. 3 of 2006), and the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) (Amendment), Regulations 2007 (SI 201 of 2007) give legal authority to nurses and midwives to prescribe medications. However, this authority is based upon the followingconditions being satisfied: 1. The nurse/midwife is employed by a health service provider in a hospital, nursing home, clinic or other health service setting (including any case where the healthservice is provided in a private home). 2. The medicinal product is one that would be given in the usual course of the service provided in the health service setting in which the nurse/midwife isemployed. 3. The prescription is issued in the usual course of the provision of that health service. In addition, the 2007 Regulations allow a health service provider to determine further conditions in limiting the prescriptive authority of the nurse/midwife. The An BordAltranais registration number (also known as the Personal Identification Number (PIN))must be stated on the prescription. Nurse/midwife prescribing of controlled drugs is detailed in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations, 2007 (SI 200 of 2007) which requires the above conditions to be met and details additional restrictions for the prescribing of MDA scheduledmedications 4, and 5. A specific schedule - Schedule 8 - has been devised, composedof four parts, which names the Schedule 2 and 3 drugs that a nurse/midwife isauthorised to prescribe and also dictates administration routes and care settings orconditions 2. Additional information concerning nurse and midwife prescribing is 2Refer to Appendix C for Schedule 8 details.GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 8AN BORD ALTRANAISprovided in the Practice Standards for Nurses and Midwives with Prescriptive Authority (An Bord Altranais, 2007). The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006, the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, 2003 and 2005 and the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, and subsequent regulations authorise the nurse/midwife to possess, supply and administer medicinal products to a patient/service-user. The Pharmacy Act, 2007, makes provision for the regulation of pharmacy, including authority for the sale and supply of medicinal products. 1.2 Key principles Medication management activities performed by the nurse/midwife may vary, dependingupon the individual patient/service-user situation, the health care setting, its policies andprotocols and the scope of practice of the nurse/midwife. The key factors to be consideredwhen determining the scope of practice for nursing and midwifery care also apply to thescope of practice for medication management. These include: Competence Accountability and autonomy Continuing professional development Support for professional nursing and midwifery practice Delegation Emergency situations. Standard Each nurse/midwife is expected to develop and maintain competence with regard to all aspects of medication management, ensuring that her/his knowledge, skills and clinicalpractice are up to date. The activities of medication management require that thenurse/midwife is accountable to the patient/service-user, the public, the regulatory body,her/his employer and any relevant supervisory authority. This relates to both actions andomissions. Supporting Guidance The nurse/midwife has a responsibility to ensure her/his continued professional development, which is necessary for the maintenance of competence, particularly withregard to medicinal products. She/he should seek assistance and support wherenecessary from the health service provider concerning continued professionaldevelopment. Standard Nurses or midwives who require a medication for a personal health condition should acquire it through appropriate means, i.e., from a pharmacy if an over-the-counter, non-prescription medication or on foot of a prescription from a medical practitioner orregistered nurse prescriber who has assessed this need. It is not acceptable practice for a nurse or midwife to remove or take medication from her/his workplace for personal use or for supplying for use by family, friends orsignificant others. This is applicable to all forms of medicinal products (e.g.,prescription medication including analgesia, antibiotics and non-prescription/over-the-counter medication). Supporting Guidance It is not appropriate for a nurse or midwife to ask a work colleague with prescriptive authority to write a prescription for them. In addition, nurses or midwives who removemedications from their place of employment for personal use may be subject to afitness to practise inquiry by An Bord Altranais for professional misconduct,employment disciplinary procedures and/or criminal charges. 1.3 Five rights of medication administration There are guiding principles for medication management that each nurse/midwife shouldadhere to in their delivery of care related to medicinal products. Standard The prescription or medication order should be verified that it is correct, prior to administration of the medicinal product. Clarification of any questions regarding theprescription/medication order should be conducted at this time with the appropriatehealth care professional. The expiration date of the medication should be checked priorto administration. Expired medications should not be administered. The five rights of medication administration should be applied for each patient/service- user encounter: Right medication, patient/service-user, dosage, form, time. Supporting Guidance The five rights considerations:1. The right medication: Matching the prescription/medication order against the label of the dispensed medication GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 9 Being aware of look-alike and similar sounding medications Best practice indicates using generic names of medications whenever possible. 2. The right patient/service-user: Being certain of the identity of the individual who is receiving the medication Checking the medical record number and/or identification band Asking the patient/service user to state her/his name Confirming that the name and age are means of ensuring the correct identity Maintaining a photo of the individual on the medication administration record. 3. The right dosage: Considering if the dosage is appropriate based on age, size, vital signs or other variables If it is necessary to measure the dose (e.g., liquid form) the appropriate equipment should be used. 4. The right form: Ensuring that the correct form, route and administration method of the medication are as prescribed If this information is not indicated on the prescription or on the label of the medication, it should be clarified with the prescriber, as many medications can begiven by various routes. 5. The right time: Ensuring the correct timing, frequency and duration of the prescribed order The timing of doses of medications can be critical for maintaining specific therapeutic blood-drug levels (e.g., antibiotics) and avoiding interactions with othermedications Accurately documenting medication administration times. For each patient/service-user encounter, medicinal products may normally be administered by a nurse/midwife on her/his own. As evidenced by best practice, thepreparation and administration of a medicinal product should be performed by the samenurse/midwife. Student nurses/midwives may administer medicinal products under the supervision of a nurse/midwife and should follow the principles of supervision. The registeredGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 10AN BORD ALTRANAISnurse/midwife retains accountability for the administration of medicinal products. The principles of aseptic technique and appropriate precautions (e.g., universal precautions, safety precautions with the management of cytotoxic therapy) should beobserved during the preparation and administration of the medicinal product. 1.4 Double-checking medications Double-checking is the process/activity of having a second colleague independently check the preparation of a medication for administration. This may involve verification ofthe medication against the medication prescription order, performing calculations fordosing of the correct volume or quantity of medication and/or other aspects ofmedication administration as appropriate. Double-checking is a significantnursing/midwifery activity to facilitate good medication management practices and is ameans of reducing medication errors. Standard The use of double-checking medications should be implemented purposefully in situations/indications that most require their use - particularly with high-alertmedications 3. Supporting Guidance Registered nurses/midwives are accountable for their professional decisions and do not need another professional colleague to routinely check their work. There is no legal orprofessional requirement that a nurse/midwife must double-check the preparation of amedication with a colleague prior to administration. However, a nurse/midwife mayconsider asking another nurse/midwife to double-check a medication preparation ifshe/he determines that assistance is needed. For patient/service-user safety and risk management purposes health service providers may have a policy for double-checking preparations, particularly for those that areconsidered high-alert medications (such as insulin, heparin and chemotherapy) or thatrequire complex calculations in preparation for administration. If double checking is required the Institute of Safe Medication Practice (ISMP) in the USA advocates that double-checking should be performed independently, withoutknowledge of any prior calculations, as problems or errors can occur with sharingprevious calculations or completing the double-check together (ISMP , 2003).GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 113High-alert medications are drugs that bear an increased risk of causing significant patient harm when they are used in error (ISMP , 2003).In determining whether or not double-checking of a medication is required, the following points should be considered by the nurse/midwife: Existence of a health service/employer policy for double-checking preparations Self assessment of competence. If it is identified by the nurse/midwife that a policy should be established, he/she should first examine the practice and patient/service user population. Consult with colleagues,nursing/midwifery managers, pharmacists and others as appropriate for this process.This may include identifying the high-alert medications used in the practice setting. 1.5 Monitoring and documentation of medication management Standard The assessment and evaluation of the administered prescribed medicinal product should encompass the observation of the patient/service-user for the following: Vital signs and laboratory values prior to administration (as applicable) Effectiveness of medication administration method (e.g., is the oral route appropriate for this patient/service-user?) Awareness and observation for medication allergies, possible side effects, adverse reactions, toxicity, interactions and contraindications of medicinal productsadministered Monitoring the effectiveness of the administered medicinal products. Standard The administration of a medicinal product and the patient/service-user response should be accurately documented according to local health service policy. Supporting Guidance Monitoring and documentation are key responsibilities for nurses and midwives in medication management; they incorporate the activities of assessment, planning,implementation and evaluation. These responsibilities require effective and efficientcommunication with the patient/service-user and other health care professionalsinvolved in her/his care. GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 12AN BORD ALTRANAIS1.6 Patient/service-user education Standard Education should be provided to the patient/service-user and/or carer in relation to the use of medicinal products. It should be explained to the person in a way that isaccessible and understandable. Supporting Guidance Consideration should be given to the appropriate timing of teaching, including patient/service-user or carer readiness to learn. Best practice would indicate that thisinformation should include: The expected mechanism of action of the medicinal product Potential side effects Signs and symptoms of potential adverse effects and actions to take if they occur Possible interactions of the medicinal product with other medications, particular foods or other substances Precautions or instructions to follow, including time, route, and method of administration and storage of medicinal products Significance of adherence to prescribed therapy (duration and frequency) Recommendations for follow-up and reporting of potential side effects or adverse reactions. 1.7 Considerations for withholding of medication Standard It is appropriate to exercise professional judgement to withhold a medicinal product if relevant in a specific patient/service-user case. The medical practitioner or registerednurse prescriber should be contacted with details if contraindications of administrationexist, thereby communicating changes in the condition of the patient/service user. Accurate and contemporaneous documentation should be made for any medicinal product withheld or refused. Any information or advice given to a patient/service-userabout the possible consequences of such a refusal should also be documented. Supporting Guidance It may be necessary to consult with a peer, medical practitioner, registered nurseGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 13prescriber, pharmacist or manager, as applicable regarding withholding medication. The decision by a patient/service-user or parent/guardian to refuse administration of a medicinal product (after having been provided with information about the drug and therisks and benefits of the therapy) should be respected and the medical practitioner orregistered nurse prescriber should be notified. 1.8 Use of complementary therapies Complementary therapies include, but are not limited to, acupressure, acupuncture,aromatherapy, herbalism, homeopathy, massage therapy, reflexology and yoga. The useof complementary therapies is increasingly more common in the delivery of health carewith many nurses and midwives providing these therapies. Standard The nursing/midwifery care plan should capture if patients/service-users use complementary therapies and medicines routinely. If a nurse/midwife is providingcomplementary therapies the patient/service-user consent and care plan should bedocumented in her/his chart. This information should also be communicated to themembers of the health care team involved in the patient/service-user's care. Supporting Guidance The nurse/midwife using complementary therapies should be competent in the specific therapy, having undergone an education programme that provides her/him with therequired skills and knowledge to practise such therapies. Prior to the initiation of the complementary therapy, the patient/service-user should be assessed and any co-existing conditions and treatments noted, as these therapies mayinteract with prescribed medicinal products by increasing or decreasing their effect orby combining to create a toxic effect.GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 14AN BORD ALTRANAISGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 15SECTION 2 The Cycle of Medication Management 2.1 Transcription of prescription/medication order Standard Best practice would indicate that the responsibility for documenting the prescription/medication order is with the medical practitioner and/or the registerednurse prescriber to prevent the possibility of error by another individual. The decision totranscribe a prescription should only be made in the best interests of the patient/serviceuser. A nurse/midwife who transcribes is professionally accountable for her/his decision to transcribe and the accuracy of the transcription. Supporting Guidance Transcribing is the act of transferring a medication order from the original prescription to the current medication administration record/prescription sheet. This activity shouldbe directed by local health service provider policy which must stipulate requiredsystems (i.e. a second person checking the prescription transcribed) in order tominimise the risk of error. Transcribed orders should be signed and dated by the transcribing nurse or midwife and co-signed by the prescribing doctor or registered nurse prescriber within a designatedtimeframe. If a nurse or midwife is unclear about a transcribed prescription/order she orhe should verify or confirm the prescription with the prescriber or pharmacist beforeadministering the medication to the patient/service user. The practice of transcribingshould be the subject of audit. 2.2 Emergency situations and the use of verbal and telephone orders Standard The only acceptable time a verbal or telephone order for medication should be taken from a medical practitioner is in an emergency situation, where there is an immediateunplanned patient/service-user need. A registered nurse prescriber should not communicate a medication order through the use of a verbal or telephone order. GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 16AN BORD ALTRANAISSupporting Guidance A verbal or telephone order from a medical practitioner should not be considered an acceptable substitute for a comprehensive medication policy or protocol for routinemedication management. The best interests of patient/service-user care and safetyshould be considered. A nurse/midwife who accepts a verbal or telephone order in thesesituations should consider her/his own competence and accountability. A nurse or midwife accepting a verbal or telephone order should repeat the order to the medical practitioner for verification. A record of the verbal or telephone order should bedocumented in the appropriate section of the patient's/service-user's medicalchart/notes. This should include the date and time of the receipt of the order, theprescriber's full name and her/his confirmation of the order. The justification andrationale for accepting a verbal or telephone medication order should also bedocumented by the nurse/midwife involved to establish the clinical judgement exercisedin the emergency situation. Best practice indicates that, where possible, the medical practitioner should repeat the order to a second nurse or midwife. This should be followed by the nurses/midwivesconfirming the order between them. The medical practitioner is responsible fordocumenting the written order on the prescription sheet/medication administrationrecord within an acceptable timeframe as determined by the health service provider. Thisresponsibility also applies in the case of electronic record keeping. 2.3 Use of facsimile Standard A medicinal product prescription provided via facsimile (fax) by a medical practitioner for a patient/service user under her/his supervision should be signed by the practitioner,with the original prescription supplied for insertion in the patient's/service-user'schart/notes within a specified timeframe. Nursing, health service and medicalmanagement should ensure adherence to this policy through systematic audit andevaluation. Supporting Guidance Exemptions for emergency supply as detailed in the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply Regulations), 2003 require that a medical practitioner must provide an original prescription within 72 hours to the dispensing pharmacist.GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 172.4 Electronic prescribing Electronic prescription writing is considered acceptable if the clinical standards for legal and best practices are realised. Standard The computer-generated prescription must be dated and signed by the medical practitioner or registered nurse prescriber in her/his own handwriting. A prescription forcontrolled drugs must adhere to the requirements of the Misuse of Drugs Acts of 1977 and 1984 and subsequent regulations and therefore must be handwritten in its entirety for it be dispensed by a pharmacist and subsequently administered by a nurse/midwife. 2.5 Supply of medicinal products Standard A nurse/midwife may supply medicinal products under the direction of a registered medical practitioner or a registered nurse prescriber in the course of a service providedby a hospital other than a hospital providing community mental health services (whichis limited to three days supply). Supporting Guidance This activity is authorised in the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006 and the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, 2003. The following should be adhered to by nurses and midwives in these supply situations: Local written policies/protocols, agreed upon following consultation and collaboration with relevant stakeholders, should be observed when a nurse/midwifeis to supply a medicinal product The policy/protocol should include directions on labelling of medicinal products as per Article 9(2) of the Regulations. Consideration should be given to the further education and training required by any nurse/midwife involved in the supply of medicinal products. Circumstances may arise when the nurse/midwife may be required to supply a medicine without previous dispensing of the medicinal product by a pharmacist. An example ofthis is the use of a medication protocol to supply and administer a specific medication.In these situations, the nurse/midwife must be aware of the responsibilities involved with this practice in the overall management of medications. The nurse/midwife mustconsider the scope of practice framework (and specific medication protocol ifapplicable) in determining her/his own competence to undertake this activity. 2.6 Dispensing of medicinal products Best practice suggests that medications should be dispensed by the pharmacist andshould only be undertaken by the nurse/midwife in exceptional circumstances. Standard Dispensing represents an extension to professional nursing/midwifery practice. The determination for nurses/midwives to dispense must be supported by organisationalpolicy with the involvement of the nursing/midwifery, pharmacy and medicalprofessions. Supporting Guidance In-service training and education should be provided to those staff involved in dispensing, followed by assessment of the nurse's/midwife's competency in this activity.(See dispensing activities in the Glossary of Terms) Quality assurance procedures should be in place to ensure safe dispensing practice. These include: Availability of a qualified pharmacist for consultation, either on-call or at another location Independent second check by another professional colleague Documentation of dispensing practice Evaluation and audit performed on an on-going basis. Nurses and midwives are advised to consult with their health service provider regarding indemnity insurance to cover their dispensing practice. 2.7 Self-administration of medicinal products by patients/service-usersin health care facilities Self-administration of medications involves the independent use of a medication by apatient/service-user in a manner that supports the management and administration ofher/his own medications.GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 18AN BORD ALTRANAISStandard The nurse/midwife should detail in the patient's/service-user's care plan the decision- making associated with, and the support and supervision required to facilitate apatient/service-user with self-administration. Continual collaboration and communicationshould occur with the medical practitioner concerning the patient's/service-user'smedication management. Supporting Guidance Key points associated with this activity are: Health service providers should have written policies for self-administration of medicinal products, which should detail the assessment of patients/service-users,the documentation requirements for their chart/notes and for the storage andsupply of medicinal products The assessment process includes the evaluation of the patient's/service-user's ability to self-administer as appropriate, with ongoing assessment of their ability toperform this activity The patient/service-user should be adequately supervised so that they adhere to the medicinal product therapy and treatment plan and this should be recorded asnecessary in the care plan Appropriate, safe and secure storage should be provided for the patient's/service- user's medicinal products and access should be limited to the patient/service-user The practice of self-administration of medications should be evaluated and audited at regular intervals in the health care setting. 2.8 Medication administration compliance aids/monitored dosagesystems Different names have been used to describe medication administration compliance aids,such as monitored dosage systems, blister packs, medication systems, unit dosepackages and multi-dose packages, and dose administration aids. They are used solelyfor oral solid dosage medications. Compliance aids are designed to aid self-administration by patients/service-users. However, there may be circumstances where compliance aids are used bynursing/midwifery staff to administer medications, for example in health care settingswhere there is no on-site pharmacy support. GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 19Standard The patient's/service-user's individual requirements should be assessed to ensure there are no contraindications related to using the compliance aid. Systems for evaluation ofthe appropriateness of the compliance aid should be documented in local policy, basedupon the patient's/service-user's Condition and Prescribed medications. There are two distinct care areas where nurses/midwives may be using compliance aids or monitored dosage systems: 1. Assisting patients/service users in self-administration of medications in the community setting using dosette boxes. This involves the nurse's/midwife's use of a dosette box or weekly pill box whichshe/he fills from the patient's/service-user's original medication containers dispensedby the pharmacist. Consultation with the patient's/service-user's pharmacist andgeneral practitioner should be considered for guidance if supplying medicines in thismanner and in assessing the need for using such a system. The nurse/midwife mustbe aware of the decision-making associated with using such a system, having regardto the medication prescribed and the ability of the patient/service-user to use thesystem. 2. The use of compliance aids/monitored dosage systems by nurses/midwives in health care settings where there is no on-site pharmacist. Health service providers may employ an external pharmacy to dispense manymedications to patients/service-users in pre-packaged compliance aids/monitoreddosage systems ready for administration by the nurse/midwife to the patient/service-user. Supporting Guidance Caution should be exercised and the professional judgment of the nurse/midwife must remain the guiding factor when these systems are utilised Nurses and midwives should have appropriate in-service education regarding these systems. The nurse/midwife employing such an aid in the practice of medicationmanagement is accountable for her/his actions. She/he should be competent inundertaking this activity The use of compliance aids is not supported in acute care settings, areas where the range and type of medications is extensive or changes frequently (e.g., warfarin);for the administration of p.r.n.s (as needed); or where the professional judgment ofGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 20AN BORD ALTRANAISthe nurse/midwife is required in respect of omission of a medication dose Medications that could potentially be withheld should not be included in a compliance aid Optimally, the compliance aid should be filled by the pharmacist The compliance aid should be labelled in accordance with statutory labelling requirements to enable identification of individual medications to be made The ability of the nurse/midwife quickly and correctly to identify a specific medication among several medications in a package is essential. References andresources should be readily accessible for the nurse/midwife to confirm prescribedmedication in the compliance aid with identifiable drug information, e.g., physicaldescription of the medication (red, oblong scored tablet or colour photograph of themedication) Arrangements should be in place to ensure that a medical practitioner and pharmacist can be contacted at all hours and that urgent repacking of medicationscan be undertaken when required The documentation requirements for each medication administered via the compliance aid should be identical to those for administration from the originaldispensed container (e.g., it is not acceptable to document 8 am blister pack given ). 2.9 Supply and administration of over-the-counter medications Standard The practices of nurses and midwives advising, supplying and/or administering over- the-counter (OTC) medications should be consistent with the established policies of thehealth service provider in which they practice and medicines legislation pertaining tonon-prescription medications. Supporting Guidance When determining to supply/administer or recommend an OTC medication or non- prescription medication to a patient/service-user, the nurse/midwife is accountable forhaving the appropriate knowledge of the OTC medication and its interaction with thepatient's/service-user's other current medications (OTC and prescription), therapies andtreatments. These practices should be supported by locally devised medicationprotocols where appropriate. See Section 4 for guidance on the development ofmedication protocols. Inherent in this independent clinical decision by the nurse/midwife is her/hisGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 21responsibility to educate the patient/service-user about the non-prescription medication, specifically Its use Its effects and side effects Contraindications Potential drug interactions with the over-the-counter medication Signs to discontinue using the medication Signs that would prompt the patient/service-user to contact her/his doctor. The nurse/midwife should monitor the patient/service-user, document the nursing/midwifery action and communicate her/his actions with other members of thehealth care team, consistent with the health service provider's policies and thepatient's/service-user's overall plan of care. 2.10 Scheduled controlled/MDA drugs The Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984 and the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1988, 1993 and 2007 determine the conditions of production, possession, supply, importation and exportation of controlled drugs. The drugs are categorised into five schedules withdifferent controls applicable to each category. The legal term for these drugs is theabbreviation MDA accompanied by the appropriate schedule of the drug. For example,MDA Schedule 2 replaces the previous term of CD2. These schedules are listed inAppendix C. The storage of scheduled drugs is referenced in Section 2.17. 2.11 Supply and possession of controlled/MDA drugs to and withininstitutions In institutions where a pharmacist is not employed, the director of nursing/midwifery (oracting director) may be supplied with MDA drugs. In these circumstances, beforedelivering any MDA drug, the supplier must receive a written requisition that complieswith the general requirements for requisitions and is countersigned by a medicalpractitioner employed or engaged in the institution concerned. The nurse/midwife manager (or acting manager) in charge of a ward, theatre or department may be supplied with a controlled drug, solely for the purpose ofadministration to patients/service-users in that ward, theatre, or department, on foot ofa requisition issued by her/him in accordance with the directions of a medicalpractitioner. In circumstances where the pharmacist (or director/acting director of nursing/midwiferyGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 22AN BORD ALTRANAISwhere a pharmacist is not employed) supplies a controlled drug to the nurse/midwife manager (or acting manager) she/he must: Obtain a requisition signed by the nurse/midwife manager (or acting manager) that clearly specifies the total quantity of the drug to be supplied Mark the requisition in such a manner to show that it has been complied with Retain the requisition for two years in the pharmacy which supplied the controlled drug. 2.12 Supply and possession of controlled drugs to and within privatehospitals or private nursing homes The Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1988 Article 8 (1) (a) does not pertain to private hospitals and private nursing homes and, therefore, they have no authority to be inpossession of controlled drugs or to be supplied with such drugs. Supplies of controlleddrugs for patients/service-users in private hospitals and private nursing homes shouldbe obtained by way of a medical prescription as if the patients/service-users were intheir own homes. Private hospital and private nursing home patients/service-users areconsidered to be in the same position as a patient/service-user in her/his own home. Private hospitals and private nursing homes may hold licenses under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984. These licenses legally permit the supply, distribution and control of scheduled controlled drugs for private hospitals and private nursing homessimilar to the arrangements in use in institutions as detailed above. 2.13 Management of MDA Schedule 2 drugs Standard The general principles of medication management should be employed when administering MDA Schedule 2 drugs. The following additional guidelines are providedas evidence of best practice with the management of these drugs: The local health service provider policy may require two persons to conduct the administration of MDA Schedule 2 drugs, one of whom is a nurse/midwife. This isnot a legal requirement. It is recommended that local health service providersshould consider including requirements expected for the checking, preparation,administration or destruction of these drugs when establishing medicationmanagement policies. They should also consider whether these activities are to bewitnessed and by whom (i.e., another nurse/midwife or other member of the healthcare team) GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 23 Access to the keys of the controlled drugs storage should be the subject of local policy, bearing in mind responsibility and accountability issues. The nurse/midwifemanager or her/his nurse/midwife designee should keep the keys of the controlleddrugs storage on their person. Policies and procedures should be in place formonitoring/checking a stock balance at each transaction of MDA Schedule 2 drugs.At changeover of shifts, a nurse/midwife from each shift should complete the countof these scheduled drugs Appropriate documentation of the administration of MDA Schedule 2 drugs should be entered in the patient's/service-user's chart/notes and in the ward controlleddrugs register The nurse/midwife manager should keep requisition copies (or a note) detailing the requested MDA Schedule 2 drugs submitted to the pharmacist, ornursing/midwifery director who supplies the drugs. 2.14 Community care involving MDA Schedule 2 drugs Standard Nurses/midwives practising in the community who are administering MDA Schedule 2 drugs to a patient/service-user for whom they have been prescribed shouldcommunicate with the prescriber to ensure that the patient's/service-user's requirementsfor these drugs are regularly and frequently reviewed. Supporting Guidance An MDA Schedule 2 drug may be obtained on prescription and retained in the patient's/service-user's home. In the community, individually prescribed medicinalproducts, including controlled scheduled drugs, are the property and responsibility ofthe individual patient/service-user. 2.15 Transport of MDA Schedule 2 drugs in the community Standard Where the patient/service user resides in the community: Nurses/midwives are authorised to transport the drug to a person for whom the drug has been properly prescribed for and dispensed by a pharmacist They are not otherwise permitted to have the drug in their possession or storage. Where the patient/service user is being transported in the community:GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 24AN BORD ALTRANAIS The drugs must be dispensed by the pharmacist to the patient/service user on an individual basis as per the written prescription The drugs should not be supplied from the stock of MDA drugs on the ward. Supporting Guidance The Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1988 allows for the supply of MDA scheduled drugs to patients/service-users while in the hospital/nursing home setting but not once theyleave and enter the community. These drugs should be stored securely for transport. Unused or expired controlled drugs should be returned for destruction to the pharmacy from which they were dispensed. 2.16 Community midwifery and MDA Schedule 2 drugs A community midwife is authorised as per the exemptions to the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations, 2007 to have in her/his possession pethidine or pentazocine for her/his practice. Standard There are specific requirements for this possession: A written order is signed by the midwife and countersigned by a medical practitioner or registered nurse prescriber practising in her/his area The medication order must state: The name and address of the midwife The quantity to be supplied The purpose for which it is required. A record must be kept in a book by the midwife of any supply of pethidine that she/he obtained and administered. The record must include: The name and address of the person from whom the drug was obtained The amount obtained The form in which it was obtained. After administering the pethidine to the patient/service-user, the midwife must enter into the book: The name and address of the patient/service-user GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 25 The amount administered The form in which it was administered. This book should be kept for a period of two years from the date on which the last entry was made. 2.17 Storage of medicinal products Standard All medicinal products should be stored in a secure manner, either in a locked cupboard or room. They should be stored in the appropriate environment as indicated on the labelor packaging of the medicinal product or as advised by the pharmacist. Supporting Guidance MDA scheduled controlled drugs should be locked in a separate cupboard/container from other medicinal products to ensure further security. (Refer to Section 2.13 foradditional guidance.) Medicinal products requiring refrigeration according to package labelling or the pharmacist should be stored in a designated refrigerator that is: Not used for any other purpose Accessible and reliable Capable of being secured. Medicinal products should be stored separately from antiseptics, disinfectants and other cleaning products. Mobile trolleys and emergency boxes storing medicinal productsshould be locked and secure when not in use. Policies and procedures should be in place for: Ordering medicinal products from the pharmacy Checking delivery and inventory of medicinal products to the ward/unit and maintaining records The immediate reporting and investigation of discrepancies in medicinal products' stocks The storage of medicinal products for self-administration by patients/service-users. GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 26AN BORD ALTRANAISSECTION 3 Safety in Medication Management 3.1 Medication errors and near misses Medication error is the most common type of error affecting patient/service-user safetyand is the most common single preventable cause of adverse events (NationalMedicines Information Centre, 2001). Medication errors are defined as preventableevents that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient/service-userharm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional orpatient/service-user. These events may be associated with professional practice, healthcare products, procedures and systems. They include prescribing, ordercommunication, product labelling, packaging and nomenclature, compounding,dispensing, distribution, administration, education, monitoring and use (NationalCoordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention, 1998). For thepurposes of this document, the activity of supply is included in this definition.Medication errors can occur at any point in the medication management cycle. Additionally a \"near miss\" event or situation may also happen with medications, where the error does not reach the patient/service-user and no injury results (e.g., incorrectdosage is prescribed but is recognised and adjusted before the medication isadministered). Standard It is of primary importance upon noting a medication error that the patient's/service- user's health is monitored. If a medication error has been identified, medical andnursing interventions should be implemented immediately to limit potential adverseeffects/reactions. Patient/service-user safety is paramount. Supporting Guidance Health service provider management, and organisations outside of the traditional health care settings where nursing/midwifery care is provided, should support an open culture(non-punitive approach) for error and near miss reporting, while undertaking acomprehensive assessment of the circumstances of the error and, where appropriate,institute action plans to prevent/eradicate the contributing factors to the medicationerror. This includes educational support for the staff involved. Medication errors and near miss events should be seen as opportunities to assess practice(s), identify what went wrong, learn from mistakes and institute changes to theGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 27medication system. The prevention, detection and reduction of medication errors and near misses should occur in collaboration amongst the health care team, as errors mayreflect a problem with the system and may involve other professions and departments. Continuous quality improvement programmes for monitoring medication errors and near misses should be in place within risk management systems of the organisation.Fostering cultures of safety and continuing professional development in medicationmanagement for nurses and midwives are important in preventing and addressing thecauses of medication errors. 3.2 Unlicensed or unauthorised medications An unlicensed or unauthorised medicine is a medicinal product which is not licensed bythe Irish Medicines Board (IMB) or the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA). The IMB defines the term \"off label use\" as: \"The use of an authorised medicine outside the terms of its product authorisation, e.g., use for an indication not specified in the authorisedproduct information; use at a dose not specified in the authorised productinformation; use in a specific patient population or a specific age-groupnot specified in the authorised product information\". The Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998 (SI No. 142 of 1998) provides the statutory authority for a registered medical practitioner or dentist to treat a patient/service-user under her or his care to prescribe an unauthorised/unlicensedmedication or to prescribe an authorised medication for an \"off label use\". The prescriberhas the professional responsibility for the use of such medications. This authority doesnot extend to registered nurse prescribers. Standard A nurse or midwife who administers the unauthorised medication or administers a licensed medication for \"off label use\" should be aware of the indications for themedication's intended use in providing care to the patient/service-user. Supporting Guidance This medication management decision should be justified by evidence-based practice. Information should also be available to administer the medication safely. It is advised that the nurse/midwife refers to the medical practitioner who has prescribed the medication if there are questions regarding the indications for its use forthe patient/service-user. Additional information and support may also be available bycontacting the pharmacist. It is important that the nurse/midwife has an understandingGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 28AN BORD ALTRANAISof the reasons for administering the medication, particularly as it relates to the assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of the prescribed medication for thepatient/service-user. The medication management policies of health service providers should address the topic of unauthorised/unlicensed medication use, including \"off label\" use. If a healthservice provider does not have such a policy in effect, it is recommended that one beconsidered. The input of the pharmacy department, drugs and therapeutic committee (ifestablished), nursing and medical management and risk management is critical in themultidisciplinary effort to develop and implement safe practices involving thesemedications. If the medication prescribed is part of a clinical trial, additional guidance and information should be sought from the clinical investigator and/or the associated clinical researchnurse (if applicable), as there are specific Regulations (European Communities (Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations, 2006, SI No. 374 of 2006) that relate to the implementation of good clinical practice in undertaking clinical trialswith patients/service-users. 3.3 Crushing medications Standard Nurses or midwives determining to administer medicines to their patients/service-users in a modified form to that prescribed (i.e., crushing an oral medication that is in a tabletor pill form), should ensure that other methods have been considered and thatappropriate advice is sought before doing so. Supporting Guidance The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is the regulatory body responsible for the licensing or authorisation of medicinal products for human and veterinary use. The IMB states that,if a medicinal product is used outside of the instructions as provided for in the posologysection of the Summary of Product Characteristics, then it is used outside its licensedconditions. This would apply to those medications which are crushed. Only medical and dental practitioners can legally authorise the administration of 'unlicensed' medicines to humans. Consequently, if a nurse or midwife decides that achange in the form of the drug is necessary for its safe administration, she/he shouldconsult with the medical practitioner and pharmacist to discuss alternative preparationsor forms of administration for the patient/service-user. If it is deemed necessary toadminister the medication in an unlicensed form, this should be prescribed by themedical practitioner in the patient's/service-user's medication chart/prescription sheetGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 29with the consent of the patient/service-user or carer if applicable. Development of a policy to support the practice of crushing oral medications, inclusive of guidelines anddecision-making rationale for individual events, should also be considered. Considerations for safe practice for crushing include preparing a list of medications which should not be crushed or chewed that is placed in a readily accessible location(e.g., attached to the medicine trolley) for use by the person administering thepatient's/service-user's medications. This list should be updated regularly by thepharmacist and whenever a new product which requires specific instructions becomesavailable. Continuous quality improvement processes should review whether suchpractices are effective. Occupational health and safety issues regarding the handling,administration and disposal of waste of certain altered dose medications (e.g., cytotoxicdrugs) should be considered and included in the policies and procedures of the healthservice provider. 3.4 Immunisations and vaccinations Immunisation and vaccination are an accepted mechanism in public health for theprevention and eradication of infectious disease. Nurses and midwives are key healthprofessionals involved in providing immunisations to the patient/service-user andcommunities in the promotion of public health and prevention of infectious disease.Examples include childhood immunisation programmes, influenza and hepatitisvaccinations and travel vaccinations. Standard Nurses and midwives involved in immunisation programmes (including vaccination administration) should maintain their competency and current knowledge with allaspects of this practice. This encompasses: Obtaining consent Vaccine handling and delivery Storage and stock control Proper technique of administration Recognition and intervention with side effects, adverse events and/or complications post immunisation. Supporting Guidance The nurse/midwife should possess the ability to manage adverse reactions and anaphylaxis as first line providers in these emergency situations. Anticipation of thisGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 30AN BORD ALTRANAISmay require additional resources, skills and equipment. Anaphylaxis may also necessitate the administration of emergency medications (e.g., epinephrine, adrenalin)and nurses/midwives should be knowledgeable of treatment with these medications asindicated for the particular vaccine/medication. Health service providers should have an organisational policy on immunisation/ vaccination addressing these areas to support best practice by nurses and midwives.Available resources on this subject are the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland (Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, 2002) and the Health Service Executive websitehttp://www.immunisation.ie. 3.5 Adverse drug reaction reporting Adverse drug reactions4have been identified as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. As part of their every day care of patients/service-users, nurses and midwivesare in prime positions to observe and report on suspected adverse reactions. Standard Reporting of suspected adverse reactions is critical for safe medication management and patient/service user care. Supporting Guidance The reporting and monitoring of adverse reactions has significant implications for patient/service-user safety. It is not necessary to determine a causal relationshipbetween a drug and subsequent event prior to reporting suspected adverse reactions.Nursing/midwifery staff should liaise with the prescriber about the submission of thereport as appropriate. The health service provider's medication management policiesshould include information and direction for health care professionals in reportingsuspected adverse reactions. The IMB is responsible for the national adverse reaction reporting system, as part of its drug monitoring programme. Post-paid report forms (i.e., the yellow card) are availablefrom the IMB, with a downloadable version accessible from the IMB website. The formis reproduced in Appendix E. The IMB requests that health care professionals (defined as medically qualified persons - nurses, midwives, doctors, dentists, and pharmacists) report the following: All suspected reactions to new products Serious suspected reactions to established products (i.e., those available on the market for > 2 years)GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 314See Glossary of Terms for definition of Adverse Drug Reaction. Any suspected increase in the frequency of minor reactions All suspected reactions to vaccines All suspected teratogenic (effecting development of foetus) effects. 3.6 Haemovigilance: Adverse event reporting for blood and blood products Similar to the reporting of adverse drug reactions, the nurse/midwife should be aware ofthe need for reporting for adverse events and reactions pertaining to blood and bloodcomponents. Haemovigilance is defined as: \"A set of surveillance procedures, from the collection of blood and its components to the follow-up of recipients, to collect and assessinformation on unexpected or undesirable effects resulting from thetherapeutic use of labile blood products and to prevent their occurrenceor recurrence.\" (Irish Blood Transfusion Service). Nurses and midwives are referred to the Guidelines for the Administration of Blood and Blood Components issued by the National Blood Users Group and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service (2004) for specific information and guidance on the subject ofblood administration, monitoring and reporting of adverse events and reactions. Serious adverse events and adverse reactions involving a blood component should be reported to the haemovigilance officer (HVO) and hospital transfusion laboratory asmandated by European Communities (Human Blood and Blood Components Traceability Requirements and Notification of Serious Adverse Reactions and Events) Regulations 2006 (SI 547 of 2006). Adverse events relating to blood products and near miss events are not covered in this legislation but should be reported to the HVO. These events areusually captured in the hospital quality/risk management systems. Policies should be inplace to support the identification, investigation and, where possible, prevention ofadverse reactions. 3.7 Reporting of adverse incidents involving medical devices Medical devices have a significant role in assisting health care professionals in theprovision of patient/service-user care. Standard As nurses and midwives are often front line users of medical devices and in-vitro diagnostic medical devices, they are key individuals to identify and report any adverseincidents involving medical devices. GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 32AN BORD ALTRANAISSupporting Guidance Reporting of adverse incidents can assist in increasing patient/service-user safety, and improve the safety profile of the device by prompting a modification in use or design. The IMB is the designated authority to which a nurse/midwife should report adverse incidents pertaining to medical devices. There is no mandatory reporting system forusers; however, users are encouraged to report serious incidents. The IMB providesguidance notes for health care professionals for reporting adverse incidents. Themanufacturer of the device should also be notified of the incident. Information on thevigilance system for medical devices, including the responsibilities of the medical devicemanufacturer and the medical device adverse incident user report form, are availablefrom the IMB medical devices department. 3.8 Patient/service-user sedation for diagnostic and therapeuticprocedures There are varying levels of sedation and analgesia used in patient care, which rangefrom minimal sedation to general anaesthesia. The administration of sedation should beseen as a continuum of stages, as patients/service-users may make the transition fromone level to another in a rapid and unpredictable manner, dependent upon the dosage ofmedication, sensitivities, physical status of the patient/service-user and absence ofrecovery period stimulation (Somerson, Husted and Sicilia, 1995). The levels of sedationcommonly described in the literature are: Minimal sedation - a medication-induced state in which a patient/service-user is able to respond normally to verbal commands Moderate sedation/analgesia, commonly known as \"conscious sedation\" - a medication-induced state in which the patient's/service-user's consciousness isdepressed but she/he is able to respond to verbal commands singularly oraccompanied by light tactile/physical stimulation. No assistance is needed by thepatient/service-user to maintain her/his airway and there is adequate spontaneousventilation. Cardiovascular function is normally maintained Deep sedation/analgesia - a medication-induced state of depressed consciousness in which the patient/service-user cannot easily be aroused, although she/heresponds purposefully as a result of repeated or painful stimulation. Thepatient/service-user may have difficulty independently maintaining ventilatoryfunction and assistance may be needed to maintain a patent airway. Cardiovascularfunction is usually preserved General anaesthesia - a medication-induced loss of consciousness. The patient/service-user is not purposefully responsive to verbal or painful stimulation.GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 33Assisting the patient/service-user with ventilator function and maintaining a patent airway may be required. Cardiovascular status may be impaired. Standard Conscious sedation requires continual monitoring and assessment of the patient/service-user and requires the nurse/midwife to respond immediately to anyadverse events/reactions or complications. The nurse/midwife should be able todemonstrate competency in assessment of the patient/service-user involving completecare requirements before, during and after the administration of conscious sedation,including the recovery period. Supporting Guidance The nurse/midwife should consider evidence-based practice guidelines devised by professional organisations with clinical expertise in the administration of medicationsused for sedation/anaesthesia, as well as advanced airway management andcardiovascular support. The health service provider should have a written policy for conscious sedation, detailing health care staff responsibilities and involvement in caring for patients/service-users receiving conscious sedation. Multidisciplinary input from nursing, medicine,anaesthesia and pharmacy members should be sought for the development, regularreview and audit of this policy and standards of practice for conscious sedation. Thehealth service provider should have in place an educational/competency validationmechanism that includes a process for evaluating and documenting thenurse's/midwife's demonstration of the knowledge, skills and abilities related to themanagement of patients receiving minimal and moderate sedation/analgesia. GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 34AN BORD ALTRANAISSECTION 4 Medication Protocols Medication protocols Medication protocols are written directions that allow for the supply and administrationof a named medicinal product 5by a nurse or midwife in identified clinical situations. A medication protocol involves the authorisation of the nurse/midwife to supply andadminister a medication to groups of patients in a defined situation meeting specificcriteria and who may not be individually identified before presentation for treatment. Anindividually named prescription is not required for the supply and administration ofmedication when a medication protocol is in effect. Care (involving medications), for the most part, should be founded and provided on an individual explicit basis for the patient/service-user. However, the supply andadministration of medicines under medication protocol can support more timely deliveryof quality health care and optimally utilise the skills of health care professionals. The useof a medication protocol should be reserved for those situations when it offers anadvantage for the patient/service-user care and where it is consistent with appropriateprofessional relationships. Medication protocol use should be considered in the contextof the clinical situation, safety assurance for the patient/service-user and acceptance ofaccountability by the health care professional involved. Medication protocols must be developed based on evidence of best practice and supported locally by a multidisciplinary team (i.e., senior doctors, pharmacists, nurses,midwives and health care managers). The medication protocol should adhere toparticular standards, such as identifying who is responsible and competent toimplement the protocol; specific exclusion, and inclusion criteria should be stated andshould include a review date for evaluation of the protocol. (Refer to the medicationprotocol framework.) In operationalising a protocol, a nurse/midwife who is authorised to supply, is also responsible for administration of the medication. This activity cannot be delegated. The legislative basis for medication protocols for the supply and administration of medication is the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations of 1996, and subsequent Regulations of 2003, which provides authority for hospitals to utilise medication protocols in order to meet patient/service-user need for medicationmanagement. In the course of preparing the Review of Nurses and Midwives in theGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 355Controlled drugs cannot be supplied under protocol owing to restrictions in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1984 and subsequent RegulationsPrescribing and Administration of Medicinal Products (An Bord Altranais and the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery, 2005), theAttorney General determined this legislative basis in an opinion communicated via theDepartment of Health and Children to An Bord Altranais. The Medication Protocol Framework (See Box 1) has been developed from a project supported by An Bord Altranais and the National Council. An Bord Altranais supports thedevelopments of medication protocols using a nationally recognised template based oninternational evidence and best practice. The responsibility for developing and quality-assuring medication protocols rests with health service providers. It is important that local policies are devised to support thedevelopment and implementation of any medication protocols for patient/service-usercare. Provisions should be made: To enable nurses, midwives and members of the multidisciplinary health care team to devise and implement medication protocols where there is a service need To enable the education and training of nurses and midwives involved in the use of such protocols To disseminate information to all members of the health care team regarding organisational policies underpinning the use of medication protocols To establish review and audit processes to evaluate the use of medication protocols as part of quality care provision and risk management programmes. These key provisions should be in place to facilitate nurses and midwives in safe practices for the supply and administration of medication utilising a medication protocol.GUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 36AN BORD ALTRANAISGUIDANCE TO NURSES AND MIDWIVES ON MEDICATION MANAGEMENT - July 2007 AN BORD ALTRANAIS 37Box 1.
