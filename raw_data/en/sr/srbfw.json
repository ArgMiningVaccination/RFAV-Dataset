It is often a chronic disorder. Sometimes it is a brief issue for a child, after an infection. Symptoms vary from person to person and can change over time. Gastroparesis is suspected based on symptoms. It is confirmed by a gastric emptying scintigraphy scan. This study measures the rate of gastric emptying over 2 to 4 hours after your child is given a test meal. Gastroparesis is managed in several ways: Finding the cause for gastroparesis. Symptom relief using diet and medicines. Improving nutrition intake. Preventing or correcting any fluid and electrolytes imbalances. What are the symptoms of gastroparesis? Decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, reflux, abdominal pain, bloating, fullness, early satiety (feeling full quickly), bad breath, weight loss and progressive decrease in appetite as the day goes on (oral intake is best for breakfast and the smallest for dinner). Foods that can trigger gastroparesis: Large, high-fat, high-protein, and high-fiber meals. Other factors that contribute to gastroparesis: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, constipation, use of high-fat overnight feeds, muscle or nerve abnormalities of the GI tract, prior GI surgery, medicines, and recent viral illness. Healthy eating when gastroparesis is a concern The goal is to eat small frequent meals while limiting high-fiber and high-fat foods. Since liquids move more easily through the stomach, they may be better tolerated than solids. For weight gain we may recommend high-calorie liquids including oral supplements in between meals. Foods that should be limited include: Whole corn, popcorn, whole grains, bran cereal, coconut, nuts/seeds, celery (raw), green beans, whole legumes, and greasy/fried foods. Note: High-fiber foods such as beans, nuts and fruit/vegetables are often better tolerated cooked and in puree form such as smoothies, applesauce, nut butters, hummus, vegetable juice and blended soups. Protein: chicken, eggs, fish, hummus (2 tablespoons), meatballs or meat loaf made with lean meat, nut butter (1 tablespoon), refried beans (fat free), tofu, cooked beans, or lentils in soups. Fat: vegetable/nut/olive/avocado oil or butter (1 to 2 teaspoon serving size) OR 1/8 avocado. Herbs: Adding herbs may be beneficial. Some of the following may be added to food or may be available as a supplement. Consider the following after discussion with your health care provider. You can make an appointment with a registered dietitian who can help you with adding these herbs to your diet. Peppermint and caraway oil may reduce spasms in the GI tract, helping with pain and distention. Fennel may relax intestinal muscles and reduces gas. Ginger may relieve nausea. Kiwi contains a compound called actinidin. This may improve gastric emptying, GI motility, constipation, and enhance digestion of protein. Amla fruit may help promote gastric emptying, strengthen lower esophageal sphincter, and relieve constipation. Artichoke leaf extract may help promote gastric emptying.
