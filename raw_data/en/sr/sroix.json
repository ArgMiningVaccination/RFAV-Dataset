Doctors and scientists are working hard to nd the causes of and the cure for IBD. Despite thechallenges of living with a chronic disease, yourchild can have a normal, happy, productive life.While there is not yet a cure for these diseases,appropriate therapy can control the chronic in-flammation that is a hallmark of IBD. This willhelp achieve long-term treatment goals, includ-ing elimination of chronic gastrointestinalsymptoms, restoration of growth, and a normalquality of life. 2Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two most common types of inflammatory bowel diseases. While these conditions produce simi-lar symptoms and use similar therapies, theyare not the same. In ulcerative colitis, only the colon is affected; of the multiple layers of the intestinal wall, only the innermost lining of the colon, the mucosa,becomes inflamed in ulcerative colitis patients.Ulcerative colitis also spreads proximally , meaning it starts from the rectum and can spread contin-uously to the rest of the large intestine (colon). Crohn's disease, on the other hand, may affect any part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, from the lips to the anus. Unlike ulcerative colitis,Crohn's can skip large segments of bowel before reappearing in others. The areas most often af- fected, however, are the lower part of the smallintestine (ileum) and the large intestine (colon). Also, in Crohn's patients, the inflammation does- n't stop at the mucosa (tissue lining) and may burrow through the thickness of the bowel wall. Signs and symptoms Despite the dierences between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, bothcause similar symptomswhen active\u2014all brought onby chronic inflammation. Patients may have one or more symptoms, including: persistent diarrhea abdominal pain and/or cramps ORAL CAVITY TRACHEAESOPHAGUS LIVER GALLBLADDER DUODENUM LARGE INTESTINE TERMINAL ILEUM COLON SMALL INTESTINE RECTUM ANUS Figure 1Beyond the intestines In addition to having symptoms in the GI tract, some people also may experience a varietyof symptoms in other parts ofthe body associated with IBD. Signs and symptoms of the disease may be evident in: eyes (redness, pain, and itchiness) mouth (sores) joints (swelling and pain)skin (tender bumps, painful ulcerations, and other sores/rashes)bones (osteoporosis)kidney (stones)liver (primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis)\u2014a rare All of these are known as extraintestinal manifes- tations of IBD because they occur outside of the intestine. In some people, these actually maybe the rst signs of Crohn's disease, appearingeven years before the bowel symptoms. In oth-ers, they may occur right before a flare-up ofthe disease. 5 4fecal urgency intestinal bleedingfeverweight loss While these symptoms are the same in children and adults, children also may be affected by a delay in growth and sexual maturation. In fact,a signicant number of pediatric IBD patients are diagnosed after reporting growth delays.This primarily affects Crohn's patients becauseof the direct effects on bone growth and de-creased absorption of nutrients. However, itcan affect all pediatric IBD patients if abdomi-nal pain or other symptoms result in reducedappetite. It is important to understand that these symp- toms can vary signicantly from patient to patient and do not have to be persistent. Suchsymptoms are only present when IBD is activeand can be eliminated by inducing and main-taining remission and avoiding flare-ups (active symptoms) of the disease. Symptoms may appear suddenly and severely and may seem to be triggered by stress or a viral or bacterialillness; they may also build slowly over time. You can learn more about signs and symptoms through the following brochures offered onlineat www.ccfa.org: Living with Crohn's Disease other IBD Symptoms7 6Who gets IBD? 1.4 million Americans have either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. That number is almost evenly split between the two conditions. Here are some quick facts and gures: More than 1.4 million Americans have IBD. One in ten IBD patients are under the age of 18. On average, people are more frequently di- agnosed with Crohn's disease or ulcerativecolitis between the ages of 15 and 25, al-though the disease can occur at any age. Males and females appear to be equally affected. While IBD can affect those from any ethnic background, Caucasians develop it more thanother groups. It is especially prevalent amongthe Eastern European Jewish population.Causes of IBD No one knows for sure what causes Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, but expertsbelieve there may be severalfactors that work together to lead to the development of the diseases, including: Genes\u2014Studies have shown that 5.2 percent to 22.5 percent of affected individuals may have a rst-degree relative (i.e., parents/child, siblings) with one of these diseases. Yourgenes clearly play a role, although no specic pattern of inheritance has yet been identied. This means that right now there is no way to predict which, if any, family members may develop IBD. A number of genes have been identied as possibly playing a role. Environmental elements\u2014Viruses, bacteria, and other factors have been studied with no conclusive results. Researchers are now focusing on microscopic elements. Inappropriate immune reactions\u2014Scientists continue to study whether a glitch in patients'immune systems\u2014perhaps launched by an environmental prompt\u2014may result in the body attacking itself. While researchers continue to study possible causes, some have been ruled out, includingtension, anxiety, personality traits, or dietaryfactors. Also, the diseases are not consideredto be contagious. 9 8Endoscopy is a test that involves inserting a lighted viewing tube through either the mouth into the upper intestine (upper en- doscopy) or through the anus into the colon (colonoscopy). The physician performing theexam can also remove tiny pieces of tissue(biopsies) from the intestines, which arelater examined for microscopic signs of thediseases. During the endoscopy, your child'sdoctor may also insert a video capsule, whichtakes pictures of the inside of the small intestine. These pictures can show areas ofsoreness, ulceration, or bleeding that maynot be detectable by other methods. Gener-ally, these tests are performed on childrenwho are sedated. A new form of endoscopy,called the pill endoscopy, does not involve anesthesia. Instead, a patient swallows a small pill-shaped camera, which takes about50,000 pictures as it travels through the in- testines; the images are captured on a device stored in a belt that the child wears for a day. The camera pill is excreted in the child's stool. Without appropriate testing, IBD can be dicultto diagnose, because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis may look like other conditions.One example of this is irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. IBS shares many symptoms of IBD, in-cluding abdominal pain and diarrhea. However, IBS is a functional bowel disorder, meaning themuscles of the intestines react improperly, either moving the bowel contents too quickly or tooDiagnosis Your child's diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerativecolitis likely occurred follow-ing a few tests. In addition to a thorough medical history and physical examination, children may undergo a combination of blood tests, barium x-rays,magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopy of the upper and lower GI tract. Ingeneral, physicians will begin by prescribingthe least invasive tests, progressing to more invasive testing until a diagnosis is obtained.This is especially true in pediatric patients. Blood tests are done to check for a low redcell count (anemia) or high white cell count(inflammation). Other blood tests may beperformed to look for evidence of inflamma-tion in the intestine and elsewhere. More recently, various antibody tests have beendiscovered that can show the altered GI immune process in some people with IBD. Barium x-rays and MRI include the upper GI and small bowel series, which helps to visu-alize areas of the intestines that are out ofreach of endoscopies (see next bullet).Sometimes, a video capsule may be used toinspect the bowel wall as well. (The lower GIseries, or barium enema, has been replacedby colonoscopy.) During the your child swallows a chalky liquid con-taining barium or a similar material that coats the upper intestinal tract so it will show upon an x-ray or MRI. Areas of swelling, narrow-ing, or other signs of intestinal inflammationcan be identied with these imaging tech-niques. X-rays, MRIs, and other imagingtests will be used wisely to limit your child'slifetime exposure to radiation. 11 10slowly. IBS does not involve inflammation, however. Because there are no physical signsof IBS, it is usually diagnosed after ruling outother conditions, including Crohn's and colitis. In some individuals, it is dicult to determine whether their IBD is Crohn's disease or ulcera-tive colitis\u2014even after extensive testing. Veryrarely, people are given the diagnosis of \"inde-terminate colitis.\" Such uncertainty is morecommon in the youngest patients\u2014those under ve years old at the time of diagnosis. For in-depth information on diagnostic tests, please see the Diagnosing IBD fact sheet available on www.ccfa.org. Treatment Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are consid-ered chronic, meaning thatthey can flare up after an initial remission, the goal oftreatment is to achieve andmaintain remission. These treatments can include medication, surgery, or nutritional therapies. Prescription medication While there is no medical cure for IBD, there area number of drug therapies that can help yourchild. It is important to understand that just asthe disease impacts each patient differently,medication regimens change from person toperson, sometimes from flare to flare. For exam- ple, one individual may have few symptoms and may respond well to mild drug therapy duringone flare but may require different, stronger med- ication during a more severe or prolonged flare. Broadly speaking, ve different categories of treatments are used in IBD, both for childrenand adults. These treatments include: Aminosalicylates: These include aspirin-like compounds that contain 5-aminosalicylate acid(5-ASA) and are used to treat mild-to-moderatedisease or to maintain remission. These drugs, which can be given either orally or rectally, reduce inflammation in the intestine, similar to the way aspirin works against inflammation in other parts of the body such as the joints (arthritis). Possible side effects of aminosalicy-lates may include diarrhea, headaches, and nausea. Corticosteroids: These medications affect the body's ability to launch and maintain an inflam- matory process. In addition, they work to sup- press the immune system. Corticosteroids areused for children with moderate-to-severe IBD.Administered orally, rectally, or intravenously(through a vein), steroids are effective for short-term control of flare-ups but are not recom-mended to maintain remission in children due to undesirable long-term side effects, including stunted growth. Some side effects of cortico- steroids include weight gain, insomnia, moodswings, osteoporosis, scalp hair loss or facial hair growth, acne, appearance of stretch marks, and increased susceptibility of infectionand bruising. Immunomodulators: This class of medications reduces the activity of the body's immune sys- tem so that it cannot cause ongoing inflamma-tion. Usually given orally, immunomodulators generally are used in the majority of childrenwith IBD, especially when aminosalicylates andcorticosteroids haven't been effective or havebeen only partially effective. They may be use-ful in reducing or eliminating dependency on corticosteroids and are frequently used tomaintain remission. Immunomodulators may13 12cause nausea, a decrease in white and red blood cell counts, and inflammation of the pan-creas (pancreatitis) or liver (hepatitis); there isan increased susceptibility to infection relatedto use of these medications. Also, there is a small increase in the absolute risk of develop-ing certain cancers, such as non-melanomaskin cancers and lymphoma. However, the ben-ets of long-term remission should be weighedagainst these risks. Your child's doctor can helpyou to understand the probability of the risksas well as the benets of the medications. Antibiotics: Certain antibiotics may be used when infections, such as abscesses, occur in IBD. Biologic therapies: The newest class of therapies to be used in IBD are proteins that selectively target key cells in the inflammatory cycle, thusshort-circuiting the process. These therapiesare used to control moderate-to-severe diseaseand to maintain remission. These medicationsare administered by injection or intravenous in-fusion on a schedule that varies from weekly toevery few months, depending on the individualand the medication. As with all medications, you should know the risks and benets of these medications anddiscuss any concerns with your child's doctor.For more information about medications andtheir side effects, download the brochure Understanding IBD Medications and Side Effects from www.ccfa.org.Over-the-counter (OTC) medication Prescription medications reduce intestinal in- flammation and form the core of IBD treatment.Even so, these important prescription medica- tions may not eliminate all of your child's symp-toms. Naturally, you may want your child totake over-the-counter medications in an effortto make him or her feel better. Before doing so,speak with your child's doctor, or other health-care professional. Sometimes your child's symptoms can indicate a worsening of the inflammation that may require a change in prescription IBD medication or other course of treatment. Nutrition therapy Optimal nutrition is a goal for well-being anddevelopment in all children, but in those withIBD, this may be dicult to achieve without in- tervention. Nutrition therapy may be as simple as regular visits with a nutritionist to ensure di-etary goals are being met. The nutritionist mayprescribe higher calorie and protein foods andliquid supplements. Because IBD, especiallyCrohn's disease, may improve with nutritionalsupport, it may be necessary to provide nutri-tion by delivering a nutrient-rich liquid formuladirectly into the stomach or small bowel.Known as enteral nutrition, this type of feeding is given overnight through a tube, most com-monly from the nose to the stomach. This iscalled a nasogastric (NG) tube. This method ensures that patients receive nutrition whilesleeping. In the morning, they remove the tubeand go to work or school and generally pursuetheir normal activities. In this way, patients receive all the nutrition they need and are free to eat normally\u2014or not\u2014throughout the day.Enteral feedings can also be given through agastrostomy tube (G-tube). A gastrostomy is a surgically created opening through the abdomi-nal wall, leading directly into the stomach. Thefeeding tube is passed through this opening.The feedings are most commonly givenovernight, but they can also be given intermit- tently throughout the day. Some patients prefer 15 14this approach because it avoids the discomfort of passing a tube down through the nose. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is delivered through a catheter placed into a large blood vessel, usually one in the chest. Although it bypasses the intestine and thereby allows thebowel to rest, parenteral nutrition may createmore complications than enteral nutrition. It isalso more expensive than the other methods of nutritional support and requires more special-ized training to use. To nd more information on nutrition and IBD, be sure to download the brochure Diet and Nutrition from www.ccfa.org. Surgery No parent ever wants to have their child undergosurgery. In the treatment of IBD, all medical efforts are aimed at preserving the intestines,especially in children. But there are circumstances when surgery is the best option or the only alternative. In fact,many Crohn's patients and a signicant per-centage of ulcerative colitis patients will reacha point where surgery is the best intervention. The reasons for surgery include: unsuccessful medical control of the diseaselife-threatening colon conditions known as fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon stulas and abscesses that are uncontrolled or not healed by medication strictures and obstructions, especially those caused by scar tissue perforation of the intestinescolorectal cancer or risk of itIn ulcerative colitis, the condition is cured with the surgical removal of the colon and the liningof the remainder of the rectum, which is not thecase in Crohn's disease. In many cases, a pouchcan be reconstructed. There is no cure for Crohn's and the disease may reoccur at the site of the surgery. In Crohn's surgery, however, thepatients usually feel much better after the dis- eased segment of intestines is removed and may be able to reduce their medications as a result. It is also important to note that newer, minimally invasive surgical techniques help patients toheal faster, allowing them to return to their nor-mal activities more quickly. There are a number of surgeries that are performed in specic circumstances in IBD patients. To learn more about these surgeries,please download the following fact sheets on www.ccfa.org: Surgery for Ulcerative Colitis Surgery for Crohn's Disease 17powders, liquids, and wafers\u2014may represent another therapeutic option for adults with IBD,particularly in helping to maintain remission. Before adding these to your child's regimen,you should ask your child's doctor about thesesupplements as he or she may specify specicsupplements for your child. Two things you should remain vigilant about are your child's weight and growth rate. Sinceweight loss is a symptom of a flare-up, any loss in weight should be reported to your child's physician. Similarly, growth may slow or ceaseduring periods of disease activity. If you child'sgrowth seems to slow considerably (wears the same size clothing for more than a year, seems smaller than other children of the same age, etc.), bring this to the attention of the child's doctor. For more information, visit www.ccfa.org to review the material below: Diet and Nutrition Living with Crohn's DiseaseLiving with Ulcerative ColitisGeneral Healthcare Maintenance Your child should continue to see a pediatrician to help monitor their physical development andmake sure they are up to date with vaccinations, including annual flu vaccines. Make sure this physician is fully informed about your child'smedications, as children on immunosuppres-sive or biologic therapies should not receivelive virus vaccines. Daily activities Now that your child has a disease that causes a greater reliance on the bathroom, you should plan for more time in any activity schedule forbathroom breaks. You may also want to encour- age your child to review bathroom locations in malls, playgrounds, movie theaters, or other 16Lifestyle modica- tions With IBD, there may be some adjustments you need to helpyour child make, including altering his or her diet as nec-essary or preparing them fordaily activities. Diet and nutrition Every child needs good nutrition to help him or her grow and develop. While most children with IBD require relatively little or no change in diet,there may be times when modifying the dietcan be helpful, particularly when their diseaseis active. A few different diets may be recom-mended during different times by your child'sphysician, including a diet with no lactose (asugar found in milk and milk-based products)or a diet with low amounts of insoluble ber. Some children with IBD may become decient in certain vitamins and minerals (including vitamin D, B-12, and C; folic acid; iron; may have troubletolerating iron taken orally; your child's doctormay prescribe intravenous iron in special cases. Other supplements your child's doctor mightrecommend are known as probiotics and prebi- otics . Probiotics microflora \u2014bacteria that live in everybody's intestine. Prebiotics arenon-digestible food ingredients that providenutrients to allow benecial bacteria in the gut to multiply. They also stimulate the growthof probiotics. Mounting evidence suggests theuse of probiotics\u2014available in capsules, 19Children with IBD may have a greater reliance on bathrooms and thus need open bathroom passes or access. Certain medications may need to be taken during the school day. Plan to establish a Section 504 plan or indi- vidualized education program (IEP) for your child. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that disabled students cannotbe denied benets of any public program in-cluding education. Within an IEP , your child can benet from special \"accommodations\"that help to improve the quality of his or her educational experience and ensure social interaction with other students. (See \"Schoolaccommodations,\" page 20.) Requesting a meeting with administrators andteachers to discuss the illness and your child's needs is a proactive way of dealing with poten- tial future issues caused by IBD. While informing the administrators and teachers about your child's needs is necessary, yourchild may feel embarrassed about letting oth-ers know. Because it may be important to himor her, let your child decide with whom andwhen to share that information with others. Access other related resources that may be helpful to you at www.ccfa.org: A Guide for Kids and Teenagers A Guide for Teachers and Other School PersonnelPete Learns All About Crohn's and Colitis IBD & Me Activity Book 18regularly used areas outside of your home. Doing so can help your child feel more in control about their condition. Some states have created laws that allow access to \"employee only\" restrooms in businessesopen to the public. Call your local CCFA chapterto see if your state has passed the RestroomAccess Act. If so, make sure your child has therequired physician's note describing your child'sneed for immediate bathroom access any timehe or she ventures out. During times of flare-ups, it may also help to pack a spare change ofclothing and some moist wipes in a backpackfor your child to carry. School Because children spend most of their wakinghours in school, adults who tend to your childat school should be told about your child's illness for several reasons, including: IBD may lead to more frequent absences orhospitalizations; make-up work and othereducational needs may need to be addressed. 21the act requires schools that receive public funding to create an IEP for each child covered by the plan, ensuring that the unique needs of the child are met in the least restrictive environment. The \"individualized\" part of IEP means that the plan has to be tailored specif-ically to your child's special needs. IDEA covers children with disabilities from birth to age 21. Informal (verbal arrangement with a teacher) and formal accommodations (items coveredunder a 504 plan or IEP) for a child may helpthem reach and maintain their academic poten- tial. Here are some formal and informal sampleaccommodations that may be helpful for yourchild. Accommodations should be requested as soon as possible, preferably in the begin-ning of the school year, so that there is time tomake necessary arrangements and formalize plans. Remember: even if your child is perfectly healthy at the start of a school year, they maystill need some of the accommodations below in the course of the year. It is always best toplan ahead! These are some potential accom-modations\u2014others may be added to meet theneeds of your child. Unlimited bathroom pass: Students with active disease symptoms may need to use thebathroom many times per day\u2014often urgentlyin order to avoid fecal incontinence. Studentand teacher should work out an appropriate bathroom signal to help avoid drawing atten-tion to the student's frequent bathroom breaks. \"Stop the clock\" testing: When taking an exam, the student may need to take a break due to pain or bowel urgency. Their test time will be extended by the amount of time thatthe student is away from the exam. Ability to hydrate: Frequent bowel movements and medication contribute to loss of fluids. Students should be allowed to carry and drink fluids throughout the day. 20School accommodations If your child is falling behind in school, or requires special accommodations to maintaintheir academic performance, he or she maybenet from a 504 plan or an individualized education program (IEP). Two federal laws, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973and the Individuals with Disabilities EducationAct, provide protection for public school studentswith disabilities. Although both laws apply tostudents with disabilities, not all students withdisabilities qualify for the protections of bothlaws. Each law has specic eligibility require-ments and guidelines for services. 504 Plan: This comes from Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This act requiresrecipients of federal education funding toprovide children with disabilities appropriateeducational services designed to meet the individual needs of such students, to the same extent as the needs of students withoutdisabilities are met. A 504 plan spells out themodications and accommodations that willbe needed for these students to have an opportunity to perform at the same level astheir peers, and might include such things as blood sugar monitoring, an extra set oftextbooks, or home instruction. A Section504 plan involves an evaluation of the child'sdisability as well as his or her academic abili-ties and specic provisions to help the childreach his or her academic potential. Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): First passed as the Education for all Handicapped Children Act in 1974 and mostrecently amended in 2004, the act governshow states and agencies provide certain edu-cational services to children with disabilities,including children with health impairmentslike IBD. For students with disabilities whorequire specialized instruction, the IDEA con-trols the procedural requirements. The IDEAprocess is more involved than that requiredunder Section 504. One of the provisions of23Physical activities Young people with IBD should be as active as possible. Outside of the physical benets, in- cluding building stronger muscles and bones,these activities provide an outlet for stress andcan help build condence. Generally, there is no reason not to participate in sports, dance, or other physical activities, even if the disease is flaring up. But some mod-ications may be necessary if strenuous activi-ties cause fatigue or aggravate abdominal pain, arthritis, or other symptoms. You and your childshould also be vigilant about maintainingproper hydration. Furthermore, prolonged high-dose steroid ther-apy may make bones more susceptible to fracture during contact sports, such as football and wrestling. In these instances, a modied exercise program may be advisable. Emotional and social support The diagnosis of a chronic ill- ness can be a tough blow foranyone, but for children, itcan be especially hard to bear. Still developing a sense of themselves both emotionally and physically, young people now must face an extra hurdle of chronic illness, which can pose a threat to a child's sense of well-being and security. As a result, children with IBD may become: anxiousdepressed 22Supply bag: Student will be permitted to carry and eat small snacks, candy (to treat dry mouth), wet wipes, and other suppliesthroughout the day and use as needed. Tests and project limits: Medications and active disease symptoms may contribute to sleep deprivation and fatigue. As a result, the number of tests and projects can be limitedto one to two per day. Test and project dead-lines can also be extended without penalty. Rest period: School nurse will provide a loca- tion as needed for students to lie down, or aprivate place to change clothes. School absence: After a specied number of days absent from school, the student will receive in-home or hospital tutoring. Alternate Seating: To accommodate easy access to classroom exits, the student's seat may be changed. Medications: The student, parent, and nurse will meet to discuss and establish a medica- tion schedule. Tutoring and support: If the student is absent for more than \"x\" days from school, he/she will have an opportunity to make up or getassistance with assignments. Students will be allowed to have an extra set of books at home. Extra-curricular programs: The student will be allowed to participate in programs andevents without penalty due to absenteeism. Physical education class: The student should be allowed to self-monitor his/her energy level to determine if he or she can participatein physical activities. The physical educationteacher will notify their parents if there is on-going non-participation in gym class.

Stress is impossible to avoid in life. Since stressful situations can precipitate a flare-up insome individuals, it might be helpful to teach your child techniques for coping with or relieving stress. By using these techniques, your childcan stay calm, maintain perspective, and avoidanxiety. Encourage your child to try several different approaches and stick with ones thatwork for him or her. These can include: relaxation and breathing exercises practicing yoga or tai chicognitive behavioral therapy meditationbooks, recordings, guided imagery, etc. Realize that others in the family may also be suffering emotionally from the diagnosis. Ifthere are other children in the family, they need to understand their sibling's condition and theimpact it's likely to have on their lives. It's important to reassure them that you still love 24clingy dependentagitated It is important to remember that these reac- tions are a response to their disease, and notits cause. The emotional support provided by healthcare professionals can go a long way toward reas-suring your child. At times, a counselor or childpsychologist may be helpful in enabling yourchild to regain the self-condence that is some-times affected by chronic illness. Children can also nd peer support and educa- tion through a number of avenues, including: ucandcrohns.org\u2014A Web site for older children and teens with IBD. 27Carry extra underclothing and toilet paper or moist wipes when traveling. When venturingfurther away or for longer periods of time, speak with your child's doctor rst. Travelplans should include a long-term supply of medication, its generic name in case your child runs out or loses it, and the names ofdoctors in the area he or she will be visiting. Encourage your child to go about his or her daily life as normally as possible, pursuingactivities as they did before their diagnosis.There's no reason for your child to sit out onthings that he or she has always enjoyed or has dreamed of doing one day. Help your child learn coping strategies from friends and other supportive individuals. Your local CCFA chapter offers support groups as well as informational meetings. It helpsyour child and you to share what you know with others, too. Develop a support network of family and friends to help you and your child manage the disease. Bring a family member or friend to your child's doctor's appointmentfor support. Join CCFA's free online community at www.ccfacommunity.org for yourself or ucandcrohns.org for your older child or teen to get the support they need through partici-pation in discussion boards, personal stories,chat rooms, and much more. Make sure your child follows his or her doc- tor's instructions about taking medication. Even when he or she is feeling perfectly well, your child should continue to take theirmedication. Maintain a positive outlook. That's the basic\u2014and best\u2014prescription! 26them and want to be as involved in their livesas you've always been, although you may haveto devote more time to the child who is ill. You, your child and the rest of the family may nd comfort and support by participating in educational, social, and fundraising activitiessponsored by your CCFA chapter. Annual walks,Camp Oasis, educational seminars, andfundraising events build a sense of communityamong those diagnosed with the disease and those who love them. To nd out what is happen-ing in your chapter, go to www.ccfa.org/chapters. Living life It may be dicult and stressful for your child to accept that he or she has Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. As time goes on, this will not always be the case.In the meantime, try not to hide your child'scondition from family, friends, and co-workers.Discuss it with them and let them help and sup-port you and your family. You'll learn that thereare numerous strategies that can make livingwith IBD easier. Coping techniques for dealing with the disease may take many forms. For example, attacks ofdiarrhea or abdominal pain may make yourchild fearful of being in public places. But thatisn't necessary. All it takes is some practical advanced planning. You may want to help yourchild incorporate some of the following stepsinto his or her plans: Find out where the restrooms are in restau-rants, public parks, theaters, and on public transportation.28About CCFA Established in 1967, the Crohn's & Colitis Foun- dation of America, Inc.
