Known as \"abhyanga\" in the Sanskrit language, Ayurvedic massage is the application of generous amounts of warm (often herbal) oil with strokes that focus on balancing the flow of prana (life-force energy) in your body. While Ayurvedic massage certainly can help relieve muscular tension, muscular therapy is not the emphasis. Therefore, the pressure used is variable, primarily using light to medium pressure. In addition to balancing energy, abhyanga also supports detoxification via strokes that work on the lymphatic system. Each massage is customized to your needs (in terms of pressure, strokes, and type of oil used) based on your doshic constitution (unique mind-body type) and doshic imbalances. Why so much oil? In Ayurvedic massage, the application of warm oil is even more important than the strokes used. Warm oil serves several purposes according to Ayurveda: - To pacify vata dosha, the primary energy responsible for imbalance. - To serve as a medium for administering herbal benefits through the skin. - To support detoxification in consecutive treatments. I usually like deep pressure. Will I get that from an Ayurvedic massage? While Ayurvedic massage certainly can help relieve muscular tension, muscular therapy is not the emphasis. Therefore, the pressure used is variable, primarily using light to medium pressure. If you typically like deep pressure massage and wish to try Ayurvedic massage and bodywork, I recommend that you go into your first session releasing your expectations for what you normally think of as a good massage. Ayurvedic massage is profound and deeply rejuvenating, but you might be disappointed if you go into your session 'comparing apples to oranges'. I also recommend trying pinda svedana (hot poultice massage), which is quite invigorating. In addition, shila abhyanga (hot stone massage) is one where I incorporate deep techniques as needed. I tend to get hot easily. Is warm oil or hot stone massage for me? Since every massage is customized to your unique needs in terms of temperature and type of oil used, warm-natured people can still benefit from warm oil or hot stone massage. Cool towels are used as necessary to keep you from feeling overheated, and energetically cooling oils can be used, such as coconut or sunflower oil, to balance pitta dosha (fire energy).
