Chinese Medicine is rooted in the Eastern philosophy of the Five Elements (Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood).

Acupuncture is a safe, non-surgical and non-pharmacological solution to a wide variety of conditions. Acupuncture therapy requires the use of sterile, disposable stainless steel hair-thin needles during treatments. Acupuncture needles are used only once and and do not cause any pain or discomfort to most patients. Often, you don't even feel them being inserted into the tissue.
