The prevalence of AD is about 30% in most developed countries, and this has increased considerably in recent decades [4](#B4) [5](#B5) [6](#B6) [7](#B7). AD is associated with a significant negative economic burden and impacts the quality of life (QoL) of patients and their families [8](#B8) [9](#B9) [10](#B10). [11](#B11) [12](#B12) [13](#B13) [14](#B14). However, many patients with AD do not fully understand their disease and its treatment [15](#B15) [16](#B16). MATERIALS AND METHODS Study population Questionnaire [17](#B17). AD knowledge was addressed with 10 questions, and participants were asked to choose all of the phrases that they agreed with. The percentage of correct answers was calculated. Statistical methods RESULTS Sample characteristics [Table 1](#T1). We represent \"Patients\" as those aged 16~49 years with AD, and if parents answered this questionnaire, their children aged 0~15 years with AD. We represent \"Respondents\" as those who answered this questionnaire (parents with children aged 0~15 years with AD and individuals aged 16~49 years with AD). Understanding of AD [Table 2](#T2)). Treatment behaviors of patients with AD 1) AD management pattern 2) Annual expenditure on AD treatment [Table 3](#T3)). 3) Steroid use by patients with AD Use of medical institutions by patients with AD 1) Preference for a medical institution among patients with AD 2) Patient satisfaction with medical institutions [Fig. 1](#F1)). 3) Awareness of Western medicine and oriental herbal medicine for AD treatment [Fig. 2](#F2)). DISCUSSION [15](#B15) [18](#B18) [19](#B19) [20](#B20)have found that many patients obtained information from the Internet and trusted the source of that information, which was sometimes false. Thus, knowledge acquisition without being helped by experts may render in-depth understanding of the AD treatment by patients without any previous AD experience difficult. Enhancing the knowledge about AD treatment would encourage treatment adherence and improve patient prognoses [11](#B11) [13](#B13) [21](#B21) [22](#B22). For the improvement of the clinical outcomes of AD patients, active physician-based education programs targeting AD patients and their parents are necessary. [23](#B23). This suggests that medical institutions should concentrate their efforts on facilitating regular follow-ups and increasing compliance among AD patients. [24](#B24)surveyed patients in 3 university hospitals for the expenditure on AD treatment. They found that the annual direct cost (including consultation fees, costs of medical tests and procedures, prescription fees, dispensing fees, medication storage fees, and the costs of drugs and other dermatologic products) per patient was 2,646,372 KRW. In this study, we conducted a web-based survey for the general population; on the other hand, Kim et al. [24](#B24)surveyed patients who visited large university hospitals, and the results of their survey could be overestimated. Thus, this sampling bias may have caused this discrepancy. According to the results of a review of 418 articles on AD in the United States [25](#B25), the annual direct cost per patient for AD treatment was 167~580 USD, and the total national costs of AD treatment ranged from 364 million USD to 3.8 billion USD. The national health insurance system of Korea covers a larger proportion of heath costs than does the national health insurance system of the United States. According to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) statistical data, not only the total payment but also the out-of-pocket payment for health care in the United States is higher than that in Korea [26](#B26). Nevertheless, the high amount spent for AD treatment in Korea, similar to the amount spent in the United States, seems a burden to the Korean society. In our study, costs appeared to increase significantly with increasing disease severity. In contrast, Kim et al. [24](#B24)reported that expenditure on AD treatment did not significantly increase with the disease severity. This may be attributable to the larger size of the study population (500 participants) than that in the previous study (32 participants). [15](#B15). In the present study, although most of the patients with AD and their parents (75.7%) were satisfied with steroid treatment, they tended to use steroids minimally even for aggravated symptoms. Furthermore, most of the patients and their parents were aware that a topical corticosteroid (TCS) can be addictive even after a single use (70.2%) and that long-term use of topical steroids is harmful (67.4%). Consistently, Kim et al. [15](#B15)and Aubert-Wastiaux et al. [27](#B27)found that TCS phobia occurred in 86.3% and 80.7% of their patients, respectively. TCSs are the representative mainstay of AD treatment [27](#B27), and although they have adverse effects, their safety is well established when they are used correctly [28](#B28) [29](#B29) [30](#B30) [31](#B31). Thus, appropriate education is needed on the use of steroids for AD treatment in order to reduce steroid phobia and improve treatment adherence. [32](#B32). However, our results showed that most patients do not appear to be satisfied with oriental herbal medicine. Consistently, Chin et al. [33](#B33)reported that herbal remedies prescribed by oriental herbal medicine clinics were therapeutic in only 25.3% of the included patients, with the conditions in the others remaining unchanged or even being aggravated. [32](#B32). This suggests that long-term oriental herbal medicine treatment for AD should be scientifically evaluated, and further study is needed to clarify its efficacy and tolerability. [34](#B34)demonstrated that those scores were strongly correlated with SCORAD scores, which suggests that the PO-SCORAD score provides a meaningful assessment of the disease severity of AD. "}
