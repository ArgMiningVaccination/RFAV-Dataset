As an integrated part of the Core Facilities Department, Fluorescence Microscopy can support current multidisciplinary research and facilitate the preliminary stages of new investigations. Since being established in 1999 the Fluorescence Microscopy facility has grown to support a broad range of research at the School of Medicine, College of Engineering, Pharmaceutics and Liberal Arts. Integrating equipment, training, education and expertise helps maximize the impact of capital equipment and facilities and ensures our users have the expertise to effectively leverage the resources that the core facilities provide. DNA Peptide Facility provides investigators with standard and specialty oligonulcleotides and peptides. Specialty modifications include chromophore labeling, functional group modifications, and modified bases/amino acids. These synthetic products are used in a wide range of biochemical, molecular, and clinical applications. For example, primers and probes necessary for Q-PCR and synthetic peptides serving as antigens in ELISPOT assays are important tools to monitor immune responses from blood samples. DNA Sequencing Laboratory: The DNA Sequencing and Genomics Core laboratories are co-located in 2500 sq. ft. on the second floor of building 585. We have dedicated clean space for master mix preparation that contains one class II/A2 hood, a larger general lab area where all sample manipulations take place that precede any PCR steps, and a dedicated post PCR space where PCR occurs and any manipulation of amplicon (including running gels) occurs. This setup is to minimize any possibility of amplicon contamination in our molecular testing. The general lab area contains everything needed for general molecular biology needs. This includes various centrifuges (both tube and plate spinning versions) as well as water baths, dry baths, a liquid handling robotics system (BioMek FXp), as well as other various minor lab devices required in a standard molecular biology laboratory. The PCR area has numerous thermocyclers to support varying PCR experiments or Next Gen Sequencing (NGS) library building as well as array runs. This area contains all the typical equipment needed for molecular biology experiments including centrifuges, pipettes, and a class II/A2 hood for use when opening PCR plates to further help contain PCR amplicon contamination. There is also an Illumina iScan array reader and there are real-time PCR instrumentation to support labs needing to run their samples using this methodology as well as two computers dedicated to customer use for analysis and setup of such plates. The PCR space also contains the Applied Biosystems 3730xl that is used for Sanger sequencing as well as fragment analysis pipelines. Major Equipment DNA Sequencing and Genomics : - Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer. This instrument remains state of the art for capillary electrophoresis and is also very useful for fragment analysis with down to 1bp resolution. This instrument has been a workhorse in sequencing and genomics for approximately 30 years and doesn't appear to be showing any signs losing its usefulness. - Oxford Nanopore P2Solo (coming). This instrument has recently been acquired by the core. It is capable of running up to two full human genomes per run using long sequencing chemistries from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The read lengths will vary depending on the DNA quality provided, but the longest single read on ONT platforms to date is 4.2 million bases in one read. The vast majority of runs target sizes more in the range of 10-50kb per read and therefore produce more reads per run. In addition to returning sequence of the sample, the instrument is also capable of providing methylation state of the DNA using a modified base caller available for the system. - Oxford Nanopore MinIon. This instrument is a much smaller version of the ONT platform and is capable of running smaller runs such as plasmid sequencing, small genomes (bacterial for example) with all the same benefits of the larger P2Solo. - Agilent Fragment Analyzer. This instrument is generally used for QC of NGS libraries or quality of DNA or RNA extractions including size distributions. Various kits are available that can cover from only a few hundred bases size range to around 50kb DNA fragments. - Illumina iScan. This instrument has been in use running any Infinium arrays that Illumina produces for multiple years. Although sequencing is becoming cheaper over time, arrays are still frequently used for screening large numbers of samples that would be cost prohibitive using sequencing at this point in time. Arrays exist to cover things from GWAS studies to targeted panels focused on individual diseases. - Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 12k Flex. These two instruments are the workhorses for real-time PCR runs in the core. In addition, with a simple block change, these instruments can also run Open Array (a smaller for of array testing owned by ThermoFisher that allows targeting of much smaller numbers of genes than available by the Illumina platform). - Element Biosciences AVITI. This sequencer is the newest addition to our DNA Sequencing Core. This is a mid-sized sequencer capable of yielding up to 2-2.4 billion reads at once. It can be used to support any type of short read sequencing currently in use. The chemistry is distinct from the predominant Illumina chemistries and yields on average higher quality base calls. In addition it is able to maintain base quality even after repetitive regions (a known issue with Illumina chemistries). Cost/Gb is very similar to the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cells.

Tests to assess the impact of genetic, dietary and pharmacologic manipulations on insulin sensitivity, whole body energy metabolism and body mass in mice. The tests to determine whole body insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism include oral and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. A Bruker NMR machine is used to determine body composition on rodents. CLAMS metabolic chambers are available for energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure and locomotor activity) at multiple ambient temperatures. Cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics are available with either the Seahorse XFe96 or XF24 analyzers. These analyzers measure energy metabolism glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in real-time, and non-invasively in cell lines and tissues isolated from animals. These assays measure multiple mitochondrial bioenergetics parameters such as basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP synthesis linked OCR, proton leak, maximal respiratory capacity and mitochondrial reserved respiratory capacity. Since the Seahorse XFe96 simultaneously measures OCR and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), which is mainly the result of glycolysis, it can determine if there is metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in the cells. Other assays performed on XF analyzers are to determine substrate utilization by mitochondria including the metabolism of pyruvate/glucose, glutamine and fatty acid. In addition to the Seahorse assays described above. The MPC also offers several radiometric metabolic assays for determination of glucose transport and its metabolism including glycogen synthesis, lipogenesis and glucose/fatty acid oxidation in cultured cells and isolated metabolic tissue samples such as skeletal muscle, fat cells and hepatocytes.

We specialize in variant calling and disease-gene discovery research. Facilities and Instrumentation and Services: Computing infrastructure is housed and maintained at the University of Utah Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC), an organization of professional faculty and staff dedicated to providing access to high performance computing for research and education. The CHPC provides space, infrastructure, and systems support for large-scale computing and advanced networking systems. Computing equipment is housed in a newly renovated state-of-the-art 74,000 sq. ft. facility with 24-hour staff support, security, and high-efficiency cooling and energy supply systems. The CHPC cluster uses a Portable Batch System (PBS) job submission queue that facilitates large-scale analysis jobs. The University cluster also supports the OpenMPI message-passing interface, which allows for development and testing of scalable genome arithmetic software. All resources are HIPAA compliant. Alignment and variant calling (including structural variant calling) for NGS datasets, variant interpretation, joint genotyping, disease gene discovery in cohorts and families, and ad hoc research analyses as dictated by the project. In total, the UCGD has available 2340 CPU cores and 3.25 PB of disc storage, plus access to additional shared resources. Total capacity for variant calling is approximately ~200,000 genomes annually via a combination of in-house and cloud-based processing. The UCGD Core has cloud computing expertise for massively scalable data access, processing and sharing, and maintains a web-based data portal for data access and collaborative analysis. In addition to bioinformatics infrastructure and routine data analysis and management services, the UCGD Core provides a world-class team of professional software developers and scientists, and a collaborative environment for new investigators and those without significant bioinformatics experience. Scientific oversight for our core comes from internationally recognized computational genomics leaders Mark Yandell, PhD; Gabor Marth, DSc; and Aaron Quinlan, PhD. Core personnel are embedded within a dynamic network of over 50 computational genomics researchers, software developers, and analysts with the shared goal of integrating genome sequence information into health care.
