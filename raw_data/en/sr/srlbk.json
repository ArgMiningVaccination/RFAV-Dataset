They do not contain pieces or proteins from the virus. Instead, they contain instructions for your cells, called \"messenger RNA.\" This messenger RNA tells your cells to make the COVID- 19 spike protein themselves. Once your cells make the spike protein, your immune system will make the antibodies that ght COVID- 19 and protect you from getting sick from this virus. 1) mRNA enters normal cell in the body 2) Cell decodes mRNA and makes spike protein 3) Cell brings spike protein to cell surface and your body makes antibodies messenger RNA (mRNA) for spike protein How do the COVID-19 vaccines work? Antibody Virus that causes COVID-19 Vaccines expose us to pieces of either a bacteria or a virus. Our body mounts an immune response by making antibodies against those pieces. Antibodies are proteins that ght germs like viruses and bacteria by latching onto and disabling them. The goal is that our body will then recognize those pieces and use the antibodies to ght o any future exposure to the real bacteria or virus. There are several dierent types of vaccines. Traditional vaccines include pieces of the virus in them. This causes your immune system to react by making antibodies against those pieces. mountsinai.org/about/covid19/vaccine-informationThe spike protein is an important and recognizable part of the virus. When the immune system makes antibodies against the spike protein, they can disable the entire virus.\"S\" Protein\u2014Spike Protein Pieces of the virus An antibody is a protein that ghts germs like viruses and bacteria by latching onto and disabling them. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine also instructs your cells to make the COVID- 19 spike protein themselves, but it delivers those instructions by using a harmless adenovirus, similar to a common cold virus, rather than using messenger RNA.Common cold virus with spike protein instructions 1) Instructions enter normal cell in the body 2) Cell makes spike protein 3) Cell brings spike protein to cell surface and your body makes antibodies "}
