[15](#B15)). Although CAM use in South Korea has presumably increased at a considerable pace since then, no further national surveys have been conducted. Accordingly, the purpose of this survey was to obtain current information about the prevalence, costs, and patterns of CAM use in a general population in South Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects Definition of CAM [16](#B16)). Twenty-seven different types of CAM were categorized into six groups: five groups [1)-5), infra] were defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) at the National Institute of Health ( [16](#B16)), whereas the sixth unclassified group [6), infra] included certain CAM therapies specific to Korea that did not fit precisely into the NCCAM classification system. Whole medical systems: Korean oriental medicine (KOM), Ayurveda , Homeopathy Mind-body therapies: prayer for health reasons, hypnosis, music and art therapy, yoga, meditation, Dantian breathing, Kuksundo, Tai chi and Qi movement Biologically based therapies: dietary supplements (non prescribed vitamins and mineral supplements, ginseng and non-mineral, non-vitamin and non-ginseng dietary supplements), herbs (non-processed and not prescribed) and animal extracts (for health reasons) in the diet-based therapies Manipulative and body-based therapies: chiropractic manipulation, massage Energy healing therapies: therapeutic Qigong, therapeutic touch, magnetic fields therapy, bio-active frequency therapy Unclassified therapies: spa for health reasons, hand acupuncture, taping therapy Contents of the survey RESULTS Demographic and socioeconomic data [Table 1](#T1). First, the use of any CAM modality was reported to be higher among women (80.3%) than men (69.3%) (p<0.001). Furthermore, the subjects significantly more likely to use CAM were those in the 50- to 59-yr age bracket were (p<0.001); living in metropolitan cities (p<0.005); with marital experience, as opposed to those who had never married (p<0.001); not employed (p<0.001); with religious beliefs (p<0.001); with education levels under high school (p=0.02); and with a higher level of monthly family income (p=0.008). Medical conditions & self-perception of general health [Table 2](#T2). In this regard, the subjects significantly more likely to use CAM were those with medical problems (p<0.001); and lower self-perceptions of general health status (p<0.001). Prevalence and types of CAM use [Table 3](#T3). Of the 3,000 subjects, 2,244 (74.8%) reported using CAM in the previous 12-month period. On average, each CAM user had employed approximately 2.5 types of CAM therapy. In aggregate, CAM users had employed a total of 5,727 CAM therapies. The most common category of CAM used was biologically based therapies (65.4%), followed by whole medical systems (31.7%), mind-body therapies (5.1%), unclassified therapies (2.1%), manipulative and body-based therapies (1.8%), and energy-healing therapies (0.5%). Among whole medical systems, 31.6% of the subjects had used Korean Oriental Medicine (KOM), commanding an absolute majority in this category. For the biologically based therapies, 60.2% of the subjects had used dietary supplements, 13.9% had used unprocessed and non-prescribed herbs, 7.5% had used animal extracts for health reason, and 4.8% had used diet-based therapies. More specifically, among the use of dietary supplements, vitamin and mineral supplements (not prescribed accounted for 34%; non-vitamin, non-mineral and non-ginseng dietary supplements, 33%; and ginseng, 23.1%. Finally, the five most common types of CAM therapies reported were dietary supplements (60.2%), KOM (31.6%), non-processed and and diet-based therapies (4.8%). Reasons for CAM use Main source of advice about CAM use Costs for CAM therapies DISCUSSION [2](#B2), [4](#B4), [5](#B5), [7](#B7)- [14](#B14)) in various countries. Our study suggests that about 75% of adults in the Republic of Korea had used some form of CAM in a 12-month period between 2005 and 2006, the median annual out of-pocket expenditures for which was KRW200,000 or about US$203.6. This prevalence rate is much higher than that reported in Western countries ( [2](#B2), [5](#B5), [8](#B8)- [12](#B12)) and similar to that in Asian countries ( [4](#B4), [7](#B7)). A comparison of our results with those of the previous national survey by Lee et al. ( [15](#B15)) would appear to suggest that the prevalence of CAM use and the expenditures therefore are on the rise in South Korea. The prevalence of CAM use was 29% in 1999 ( [15](#B15)) and about 75% in 2006. The mean annual out-of-pocket expenditure for CAM therapies was KRW72,750 or US$61 in 1999 ( [15](#B15)) and KRW200,000 or $203 in 2006. However, these apparent increases may be explained by the different definitions of CAM use between the two surveys. Whereas our study looked at the use of CAM by all people regardless of medical condition, the prior study had limited its examination to CAM users who had also experienced symptoms or disease. [15](#B15)), and the present study also shows, KOM is now regarded as one of CAM therapies, possibly because TCM and modified versions of TCM in various countries are accepted around the world as a kind of CAM modality. This conceptualization of KOM is an important factor that increased the prevalence rate of CAM use shown in our study, similar to the rate of some Asian countries that regard TCM as conventional medicine ( [4](#B4), [7](#B7)). Thus, it will be an important task to develop a consensus for the definition and taxonomy of CAM therapies in South Korea, as well as the rest of the world. [17](#B17)- [20](#B20)), and the rates of cancer patients ranged from 41% to 72.7% ( [21](#B21)- [24](#B24)) in South Korea . But because of the differences in the respective contents of these various surveys, it is hard to conclude that CAM usage rates of patients with chronic disease in 2006 rose in comparison to the rates previously reported. Still, with the exception of the educational factor, our results generally support those of previous reports from the West, which found that CAM use was more likely among persons with higher education ( [3](#B3), [5](#B5), [6](#B6), [8](#B8)- [10](#B10)). Our results, on the other hand, differ somewhat from those of some Asian studies ( [4](#B4), [7](#B7)). [5](#B5)), which may be related to cultural or religious differences. [25](#B25)). As such, the government should provide information about the benefits and risks of CAM therapies, such as the interaction between commonly used dietary supplements and prescribed conventional western drugs, and develop guidelines for use. This would also raise awareness among the orthodox medical community, which at present is largely uninterested in CAM therapies and skeptical of their benefits, so that complementary and alternative treatment modalities may be used more often, more effectively, and more safely in conjunction with the other standard forms of treatment available to patients.
