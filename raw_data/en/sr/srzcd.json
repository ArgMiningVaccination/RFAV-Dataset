By taking a break to clear out environmental, dietary, mental and emotional distractions, you will find a sense of renewal and expanded vitality to re-energize you in your daily life. Your cleansing week begins the moment you drive onto our 400 acre campus, nestled in the beauty of the rolling Pocono Mountains. Serenity and peace welcome you with complimentary hot tea and meditative surroundings. Your first evening is about settling in - finding a sense of stillness. Take a nature walk or hike on our 5 trails, or gaze peacefully at our charming Sunset Pond. The retreat is structured to rotate through: - Daily relaxing massage and bodywork therapies - Steam therapy for further toxin removal - Gentle morning hatha yoga classes - 3 light and fresh meals each day served at the retreat center - Nourishing, delicious gluten-free meals - Freshly prepared organic juices - Individual consultations with medical professionals to help you focus on transforming your health - Evening group instructional classes on a variety of topics regarding cleansing, diet, Ayurveda, and meditation/relaxation techniques - A Take Home Plan for continued success after the retreat has ended Plenty of down time is allowed for you to rest and detox in your own personal way. You may also find a sense of comfort in connecting with the intimate group, set at a maximum of 10 attendees. Enjoy the personal attention of our experienced team of wellness professionals, here for you every step, so you can leave worries at home and focus completely on deep cleansing and relaxation. Our cleanse retreat is designed for complete nourishment, and as such does not involve fasting, which can actually rob the body of important nutrients and slow your metabolism. Our professional chefs cook you three fresh, light meals a day that will aid the body in detoxing and recharging. These meals will nourish your body's internal detoxification system, thereby increasing the natural capacity you have to cleanse and restore. You may lose weight, and you will definitely feel more energized, lighter, and buoyant. Open the door to a feeling of clarity and harmony in your body and life Who Manages the Program?
