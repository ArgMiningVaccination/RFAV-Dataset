The primary objective of this project is to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 among HCP, specifically focusing on the effect of vaccine boosters and temporal changes in vaccine effectiveness. Secondary objectives include: - Identifying differences in vaccine effectiveness by age group and comorbidity categories - Evaluating vaccine effectiveness within job categories and clinical practice settings, - Estimating the comparative effectiveness of different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, vaccine schedules, and time periods between doses, - Evaluating vaccine effectiveness as related to participant reported history of past infection, - Measuring effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters, - Elucidating the role of vaccination in preventing prolonged symptoms of COVID-19, and - Evaluating vaccine effectiveness for illness related to emerging variants. These questions will be answered by enrolling HCP in participating sites who develop symptoms of COVID-19. After COVID-19 testing, we will define: Cases: HCP who test positive for COVID-19, and Controls: HCP who test negative for COVID-19. Study sites are selected to be high-volume academic centers with robust employee testing programs that participate in [EMERGEncy ID NET](https://www.emergencyidnet.org/), a CDC-funded emerging infectious disease network created for surveillance and research of emerging infections (PI: David Talan, MD). Project PREVENT is being administered with the Clinical Coordinating Center at the [Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA](https://www.emergencymedicine.ucla.edu/) and the Data Coordinating Center at "}
