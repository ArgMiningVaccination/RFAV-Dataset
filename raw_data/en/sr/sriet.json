The university is closely monitoring university health conditions as well as local, state and federal laws and guidelines. As has been the case since the pandemic began, the College of Law will follow university policies and is prepared to shift operations and classroom and work modalities as needed. The health and wellbeing of our community is our top priority. The College of Public Health has [current information](https://publichealth.arizona.edu/news/2021/covid-19-forecast-model) about conditions in Arizona. Based on current public health conditions and aligned with [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fyour-health%2Feffective-masks.html), the University has updated its [face covering policy](https://covid19.arizona.edu/face-coverings). Masks are now recommended, but not required, in most indoor spaces including classrooms. We will continue to require that surgical masks or higher-grade masks be worn: - In any building/facility that is operated by or affiliated with the University where patients or human research subjects participating in clinical research are seen in person. - In locations where personal protective equipment (including masks) has always been required to maintain safety protocols for situations with high hazards, such as areas where regulated chemicals are used or stored and other laboratory settings. - Inside a Cat Tran shuttle or any other public transportation provided by the University as recommended by the [CDC and TSA](https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/statements/2022/03/10/statement-regarding-face-mask-use-public-transportation). Surgical masks are three-ply disposable masks. Higher grade masks include KN95 or KF94 masks. The University will provide surgical masks in building front entrances, classrooms, and other large sites. Surgical and KN95 masks will also be provided upon request. Please call the Facilities Management Work Control Desk at 520-621-3000 or contact your [building manager](https://www.fm.arizona.edu/documents/BuildingManagerList.pdf). These requirements apply to all faculty, staff, students, designated campus colleagues and visitors to the University of Arizona campus or University locations. Please contact the [Disability Resource Center](https://drc.arizona.edu/) if you have questions regarding a disability or medical-related condition. While individuals cannot require others to wear a mask, given the varying levels of personal risk from COVID-19, we encourage members of the university community to be compassionate towards one another and respectful of each other's needs. Building access and access to university services cannot be denied based on an individual's decision not to wear a mask where masks are not required. Please contact the [Disability Resource Center](https://drc.arizona.edu/) if you have questions regarding a disability or medical-related condition. Mitigation efforts on campus include: - Recommended use of [face coverings](https://covid19.arizona.edu/face-coverings)indoors when continuous social distancing is not possible. - Free [vaccinations](https://covid19.arizona.edu/vaccine)and [COVID-19 testing](https://covid19.arizona.edu/covid19-testing/locations)for faculty, staff and students. - Robust contact tracing in the event of [student](https://covid19.arizona.edu/test-trace-treat/positive-case-protocol-students)or [employee](https://hr.arizona.edu/content/covid-19-positive-case-notification-protocol)positive cases - Use of Oxivir for cleaning and disinfecting which kills the COVID-19 virus - Isolation Dorms and student isolation transportation - Installation of MERV-13 air filters, wall-mounted hand sanitizers, touch-free paper towel dispensers, toilet seat covers and other facilities enhancements.

We strongly encourage you to enjoy your meals outside, in our beautiful courtyard, under the big blue umbrellas near our parking lot, or in single-occupancy offices or rooms. Please refrain from eating in common areas indoors. COVID-19 Testing, Health & Wellness Everyone is encouraged to test weekly, even if you are vaccinated.

Additionally, contact [Law's building manager](mailto:bwilkins@arizona.edu) when a person has tested positive for COVID so that we can get the areas in question sanitized quickly. If an employee is [symptomatic](https://hr.arizona.edu/content/covid-19-positive-case-notification-protocol#Symptoms), they should stay home -- or go home -- and contact Campus Health and get tested for COVID. If an employee is in [close contact with someone who has tested positive](https://hr.arizona.edu/content/covid-19-positive-case-notification-protocol#CloseContact) for COVID-19, they should follow university-established [protocol](https://hr.arizona.edu/content/covid-19-positive-case-notification-protocol#CloseContact). Generally, if a professor becomes incapacitated, another member of the Arizona Law faculty will cover classes until the professor is able to return to teaching. A professor who is unable to enter campus but is able to teach remotely may elect to teach a class or clinic remotely. If this is not feasible then a professor's absence will be treated just like any other absence due to illness, and alternative arrangements will be made on a case by case basis.The College of Law will follow [ABA Standards (see Ch. 3, Sec. 310)](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/standards/) for the guidelines on classroom instruction.
