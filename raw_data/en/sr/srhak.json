This is because toxicity in the body can initiate or aggravate e existing health conditions. When you think of a detox, a radical diet change or sauna time might come to mind. Yet, there are many small changes and treatments you can do that will help support your body's own natural detoxing process without such radical changes. One of these options for supporting a detox is chiropractic care. What is a Detox? Our bodies are exposed to chemicals all day long from the foods we eat, air we breathe, and other particles we come in contact with everyday. Luckily, our bodies have a natural process for managing these exposures to keep us healthy. However, if the toxin load becomes too much it can lead to a range of symptoms. Symptoms of toxicity can range from sleepiness, fatigue, and poor concentration to chronic disease and even death. Ways to do a Detox Reducing our toxic load by supporting the body's natural detox pathways is essential for good health, especially in our modern world of synthetic chemicals. Organs that help detoxify and keep the body in balance (that we can support) include the lymph nodes, kidneys, blood, liver, and digestive system. Additionally, reducing overall toxin exposure is a great long term strategy for improving our health. Common detox options include: - Exercise - Increasing water intake - Stress management - Adequate sleep - Reducing our environmental exposure with awareness of our hygiene and cleaning products - Nutrition changes- focusing on fresh nutrient dense whole foods and reducing processed chemical laden foods - Taking a cleansing supplements with other lifestyle changes - Fasting (intermittent or for a longer period with professional supervision) How Chiropractic Care Can Help When the body begins to struggle with toxin overload, certain areas of the body can be forced to start storing some of these toxins. Common areas include visceral fat and joints, such as in the spine. Toxin buildup in the spine can be exacerbated when spine misalignment is present, since it affects the local nerve energy flow. Restoring spine alignment, a common underlying health issue that we tend to underestimate, can help open and support our natural detox pathways and prevent unnecessary storage and buildup of toxins. Finding a CBP Provider to Support A Chiropractic BioPhysics (CBP) practitioner specializes in holistically restoring spine alignment. This gives your body the energy it needs to process and rid the body of toxins. When the body is well supported with it's own detox pathways, you can expect better overall health free of toxicity. Find a CBP provider in your area to see how CBP care can help support and possibly expedite your detox goals and results. Share This Story!
