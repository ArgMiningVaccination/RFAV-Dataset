The earthquake that shook much of the Northeast on August 23 rumbled through the Bridgeport area as students were returning to campus. Following close on the heels of this rare event was the approach of Irene, the first hurricane in 25 years forecast to hit Bridgeport directly. On Saturday, the 27th, in advance of Irene, all of our recently arrived freshman students and returning athletes and staff were evacuated to higher ground at nearby Sacred Heart University Because of extraordinary planning and effort by many dedicated UB personnel, the University weathered the storm with minimal damage to the campus and no loss of electrical power. Students returned to their dormitories on Sunday, as soon as the storm had moved on. Move-in day, the first day of classes, and welcome activities were rescheduled, and the new school year is now well underway. Events such as these, which are out of our control, remind us how much all of us in the University community depend on each other and draw strength from our collective commitment to UB. Over the summer, a number of UB departments worked collaboratively to complete a wide variety of campus restoration, repair, and renewal projects. Upgrades to the Anatomy Lab, which is so essential to the work of our Chiropractic, Naturopathic, Acupuncture, and Physicians Assistant programs, have vastly improved storage areas, ventilation systems, and work spaces, enabling our students to achieve higher levels of understanding and competency in greater comfort. The renovation of dormitories will help meet the needs of an increasing number of students who require on-campus housing, and the first phase of a two-part renovation of our main dining facility in Marina Hall has made a significant improvement in the quality, hours of operation, and variety of dining options. Several important new gifts to the University will enrich research opportunities for graduate and post-graduate students as well as independent researchers. The continued development of facilities in the Shintaro Akatsu School of Design and the Arnold Bernhard Center for the Arts and Humanities move us closer to accomplishing several key elements in our long-term plans for the University of Bridgeport. Despite so much progress, the issue for many of our students remains their ability to pay for their college educations. State and federal financial aid programs continue to diminish, and this trend affects our student population in particular. The University of Bridgeport has always been committed to securing as much financial help for as many students as we possibly can. We have a strong foundation for providing continuing support, but every foundation requires shoring up on a regular basis. I want to thank you for your generous support of our Annual Fund. I encourage you all to consider increasing your contributions this year as an investment in our students and the growth of UB. I hope that as you read this issue of Knightlines , you will appreciate the many inspiring stories about our faculty, staff, and students. The University of Bridgeport community is composed of remarkable individuals who contribute individually to the greater whole and make us who we are. Alumni have a special place in their hearts for their alma mater, and I know that you will help us to make this year a special one-and memorable not just for the weather.

Mixed with the sounds of traffic, birds, and a distant lawnmower is the unmistakable pastiche of laughter, music, and footsteps that signal only one thing: students. Welcome back!The summer has been a very busy time on campus, with so many new projects taking shape that it is hard to choose only a few to highlight. The renovation of the Human Anatomy Lab in Charles Dana Hall is complete. Sidewalks have been replaced, creating a safer and more accessible routes throughout campus. Significant improvements to the cardio facility at Wheeler Rec, as well as a fresh coat of exterior paint, make a workout even more enjoyable. Campus-wide electrical upgrades were also completed, as the University works to ensure that its power needs will be met safely and efficiently. And last but by no means least, students, faculty, and staff will be blown away by the renovations at Marina Hall, which now boasts an international food court and air conditioning! This is just the first stage of renovation for the dining facility, with the full project to be completed next summer. The University of Bridgeport continues to work at improving the foundations, not only of its physical plant, but for programs, classes, activities, and of course, the vitality of the Annual Fund. The Annual Fund, with generous funds from CHEFA, helped to underwrite many of the improvements and upgrades here at UB, and with your help, we will be able to continue these efforts.

We are most grateful to the UB acupuncturists who serve the School Sisters of Notre Dame in Wilton, CT. This service portrays their friendliness, compassion, and expertise for healing. College of Chiropractic professor Jim Fitzpatrick is a thoughtful organizer, and we are very fortunate to have this wonderful therapy for our sisters. Our prayers and blessings are with these healers as they reach out into their future. Sister Teresia Spodnik Wilton, CT Dear Editor, I am an alumna of UB (the Human Nutrition Institute) and I just finished reading the Knightlines \"Health Issue\" (Spring 2011) from cover to cover. I was so impressed with the quality of the publication I just had to write to you. The articles were interesting, the writing superb, and the photos beautiful. What a wonderful representation of the Health Sciences Division and the diversity of learning that UB provides! Thank you for delivering such a consistently fine product. In my large family we see many university publications among us: Knightlines has a standard of excellence that is clearly above the rest. I will continue to look forward to enjoying future issues. Annette Alfieri '08, MS Fairfield, CT Dear Editor, I just received the newest Knightlines in the mail (\"The Health Issue,\" Spring 2011), and I am so impressed with it. Working at UB I see every day the high caliber of students and faculty involved in the health sciences programs. I love the holistic approaches that these skilled health care providers take toward promoting health of the mind, body, and soul of their patients. Leslie Geary did a great job highlighting these programs and the people behind them. Congratulations and great job! Melissa H.

Heard told the Class of 2011 as she launched into her keynote address at the University of Bridgeport's 101st Commencement, held at the Arena at Harbor Yard. Listen up, they did. Heard, who has mobilized millions of Americans to volunteer as the founding chairman and CEO of the Points of Light Institute, energized the 1,470 graduates and their families by calling on them to \"do something\" for positive change in the world. Graduates were joined by members of the Class of 1961, who were honored as Golden Knights on the 50th anniversary of their graduation. Dressed in bright yellow caps and gowns, the group marched across the stage to robust applause. Heard wasted no time, either, to remind graduates that getting their degrees would not have been possible without the support and sacrifice of their families who \"gave something up so you could be here today with your cap and gown. Don't forget it. You did not do it alone.\" Heard's humor, however, matched her candor. In speaking of the dangers of hubris, for example, she recounted the time that heavyweight champ Muhammed Ali refused to fasten his seatbelt on a plane because \"Superman don't need no seatbelt.\" Heard continued, \"The flight attendant, a woman, responded, 'Superman don't need a plane, either.'\" And thus it went. Heard admonished those with cell phones: \"I see you texting! Text this and send it out to everyone on your contact list: A-M-Z-G- S-P-K-R. Amazing speaker! . . you are slouching! . . . People like me do notice. So remember ESP \u2014 Elegant Self-Promotion. Carry yourself with pride. Carry yourself with focus and force.\" Striving and achieving excellence, she continued, would enable graduates to produce effective change for others' benefit. \"Every 16 seconds a child dies because of lack of water . . . In America today, a child drops out of school every 26 seconds. So I need you to \u2014 \"Do something!\" Graduates called out, finishing the sentence. Heard's message was echoed by University President Neil Albert Salonen, who told graduates, \"You cannot look out at the problems of the world and wait for 'them' to solve them. Today, you have become one of them.\" Both addresses resonated with graduates like you Sandra Granath, who earned her bachelor's in Interna-tional Policy and Development. Granath, 25, moved to Taiwan over the summer to learn Mandarin. \"I want to work with the development of third world projects.\" Graduates were joined by members of the Class of 1961, who were honored as Golden Knights on the 50th anniversary of their graduation. Dressed in bright yellow cap and gowns, the group marched across the stage to robust applause. Dorothea E. Brennan, a member of the Connecticut Board of Governors of Higher Education, also spoke.

U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 56U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 Classes may have been out for the summer, but the UB campus hummed with activity as crews began more than $7 million in construction projects to accommodate growing enrollment and support academics. \"There are a lot of changes\u2014all good, \"said David Clarkin, a junior from Coventry, Rhode Island, as he moved into the newly opened Chaffee Hall, which got a top-to-bottom overhaul. Other projects included a new food court at Marina Dining Hall, restoring historic landmark buildings on campus, and providing students with more high-tech classrooms and state-of-the-art health sciences labs. Construction is being financed by a $7 million Connecticut Health and Education Facilities Authority (CHEFA) bond issue, various private grants, and University funding.\"We've completed more than $21.2 million in CHEFA projects since 2008, but many of our original projects, like removing old transformers to comply with federal environmental laws, weren't visible to the public,\" said Associate Vice President for Planning and Construction George Estrada. \"Construction done over the summer has a bigger impact on the look and feel of the campus. It's exciting to see.\" Serving up more at the food courtWork began soon after graduation at Chaffee Hall. The residence hall, closed in 1992, was reopened shortly before students returned to campus in August. Crews power-washed the building's brick exterior, replaced the roof, and installed energy-efficient windows. Interior upgrades include freshly painted dorm rooms and 6By Leslie GearyA new food court, wired classrooms, high-tech anatomy labs, and Wheeler Rec's gleaming fitness center are among the changes on campus this semester.BuildingExcellence7U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 upgraded bath and laundry rooms. Modern common social areas on each of Chaffee's four floors now boast kitchenettes and lounges outfitted with flat-screen televisions and comfortable seating. Students who want to live in the souped-up residence hall must have earned 60 credits and have done well in class, said Associate President of Admissions Bryan Gross. \"Reopening Chaffee isn't just about accommodating enrollment growth,\" Gross said. \"We're raising the bar in terms of providing the highest quality of living accom-modations that we possibly can for our upper-classmen and graduate students who have done well academically.\" Across the courtyard, the first phase of Marina Dining hall upgrades began when crews ripped up decades-old flooring and ceiling tiles, added air conditioning, and installed massive energy-smart windows overlooking Long Island Sound in the main eating hall. The other half of Marina was radically transformed into a modern food court featuring three restaurants run by Sodhexo: Ultimate Baja, with south-of-the-border fare; Grill 155 for traditional burgers and sandwiches; and Star Ginger created by celebrity chef Mai Pham. Patrons can purchase food to go or dine at the court's caf\u00e9-style seating area, which boasts screen televisions and wireless Internet. Smart boards and smart classrooms Construction projects will also enhance academics. To support the fast-expanding Health Sciences Division, for example, the human anatomy lab at Charles Dana Hall was doubled in size and equipped with men's and women's locker rooms, scrub areas, modernized ventila-tion systems, a virtual anatomy lab where students can hone their skills using the latest human-dissection software, and large-screen video monitors to broadcast in real time gross anatomy dissection demonstrations by faculty.

Brady, \"is intended to enhance the instructor's ability to effectively teach anatomy. \"This lab represents another part in the revitalization of facilities within the health sciences campus and will enhance the student experience and our ability to recruit students to our programs.\" The business school has grown, too, in recent years, thanks to new graduate- and undergraduate-degree programs. To better serve MBA candidates and under- grads, Mandeville Hall classrooms were modernized with smart technology and a new computer lab. The dean's office was redesigned into a suite that, among other uses, will provide comfortable meeting spaces for headhunters who each year visit Mandeville to recruit UB students for jobs. Wheeler Rec's new fitness center Across campus at the the Arnold Bernhard Center (ABC), home to the Shintaro Akatsu School of Design, first-floor corridors are being recarpeted and bright- ened with new lighting. The upgrades will complement renovations at the first-floor gallery which is used to showcase work by design students and visiting artists. ABC is scheduled to reopen later in the fall, and the improvements will \"reestablish ABC as a cultural destina- tion in Fairfield County,\" said Estrada. Down the block, crews repainted Wheeler Recreation Center, replaced the roof, and installed premium Matrix fitness equipment in the cardio workout center. Cortright Hall, built in 1890 for New York socialite Lavinia L. Parmly and now home to the University's Alumni Office, is being restored to its former grandeur. Starting in the fall, artisan craftsmen will restore the elegant Queen Anne-style building's wooden Yankee gutters, masonry, and wrap-around bay windows. The historic restoration campaign is being funded by the University and a $200,000 grant from the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism. Changes at UB aren't simply utilitarian. \"Walk through campus. You'll see more landscaping, trees, outdoor seating,\" said Estrada. \"We're creating beautiful spaces all over campus. There's so much to offer at UB; we want people to stop, take in the view, and enjoy it.\" 9The Human Anatomy Lab at Eleanor Dona Hall was demolished then rebuilt with new scrub areas, large-screen monitors, and virtual dissection stations. Facelift: Crews replaced walkways and created lush open spaces throughout campus. 10U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 Rana's experience in Haiti was life-changing. \"There were so many orphans, it was horrifying,\" he says. Peace 1011U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 Fighting in Nepal's Civil War inspired Pranaya Rana '11 to learn more about nonviolent means to end conflict while studying at the International College. Now he's helping immigrants displaced by war and working to bring lasting peace to his country. Clutching a spiral-bound notebook tightly to his chest, the man hesitated at the office door and scanned the room's modest surroundings: two wooden tables, a fireplace mantle topped with 126 miniature flags from nations around the world, one large American flag, and 18 folding metal chairs, one of which was occupied by another man, just a bit younger than himself, he supposed. Dressed in a starched button- down shirt and brown leather shoes buffed to a high shine, the room's well-groomed occupant looked like he belonged in a corner office overlooking the coruscating skyline of the Big City, not here. Yet this dimly lit classroom at the International Institute of Connecticut (IIC) \u2014 an agency for newly arrived immigrants located in an old Victorian on Clinton Avenue in Bridgeport \u2014 was exactly where UB alumnus Pranaya Rana '11 belonged. Indeed, he'd left his home in Nepal to be in places like this. \"Please,\" said Rana, 28, looking up from his note-taking with a megawatt smile. \"Come in! Sit.\" Rana, who in May graduated with a master's degree in Global Development and Peace from the International College, was back at IIC after returning the previous evening from Washington, D.C. He'd spent a packed three days meeting with officials from the U.S. Commission for Refugees and Immigrants to discuss security and funding issues. Nonetheless, Rana's gaze locked in on Abdul Mahfoz Abdul Ghafor, a 32-year-old immigrant from Afghanistan, just now stepping into the office. Ghafor's reticence was understand- able. He arrived in Connecticut as a refugee in April, after being sponsored by the U.S. government. Like other clients at IIC, he'd been displaced from his home by war and political upheaval. Now his future lay with Rana, whose job at IIC it is to resettle Ghafor and 38 other clients into a new American life and become self-sufficient as quickly as possible. It's a monumental task. On any given day, Rana finds himself scheduling medical appointments for clients; filling out their applications for Green Cards and Social Security numbers; helping them apply for food stamps; Medicaid, and other benefits; searching for apartments and negotiating rent with landlords for displaced families; enrolling children into schools and their parents into ESL classes; and finding, then obtaining, jobs for clients, some of whom speak English, most of whom do not. It's a job that requires stamina, gritty determination, untold patience, and the full sum of Rana's diplomatic and survival skills \u2014 most of which he acquired in the classrooms of the International College and the jungles of Nepal, where for seven years he served in the army (continued on page 12)Soldier to statesman? International College alumnus Pranaya Rana has a most unusual past, but he's determined to make the future better for those affected by war. By Leslie Geary Peace Maker12U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 during that country's bloody civil war between government forces and Maoist rebels. Rana intends to return to Nepal one day, to help it stabilize and rebuild, but first he's got work to do. For family and country It is, without question, a rather unusual CV: soldier, student, nonprofit immigration counselor. But Rana's variegated background reflects a family destiny spanning 100 years of successive and ever-successful generations of Rana patriarchs. His great-great-grandfather, Dev Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana, was Nepal's prime minister in 1901 for a short spell before being ousted by family members in a nasty internecine power-grab. Although Dev's service as PM was brief \u2014 just 144 days before he was exiled to India \u2014 the elder statesman enjoyed a reputation as a reformer who championed the causes of universal education and anti-corruption. Since his tenure, the Rana family has been linked to their homeland.\"Whatever they did, it always had to do with Nepal,\" says Rana, whose ancestors include more than a few generals and whose father is a colonel in the Nepalese army. So it was not unusual that soon after his ninth birthday Rana enrolled in a boarding school reserved for children of the military's elite. When he turned 19, he joined Nepal's army, as a first lieutenant. He was highly trained, highly disciplined, and harbored no illusions about what lay ahead as he entered the then-raging war. Nevertheless, Rana quickly grew frustrated. \"I always tried to see a different means to resolve conflict,\" he says, \"but the military has a chain of command. You cannot mediate between parties. There's no improvisation. You're there to follow orders, to serve, to obey. As a young officer, your voice is not heard. And I never liked the violence.\" As it happened, the civil war did end, in 2006. Rana had three more years of military service, and while he knew he would leave the army, he wasn't ready to No job too small . . . or heavy. After finding homes for refugees Rana helps them move in. 13U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 abandon his country. After all, he was a Rana. \"You were always expected to excel in my family, and you want to do something,\" he says. \"I realized if I had a degree and experience, I would be able to provide my own ideas for Nepal's future. If they're good ones, they will listen.\" Moreover, as far as Rana saw it, Nepal desperately needed good ideas. \"It's been five years since the civil war ended and Nepal still doesn't have a constitution. It's all about power politics. No promises made by any of the parties have been kept,\" says Rana with frustration. \"I want to help things go in a positive direction.\" Family destiny Having a prime minister in the family is one thing. But to get his turn at the steering wheel Rana had to earn his chops \u2014 especially given his family's legacy, which was, he admits, less than neutral. \"I needed experience,\" he states pragmatically. \"I needed credibility.\" So he went to Kathmandu to study diplomacy at T ribhuvan University, where he met an American named Brian Polkinghorn, director the Institute of Multi-T rack Diplomacy. Founded by ambassador John W . McDonald to promote peace in areas of conflict, the Washington, D.C. nonprofit has worked in more than 50 nations that have invited it to assist with peace-building efforts. Polkinghorn had been tapped to help in Nepal stabilize after the civil war. He used the trip to teach a class on conflict resolution at T ribhuvan. It was a fortuitous visit for both Polkinghorn and Rana. There were 46 students, but Rana quickly stood out. \"He sat in the back of the classroom, and every time he asked he question he stood up, used the word 'sir,' and showed he wasn't just synthesizing what he heard; he was really evaluating the information. After about the third question I realized, 'This is a really bright guy. He's really asking high-order questions,' \" recalls Polkinghorn. Soon the two met outside of class to exchange ideas. Polkinghorn wanted to talk with former soldiers about integrating Maoists into Nepal's army, and Rana was happy to share his views. \"Sometimes it doesn't pay to be close, and coming from a military family, I'd ask Pranaya, 'Is this a personal bias or would someone else give this assessment?' and for the most part he was very honest. He didn't let personal Rana helps a client unpack and move into new digs in Bridgeport. Resettling refugees means paperwork, paperwork, and more paperwork. Rana tells a client how to cut through the red tape at one of many meetings at IIC. (continued on page 14)More than 250 to become citizens at ceremony for new Americans at UB this fall The University of Bridgeport will host a naturalization ceremony for new Americans this fall as part of its ongoing work with the International Institute of Connecticut (IIC) on behalf of refugees and immigrants to the United States. The time-honored swearing-in will be held at the Arnold Bernhard Center on Friday, September 23. University President Neil A. Salonen will deliver welcoming remarks to more than 250 immigrants from over 50 countries, who then will pledge the Oath of Allegiance before being sworn in as naturalized citizens. \"The University of Bridgeport has been a critical partner in helping the IIC to realize its mission to serve the needs of the foreign-born community in Bridgeport. We're very happy to cohost this event with UB; it's a ceremony that really is the American Dream,\" said IIC Executive Director Angela Zurowski. The IIC and UB's International College have collaborated on various refugee-resettlement projects for the past two years, Zurowski added. Several students intern at the non-profit, and International College alumni also work at the organization's immigrant resettlement and anti-human trafficking departments. - L.G.O A T H O F A L L E G I A N C E 14U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 bias affect his assessment,\" says Polkinghorn. \"He knew what the Maoists would say and do when certain options were presented to them. He predicted the fall of the Maoist prime minister [Kamal Dahal] Prachanda two months before it happened. I showed his work to people in diplomatic circles in Washington, D.C. and New York, and they were stunned. He'd tell you something, and bam, several weeks or months later it would have happened. He's a very bright guy. If you want a cheat sheet on the peace process in Nepal, read his thesis.\" Bright. Connected. Yet in post-civil war Nepal, even these attributes could be a determent. As Polkinghorn notes, \"Being from a prime minister's family has its ups and downs. He needs credibility and experience, and the smartest way for him to do that is by being out of Nepal. Then the Maoists and Marxists cannot come back and say, 'You're riding on the coattails of dead ancestors.'\" Polkinghorn's advice? Study abroad, get practical experience, then return to help your homeland. Experience required The International College at UB had everything Rana was looking for: It's Global Development and Peace program offered a concentration in conflict resolution. Students needed to speak at least one foreign language (Rana knows three: English, Nepalese, and Hindi). And, most tantalizing of all, Rana, like all students at the 14 Right: Rana must use all of his diplomatic skills to get landlords to rent to his clients. \"I don't have to be in the UN to get experience in peace-and- conflict issues,\" he says. 15U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 College, would be required to complete an international internship to gain practical, on-the-ground experience. He quickly impressed dean Dr. Thomas Ward. \"Because of his background Pranaya was a person with some very strong skills and experiences, and he brought them into the program,\" says Ward, who had Rana in his International Conflict Analysis and Resolution class and Advanced Diplomacy course. \"We have other students from Nepal, but the unique thing about Pranaya is that he sees conflict resolution through the eyes of a trained soldier. He has a big vision.\" And boundless energy. Rana augmented classes by doing volunteer conflict analysis for Polkinghorn, with whom he stays in touch, and the Institute for Multi-T rack Diplomacy. And when an earthquake ripped through Haiti in January 10, 2010, Rana obtained permission from Nepal's military supervisors to join UN peacekeeping forces in Haiti, thus fulfilling UB's internship requirement. He provided security at food-distribution centers and at camps for people displaced when their homes were destroyed. But it was the children who inspired him.\"We would help orphans in various orphanages with food and clothing with internal resources,\" he recalls. \"The children were anywhere from one to eight or nine years old. Our battalion would bring them cooked meals and clothes we bought with donations from military personnel. Sometimes our medical team would go with us to give check-ups. There were so many orphanages, it was horrifying. All we could do is see if the children were treated properly. But Haiti made it very clear in my mind that in one way or another I would pursue a field Thanks to his relationship with Chip's owner George Chatzopoulous, Rana was able to get a job for client Mahfoz Ghafor. (continued on page 16)16U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 where I could work with people in need.\" When he returned to UB two months later Ward directed Rana to IIC, which frequently collaborates with the International College (see \"Oath of Allegiance\" on page 13). Many immigrants at IIC have been forced to leave Bhutan, and Rana would serve as a much-needed interpreter. But even when clients come from, say, Eritrea, speaking Tigrinya, or from Afghanistan, speaking Farsi or Russian, or a smattering of English, Rana can hone skills to achieve his political dreams. After all, says Ward, he may have \"a big vision\" but like so much in politics, dreams hinge on diplomacy and attention to detail. \"The most important thing Pranaya can do in his current position at IIC is to convey the suffering and challenges of the people who need to be resettled to the people who can do something about it,\" Ward continues. \"That's a key dimension of leadership: to possess both the understanding of the circumstance of those who have needs and the realities of those who can help them. You have to be patient to get results. Patience is one of Pranaya's many skills.\" Notebooks and jobs And so Rana now spends days shepherding clients, some with families and young children, others alone in the U.S., through labyrinthine bureaucracies. \"Just when you settle one problem another comes up. Most of the refugees don't speak much English, or if they do, they don't write it. It's hard to reach case workers on their behalf. We send faxes to different agencies, but faxes don't reach them in time. Food stamps or other benefits are discontinued. To reactivate benefits, we need to go wait in line. And every government office is busy,\" he says. \"Working with refugees is sharpening my negotiating skills.

It's always the common people who are the victims. Most of my clients are refugees from Bhutan, Afghanistan, Eritrea, who lived as refugees because they were forced to join the military. My background gives me good knowledge of what their lives were like.\" His empathy quickly becomes apparent during his meeting with Mahfoz Ghafor, the hesitant young man now comfortably ensconced in a folding metal chair at IIC. After a few pleasantries, Rana gets to the point: \"There's a new ESL class for you. It's every day except Friday, from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.,\" he tells Ghafor cheerfully. \"Here, let me write it down for you.\" Ghafor, still clutching the spiral notebook, slowly hands it over the table for Rana to copy the class schedule on the book's last page. \"I'll get you another,\" Rana says, ever mindful that sweeping change \u2014 be it crafting a national constitution or becoming an American citizen \u2014 often hinges not on lofty ideas but on the tiniest of details. Something as inconsequential a fresh notebook will make life infinitely easier for Ghafor to remain organized, get to ESL classes, and with any luck, schedule job appointments. There's more news: Rana has been meeting with George Chatzopoulos, owner of Chip's Family Restaurant in Orange, and Chatzopoulos has agreed to hire four IIC clients, including Ghafor, at his second site in Fairfield. Conversation ensues. Ghafor will call Rana if he is unable to attend class. Rana underscores the point by holding a fist to his ear, as if cradling a phone. Mahofoz nods in assent. \"Yes, I will call.\" \"Good!\" beams Rana. \"It's good to see you trying to speak English. When you improve, you will go to the intermediate level. You are doing very well.\" \" Haiti made it very clear in my mind that in one way or another I would pursue a field where I could work with people in need.\"17U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 17\"In preparing for Korea, it's safe to say that I was worried about all the wrong things,\" says Katelyn Anton. \"I'm so much more versed with the culture than the language, so while I understood the importance of giving money with both hands, I couldn't understand the price when a store clerk spoke it.\" Anton, who's majoring in International Political Economy and Diplomacy at the International College, was among more than one dozen UB students to study at several international programs held in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East this summer. The classes they took were as diverse as the countries they visited. Students learned about diplomacy to biol- ogy to design in cities from Milan to T unis.

Ward, a senior majoring in World Religions, won a U.S. Department of State Critical Language Scholarship to study at Centre d'Etudes Maghrebines \u00e0 T unis. \"It was a fantastic program,\" she says. \"I jumped four levels with my Arabic! I can read much faster and speak much more confidently.\" No wonder. Ward spent ten weeks in T unis and most of her time was dedicated to intensive language studies. \"I had class for four hours a day, then tutoring, and then speaking practice, and then four hours of homework,\" she reports. Ward studied with 26 students from other U.S. universities. But the person she got to know most intimately was Aya Moez, her host parents' 11-year-old daughter. \"I had to do a lot of writing assignments, and she used to help me with my grammar and spelling. She loved it! She made me little lessons for me and graded them,\" says Ward, laughing. \"It was very cute.\" In Dubai, Pimentel, 21, spent the summer at the American University as a William Jefferson Clinton \"We felt that it was important to provide our students with an opportunity to study interior design overseas and expose them to a different cultural context,\" Kandalaft said. \"They had to go to the Hotel Bulgari, photograph it, and develop concepts for the renovation. It's a real-life project in hospitality design that's part of the practical training at SASD. We're also hoping to create a teaching- and student-exchange program with professors from the Institute.\" Work at the Institute was \"intense,\" said Chavez. \"It was like doing a semester's work in a few weeks. But the professors were very good.\" When not in a studio, Chavez hit the streets. \"You walk for hours and hours and everywhere you look, there's art and design, architecture, fashion, style.

Although her first task was to improve her Arabic, Pimentel found that the timing of the trip gave her a front-row seat to the so-called Arab Spring protests that have erupted in Egypt's Tahrir Square, in T ripoli, Sana, Jeddah, and other cities across the Middle East. \"There were people from Lebanon, Egypt, Iran \u2014 all over \u2014 and there was a lot of heated discussion about what was going on,\" said Pimentel. \"I was able to get a lot of different perspectives; it was really enriching to hear.\" Pimentel also befriended a Palestinian couple, Feraf and Buka, who frequently invited her for meals of stuffed zucchini, rice, meat, chocolates, watermelon, and demitasse filled with thick T urkish coffee. As they lingered over their meals, Pimentel learned her new friends didn't have passports, only refugee papers. \"They told me how hard it was for them without passports. I knew stuff like that happened, but it shocked me,\" said Pimentel, who one day wants to work in the U.S. Foreign Service or for an international NGO. \"But I'm an optimist. I see hope. And it was amazing to meet new people.\" A garden in China As part of its ongoing exchange program with sister school Sichan University Jingjiang College (SUJC) in China, eight students and mass communications professor Yanmin Yu traveled to Chengdu, China, for ten days. Among them: MBA candidate Janneth Achury, who signed on for the trip because she wants to work in international business. \"I speak two out of three major languages \u2014 English and Spanish \u2014 and I'm learning Mandarin,\" says Achury. \"I want to do business in China.\" T o learn more about various enterprises, Achury visited Shanghai, which she called \"New York on steroids.\" She also got a peek at more modest rural enterprises when she UB student Carolina Lobato helps to plant a tree at Jinjiang College.

So she signed up for the International Summer Program at Hanyang University in Seoul, Korea. Language classes, she figured, would help her as president of UB Language Exchange, a student group she founded last year to promote the understanding of various cultures. And the marketing would be helpful, too. Anton plans to combine her interest in various cultures with business. T o help prepare for business school \u2014 she has her sights set on an MBA \u2014 she took both marketing and basic Korean language classes over the summer. The Korean courses, she admitted, \"were a bit of a stretch . . . .

What really contributed a lot though was the hospitality of the Korean people. As cliche as it sounds, I learned that a smile really does say it all.\" visited a winery near SUJC. Yet Achury found that spontaneous adventures provided her with the most pivotal experiences. One morning she and UB classmate Mariah Dookie joined her host mother at a local park. \"We called her Miss Mei. She was older, like a mother, and she invited us to do tai chi with her,\" said Achury. \"It was about 7 a.m. and a little bit rainy. But when we got to the park we saw old trees and rivers and bamboo houses. It was beautiful, like being in an enchanted movie.\" Happily, that enchanted garden awaits Achury: SUJC offered her a job teaching English to its Chinese students. She'll go next summer, after she graduates with her MBA from UB, and work during the day. At night, she'll take more Mandarin. \"It will be so good to learn more of the language and the people and culture,\" she says. \"It will open a lot of doors.\"UB students attended the International Summer Program at Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea, from June 28 to July 22.

Penny, seated by Nathanson's side, is quick to add anecdotes of her husband's many accomplishments.The couple met on July 4, 1986, at the Statue of Liberty Centennial Celebration, complete with a flotilla of ships, President Reagan, and picturesque views. \"We saw fireworks that evening\" Nathanson recalls with a laugh. The happy couple married on August 2, 1992. Destiny intervenes At age two, the Nathansons' daughter Marni began having seizures, an event that inspired Nathanson, who had been a third-generation printer, to pursue a career in health care so that he, too, might help GetGive a Miraclea Miracle Dr. Brian Nathanson began using chiropractic techniques he learned at UB to help cancer patients. Then he and his wife cofounded CT Row for a Cure to do even more. (continued on page 22)By Sherri Bartley Rivera Nathanson and his wife PennyU B FALL 2011 2122U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 Association. Nathanson had never tried the sport, but he was intrigued every time he walked by the Association's boat house. \"I always liked the outdoors, and I knew about the place, so I just wandered in one day,\" Nathanson says. He introduced himself to Charles Huthmaker, the director, and told him about the chiropractic skills he used to help runners in the ING NY Marathon and other athletes. They two men it off instantly. Nathanson began treating rowers - and learning to row. (\"I'm not a typical rower,\" he concedes with a laugh. \"I'm short.\") But he loved it. Soon, he had Penny rowing, too, and then their daughters. The family was hooked on the sport. \"Penny and I kept thinking this would be a great for our patients,\" says Nathanson. They established the local Row for a Cure chapter in Connecticut. Row for a Cure The Connecticut Chapter of Row for a Cure regatta raised a respectable $7,000 its first year in 2009 for the Connecticut Affiliate of Susan G. Komen for a Cure\u00ae. Komen Connecticut is a state-level organization that is part of the national Susan G. Komen for the Cure, which is world's largest grassroots network of breast cancer survivors and activists. The second regatta, on a cold day, with 40-mile-per- hour winds, in November 2010, the CT chapter raised over $23,000. The Nathansons' younger daughter, Cali, then 12-years-old, also rowed for the family cause. \"Connecticut has the second highest incidence of breast cancer in the nation,\" said Anne Morris, executive director of Komen Connecticut. \"We are so appreciative to have the generous support of the Connecticut community through events like the Row for a Cure to do what we can to combat this statistic. Under Brian and Penny's leadership, Row for a Cure has made a significant contribution to the local fight against breast cancer.\"others. He decided on chiropractic medicine as it would allow him to run his own practice and dictate his professional future. Nathanson opted to study at the University's College of Chiropractic, which came to the forefront of his search as he was inspired by professors like Dr. Stephen Perle. Nathanson volunteered to work on Perle's finish line triage team for the ING NYC Marathon. \"Brian jumped right in . . . and he put his all into it,\" recalls Perle. Today, the two remain in weekly communication. Perle also taught Nathanson how to help patients using the so-called Graston technique, a method that involves using specifically designed stainless steel instruments to break down scar tissue and reduce inflammation. As a student, Nathanson had no inkling of how the lessons would come to define New England Physical Care, the private practice he opened in Norwalk, Connecticut, and open a new chapter in his life helping cancer patients. \"It allowed me to give life back to a patient who had a mastectomy. She thought she would never be out a pain,\" recalls Nathanson, whose first cancer patient was a woman who had undergone a mastectomy. The operation created built-up scar tissue in her pectoral muscles, causing her to lose significant arm movement. Using the Graston technique, Nathanson got her arms moving again and decreased her pain. Soon, word traveled, and he was treating many breast cancer patients. Get a Miracle, Give a Miracle At the same time, cancer was impacting Nathanson's personal life. His mother passed away from brain cancer, and two close family friends developed breast cancer. As he suffered personal loss and worked with breast cancer patients, Nathanson and his wife could not help thinking about their daughter's earlier experience with seizures. They decided to raise money for a cause supporting cancer patients. But what kind of charity? The answer, as it turned out, was across the street from Nathanson's practice at the Norwalk River Rowing \" The chances of our daughter getting better were very small. This experience totally turned our lives around. We got a miracle and we had to give back. \"23U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 Right: Penny Nathanson and daughter Cali at the 2010 CT Row for the Cure.Seventy-five percent of net proceeds from events like Row for a Cure support Connecticut-based education, screening, and treatment programs, says Morris. Other proceeds fund national research initiatives to find cures for breast cancer. \"To date, and with the help of community fundraisers like Row for the Cure, Komen for the Cure has invested more than $20 Million in Connecticut's breast health,\" Morris adds. The Nathansons love and live as a team, but now Dr. Nathanson explains \"we're finally working as a team.\" As the interview concludes Penny sits at the edge of her seat and declares, \"Brian is very humble... but I know that he is there to heal people and he's come home and told me stories about people. And I see tears role, his heart and his soul and his spirit are into making lives better, for people to be the best they can possibly be.

Crayhon was cofounder of Designs for Health, a nutrition supplements company, who died of cancer in September 2010. But at UB he was known by graduates from the Human Nutrition Institute as the go-to source for career advice. Students often attended his workshops and sought his input as they prepared to enter the nutrition profession, said Dr. David M.

Designs for Health President Linda Lizotte and company CEO Johnathan Lizotte, who cofounded the Suffield, Connecticut, company with Crayhon in 1989 and were among his closest friends, donated $15,000. The Chiropractic College Student Government, Naturopathic Student Association, and the Fones School's Sigma Phi Alpha Honorary Society, student groups within the health sciences, as well as Professional Nutrition Associates, an alumni group for UB nutrition grads, made donations, too. Funding also came from various health sciences divisions. At the dedication Crayhon was remembered for his intellect and humor. Blogging about being diagnosed with stage-four colon cancer, Crayhon once wrote: \"If you are looking for something fun and exciting, don't pick cancer. It's boring. You're tired. You don't look your best . . . .

As he bounds across a room with the self-assured energy of an athlete Rashad Melvin, 19, looks like the picture of health. But looks can be deceiving: Melvin began smoking when he was 17, and like millions of American teenagers who pick up the habit, he suddenly found himself hamstrung by an addiction to tobacco. \"I was stressed out because of school, and a friend offered one to me.\" But in August Melvin, who is from Norwalk, Connecticut, tossed away cigarettes for good and picked up plenty of tips about helping his peers stay healthy after participating in a cutting-edge program held at the University. Called \"Don't Let Your Life Go Up In Smoke,\" the campaign trained Fairfield County teenagers to become anti-tobacco advocates while opening doors to them as future professionals in the field of health care. The program was funded by a Connecticut Department of Health grant through the American Lung Association, and was led by UB faculty and the nonprofit Connecticut Area Health Education Center (AHEC). Health experts say such programs are critical. The number of American teenagers who smoke up to 10 cigarettes a day jumped from 61 percent to 79 percent between 1991 and 2009, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Once you get in the habit, it becomes almost impossible to observe your own free will,\" said UB President Neil Salonen, who visited the program to encourage students. He was joined by Senator Richard Blumenthal. Don't Let Your Life Go Up In Smoke focused on science and advocacy in health care. The teenagers learned to write anti-smoking PSAs for radio and crafted letters to lobby lawmakers to support anti- smoking programs. Much of their training will be put to use this fall, when program participants will be dispatched to Fairfield County schools to teach middle school students about the dangers of tobacco. \"Peer-to-peer counseling has proven to be extremely effective,\" explained AHEC Executive Director Meredith Ferraro. To help focus on the sciences, participants also took seminars with University biology professor Kathleen Englemann to learn about the chemical properties of tobacco and some of the more than 4,000 chemicals and 43 known carcinogens found in cigarettes. \"If you knew what was in them,\" said Melvin, \"you'd never start!\" - L.G.No ifs, ands, or butts UB President Neil Salonen and Senator Richard Blumenthal encouraged teenagers to choose healthy habits.26U B KNIGHTLINES FALL 2011 News Lines University graduates who qualify will be granted guaranteed admission to the American University of Antigua School of Medicine, (AICASA) under an articulation agreement signed by the two schools in May.

O'Leary, who are making quite a mark in professional and international baseball. A 2011 Bridgeport graduate, Barrows got off to fine start in pro ball with the Wichita Wingnuts of the independent American Association. In his first 12 games in professional baseball, Peter has a .395 batting average, with one home run and seven runs batted in. He has hit safely in 11 of the 12 games in which he has played as Wichita's starting right fielder. Barrows signed with the Wingnuts in mid-July, after leading after leading the summer MINK Collegiate Baseball League in batting with a .404 average playing for the Nevada Griffons. A First Team 2011 All-East Coast Conference selection, as well as a 2011 First T eam Daktronics All-East Region pick, Peter helped the Purple Knights to a single- season school record 31-14 record this past season, as he led the team in batting average of .353, slugging percentage of .516 and stolen bases with 21. Barrows's signing marks the second consecutive year that a former University baseball player has inked a professional contract, as pitcher Riley Shuckerow signed with the hometown Bridgeport Bluefish of the independent Atlantic League in 2010. O'Leary was selected as the Most Outstanding Pitcher at the 2011 Euro Baseball Qualifier held in Barcelona, Spain from July 25-July 30. T.J. tossed a complete game, four-hit shutout in the Republic of Ireland's 10-0 win over Hungary on July 27. T.J., who pitched for the Purple Knights during the 2009 and 2010 seasons, is in his second year representing Ireland on the diamond.

T roubled by that trend, Skowron sat down to pen his latest book, 100 Natural Remedies for Your Child , (Rodale Press). Skowron treats hundreds of kids a year at his private practice and at the UB clinic, and says too many kids are given prescriptions for drugs they don't need and that can cause them physical harm, due to \"over-diagnosis and incorrect diagnosis.\" 100 Natural Remedies provides other options. Featuring an alphabetical index of the top 100 pediatric health conditions \u2014 from acne to chicken pox to the flu and weight loss \u2014 the book features a handy guide to natural remedies for each of the ailments. Each \"has been scientifically researched to safe and effective\" Skowron says. And many natural remedies can be used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medicines for more effective relief. The Great Mortgage Meltdown underscores the pitfalls of bad loans. But there's danger, too, if banks don't make any loans, argues business school assistant professor James Sagner in Handbook of Corporate Lending (Bank Credit T raining Partners). Sagner, a former senior banker at First Chicago Bank, co-wrote the book with Herbert Jacobs. \"Banks are so scared about making bad loans and are under such pressure from regulators to build up their capital that they don't want to lend,\" Sagner says. Corporate Lending argues banks can and should make smart loans. They just need to stick to sound but often-eliminated business practices, like reinstituting credit-training programs so lenders learn to properly analyze loan applications. Gastrointestinal complaints account for nearly one third of all visits to primary care doctors, and one out of six patients suffer from digestive disease.

Mullins is an associate professor of medicine and practicing physician at John's Hopkin's University School of Medicine. The book provides for the first time ever both integrative and standard medical remedies \u2014 from pharmaceuticals to naturopathic supplements, dietary and lifestyle changes, and mind-body treatments \u2014 for common gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, reflux, celiac and Crohn's diseases.
