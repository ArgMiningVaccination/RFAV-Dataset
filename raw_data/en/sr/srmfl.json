If you have any questions or concerns, please speak to a doctor or nurse caring for you. Oralvac\u00ae Compact is an immunotherapy treatment for allergic reactions. If you have an allergy, your immune system overreacts to a substance that is not harmful. This treatment can weaken your body's response to the substance causing the allergy (the allergen). It helps your immune system get used to the allergen and stop reacting so strongly. We might recommend Oralvac Compact for you if: - you have a severe allergy to house dust mites (tiny bugs that live in house dust), tree pollen or grass pollen - your current medicine does not control your symptoms well This treatment comes as drops that you put under your tongue (sublingual). This medicine is not officially approved (licensed) for treating your health condition at present. However, your doctor feels that it is safe and effective treatment for you. [Read more about unlicensed medicines]. How Oralvac Compact works We use Oralvac Compact to treat the symptoms of an allergic reaction. The symptoms include: - inflammation (swelling) of the inside of the nose ( [rhinitis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/allergic-rhinitis/)) - inflammation of the eye ( [conjunctivitis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/conjunctivitis/)) Substances called allergens cause these symptoms. Almost anything can be an allergen, including pollen, animal fur, food and medicine. When you take Oralvac Compact drops, you have a small amount (dose) of the allergen that causes your reaction. By taking lots of small doses, you can build up a tolerance to the allergen that affects you. This reduces the symptoms of your allergic reaction.
