If you're having health concerns of any kind, we urge you to speak to a healthcare professional. About six years ago, seemingly overnight, I developed a case of acid reflux so unpleasant that it felt like lava was perpetually bubbling up into my throat. I know that's not the most pleasant image, but unfortunately, that is what it feels like to have the gastric contents of your stomach flow backward and up into your food pipe. While it can feel isolating, this internal roller coaster is more common than you may expect. What Is GERD? Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a chronic condition that occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, irritating its lining. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects roughly 20 percent of Americans, most of whom treat the condition by popping over-the-counter antacid tablets like they're Tic Tacs. But according to Rebecca Park, RN, a New York City-based nurse and founder of the natural treatments site [Remedies for Me](https://www.remediesforme.com/), coming at your GERD with drugs could be a big mistake. Luckily, I was able to remedy my acid reflux with a few simple diet and lifestyle changes, and Park says you can, too. With her help, plus the advice of [Elizabeth Trattner](https://elizabethtrattner.com/), a doctor of Chinese and integrative medicine, we put together this list of natural remedies for acid reflux to try. Meet the Expert - Rebecca Park is a registered nurse and founder of the holistic site Remedies for Me. Park believes that taking care of one's body and understanding its functions are necessary for maintaining good health. - Elizabeth Trattner is a certified acupuncturist and doctor of integrative medicine. Taking a less traditional path to wellness with her female patients, Trattner has gone on to lend her voice to publications such as Nylon and Elle as well as medical journals.

Watch Now: 6 Natural Remedies for Acid Reflux Drink Organic Apple Cider Vinegar In addition to its antimicrobial properties, organic [apple cider vinegar](https://www.byrdie.com/apple-vinegar-cider-for-skin) may help lower blood sugar, aid weight loss, and improve gut health. \"ACV is an alkalizing food, which balances the body's pH level,\" Park adds. \"Slightly alkaline (7.4) is the ideal state you want your body to be in to be able to fight off microbes and cancerous cells.\" As for methodology, make sure to buy organic, raw, unfiltered vinegar that comes in a glass bottle. Down a teaspoon or two each morning, and chase it with water. \"Try holding it in your mouth for a few seconds before swallowing,\" Park advises. \"This stimulates the saliva production and initiates the stomach in producing digestive acid.\" Add Fennel Seeds to Your Diet Rich with vitamins and minerals, fennel has been used as a digestive aid all over the world for centuries. That's thanks to its source of anethole, a compound that relaxes the stomach. Park suggests seeping some crushed fennel seeds in boiling water to make a tea and sipping it after a meal. Make Kudzu a Daily Ritual One of Trattner's go-to natural remedies for acid reflux is a combination of unfiltered apple juice and kudzu, a vine that's been used in Chinese medicine for millennia. Kudzu, blended with the pectin in apple juice, works to settle the stomach gently. Trattner recommends mixing a tablespoon of kudzu with 32 ounces of unfiltered apple juice in a pot, stirring every minute with a wooden spoon. After 10 minutes, have a few spoonfuls, and save the rest in a glass container for whenever you experience a bout of acid reflux. Soothe Your Stomach with Aloe Vera [Aloe vera is a natural anti-inflammatory](https://www.byrdie.com/aloe-vera-for-skin-4777483) that not only works on sunburns but also, when ingested, soothes an inflamed esophagus and stomach lining. Just mix two to three ounces with eight ounces of coconut water or fruit juice, and drink it 15 to 20 minutes before eating. Add More Fruit to Your Diet Citrus fruits are a definite no for acid reflux, but the digestion-promoting pectin and [pH-balancing](https://www.byrdie.com/ph-balance-skin) tartaric and malic acid found in apples are a definite yes. The papain in papaya (that's an enzyme that dissolves carbs, speeds up the metabolism, decreases inflammation, and treats constipation) is great for acid reflux, as well. So are bananas, which coat the lining of the stomach to soothe it and have a natural antacid effect. Relax with a Cup of Ginger Tea \" [Ginger](https://www.byrdie.com/benefits-of-ginger) is one of the oldest Chinese remedies for digestive issues and is a main ingredient for digestive herbal formulas,\" says Trattner. Try winding down with some ginger tea whenever your acid reflux strikes. Ginger is also a remedy for an upset stomach. If you are feeling nauseous, try sipping on ginger tea or suck on a piece of raw ginger. Try Peppermint Something that soothes my acid reflux every time is peppermint, which Trattner says is one of the most prescribed herbs for digestion. \"It helps with [nausea](https://www.byrdie.com/foods-for-nausea-5112769), upset stomach, and all digestive disorders,\" she says. Plus, [peppermint tea](https://www.byrdie.com/peppermint-oil-for-hair) cools that burning throat. [Peppermint Throat Coat](https://www.iherb.com/pr/traditional-medicinals-organic-throat-coat-original-with-slippery-elm-caffeine-free-16-wrapped-tea-bags-1-13-oz-32-g/6798) tea is my favorite, and Trattner is a fan of peppermint oil capsules. Sleep Upright Sleeping totally flat (my position of choice) was definitely a primary cause of my personal acid reflux. Park suggests sleeping as upright as possible and on your left side. \"This position does not allow stomach acid to empty back into the esophagus,\" she says. Eat Smaller Meals It's harder for your digestive system to break down larger meals. If you fill up too much, your stomach acid will likely bubble back up the esophagus. \"Chew slowly and more frequently before swallowing; digestion begins in the mouth,\" says Park. \"The more you help your body from the beginning, the easier it'll be later on.\" And avoid eating right before bed, waiting at least two to three hours after dinner to lie down. Bottom line? If you're experiencing acid reflux, take a trip to the grocery store before the pharmacy. These natural remedies can have multiple healing and soothing effects (and several are pretty tasty to boot). I'm pleased to share that these tips worked for me, and experts are confident they may help you, too.
