More recently, my research has focused on the application of structural equation modeling techniques (particularly latent growth curve modeling) to the examination of important educational issues. In the last few years, I have been investigating the validity of key assumptions of bilingual education theory in order to determine whether this is an effective strategy for educating students whose native language is not English. Currently, I am working with data from large-scale international assessments of student achievement, which are conducted every few years, in an effort to understand the U.S. achievement gap, particularly in math and science.
