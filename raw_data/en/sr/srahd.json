Through this article, we hope to clear your confusion at least to some extent. Here are a few characteristics which can help you differentiate these products: Ayurvedic Products - The word Ayurveda is derived from the Sanskrit language. It consists of two separate words - 'Ayu' which means life, and 'Veda' which means knowledge or science. These products are based on ancient medical sciences and the belief that diseases can be prevented or cured if we live in harmony with nature and the universe. Ayurvedic products make use of various herbs and may also make use of heavy metals like gold, silver, copper, sulphur, tin, mercury, or even some animal products. Natural Products - Products under this category are made with ingredients that are derived from nature such as minerals and plants. These products do not contain added synthetic fragrances, preservatives, or any other artificial additives. However, few chemicals are used during the growth of the raw materials for these natural products which include chemical fertilizers & pesticides. Herbal Products - These products are made up of extracts obtained from flowers, leaves, plants, etc. They can be used for the treatment of ailments and can also be considered as an alternative healing modality. Herbal products do not contain any kind of toxic chemicals or additives, but during the production of their raw materials, pesticides are sometimes used. The word 'Herbal' is basically derived from a book by the same name, which states the medicinal properties and usage of plants, leaves, flowers, etc. Organic Products - Organic products are made without the addition of any toxic chemicals such as herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides. These products are grown or made from raw materials which have been produced by organic agriculture methods. Most of the popular food items in the market today are termed as organic, but besides food, cosmetic products, garments, etc. can be found in this category, too. Organic ingredients are grown by using certain unique, approved methods which include cultural integration, ecological balance promotion and biodiversity conservation. Special, healthy and fertile soil is prepared for growing organic ingredients. In this soil, organic material such as compost is used.
