This year, our hybrid set up enables us to meet in -person thanks to the hospitality of the Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9 , enjoying at the same time the excitements of the City of Lig ht, Paris. As an international forum for generations of linguists , our Society is collectively devoted to analyz ing language through the development of experimental methods in Linguistics . We encourage new and established researchers to participate in and discuss developments in linguistic research and related experimental methodologies. It all began in 2006 in Athens , with the first ExLing Conference (at the time an International Speech Communication Association (ISCA) ExLing Workshop ). Subsequently, it w as hosted in cities such as Paris, Saint Petersburg, Heraklion, Lisbon and has been established since 2019 as the annual International Conference of Experimental Linguistics. ExLing 202 2 has a recurrent connection to Paris - this year marks our third conference here. We are excited to return to this wonderful city once more, this time with the added benefit of virtual conference attendance which opens new horizons and allows us to reach a wider audience. This volume includes the proceedings of ExLing 202 2. In addition to the main conference, ExLing 202 2 is hosting three special sessions encompassing diverse and energetic research domains focus ing on experimental methods and current topics in Experimental Phonetics, Language Education and Language Pathology. The l aunching of the Language Technology Exhibition presents a new aspect of the ExLing 2022 Paris conference, which is expected to unify diverse language applications and promote interdisciplinary advances in majo r areas of technological language aids. We would like to thank all ExLing 202 2 participants and our keynote speakers, Ann Bradlow, Edward Gibson, Frank Guenther, and Charles Hulme, as well as colleagues from the International Advisory Committee , and the Review and Organization Committee s for th eir contribution to the successful outcome of the Conference.

Bradlow , Northwester n University , USA https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract This presentation seeks links between speech tempo, information transmission rate and communicat ive efficien cy in conve rsations involving L2 participants . First, we show that L2 speech te mpo is influence d by both \"state\" and \"trait\" characteristic s. Specifically, while L2 spe ech is invari ably slower than L1 speech (L1 vs. L2 \"state\"), within biling ual individuals L1 rate is a significant predictor of L2 rate (individual \"trait\"). Next , we show that the slower rate of L2 speech (fewer syll ables/second) is comp ounded by lower L2 information density syllables /text) yielding a very low L2 informa tion trans mission rate (fewer bits of information transmi tted/secon d). Finally, we show variation in conversation -based cooperative task completio n time depend ing on degree of language background overlap betw een task part icipants . Together, these s tudies provide a scaffold for eventually linking acoustic level temporal variation to discourse le vel communicati ve efficiency in L2 speech communication. Keywords: bilingual speech communic ation ion features of speech com munication between interl ocutors from different l anguage background s is its relativ ely slow pace. At every st ep along the speech chain - from lexical selec tion to speech articulation to wo rd recognition - second-language (L2) speech production and percept ion proceed more slowly than first-language ( L1) speech production and perception . As a consequence, conversational int eractions in which one or both of th e partic ipants are L2 speaker s are generally less e fficient than interactions that include on ly L1 speakers . In this present ation, I will discuss a series of studies of the temporal domain of L2 speech with an emphasis o n its communicative consequence s. Specifical ly, these studies will show possible links between speech rate at the p honetic lev el, density of information coding at the semantic level, and communicative efficiency at the disc ourse level. \"State\" and \"trait\" characteristics in s peech tempo At the phonetic level, one of the m ost salient differences between L2 and L1 speech production is the reduced tempo of L2 speec h in terms of syllables produced per second. This reduced L2 speaking rate is well established across A.R. Bradlow 2 L1 and L2 talk ers of a giv en language as well as across langu ages within bilingual individuals (e.g. Guion et al, 200 0; Baese-Berk ). Moreover, slower L2 than L1 speaking rates have been demonstrated i n several L2s, including Spanish, French, Dutch, and German (Garc\u00eda Lecumber ri et al, 2017; De Jong 5; Trouvain & M\u00f6bius , 2014) . Data from a large corpus of bot h read and spontaneou s speech recordings in both the L1 and L2 of a group of bilingual individuals (n=86 ) from various language b ackgrounds (n=10) show that this language -general, group -level difference between L2 and L1 speaking r ates exhibits systematici ty at the individual t alker level . Usi ng automatically extracted speaking rate measurements (syllables/second) , a com parison of L 1 and L 2 speaking rates within indi vidual bilinguals revealed that, while speaking rate was always slo wer in L1 speech than in L2 speech, L1 speaking rate signif icantly predicted L2 speaking rate. That is, relatively fast or slow talkers in L1 were also r elatively fast or slow in L2, respe ctively. These results indicate a persistent influence of a talker -specific articulatory se tting, or \"trait\" characteristic, that combines with, rather than is overwhelmed by language dominance (i.e. a L1 ver sus L2 \"stat e\" characteristic) in the global te mporal structure of bilingual speech production (Bradlow et al, 201 7; see also De Jong et al , 2015 and Derwing et al, 2009) . This combination of \"trait\" and \"state\" characteristics in speech tempo suggests that infor matio n abo ut both talker -specificity (who is talking) and mode -specificity (L1 versus L1 speech mode) are available to listeners as part of the context for message i nterpretation. Indeed, studies of foreign -accented speech detection have shown that listeners can de termine whether an utterance was produced in L1 speech (i.e. sounds \"unaccented\") or L2 speech (i.e. sounds \"foreign -accented\") based on very short snippet s of speech in a known language (Flege, 1984 ) as well as in an unknown language (Major, 2007 ), sugges ting that listeners are sens itive to language -general , \"state\" characteristics of L2 speech eve n without knowledge of la nguage -specifi c phonetic contrasts. Moreover , studies of talker identification have shown that l isteners can identify specific bil ingua l talkers based on speech sa mples from both of their languages (e.g. Win ters et al, 2008) indicating that talker -specifi c \"trait\" characteristics are acces sible and potentially useful for listeners . Global speech tempo is very likely one of the acous tic dimensions that conveys this indexi cal information about the language \"state\" (L1 or L2) and talker \"trait\" (talker ident ity). Information transmission rate in L1 and L2 speech To explore t he communicative impact of the slow L2 tempo, we exami ned the relationship between speaking rat e (syllables/second) and information density (number of syll ables f or a given text) in L1 an d L2 recordings of a standard reading passage (NWS, North Wind and the Sun passage) in three languages, English, Fre nch, and Spanis h. This analysis followed the re asoning and approach of cross -language c omparisons indicat ing an in verse relationship Tempo, informatio n rate, and communicati ve effici ency in L2 speech 3 betwee n speak ing rate (syllables/second) and information density (number of speech un its for a given meaning) yielding relative cross -language consistency in information conveyed per second (information rate) (Coup\u00e9 et al, 2019) . Extend ing this approach to L2 speech , we see that L2 productions of the NWS passage in all three lang uages involved both slower rates and lower information densit y than their respective L1s. A f ollow -up comparison of the num ber of acoustic s yllables (intensity peaks in the signal) vers us orthographic syllables (dictionary -based counts of phonological syl lables in the text) indicated substantial syllable reduction for L1 speech (number of acoustic syllables < number of orthogr aphic syllables) in contrast to substantial of acoustic syllables > number of for L2 speech (L2 English and L2 French) or no reduction (L2 Spanish) . Thus, compared to L1 speech, L2 speech involved information -sparse syllables (i.e. more syllables were produc ed to convey the same meaning/text) as well as slower speaking rates (fewer syllables per second) yielding a very slow information transmission profile ( fewer bits of information conveyed per second) that, at an extreme , may fall o utside the optimal range for human information processing of dynamic signals (Bradlow, 202 2). Communicativ e efficien cy in a cooperative task Finally, to assess the impact of a language bar rier in a task with communicative intent rathe r than in decontextua lized, laboratory -based, monologue recordings, we compar ed task-complet ion time in a conversation -based, cooperative, picture -matching task, t he diapix task (Van Engen et al, 2010; Baker & Hazan, 2011) , across pairs of talkers representing various combinat ions of L1 and L2 talkers . These data showed that, while all pairs successfully completed the ta sk, L2 talke r pairs were substantially less e fficient than L1 talker pairs in terms of both task-completion time and number of word repetiti ons (word type -to- token ratio). However, th e L2 complet ion time disadvantage was mitigated when the L2 conversa tion partner s shared L1 as compared to L2 partner s from differe nt L1 backgrounds (Van Engen et a l, 201 0). Summary and c onclu sions Taken toge ther, these studies demonstrate an accumulation of time -related influences of a language barrier on speech communication. At the phonetic level, L2 speech is distin guished from L 1 speech by a slow tempo (fewer syllables per second ). Th is relatively slow L2 rate is compound ed by a relatively low L2 information density (less syllable -level reduction ) yielding a speech signal with a very low information r ate for a give n text/meaning . While a direct link between in formation rate at the phonetic level and comm unicative efficiency a t the discourse level rem ains elusive and is undoubtedly compounded by lexical, syntactic, and other linguistic and cognitive components of L2 speech produc tion and perception, we can specu late that the A.R. Bradlow 4 temporal character of L2 speech communication is not just a matter of global slowing but instead also involves a disti nctive pattern of information encoding .

ExLing 20 22 Paris : Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Speech rate and intelligibility of Arab Airlines' safety instructions Manal A ldhafe eri, Ghadi Al qahtani , Yahya Aldholmi Department of Linguistics & Translation Studies, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022 /13 Abstract We first a nalyze d and reported the speech rate (SR) of safety instructions (SIs) for n ine Arab airlines , includ ing Saudia, Flynas, Egypt Air, and Oman Air . EgyptAir had the slowest SR and Omani Air the fastest , a statistically significant diff erence (Kruskal - Wallis, p<0.001). Then, we assess ed the impact of normal and accelerated ( by 5%, 10% , on intelligibility evaluation ratings demonstrate d that intelligibility diminished to 48% at the original SR and to 7% at the 20% accelerated SR and that SR was a statistically significant factor (repeated -measures ANOVA, p<0.01). Arab airlines are advised to consider this finding and consult the International Civil Aviation Organizatio n on the recommended SR. Keywords : speech rate , speech intelligib ility, noise , safety instructions , Arab airlines Introducti on Within the plentiful scholarship on talker -listener interaction and speech intelligibility , the concept of speech rate (SR) has been examined consistently in numerous studies , yet experiments on SR combined with and/or compared to noise have been conduc ted only in a few such studies (e.g., Adams & Moore, 2009; Rosenhouse & Kishon -Rabin, 2003; Rosenhouse et al., 2006) . The aim of these studies was to probe and unde rstand the impact both of product ion conditions (i.e., SR) and list ening condition s (i.e., n oise) separately and collectively on intelligibility . Among such diverse conditions are aircrafts and air traffic control (ATC) tow ers, which are two critical envir onments for intelligibility (and safety) . Taylor and colleagues ( 1994) reported that SR exerts a negative impact on aircraft pilots' ability to execute simulated ATC instructions , while Nitta and colleagues (2018) observed that American ATC officers who were native speakers of English did not slow their SR when communicat ing with nonnative pilots . The current study adds to the existing literature , first, by establishing a baseline for the SR (syllable s per second [sps]) of s afety instructions (SIs) for nine Arab airlines ( e.g., Saudia, Fly nas), and, second , by assessing th e impact of SR in noise o n intelligibility evaluation . The finding s should enhance our understanding of the interplay between SR and noise and its pertinenc e to intelligibility, especially in Arabic, a language that presen tly suffers a scarcity of studies on speech rate (e.g., Aldholmi et al., 2021a). M. Aldhafeeri , Gh. Alqahtani , Y. Aldholmi 6 Part I: SR analysis of SIs Method s We obtained YouTube video clips containing Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) SIs for nine Arab airlines (Saudi a [S], Flynas [N], Qatar Airways [Q], Oman Air Emirates Airlines [Em], Egypt Air [Eg], Royal Jordanian [J]) and Royal Air Maroc [M], representing four major Arabic Arabian Egypto -Sudanic, Levantine, and Maghrebi Arabic . We made efforts to select only clips that appeare d to be original , complet e, and unnoisy. We then extracted .WAV audio from each clip , segmented and syllabified the sentences, and removed long pauses. The pause removal process was based o n a criterion of 200 ms and guide d by pause classification and meth odological consideration in previous research (e.g., Sakamoto et al. , 2018; Tanka et al. , 2011). Finally, SR was calculated according to the equation below. Equation 1. . Resu lts The analysis of 485 sentences containing SIs yielded that Egypt Air had the slowest SR ( Median = 5.8 sps , Mean = 5.8 sps ) whereas Omani Air had the fastest ( Media n = 7.1 sps , Mean = 6.9 sps ). The SR medians for the other airlines (Figure 1A) range d betw een 6.0 sps (Mean = 5.9) and 6.7 sps (Mean = 6.9). A Kruskal -Wallis test show ed a statistica lly significant difference between the medians for all airlines, H(8) = 91.495, p<0.001 . in Figure 1B, t he compar isons reveal ed (a) that all diffe rences among Gulf airlines , with the exception of the difference be tween Oman Air and Qatar Airw ays, were not st atistically significant, p>0.05 ; and (b) that the statistically significant differences occurred between EgyptA ir or Royal Air Maroc and most other airlines, p<0.05 , but not bet ween EgyptAir and Royal Air Maroc, p>0.05.

Speech rate and intelligibility of Arab Airlines' safety instructions 7 Part II: SR and intelligibility of SIs in Noise Methods Twenty i mpera tive SIs were randomly selected f rom the S audi Airlines ( Saudia 's in a male voice and Flynas 's in a female voice) and aurally presented in a random order to 54 Saudi participants at the original SR (6.5 sps ) and at an accelerated rate of the just -noticeabl e-difference ( JND) level 5% (see ons by 10%, 15%, and 20% . As in similar previous studies Aldholmi, 2021b), t he PSOLA (Pitch -Synchronous Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2022 ) was used for the acceleration process . All sentence s were first normalized at 60 dB and then mixed with a passenger -boarding noise at -6 dB and resampled at 44100 hz. Fifty-four (22 male and 32 female) Saudi native speakers of Arabic (age, Mean = 30.6 SD = 6.8) used the online platform Phonic (Phonic, 2022 ) to rate the intelligibility of each sentence on a scale from zero to 100 (zero = completely unintelligible, 100 = completely intelligible) . The participants were allowed to listen to each stimulus as many times as they wi shed, but no sentence appeared in more tha n one condition to each participant. Results The results showed that, in the simulated aircraft boarding noise, (a) the intelligibi lity diminished to 48% at the original SR and to 7% at the 20% accelerated SR (Figure 2B) and (b) that SR was a sta tisticall y significant factor (repeated -measures in intelligibility rating . Pairwise multiple comparisons revealed that the differences between every two pairs of SR conditions were statistical ly significant, p<0.05, with the exception of the comparison betwee n 15% Acc and 20% Acc, p = 0.847 (Figure 2A) .

Aldhafeeri , Gh. Alqahtani , Y. Aldholmi 8 Conclusion Most Arab airlines seem to have a fast SR , especially considering that SIs are meant for both native and nonnative passeng ers. Most SR medians exceed ed the average reported for Saudi, Egyp tian, and Moroc can dialect s (e.g., Aldholmi et al., 2021 b; Vaane, 1982). A median SR of 6.1 sps for English A TC officers has been described as a worrying and unsafe SR (Nitta et al., 2018). The results also show ed that a slight increment in SR coupled with noise can lead to a large decreme nt in intelligibility rating. Should Arab airlines be apprised of this finding, they should consult the International Civil Aviation Organization on the rec ommended SR and collaborate on fu rther research in this regard .

ExLing 20 22 Paris : of Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Variable Adaptat ion of /v/ and /t/ in English Loanwords in Saudi Arabic Areej Alenazi , Sam Hellmuth Language and Linguistic Science, University of York, UK https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract This study seeks to exp lore the impact of the input modality, language exposure, context , and gender on the production patterns of two non -native sounds, /t/ and /v/, in Saudi Arabic. A production task was conducted to test 67 Saudi speakers in three conditio ns: aural -only (auditory inputs) -written (auditory -orthographic inputs) . Language exposure had a main e ffect on the production of the two sounds . Context was a major factor influencing the production accuracy of /v/ but not /t /; /v/ was more likely to be devoiced in word - final position. The written input resulted in a decrease in the production accuracy fo r /t/but not /v/ , suggesting that the effect of the input type varies for different non - native sounds. Keywords: borrowing , variable adaptation, input modality, language exposure Introduction When one language borrows a word from another language, a no n-native sound may be preserved or substituted (e.g., Kang et al. 2016). This means that substitution does n't necessarily occ ur when a sound doesn't exist in the na tive language. Previous studies of English loanwords in Arabic (e.g., Al -Athwary, 2017) show ed variations between speakers in the production of /t / and /v/: /t/ was either preserved or replaced by / /; /v/ was sometimes preserved and sometimes replaced b y /f/. Prior research has attributed these variations to Arabic phonology, but less attention has been paid to the role of perception or orthograp hy. Research on L2 acquisition suggests that the input modality ( with acoustic and/or orthographic information) in which a lexical item is initially encountered can influence the production of non -native sounds, especially if they are realised differently or do not occur in the native language (e.g., Bassetti, 2017). The production patterns of non -native sounds may thus vary with how borrowers are first exposed to a source word. In this study, we consider the possible impact of input modality and a range of other factors (context, gender, and level of English exposure) on production accuracy of the two sounds. A. Alenazi , S. Hellmuth 10 Methodology The participants were 67 Saudi speakers, split by gender (31 male/ 36 female) and level of English exposure (high/medium/ low). Adapting the design of Vendelin and Peperkamp (2006 ), in this study, participants' oral productions of target words were elicited in three conditions: aural -only, written -only and aural-written. In aural condition , they heard non -words pronounced by a n English native speaker, and in written condition they saw the word on screen. In aural -written condition, they heard the non -words wh ile viewing the written forms on screen. Gorilla ( https://gorilla.sc ) was used to present stimuli and record participants' responses. The stimuli were 24 CVCVC non -words with target segments embedded in three positions: i nitial, intervocalic and final. The vowels were held constant with /\u00e6/ in the first syllable and / / in the second syllable. In each condition, participants were requested to produce six non - words twice. Written stimuli were presented in English orthography, with /v/ spelled with the letter <v> and /t / with the digraph <ch>; / \u00e6/ was spelled with <a> a nd // with <i>. Recordings of auditory stimuli were produced by a female native speaker of British Engli sh, normalised to the same intensity level (75 dB). Participants' productions were auditorily coded as one of either [v~f] or [~t], by the first auth or, with reference to the waveform and spectrogram in Praat. Results Mixed effects logistic regression models were run for each target segment to estimate the probability of the binary outcome based on the different predictors. Figures 1 -2 visualise the predicted probability of substitution for each target. Overall, production accuracy (i.e. preservation of the loan segment) was lower for /v/ than / t/. Language exposure had a main effect on the production accuracy of /v/; the high exposure group ( = -2.1889, SE = 0.4171, z = -5.247, p = 1.54e -07 ***) and the medium exposure group ( = - 1.0199, SE = 0.4059, z = -2.513, p = 0.01198 *) are each signifi cantly different from the low exposure group. There was also a main effect of context: /v/ was more likely to be produced in both word -initial context ( - 1.5524, SE =0.4960, z = - 3.130, p = 0.00175 **) and wor d-intervocalic context ( - 0.8802, SE = 0.43 16, z = -2.040, p = 0.04139 *). Female participants showed higher production accuracy than male participants for /v/ ( -1.9756 (SE = 0.4181, z = -4.725, p = 2.30e -06 ***) as well as an interaction of gender with condition ( = 1.2801, SE = 0.4087, z = 3.13 2, p = 0.00174 **), whereby male participants were less likely to produce /v/ when ever aural input is available. The performance of the female participants did not differ between conditions. Input modality had a main effect on production accuracy of /t /. The results showed that /t/ was less likely to be produced in the aural -written condition ( =1.1494, SE = 0.3543, z = 3.245, p = 0.00118 **) and in the written condition Adaptation of /v/ and /t/ in English Loanwords in Saudi Arabic 11 ( = 3.1923, SE = 0.3534, z = 9.033, p = < 2e -16 ***) than in the aural condition. The effect of language exposure was also significant; the high exposure group differed significantly from the low exposure group ( = - 2.4332, SE = 0.6027, z = -4.037, p = 5.4e -05 **). The productio n accuracy of /t/ was not affected by context or gender . Figure 1. Predicted probability of [f] production in target non -words by context, group (level of language exposure), condition and gender. Figure 2. Predicted probability of [ ] production i n target non-words by context, group (level of language ex posure) , condition and gender . Discussion The influence of level of English exposure is most evident in how input condition contributes differently to the production of /v/ and / t/. Overall, as already noted, the presence of written -only input supported t he production accuracy of /v/, but this effect was greater with more exposure to English. Participants in the high exposure group were more likely to utilize the orthographic infor mation whereas written -only input had reduced impact on production for the p articipants in the low exposure group. In contrast, the A. Alenazi , S. Hellmuth 12 absence of aural input resulted in lower production accuracy for /t/, though participants in the high exposure group had th e highest production accuracy in written condition, perhaps as they are more familiar with English orthography. These results contrast with some previous studies which found that orthographic input along with auditory input can improve production accuracy of non -native sounds (e.g., Davidson, 2010), but are in line with other studies which showed that orthographic input accompanying auditory input is not helpful (e.g., Vendelin and Peperkamp, 2006 ). It is worth noting that target /t/ was spelled as <ch> i n the stimuli, which in English can represent not only/t / but also/ / and even /k/ (e.g., chair, chef, and character). This spelling inconsistency contrasts with the transparency of Arabic orthography where one letter represents on e sound. Context influen ced production of /v/ but not /t/: participants were more likely to replace /v/ with [f] in word -final position. It is worth noting that the final /v/ was partially devoiced in the auditory stimuli, which is a feature of English wo rd-final fricatives, so /v/ was even more similar to the participants' closest native sound /f/ in word -final position. The source of devoicing in the participants' own productions cannot be attributed to their native language since has a word -final voicin g contrast Thus markedness , than native language transfer, may have influence d participants' production of /v/ (Eckman,1991). In conclusion, the findings demonstrate a primary role of language exposure in influencing variable ada ptation of loan segments ; participants with high English exposure were more likely to produce target -like /v/ and / t/. Nevertheless, a ll participants, regardless of level of English exposure, struggled with production of /v/ in word -final context. Finally , written input supported production accuracy for /v/ but not for /t /, suggesting that the effect of the input type (auditory, written, or both) varies for different non -native sounds.

ExLing 20 22 Paris : Proce edings of Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Using entropy to determine vowel space s Terese Anderson1, Grandon Goertz2 1Health Sciences Center , University of New Mexico , US 2Educational Linguistics, College of Education & Human Sciences, University of New Mexico , US https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract Vowel spaces are often illustrated with the first and second formants plotted against each other on X -Y plots. The numerical values of vowel F1, F2, and F3 were ev aluated using Pearson correlations and results often show inconsistencies, indicating that some F1-F2 plots might not provide the best vowel space depiction. The same formant values were examined using condi tional entropy methodology and determinations we re made which formants should be the independent X variable, and which formants should be the dependent Y variable for plotting. This research describes the examination of relationships between formants to d etermine optimal, more accurate vowel space plot s. Keywords: vowel space, entropy, correlation, formant Introduction Formant values are traditionally plotted on an X -Y vowel space diagram to show how the formant values are related to each other (Story & Bunton, 2017). This research investigates how F1, F2, and F3 values compare. This research is motivated by two research questions: Are vowel space plots a viable method to display depict vowel characteristics ? A second research question i s: Is it pos sible to measure the relationship between formants, prior to plotting, and determine which formant plots would produce optimal results and which plots would not be the best for comparison purposes? Correlations of vowel formant s The speech data for this research comes from three sources : 1) Linguists provide e xamples of the 28 IPA vowels on several academic websites (see references) and a total of 112 vowel examples were used in this evaluation. 2) A total of 908 CVC and CV words read by native English sp eakers (two female, 1 male) using a R\u00f8de N microphone in a GretchKen Industries acoustic sound booth. 3) The third portion of the speech data was 426 speech tokens from 29 languag es downloaded from the IPA and UCLA website s. All vowels and vowel portion s of the words were evaluated using PRAAT (standard settings of 5,500 Hertz ceiling and 5 formants), to produce F1, F2, and F3. Formants were them evaluated using Pearson correlation methods. T. Anderson , G. Goertz 14 Correlations varied widely for the 112 vowels found that approxi mately 15% have strong correlations and 50% hav e low or negative correlations. Many correlations indicated F1 -F3 formants would be preferable. The word list correlations varied from very low values such as -0.263 (man) and -0.067 (key) to higher values 0.901 (pet) and 0.842 (put). Some F1 -F3 correlations were found to be stronger than F1 -F2 correlations . The correlations for the tokens of the 29 languages also varied from very low to high values and did not support a general F1 -F2 plotting scheme. Correlations did not produce clear indications for vowel space plotting, prompting the investigation to the suitability of conditional entropy. Conditional entropy for vowel formant pairs Conditional entropy was developed from Information Theory . Entropy is used to detect patterns in data, and to establish their relationship s by providing numerical value s that shows their relative degree of over lapping information (see MacKay 2003, Haglund, Jeppsson, & Str\u00f6mdahl 2010, Goodfellow et al. 2016). Conditional entropy is the amount of data needed for one variable to describe another variable: their suitability for plotting one against the other. The conditional entropy was calculated with the Mutual Info 0.9 cross -platform program package (Peng 2002) operating in Matlab . Results The entropy data shows which formant is the independent variable (X) and which formant is the dependent variable (Y) for plotting . Table 1. Entropy values of vowel portions of speech samples. Data from female speakers are indicat ed in italics. The Bulgarian word translates to 'five' and the Czec h word svtlo translates to 'light'. Other words are English. kid boat cot out nem /\u00e6/ ship 0.3419 0 0 The left bolded column shows the six pairs of the formants that were compared for the analysis. F1F2, for example, is notation for the test of the suitability of F1 as the dependent variable and F2 as the independent variable. Lower entropy values show better suitability for vowel space plotting. In the case of 'kid', plotting F2 -F3 would provide optimal results. ' Boat' and ' cot' Using entropy to determine vowel spaces 15 indicate the dominance of F2. The res ults for 'out' shows that F1 should be plotted on the X -axis. The zero values of nem shows that F2 and F3 are independent, svtlo shows that F3 is the independent variable, and the UCLA vowel /\u00e6/ spoken in isolation shows that F2 is the independent variable. Ship data, having all zero values, indicates that the vowel formant s are combined or related to each other. Some vowel formant pairs have zero entropy values as seen in the four right columns of Tabl e 1. Conditional entropy has a uniqu e defined mathematical property: if and only if condit ional entropy is equal to zero then the value of one variable (dependent) is a direct function of the input variable (independent). This property was noted in samples taken from both male and female speakers, and sometimes does not appear consistently in words that speakers repeated words. These zero or near zero values mean that two formants are linked and perhaps one formant generates the other. Rather than being d istinct formants, the two zero formants could be considered a combined wide band of formants. Summary Conditional entropy determine s which formants would be most accurately displayed on the x -axis and which formant would be plotted on the y -axis. In some cases, F2 -F3 or F3 -F2 plots w ould convey more complete information than F1 -F2 plots. Assumptions about vowel depictions may have to be modified, according to entropy data that defines the appropriate X -Y vowel space plot. The discovery of zero entrop y values of some formant pairs s hould be investigated further. Hopefully additional research will show if zero value formant pairs should be plotted against each other, or against a third value. References Goodfellow, I ., Bengio, Y., Courville , A. 2016 .

The possible asymmetry in performance between Subject -Gap (SG) and Object-Gap (OG) relatives was also exam ined and an error analysis was conducted . The results indicate d that DS individuals encounter diffic ulties in both comprehending and producing RCs compared to Typically Developing Children (TDC) , as well as that both groups performed significantly better in SG than in OG relatives and presented the same pattern of error types . The same pattern of perform ance observed gives support to the hypothesis that language development in DS could be characteri zed as more delayed than deviant . Keywords: Down Syndrome, relative clauses, language development, delay hypothesis Introduction Many cross -linguistic studies focus on the language development of individuals with DS and characteri ze it as either delayed or deviant compared to that of typical population . However, most of them conclude that morphosynta x is severely impaired in this population (Katsarou & Andreou 2022). For the Greek language , very few studies to date have been conducted that have examined morphosynt actic phenomena in this impaired population. The purpose of this study is to investigate both the comprehension and production of RCs by Greek -speaking individuals with DS and to compare their performance to that of mentally age -matched peers . In particular, it was examined whether the individuals with DS comprehend and produce RSs in the same way as the TDC, as well as the asymmetry in their performance between SG and OG relatives , an issue which is studied in typical and atypical populations (McKee & McDaniel 2001; Stavrakaki 2001). Moreover, a detailed error analysis has been conducted. Methodology Participants 15 Greek -speaking individuals with DS a ged from 9 to 37 with moderate retardation participated in the current study. In addition, a control group of G. Andreou , E. Chartomatsidou 18 TDC aged from 6 to 7 years , without any report ed learning or neurological disabilities , also participated in the study . The two groups were matche d on mental ages through Raven and WAIS -IV tests , as well as on the raw scores of two subtests which assess their expressive language skills , namely the Action Picture Test (T -value= -1,88, p=0,071) and their receptive v ocabulary, namely the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (T-value= -0,89, p=0,383). Detailed information of the participants and scores on language tests is presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation ( SD) in Table 1. Table 1. Participant information and scores on the language tests for the examined groups . DS group (N=15) Cntrl. group (N=15) were conducte d. The first experimental task was an elicited production task with twenty trial sentences (10 Subject -10 Object relatives) . The second experiment was a picture selection task with twenty trial sentences on five RC types: Subject head -Subject gap (SS), Subject head -Object gap (SO), Object head -Subject gap (OS) , Object head -Object gap (OO ) and Object Object gap with clitics (OOcl) . Resul ts Descriptive statistics analysis revealed that t he mean correctness score of the DS group is statistically significant lower (Production = 2,86, SD 1,46/Comprehension = 8,93 SD 2,22) than that of the TDC for both tasks (Production = 17,67, SD 2,32/ Compr ehension = 15,87, SD 1,68). Since the data w ere not normally distributed non -parametric tests were e mployed. Mann - Whitney U Test analysis revealed a highly significant difference between the two groups ' median scores on p roduction (3,000 19,000, p=0.000 ) and on comprehension (9,000 16,000, p=0.000) . TDC showed almost equal performance in the median scor es of the two tasks (p=0,0310 ), while the DS participants showed higher performance in the comprehension task than in the producti on one (p=0.000 ). Regarding the production task , both groups showed better performance in subject RCs than in object RCs. However, there was a statistically significant difference between the two types of RCs only in the DS group ( p=0,0006 ), while TDC did nificant difference ( p=0,1524 ). On Relative clauses in Down Syndrome 19 the other hand , in the comprehension task , examin ing the SG (SS+OS relatives) and OG (SO+OO relatives) asymmetry, we found tha t both groups comprehend the SG relatives better than the OG re latives (DS p=0,0001 / TDC p=0,0001 ). One way ANOVA revealed that the TDC exhibited the highest level of performance in OS ( M=0,267 SD=0,458) an d SS ( M=0,467 SD=0,516) SD=0,775) and OO (M=0,800 SD=0,561) relati ves. The DS group exhibited the highest level of performance in SS ( M=1,133 SD=0,743) and OS ( M=1,933 M=2,400 SD=0,632) relatives . error analysis has been conducted in order to exami ne the pattern of the responses of the two groups. In the production task we noticed that both groups presented the same patte rn of errors. DS participants preferred to produce main clauses (Subject RCs: M= 2,733 SD=0,884 / RCs: M=3,000 SD=1,134 ) instead of the RCs and also made reversal errors ( Subject RCs: M=0,333 SD=0,488/ Object RCs: M=0,667 SD=0,617) . In the comprehension task we noticed that in SS and OO RCs the most frequent error in the DS group is the reversal error (M=0,600 S D=0,507 / M=1,200 SD=0,676 ) is the agent error, while in OOcl the p ercentage is the same for and agent errors (M=1,067 SD=0,704) . TDC presented the same pattern of e rror types in the examined RCs categories . Discussion The results indicate that DS individuals encounter difficulties both in comp rehend ing and producing RCs, as they performed at a significant lower level than the TDC . The DS group performed better in the comprehension task than in the production, while TDC performed almost equally well in both tasks. Moreover, both groups performed significantly better in SG relatives than in OG relatives , with the overall performance of the DS group being at a lower level in both tasks . The same pattern of performance observed in both groups , as well as the same pattern of errors produced gives sup port to the hypothesis that language development in DS could be characterized as more delay ed than deviant. Our findings are i n line with previous cross -linguistic studies the results of which revealed difficulties with RCs on the part of individuals with DS (Stathopoulou 2007 , Witecy & Penke 2017 ). As the RC construction has not been extensively studied yet, especially in the Gr eek language , our findings help to fill in this research gap . However, more research is needed in this field in G. Andreou , E. Chartomatsidou 20 order to elucidate further the delay hypothesis especially in the morphosyntactic domain and unders tand the kind of difficulties Greek speaking individuals with DS present so as to help them improve the ir morphosyntactic abilities.

ExLing 20 22 Paris : Proce edings of Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Evaluation and reading time of predicate agreement with conjuncts Daria B elova Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics , Lomonosov Moscow University , Russian Federat ion ntific and Educational Systems, Artificial Intelligence\" , Russian Federat ion https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract This paper aims to investigate possible patter ns of predic ate agreement wi th coordinated pronominal subjects i n Russ ian. We have conducted two experiments to examine the effect of two fact ors on acceptability and reading time of different verbal forms , namely : the order of conjuncts exhibiting differe nt grammatic al features ('1sg - 2sg' or '2sg - 1sg') and the order of subject and verb (SV O or OVS). Th e experiment al results showed the diffe rences in the agreement patterns related to the word order as the respondents more often allowed the le ss frequent ly encounter ed closest adjun ct agreement in OVS-stimuli than in e Subject Strategi es of a greement with coordinated subject With respect to phi -features, a coordinated subject may conta in mor e than o ne value , therefore, there is a need for some sort of a strateg y for choosing the form of an agreeing predicate . Three bas ic strategies are describ ed in the literature. The first one is resolution: the value is calculated depending on w hat values t he conjuncts hav e. For example, the person feature can be cho sen based on the person hierarchy (Zwicky 1997 ); in the mean time, the number feature can be simply copied from the one that the coordinate phrase has, which is always plural. The s econd str ategy is partia l agreement: a predicate gets all th e values from on e of the conjuncts , for example , the linear ly closest ( closest conjun ct agreement , CCA (Al Khalaf 20 15)), and the sec ond conjunct is ign ored. Finally, if none of these strategies is a pplied, the default agreemen t can appear as a last resort op tion (Nevins, Weisser 2018 ). Predicate agreement with coordinate d subje cts has also been investigated by means of the experimenta l methods, mainly speech production ones, and great variability has been observ ed, cf. (Timmerm ans et al. 2004 ) for German and Dutch and ( Marui et al. 2015 ) for Slovenian. Russian prescriptive grammars provi de only one strategy of person al agreement with a coordinate d subject - the one that is based o n the person hierarchy . However, corpus researc h show that the CCA in person and gender D. Belov a 22 is possi ble and facilitate d by the postverbal subject position (Corbe tt 1985). Taking in to consideration the experimenta l findings in other languages , we suppose that the acceptability of different perso n agreement strategies in Russian should be experim entally in vestigated. Researc h design Two experiments that differ in the word order of stimuli (SVO and OVS) were conducted using the 1-7 Likert scal e and the self-paced reading task. Both experiments shared the same lexicalizations and the 4\u00d72 AJ experiment al desig n that featured two ind ependent v ariables: the verb form represen ting all three agreement strategies (1pl, 1sg/2sg, and 3pl , all in non -past tense ) and the conjunct order (ja i ty 'me and you' and ty i ja 'you and I' ). Each experiment consisted of eig ht experimental list s conta ining 32 target stimuli and 32 grammatic al and ungrammatical fillers . In (1) one can see th e stimuli structures of the SV O and VS O experiments respect ively. (1) a. [ja i ty / ty i ja ] V Obj P NP b. Obj P NP V [ja i ty / ty i ja ] Results: the ratings The results of the acceptability judgment task are presented in fig.1 below. All the ratings were z-transformed and then st atistically processed with the use of linear mixed model ing (LMM) and a posterior Tukey 's HSD test. The SVO ID as random effect (form ula: ~1 | id). The model's total explanatory power is substantia l (conditional R2=0.42) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.39. The pai rwise comparison s show the significant difference betw een all four verb forms: 1pl i s rated highest , followed by 3pl, 1sg, and 2sg. There is no difference between two c onjunct orders within each verb form (the blue and the green line s in the plot ). The OVS -experiment involved 126 conj unct_order * verb_ form ) included respondent 's ID and sentence ID as random effects (formula: (~1 | i d) + (~1 | sentenc e_id)). model's total expl anatory power is substantial (condi tional R2 = 0.39) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.28. The conjunct order is significant for 1sg and 2sg but not for 1pl and 3pl . The ov erall low level of the target ratings in co mparison to the grammatica l fillers we relate to a pragmatically unusual context of the s timuli. Given th at, the supe riority of the r esolution form 1pl is obvious . In the mean time, the CCA in the OVS -order is observed : the conjunct order '1sg - 2sg' is rated higher when followin g the 1sg verb form, and the same is true fo r the 2sg forms. The non-partia l agreement strateg ies are rated the same independe ntly of the conju nct order or the word order. Evaluation and reading time of predicate agreement with conjuncts 23 Figure 1. Normalized r atings from SVO & OVS experiments by the verb form. Results: the reading time The starting hyp othes es concerning the self-paced read ing componen t of the experiments w ere the following: (i) in the SVO -experiment th e verb form s differ ing from the basic 1pl would be re ad slower ; (ii) in the OVS -experim ent the first conjunct mismatching the verb person feature would be re ad slowe r than the matching on e. Neither of the se predictions is borne out b y the results . In the SVO - experiment the pa irwise comparison with the use of the Student 's t-test does not show any differ ences in the reading time of verbs between the two conjunct orders for any o f the verb f orms. In the VSO -experiment there is no dif ference found in the reading time of first nor secon d conjuncts, however, conjunc tions are read faster when the conjunct order is ja i ty for the stimuli with every verb form exc ept the 2sg , see shows that alth ough different forms are clearly on different levels of acce ptability, they all take the same amount of time to read and pro cess. In turn, the OVS-experiment was presumabl y more li kely to demo nstrate the signs of the reanalysis . The alternative h ypoth esis, leading to other predictions, is that it is only after the first conju nct that a reader starts processing the who le coordina ted phrase . In the st imuli with the singular verb forms where the v erb stand s close to the matching pronoun the conjunction i should be read slower because this pronoun can constitute a subje ct by itself. Meanwhile, in the stimuli with the plural verb forms , there should be no such pattern as the second pronou n is needed to match the verb number . Since this hypothesis is not conf irmed either, the most suitable explanation for the data seems to be methodological. The pronouns ja and ty and the conjun ction i are monosyllable and overall short words , which were pr esented sepa rately, and it coul d influence a reader 's pace of passin g the experiment. D. Belov a 24 Figure 2. The mean reading time (in ms) of each element in OVS -stimuli . Conclusion All three agreement s trategies (person hierarchy resolution, CCA , and default agreem ent) are pos sible in Russian in th e sense that they all are rated highe r than the ungrammatical fillers. The postverbal subject position does indeed facilitate th e partial agreement strategy compared to the preverbal position , hence, the previous conclusio ns based on the co rpus data are confirmed . Another interesting result i s the acceptability of the default a greement w hich is even higher than the partial agreement.

Unlike adults, children derive few AEs w ith double negation in Minnie nu a putut s nu coac o p izza \"Minnie was not able not to bake a pizza\". Keywords: first language, actuality ent ents (AEs) inferences a ble to do Y\" to \"X did Y\". A sentence such as Minnie could make a cake is ambiguous in English between (i) an abili ty reading (\" She was able to\"), and (ii) an implicative reading (\"She actually did it\"). Such readings have been c onsidered either (a) semant ic interpretations ( Mari, Martin 2007, Mari 2015), arising Hacquard 2020), arising from the interaction with aspect (i.e., AEs ar ise only with perfective aspect i n Romance). In the current paper, we examine AEs in child and adult Romanian, where AEs have not b een investigated. We look at how children interpret sentences conta ining a main verb such as a putea 'can' followed by another predicate, when in interaction with negation or double negatio n (DN) , e.g. \"Bucle Aurii s pune: a s nu coac o p izza. Donald se \u00eentreab : A copt Minnie o p izza?\" (\"Goldilocks says: Minnie was able to bake a pizza . Donald wonders: Did Minnie bake a pizza? \"). Previous studies on (related) telicity /completion entailments indicate an adult-like (Stoicescu , atures (Novec k 2001, Stoicescu et al. 2015) show that 5 -year-olds derive fewer implicatures than adults in trut h value judgmen t tasks (TVJTs), t hough there is task variation. Consequently, if AEs S. Bilea, A.C. Bleot u 26 are semantic, we expect adult -like rates of AEs in ch ildren, while , if they are pragmatic, we expect fewer AEs. Regarding negation, previous studies suggest that DN is challenging for children (Thorn ton et al. 2016, Tagliani 2019). Thus, we expect Romanian children to have dif ficulties with DN in Romanian, a negati ve concord language , where DN is interpreted as negative in meaning . Methodology Participants The st udy involved 40 native Romani an speakers: a test group consisting of 20 pre-school children between age s 5 and 6 (Mean age : 5;5) , recruited from a kindergarten in Buc hares t, and a control group of 20 adu lts betwe en 24 and 37 (Mea n age: 33), of various academic backgrounds . Procedure The experimen t involved a tr uth-value judgement task , where participants had to help Donald figure out what Goldiloc ks was sayin g about other Disney characters : e.g., \"Bucle Aurii spune: Minnie nu a putut s nu coac o pizza . Donald se \u00eentreab : A copt Min nie o p izza?\" (\"Goldilocks says: Minnie was a ble to bake a pizza. Donald wonders: Did Minnie bake a pizza? \"). Participants could answer with Yes/No/ I don't know . The task employed 16 cri tical items in 4 conditions : Affirmative ( Minni e a putut s \"Minnie wa s able to \"), Negate d Main Verb ( Minni e nu a putut s to\"), Negated Verbal Complement ( Minni e a putut s nu \"Minnie was able not to \"), DN (Minnie nu a putut s nu \"Minnie was not able not to \"). The test condition s employed the implicati ve verbs a putea (\"be able to \") and a reui (\"manage to \") followed by creation verbs (e.g., a face, \"to make \") and change of state verbs (e.g. a strica, \"break \"). There w ere also 16 control items preventing a possible yes-bias. All ite ms were used with perfective aspec t to encourag e AEs . Results Just like adults, children interpreted affirmative sentences as giving rise to AEs, while they gave a negative interpretation to sentences in the Negated Main Verb condition and in the Nega ted Verbal Complement con dition. Howev er, while adults mostly interpreted DN affirmatively, deriving AEs, children mostly interpreted it negatively. The statistical data were fitted into a generalized linear -mixed (logit) model (glmer) with Answer as the Dep endent V ariable (coded as 1 if accu rate, and 0 otherwise ), Age as fixed effect and rando m slope s per Item and Participan t. There was a significant difference between Groups only for DN (\u00df = 0.08043, SE = 0.0250 6, Z = 3.209, p < .01). Romanian children are not able not to derive actuality entailments 27 Figure 1. Rate of accurate answers (with SE) per group. Legend: AFF=Affirmative, ment, DN= Double negation Discussion The current study shows that 5-year-old Romanian children are adult -like in their ability to derive AEs (\"X did Y \") with implicativ e verbs in the aff irmative condition and their ability to derive t he opposite inference (\"X did not do Y \") in conditions involving one single negation (either on the main verb or on the complement) . If AEs were sim ilar to some not all implicatur es, then we would have expected them to derive fewer such inferen ces than adults, s ince children are known to have difficulties with some not all implicatures (Noveck , 2001, Stoicesc u et al. , 2015). However, we find the oppo site result . Children 's ease with AEs suggests th at AEs are best treated either as a semantic inference, which cannot be cancelled, or as a type of pra gmatic implicature different from \"some, n ot all \", perhaps of a more conventionalized natur e (Bhat t, 1999). Nevertheless, c hildren may have us ed dif ferent cognitive strategies than adults when agreeing with a sentence , such as premature closure , i.e., the tendency to choose one alternative out of several (Ozturk & Papafragou , . Regarding DN, our pre diction that child ren will not derive AEs in DN contexts is met. Interestingly, children's fail ure with AEs in DN contexts is not because of an inability to handle AEs, but because of interpreting DN negati vely rather than affir matively . This line wi th a general cross-linguistic negative -concord preference in child language . Conclusion Our study represent s the first experimental study on AEs in child languag e in Roman ian. We find that, just like adults, children are able to de rive AEs in the affirmati ve and the o pposit e inferences in the negative , when negati on is either on the impli cative or on its complement . However, unlike adults, children are unable to interpret DN affirmatively and, consequently , they do not derive AEs in these contexts. Thus, c hildren are at a developmental stage where they are not fully adult -like with resp ect to DN and entailment readings in suc h contexts . Further research is needed to clarify the exact semantic /pragmatic nature of AEs. S. Bilea, A.C. Bleot u 28 References Bhatt, R . A., Gotzner , Shadow -playing with Romanian 5 -year-olds.

ExLing 20 22 Paris : Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Language envi ronmental analysis (LENA) of three Cypriot G reek-speaking children Binos , Kakia Petinou Department of Rehabilitation , Cyprus University of Technology , Cyprus https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract This is the first study that explores t he qua ntity and quality of language input in Cypriot Greek -speaking families using highly specialised software. The purpose of this longitudinal case study was to record, analyse and evaluate the longitudinal c hanges in conversational turns, input and part icipan t vocalisations in C ypriot Greek -speaking families using the computerised LENA (Language Environment Analysis) software. The study involved two typically developing children (TD) and a child with a Langua ge Disorder (LD). TDs' performance and languag e inpu t confirmed the norm s of typically developing scores of the LENA system. In contrast, LD differed quantitatively and qualitatively from the mean number of CVC and CTC. The mean numbers of LD measured belo w the < 25th percentile in any measurement and the qu antity of language input. Recent research supports the findings of the present study. Keywords: LENA, language input, vocalisation, prelinguistic, language disorder Introduction LENA system is a new tool combining a wearable audio recorder with automated vocal analysis soft ware (LENA Research Fo undation, 2014). LENA was developed to overcome the difficulties in obtaining data from young children and conducting detailed analyses of language samples. LENA system investigates various linguistic aspects (Gree et al., 2016 ). Recently, Wang et al. (2020) reported a statistically reliable correlation between adults' words and children's language skills. Thus, the LE NA system estimates of in-home language input si nce the 30 -million -word gap project showed that parents were encouraged to increase the quality and quantity of their turns . Another milestone study by Gilkerson et al. ( 2018) recently demonstrated long -term associations between e arly l anguage exposure and subsequen t child language and IQ through late middle school through LENA and their naturalistic methodology. Thus, they have proved that turn -taking predicts crucial out comes by age 14. The authors affected the clinical practice recomm endations of the Ame rican Acad emy of Pediatrics . P. Binos , K. Petinou 30 Aim of the study This study aims to record fo r the first time in Cypriot -Greek dialect and Greek language how m uch exposure is needed for language acquisition since a language is acquired through expos ure. A lso, are there any recorded differences among TDs and LD participants? Method This is a lon gitudinal study of three cases included in -home recordings where two Cypriot Greek -speaking families and their typically developing children (6 and 46 months o ld) (T Ds) and a Cypriot G reek-child (81 months old) (LD) diagnosed with a language disorder parti cipated in the study. TDs were born full-term without neurodevelopmen tal or hearing disorders. All participants were recruited through the Cyprus University of Techn ology University Re hab Clinic and their participation approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Clinic and the University . LEN A's hardware includes a digital language processor (DLP), a USB port for data transfer, and a display screen that is held in a t-shirt worn by the participant with a pocket on the front. The device records in 16 -bit, and when it is full, th e researcher can upload it to the software since a full day consists of 20 to 50K segments (VanDam et al., 2016). The software classif ies each segment based on vo lume and suprasegmental speech features as one of seven categories: adult male/female, another child, essent ial child, TV, noise, silence and overlapping sounds. Other sounds, defined as \"vegetative sounds\" (burping, sneezing) or \" fixed signals\" (crying, l aughing) measured and classified based on their prosodic features (intonation, duration) (Olle r et al., 2010 ). The segments classified as \"vocalizations\" counted as CVC and adult speech as AWC. Vocalization turns produced within fi ve sec onds of an adult's production without interruption are classified as the contiguous, linguistic turn -taking CTC. LENA system generates an estimated expressive language standard score calculated on the quality of the child's p roductions called automat ic voc alization assessmen t (AVA) and provides a comparison to typically developing peers. The software requires recordi ngs to be at least 10 hours long to complete a full analysis, including percentile rankings. The audio data (>150 hours overall) was proc essed and classified by t he LENA Pro software into seven sound categories . The speech and turn-takings of the six month s old TD was recorded and analysed based on recordings in two months that fulfilled the system's criteria for analysis. The analysis of 4 6 mont hs old TD was based on four recordings for two months. Accordingly , the analysis fo r LD child was based on 46 hou rs of three recordings in two months. An SLP explained the proper wearing and use of the DLP to the parents asking parents to have the ch ild wear the recorder in the unique LENA clothing. Parents received an instruction sheet and were asked to provide information on whether the recording day seemed to represent a ty pical day for the child . Language environmental analysis (LENA) 31 Results env ironment by the cat egories are divided into five categories : 1) TV and electronic sounds, 2) silence and background noise, 3) noise, 4) meaningful speech, and 5) distant speech. The TV and electronic sound s time for TDs ranged f rom 3 to 9 hours. The overal l time for LD child was 4 hours respectively. The amount of exposure to meaningful speech was found 4 \u00bd to 8 hours for TDs, while the corresponding time for LD was only 4 hours. The time of the distant spe ech was mea sured betwee n 7 \u00bd to 16 hours for TDs, w hile the distant sp eech time of LD was found 16 \u00bd hours. The noise was measured for all the participants for almost 1 hour. Finally, the silence and background time for TDs was measured long since, ranging from 21 to 27 hours ov erall. Vocali zations and t urns The mean number of vocalizations of LD (46 months old) was 990 words classified at the 50o percentile, while the mean number of LD (6 months old) was 529 vocalizations classified at the 10o percentile o f the LENA system. The performance of LD was measu red at 313 words and classified at the 10o percentile of the norms. The adult words of TDs were classified at 75 -90o and 70o percentile accordingly. Regarding the concern, the mean conversational turns were found at 270 (50o percenti le) for six month s old TD and 223 (10o percentile) for the other TD child. The LD child had only 85 turns classified at the 10o percentile of the system since the 50o percentile is measured at 200 turns. Discussion The purpose of this study was to present in detail data fo r the first time in Cyprio t-Greek and Greek about the informal environment of TD and LD participants. The present study is part of a more extensive study involving more participants from both groups. We are particularly interested in revea ling subtle communicati ve differences among TDs and LDs, especially in Cypriot -Greek dialect, so we can differentiate our clinical protocols in Speech -Language Pathology, providing the parents with the opportunity to be more \"communicative\" qualitatively a nd quantitative ly. AWC, CT and CV variables of the LENA system proved reliable in many studies and linked the performance to possible LDs (Ganek & Eriks -Brophy, 2018; Thiemann - Bourque et al., 2014). According to our results, the adult words that LD child r eceived were few, only at the 10o percentil e. The same stands for the turns since the mean number was calculated at 85 and the 10o percentile. Thus, there is a significant mean difference between the adult words that LD chil d received (6.800) and P. Binos , K. Petinou 32 the vocal izations that TDs received (16.000) from th eir parents. The results revealed a delay for the turns as well. The LD child received only a mean number of 85, while TDs ranged from 223 to 270 turns. In sum, the study also revea led the need for intensive couns elling of the par ents b y changing clinical protocols in Speech Pathology, following other studies that revealed similar needs (Suskind et al., 2013).

We investigat e whether the effects of grammar complexity are same in reading and listening sentences. We show that presentation mode has no effect on comprehension accuracy but affects response times. In both modes the most difficult constructions to comprehend and the longest constructions to process were the same which demonstrates that the cost of syntactic processing is not affected by presentation modality. Keywords: syntactic complexity, sentence comprehension, Russian language. Introduction The question whether listening comprehensio n is more or less costly than reading comprehension remains open. From one point of view, reading a more complicated and costly activity than oral language comprehension because reading ability is acquired later in ontogenesis than oral speech, and orthogr aphic processing is mapped onto phonologi cal representations, which; moreover, in listening comprehension we can use prosodic cues which we do not have in reading comprehension . From the other point of view, reading is less costly than listening because in most languages word boundaries are demarcated in written text unlike in spontaneous speech, and readers can process a word as long as they choose, in natural reading they also can refixate and make regressions, so oral language comprehension is more deman ding because the processing pace is regulated by the speaker, not by the hearer. Some research has been done on the effect of modality for grammatical judgment tasks. Vetter, Volovecky and Howell (1979) compared visual and auditory presentation, both norma l and monotone, as well as simultaneous visual and auditory presentation, and found no overall effect of modality. As for neurocognitive research on the modality of sentence processing, there is neurological evidence for supramodal language system that int egrates linguistic input from speech to print and activates a common code (Braze et al. 2011, Constable et al. 2004). D. Chernova , A. Novozhilov , N. Sliousar 34 Our study was aimed to investigate whether the effects of grammar complexity are same in reading and listening modes of the sentence compr ehension task. Material The task included syntactically complex 60 target sentences of 6 types: object relative clauses, locative constructions, temporal constructions, sentences with high and low modifier attachment to a complex noun phrase and complex comparative constructions, as well as 40 fillers with simpler syntactic structure (see Chernova, Novozhilov, Slioussar 2021). For every sentence, we created a comprehension question with a choice of two answers aimed to assess syntactic structure comprehens ion. Both response options were mentioned in the sentence but only one was the correct answer to the question. All the sentences were semantically reversible and unbiased, so both response options referred to equally plausible interpretations, so the synta ctic structure of the sentence had to be analyzed to give a correct answer . The test consisted of two parts: reading mode and listening mode. In the first part the sentences were presented in a non -cumulative self -paced reading mode. In the second part the sentences were presented as audio recording s (recorded by a male native -Russian speaker who read with a natural and consistent pace and volume and was unaware of the purpose of the study ). The test had a within -subject design: all participants read and he ard all the sentences, which were randomized in each protocol. Participants 98 native speakers of Russian (48 male/ 50 female) aged 19-63 volunteered to take part in the experiment which was run online using PCIbex platform , https://farm.pcibex.net/ (Zehr & Schwarz 2018). All the participants provided informed consent and were unaware of the purpose of the study. Procedure The participants were asked to read or listen to the sentence and then answer a comprehension question. It was possible to read or listen to the sentence only once. After that the participant was presented a comprehension question and chose a response option by mouse click. Answer accuracy and response times were registered. Results We analyzed pa rticipants' question answering times and accuracy. No differences in comprehension accuracy between reading and listening mode was found: = 0.1, z=0.8, p=0.3. As for construction types, low attachment sentences were processed the least accurately both in r eading and listening The role of presentation modality in sente nce processing 35 mode, p<0.01 for most pairwise comparisons, while t emporal sentences were the easiest to interpret in both modes, p<0.01 for most pairwise comparisons . It took significantly more time to answer the questions in listening mo de compared to reading mode: = 703.1, t=4.5, p<0.001. Complex comparative constructions and locative constructions were the longest to give an answer both in reading and listening modes, p<0.01 for most pairwise comparisons. The shortest answering times were register ed for high and low attachment and temporal constructions. Discussion As we see, presentation mode has no effect on overall comprehension accuracy. However, it affects response times: it takes significantly more time to answer a question if the sentence wa s presented orally than if the sentence was presented in the written form . This effect may be caused by the procedure of the experiment: a s soon the comprehension questions were always presented in the written form in both parts of the experiment , the incr easing response times may reflect the modality switch effect. What is more important, the most and the least difficult constructions to comprehend are the same in both modes : constructions with low attachment of the modifier to a complex noun phrase provo ked significantly more errors while temporal constructions provoked significantly less errors both in reading comprehension task and listening comprehension task . Complex com parative and locative constructions took the longest time to give a response also in both modalities. These data gives evidence that the same syntactic processing system seems to be is used in both modalities .

Images depicting reversible thematic relations led to mo re errors than non -reversible images for 5-7-year- olds. Schoolchildren identified as at risk of Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) had poorer performance than their age -matched control in the comprehension of RCs and which -questions (particularly in obj ect sentences with complex images). Results of a correlation between children's scores on a language assessmen t test by means of a PI - Task and two non -verbal inhibitory control tasks suggest low inhibitory capacity makes it more difficult for children at r isk of DLD to cope with costly sentences. Keywords: relative clauses; sentence comprehension; image complexit y; executive functions ; reversibility. Introduction This paper is concerned with the task demands in the assessment of children's comprehension o f costly sentence s and their implications for the tracking and understanding of language impairment in the syn tactic domain. It focuses on the comprehension of relative clauses (RCs) and which-questions (WQ) in a picture identification task (PI-task). The asymmetry between subject and object RCs (SRCs/ ORCs) with the latter being particularly demanding for both children and adults is widely attested across languages (Lau & Tanaka , 2021) . The ability to comprehend O RCs has been presented as a late acquisition and as a possible index of language impairment in the syntact ic domain due to Extended Relativized Minimality (ERM) , an overextension of a language - specific principle (Friedmann et al., 2009 ). There is, nevertheless, the possibility of underestimation of children's language abilities. L anguage -independent factors may contribute to children`s difficulties in the task. The compreh ension of RCs has been traditionally assessed by means of a PI- task in which children have to choose one out of two images in whi ch the same characters perform the same action described by the RC, though assuming reverse thematic roles. Hence, children have to decide on the correct picture by keeping in mind the thematic roles of the subject and of the object of the RC while disting uishing in which picture the same characters assume the respective actor and patient roles. The competing dema nds of sentence and image processing in the comprehension of costly structures were characterized L. Corr\u00eaa , E. Rodrigues , M. Augusto 38 (Rodrigues & Corr ea, 2013). In Correa & Aug usto (2019), a n effect of image complexity (IC) was obtained in the number of correct responses given by schoolchil dren to RCs and W ho-questions, suggesting tha t the difficulty imposed by the comparison of similar reve rsible semantic relations may confound the factors predominantly affecting children\u00b4s performance: a domain -specific effect of ERM or inef ficient inhibit ory control. The aim s of this paper are: to report an experiment in which the effect of IC (reversible actor -patient relations) is verified ; to evaluate the impact of IC on the performance of children identified as in risk of DLD (R -DLD) and the extent to which coping with a PI-task may rely upon inhibitory control abilities. Reversible and non -reversible images In this experiment, th e same setup of Correa & Augusto 's study (2019) was used. A background picture shows two different characters of the same t ype, corresponding to the subject/object of the RC. The back ground scene presents the two characters of the same type performing the same action w ith reversed roles (eg. one lion pushes a bear; a bear pushes the other lion, reversible actions (RA) ) or one of them as the actor -patient of a different action (non-reversible action (NRA) )1. Children have to choose among three options ( the two characters of the same type and another corresponding to the subject/object of the R C), the one corresponding to the hea d noun (see Figs. 1 and 2) . Type of RC (subject and object) and image complexity (IC) (RA - NRA) were the independent variables (within and betwee n factors, respectively) . Figure 1. NRA (...the monkey that carried the cat) . Figure 2. RA(...the giraffe that the cow kissed) . The participants were 34 middle -class Brazilian Portuguese (BP)-speaking children (age range 5.0 to 7.5), equall y divided into two groups ( NRA : 7 girls, mean age 6.0 years old; RA: 7 girls, mean age 5.8 years ). 4 sentences of each type (1-2) (randomized in 4 lists) were presented, with 3 distractor sentences (subject who-questions) in a fixed order. The same sentenc es were orally presented to the two groups , with images in PowerPoint slides . Children were tested in an isol ated room of the school . The procedure took around 10 min. Image complexity in the tracking of DLD 39 1. Mostra o macaco que carregou o gato . (Subject RC) [Show (me) the monkey that carried th e cat] 2. Mostra o elefante que o urso puxou . (Object RC) [Show (me) the elephant that carried the bear pulled] Results Correct responses were analysed with R Version 4.2.1 (2022 -06-23), and the lme4 package (Bates et al. , 2015). A GLMM , using the maxi mum likelihood method in R (Laplace Appr ,) was fitted, using binomial (logit) distribution, with Type of RC and IC as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect (Baayen et al., 2008) . This analysis revealed that children performed significantly bett er with SRCs than ORCs with complex images (estimate = 1.2442, SE = 0.4016, z = 3.098, Pr(|z|) = 0.00195) ORCs were cted by = 0.4684, z = 3.990, Pr(|z|) = 6.61e -05). Figure 3. Percentage of correct answers as a function o f conditions . The results show that reversible image s add difficulty to the task, particularly in the most demanding sentences, and reveal that the SRC-ORC asymmetry can be dissolved when RC s can be integrated with a non-reversible image. What is the impac t of IC in the tracking of DLD by means of a PI-task? Image effects, DLD and inhibitory control abilities Two groups wer e created from a sample of 263 B P-speaking school children previously submitted to the MABILIN battery :2 15 whose overall performance was suggestive of risk of DLD (6 girls ; mean age 7.2 years) (R-DLD group) ; 15 with high scores (6 girls, mean age 6.7 years ), in the matched c ontrol (CTL) group ). Subject/ object RCs and WQ s with simple (SI) (see note 1) and complex images (CI) were selected for the present analysis. There were 4 sentences in each condition . Additionally , the performance of 24 different childre n in the whole MABILIN battery was correlated with their performance in two inhibitory control tests Go/Nogo test and Flanker test . L. Corr\u00eaa , E. Rodrigues , M. Augusto 40 Results The number of correct responses in a Mann -Whitney test differed significantly in the R-DLD and the CTL group both in the simple (U= 55.500, z= =.016) and complex image conditions (U=22.00, z= -3.784, p = .000 1). For SI, which is more likely to capture difficulties in syntactic processing, there were significant differences between R -DLD and CTL only for ORCs (U=69.000, z=-2.004, p=.045). For CI , more likely to capture the additional burden of a reversible image, the groups differed signifi e was a positive correlation between the total score on MABILIN and the total of correct responses on Flanker ( (24) = 0.48, p= .02) and on Go/Nogo (24) =0. 41, p= . 04). No correlations were obtained for response time . Final remarks The ass essment of children's language comprehension abilities in the tracking of DLD has to take into account the specific task demands. The differential demands of simple and complex images in a PI -task can contribute to distinguishing children whose difficulty is more likely to stem from linguistic factors (difficulty with simple images ) from thos e who are additionally sensitive to the demands of reversible images on inhibitory control abilities . Notes 1. In Corr\u00eaa & Augusto (2019), the simple image had one of the cha racters of the same type standing by the scene. 2.

ExLing 20 22 Paris : Proce edings of 13th International Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France The annotation of info rmation structure in spoken Chinese : a University of Florence , Italy https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract The paper sketches a pilot aimed at verifying the consistency of the L-AcT principles and tagging metho dology for the annotation of Chinese speech . The pilot confirm s both the correspondence between Prosodic U nits and Information Units foreseen in this theory and the applicability of its tag-set to Chinese speech . Keywords : Information Structure, Speech Se gmentation, Chinese Introdu ction According to the Language into AcT theory (L -AcT, Cresti & Moneglia 2018 ), the speech continuum is parsed into prosodic units (PUs) by boundary phenomena that correlate with pauses, pitch reset, lowering of intensity, and lengthening . Prosodic Boundaries are highly per ceivable in connection to intentional movements on stressed s yllables ( 't Hart 1990 ) and define the edges of PUs, which signal information functions . Terminal prosodic breaks (TB) mark the utterance , i.e. be pragmatically interpreted . Non-terminal prosodic breaks (NTB) signal the informati on units (IUs) . This paper sketches a pilot study aimed at verifying the consistency of the above principles and tagging methodology specifical ly with respect to the relation between prosody and informatio n structure in Chinese spontaneous speech . The pilot is t he preliminary work of a doctoral project which foresees the collection and analysis of a new corpus of spoken Chinese \"C-ORAL -CIN\" (10 h ours, with diaphasic variation) implementing Chinese in the IP IC Information structure data base . In 2. we will show the correspondence with PUs of the IUs of Comment (COM) , Topic (TOP) , (PAR) and Boun d Comments (COB) and the consistency of their informational va lue according to L -AcT's tag-set (see. Moneglia & Raso 2014 and the definitions therein ). The annotation of the data set according to L -AcT The pilot deals with the annotation of a story told to a child by his mother (the Chinese fairy tale of Hou YI). The data set has been transcribed in characters and transliterated in pinyin. The prosodic parsing of the stretch of speech marking TB and NTB is provided following the perceptual recogniti on by a E. Cresti , S. Luo, M. Moneglia , A. Panunzi 42 mother tongue. In parallel, the sound wave is analysed throug h WinPitch and PRAAT, allowing the verification o f perceptual judgements. Finally, the word - by-word translation of each chunk in English , and translation in current language is added. In agreement w ith L -AcT's principles, dedicated layers are provided fo r the segmentation of the wave in connection with TB and NTB . The correspondence of terminated sequences with reference units such as utterances and stanzas has been verified (Izre'el et al.2020) dividing the recording into 90 reference units . To each PU i s assigned a n IU tag according to the L - AcT tagse t. (1) allows to verify th e main principle of the L -AcT approach : within a n utterance compound by more than one PU , one IU is at the core (the COM) , since it bears the illocutionary information . The COM can be pragmatically interpreted for this reason even if the other IUs (in this case INT and APC ) are erased. (1) *LYF: b n le// APC And one day (SFP)/ INT ten of the sons go up to the sky/ COM are on duty// APC [then there is a day (when) the ten children run through t he sky together to take turns ] It is worth notic ing that, in Chinese , from a semantic point of view, the locutive content in the APC ( -zh\u00ed b n le) could be in principle a sentence . But this is not the case considering its actual flat prosodic perform ance, which is not consistent with any possible pragmatic interpretatio n of the unit . According to L-AcT definition, the APC just adds unnecessary information to the COM (4 APC in this t ext). So, prosody defines the structure of the speech flow , segmentin g the same utterance into three IUs instead of parsing it in two utte rances. Although simple utterances occupy an essential role in Chinese speech (43% in the tale ), the IUs of TOP , COB and PAR have been retrieved . (2) is an example of TOP /COM utterance, very frequent in Chinese (Li & Thompson 1981), which records 38% of terminated units in mother 's speech . The annotation of information struct ure in spoken son makes turn when / TOP sun [/] sky over exactly be one (CL) sun // COM [When t he elder son makes his turn, the sun [/] there is in the sky only one sun. ] In (2) the TOP is a conditional subordinate sentence, and the COM is a nominal predicate conveying an assertiv e illocution. Coherently with L-AcT definition , the TOP works as the pragm atic domain relevant for the interpretation of the illocution ary act accompli shed by the COM . As it is frequent in monolog ues, terminated units go beyond the utterance limits . In our tale too (19% in mothe r's speech) sequences ending with a TB are made by Comments bound the one to the other in an adjunctive process (COB) . These sequences are le / COB t / PAR y\u00ec sh\u00e8 y\u00ed g\u00e8 zh n // COM his shooting arrow be very acc urate/COB he go hunting when /PAR one strike one (CL) accurate // COM [The ability of his shooting arrow is very accurate, when he goes hunting, he brings every shot to the target. ] E. Cresti , S. Luo, M. Moneglia , A. Panunzi 44 In (3) t he first COB is in principle interpretable, bu t it does not end with a terminal break . On the contrary prosody mark s the continuation of the discourse . It corresponds to an assertion which frames the utterance , while the final COM adds an explana tion ( his shooting -arrow ability is strong ). As it also happe ns in Romance corpora COBs in a stanza are interpolated by IUs, which add incidental information. These units (PAR) , 4 instances in our tale, correspond to prosodic units with less f0 variatio n, performed at a lower - mid f0 values. Accordingly, in (3) PAR, which is a conditional subordinate sentence, shows a f0 profile a t a lower frequency level than the other I Us. The PAR frames the situation, but prosody signals that the circumstance (hunting) is reported \"on a different plan \" and e ven if the speaker omits this part, the meaning of the overall terminated sequence still holds. In conclusion, the research shows that in the Chin ese pilot: (a) reference units ( utterance , stanza ) are marked by TB ; (b) IUs correspond to P Us; (c) the IU typology of the L -AcT framew ork are retrieved in spoken Chinese .

However, it remains unclear whether these features influence constru ction alternations through word order or function assignment. To disentan gle these effects, we conducted a quantitative corpus study in Greek, comparing a word order alternation (SOV/OVS) and a function assignment alternation (active/passive). We annotated a random sample of 600 sentences from the Corpus of Modern Greek (Arkhan gelskiy , Kisilier 2018) and fitted a Bayesian categorical model to construction (SVO/OVS/passive). We show that animacy and definiteness features have an effect on function assignme nt, not on worder order, but we found a short -before -long length effect. Keywords: Modern Greek, construction alternations, corpus study, Bayesian modelling Introduction Construction alternations are influenced by several factors, including animacy, defini teness or length, as in dative alternation in English (Bresnan , Ford 2010). However, it remains unclear whether so -called \"referential prominence features \" (Aissen 1999, Haspelmath 2020) like animacy and definiteness affect construction choice through word order (eg. animate -first preference) or function assignment (eg. animate -subject preference) (Thuilier et al. 2021). Using sentence recall tasks, experimental studies both in English (Bock , Warren 1985, Mcdonald et al. 1993) and French (Thuilier e t al. 2021) have tried to disentangle these preferences by comparing animacy effect s on active/passive alternation (a function assignment alternation) and NP coordinations (a word order alternation). The authors report an animacy effect on active/passive alternation, but not on word order in coordinations., suggesting that animacy plays a role only for function assignment. However, this conclusion is challenged by Feleki & Branigan (1999), who found an animate -first effect in Greek using the same sentence recall task with the SVO/OVS alternation. The authors thus claim that animacy only a ffects word order and that animate -subject preferences observed in English are just due to the tight connection between subject and first position in this language. But as Feleki and Branigan (1999) only took into account the SVO/OVS Y. da Cunha, I . Chorai, A . Abeill\u00e9 46 alternation, word orde r and function assignment preferences have not yet been directly compared in Greek. As for length, it is sometimes included among prominence features (Bresnan , Ford 2010), while McDonald et al. (1993) treat it separately, as it did not show any effect in s entence recall in English. Feleki and Branigan (1999) study did not include this f actor in Greek. Methodology We aim at disentangling word order and function assignment preferences in Greek by conducting a quantitative corpus study. We used newspaper texts from the morphologically annotated Corpus of Modern Greek (Arkhangelskiy , Kisili er 2018). We randomly extracted a sample of 600 sentences, containing 200 active SVO (1), 200 active OVS (2) and 200 passive constructions with a preverbal subject and an expr essed by -phrase agent (3). were all and a rguments were only NPs, because clitic object pronouns are preverbal drop. (1) Oi ispanoi, prospheroun 1.500 eisitiria the Spanish offer 1500 tickets people offer 1500 tickets' (Makedonia, 2007/09/26) (2) Ipotheseis eka ne o Oli Pen hypotheses made the Oli Pen 'Oli Pen made assumptions' arts inspire. PASSIVE by the byzantine 'Contemporary art is inspired by Byzantine art' children injure. PASSIVE by the missile attack 'Four children were injured by the missile attack' (To Vima, 2011/05/10) Using Arg1 for active subject and passive by -phrase, and Arg2 for active object and passive subject, we annotated argument animacy, definiteness and length (number of words). With these three constructions (SVO/OVS/Passive), we can tease apart word order from function assignment preferences: in SVO/OVS, functions are the same but order differs, in OVS/Passive, there is the same Arg2 -Arg1 order but function m apping varies (object Arg2 in a ctive vs. subject Arg2 in passive). For statistical analysis, we fitted a Bayesian categorical model to construction as a function of animacy, definiteness and length, using the brms package in R (B\u00fcrkner 2017). We used OVS as reference level for the outco me, as it minimally differs from both SVO and Passive. Verb lemma was used as a random variable. Length was included using a Length difference variable: log(Arg1 Length) - log(Arg2 Length) (Bresnan & Ford, 2010). We used wea k Word order and function assignment preferences in Modern Greek 47 informative priors for regress ion coefficients (normal distribution with =0, =1) default brms priors other parameters (Student's t -distribution with =3, =0, =2.5). Four sampling chains ran 4000 iterations with a warm -up period of 1000 iterat ions. Results Results from the B ayesian categorical model are reported in Figure 1. We examine 6 hypotheses: preferences for human -subject, human -first, definite - subject, definite -first, shorter -subject, shorter -first. In each case, we report mean parameter value (Pass ive for Passive/OV S contrast and SVO for SVO/OVS contrast), 95% credible interval and the probability P of differing from 0. We find compelling evidence for human -subject preference for both do find evidence for human -first preference for neither Arg1 (2) has an effec t on function assignment, not on word order. The same holds for definiteness: there is evidence for a definite -subject preference for P(Passive>0)=20%). Conclusion Statistical modelling on Greek corpus data shows that prominence features (animacy and definiteness) only affects f unction assignment , which can be viewed as argument coding efficiency (Haspelmath 2020). By contrast, length only affects word order, which can be explained by dependency length minimization (Temperley , Gildea 2018). This difference brings evidence to distinguish the statu s of prominence features and length. While prominence features represent referential/conceptual information, length is more tied to phrasal/formal properties (McDonald et al., 1993). We failed to replicate an animate -first preference a s found by Feleki , Branigan (1999) in Greek, which may be due to task effects: ecological production may not involve the same cognitive processes as sentence recall.

ExLing 20 22 Paris : Proce Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Iconicity in fictional and natural languages: an experime ntal study Varvara Davydova1, Elena Shamina2 1Department of Foreign Languages , St Petersburg University, Russian Federation 2Department of Phonetics , St state Fe deration https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract Language iconicity has lately become an important issue in cognitive studies. The phonetic form of iconic linguistic signs is supposed to be motivated and aligned with some of th e physical propert ies of t he signified, thus making it more understandable and recognisable for the language user. The hypothesis laying the foundation of the present research is that iconic words of fictional langu ages are constructed in accordance with t he same or similar princip les as iconic words in natural lan guages. The paper discusses the results of a series of psycholinguistic experiments that are part o f a broader study of iconicity in fictional languages an d whose aim is to test the hypothesis. Keywords: psycholi nguisti c experi ment , iconicity, phonoseman natural language Introduction : language iconicity Iconic lan guage signs (unlike indices or symbols in C. S. Peirce 's classification (Peirce 1994)) are those that represent by their sound form certain properties of the signified directl y, by means of synesthe tic associ ations (Ramachandran , Hubbard 2001). They fall into two categories: sound imitative and sound symbolic , and have been shown to have cognitive potential that can en sure instantaneous unders tanding of nonsense ( Abelin 2006) or foreign ( 2018) words . It is only logical to suppose that liter ary fictional languages abound in phonosemantic vocabulary. Background: fictional languages Fictional (invented ) langua ges are those constructed for use in literary writings descr ibing thought-up worlds and their non -human inhabitants. Often , the sound of their speech is the major means of their characterization , and the readers should be given an op portunity to understand what is going on without consta ntly referring to the dictio nary. Iconic features in such languages have been pointed out (Fimi, Higgins 2016; Peterson 2015), and an extensive study of the phenomenon have been conducted for 4 of them ( Davydo va 2016). That was performed with the he lp of the phonoseman tic analysis procedure ( 1982), and a special e mphasis was placed on the phonemic inventory V. Davydova , E. Shamina 50 and the phonotactics of the lexis not being copied from English, the nativ e tongue of the inventors : iconic lexis of fictional and natural languages Material and methodology The material for the perceptual experiment with fictional lexis ( a, 2022) is extracted from two invented language s found in popular fantasy novels: Klingon by Mark Okrand and Na'vi by Paul Frommer who supplied phonetic transcription and detailed pronunciation instructions . The 20 words constitute designations of acoustic events of different types , as well as size, sh ape, lu minosity, etc., i.e., their semanti cs is typical for phonosemantic items in natural language s. The methodology used is a variation of the associative experiment with 3 options offered to the respondents to choose from when trying t o determ ine the me aning o f the target stimulus. These were presented to the participants in their audio form. The subject s were native English and Russian speakers of both sexes and various ages. For compariso n, the data from a different series of phonos emantic exper iment s (Shamina 2019) are used. The methodology and the resp ondents ' characteristics are very similar , but the word -stimuli come from the author 's corpus of English and Russian slang and the onom atopoeic vocabulary of the languages mentioned . About 5000 respons es were elicited and analysed for each of the experiment series and the data statistically evaluated. Any observed discrepan cies bet ween reactions of respondents in diffe rent age a nd gender groups are statistically insignificant. Results and discussion The analysis of the data obtained point s to the respondents' reactions to the word -stimuli , whether they are fi ctional items or existing foreign words, being based on the ir sound iconic properties, and to the speakers of both non -closely related languages de monstrat ing similar perception strategies . The overall results show that in the case of fictional languages , for 17 out of 20 lexical items both groups of subject s are incl ined to choose the meaning originally conceived by the inventor . The average c orrect interpretation of the language units unde r consideration , both fictional and natural, varies around 70 - 80 %, peaking to more than 90 % in some instances , e.g. fictional slele /sl.l/ 'swim ' for the Russian spea kers an d Russian /pentux/ 'lout' for the English speakers . In the experiment with the fictional language material, t he subjects ' \"correct\" choices embrace both sound imitations and sound -symbolic names referring to non-acoustic properties of the denotatum . Speaking of the latter, designations of small size are know n to be associated with front high vowels and fore -lingual Iconicity in fictional and natural languages: an consonants , and Na'vi lini /l.n/ 'young of an animal ' follows suit, being recog nized as such by 80 % of the Russian and 8 3 % of the English subjects. Iconic words denoting fast sharp movement usually have stops in their form, thus Na'vi takuk /ta.kuk / 'rush forward ' is perceived as exp ected by about 80 % of the Russians and about 72 % of the English . The Klingon word gho /o/ comprising a rounded vowel triggers its perception as 'circle ' and not 'sharp - angled figure ' or 'dotted line ' by about 70 % of all the respondents. The same percen tage of both gro ups of the subjects are sure tha t Na'vi hufwe /hu.fw/ means 'wind ' and not 'stone ' because denotations of air movement and breathing regularly contain fricatives and rounded vowels. In respect to onomatopes , all the subjects identified the Na'vi word nguway /u.wai/ as meaning 'howl' in more than 60 % of cases and the Na'vi word rurur /ru.rur/ as meaning 'water flowing among the rocks ' in about 80 % of cases . This happens due the well-established tendenc y (Voronin 2005 ) for tone continuants (words imitating prolonged and flui d tones) to hav e long vowels and sonorants in their phonetic structure while frequentative s (words imitating vibrations, disruptive noises) tend to include rhotic consonants. Instants (imitations of p ulses) are better recogni types of onomato pes, e.g., Na'vi pxek /p'k/ 'sound of strike ' and Klingon baS /b/ 'sound of a sheet of metal ' are corr ectly perceived in about 80 % and 90 % of cases, respectively. It is worthy of mention that the same observation was made when analysing the data of the e xperiment with the ono matopoeic lexis of the natural languages . Conclusi on The results of the experimental series discussed confirm the hypothesis about the non -random selection by inventors of fictional languages of sound forms for the transmission of various meanings , which , apparently, is determined by the universal iconic principle s of linguistic systems. The findings can be , at least partly, accounted for by the supposition that literary fictional languages do not function as a means of communication between (non -human) li terary characters, but serve the purpose of transferri ng the auth ors' ideas to the readers who are speakers of natural languages.

In 2021 we presented research on the impact of this new professional reality on the v ocal load of Saint Pe tersburg university professors. The online synchronous teaching cau sed the si gnificant increase in the focal fatigue in university professors in comparison with the pre -pandemic studies.

The goal of this study was to find out whether adapta tion mecha nisms during the pandemic period were developed to adjust to the different types of teaching mo de. The acoustic and clinical data are presented. Keywords: voc al fatigue, teacher's voice, voice load. online synchronous teaching, COVID -19 pandemic Introduct ion Vocal fatigue in voice professionals has been studied intensely for decades, especially rega rding symptoms and ri sk factors. It is particularly self -report ed by teachers as a sense of increased vocal effort and a sensation of laryngeal and pharyngeal c onstriction . The clinical analysis performed through laryngoscopy can detect symptoms associated with vocal disorders . Besides, vocal fatigue is also shown in tonal range, dynamic range, vocal quality, intensity and fundamental frequency changes. The acous tical aspect of the phenomenon allows its objective evaluating in terms of degree and dynamics. We performed the acou stic, auditory and clinical analysis of vo cal fatigue symptoms in the professors of Saint Petersburg state university (pronunciati on teache rs and lecturers) in a number of previous studies in the COVID -19 pre - pandemic years. [3-5] Due to the COVID -19 pande mic, there was a dramatic change in the wo rk mode of all voice professionals. In 2020 university professors around the world had t o shift t o online teaching. In 2021 we presented the research on the impact of this new professional real ity on the vocal load of Saint Petersburg university professors . The online synchronous K. Evgrafova , N. Sokol ova, N. Shvalev 54 teaching caused the significant increase in the focal fatigue i n univers ity professors in comparison w ith the pre -pandemic studies. We continued our study during the p ost-pandemic semester (winter -spring 2022). During that period our participants either returned to classroom teaching or switched to hybrid mode of tea ching (co nsisting of a mixture of distant and classroom activities). The goal of this study was to find o ut whether adaptation mechanisms during the pandemic period wer e developed to adjust to the different types of teaching mode. Methodology We followed t he protoc ol used in our pre-pandemic and pandem ic vocal fatigue studie s. All the participants were the pr ofessors of Saint Pet ersburg State University with average work experience of 5 years. The participants were involved in different types of teaching ac tivities: teachers delivering lectures o n linguistics ; English tea chers running practical classes; pronun ciation coaches. The minimum workload a day was 3 hours while t he maximum was 6 hours. No one had pathological voice problems. 10 female teachers recor ded thems elves before and after classroom/online synchronous teaching using their mobile phones . The part icipants read a four minute p honetically representative text. The participants also filled in the self -reporting questionnaire which t hey had faced in the 2021 study . They graded their physical state, mood and a level of activity at the moment of the reco rding. We used the WAM questionnaire to evaluate psychoemotiona l state of the teachers before and after their work. WAM (wellbeing , activity , mood) is used to a ssess the mental state of patients and healthy people, their psychoemotional response to loading . [2] Besides, the p articipants had the laryngoscopy of vocal cords done regularly during the period of 2021 -2022. Results Thus we obtained acoustic d ata ( objective evaluation ), self -reports ( laryngoscopy results ( clinical evalu ation) which can show the impact of different types of teaching mode on vocal fatigue . Acoustic data We calculated a number of acoustic parameters wh ich had been significant for detecting voice fatigue in the previous studies (mean F0, vowel duration and laryngealization ) in non-fatigued (NF) .and fatigued (F) speech samples The values of these parameters in pre-pande mic, pandemic and post -pandemic recordings are presented in Table1 below . The adapt ion to online synchronous teaching and voice fatigue 55 Table 1. Mean F0 , vowel duration increase and the percentage of l aryngealized segments in non -fatigued/fatigued speech (pre-pand emic, pandemic and post- pandemic material ). F0 tends to be higher in the fatigued speech across all types of the recordings. However, the post -pandemic values are closer to the pre -pandemic ones. The vowel duration increase in the fatigued speech is still significant , although it has dec reased in the post -pandemic period. Laryn gealization which is marked by significant decrease in pitch value and pitch breaks is a ssociat ed with a creaky voice quality. The symptom was frequently reported by the teachers during the sel f-assessment of voice quality. The mean duration of laryng ealized speech segments is the longest during the pandemic and has also reduced in the post -pandemi c period . Clinical data During the extended period of online teaching the clinical picture showed hypotonic dysphonia that was potentially caused by overuse or excess voice use. One of the patients excess voice use during the pandemic period result ed in t he pre-nodule condition of vocal cords (pic. 1). The relief in voice fatigue came with both develo ping adaptation mecha nisms and partly switching to in-class teaching in post -pandemic .

The return to the regular working environment (w ith the absence of th e necessity of the microphone use and visi ble audience follow -up and reaction) has had a positive effect on the vocal functions an d redu ced possible pathological changes in the larynx. The analysis of the acoustic and clinical data confirmed the effectiven ess of the adaption mechanisms in terms of vocal fatigue decrease. The self -reports showed that during the pandemic period teacher s had to develop new strategies to avoid voice overstraining such as slowing the pace, taking frequent pa uses, putting an emph asis on diction and consonants rather on i ncreasing the loudness.

Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Ca' Foscari University of Venice , Italy https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/ Abstract How do speakers represent and process syntactic information in their second and third langua ge? We investigated this question with cross -linguistic synt priming of passives from Spanish (L3) (L2). We found that cross -linguistic structural priming occurs between two non -native languages in intermediate to advanced speakers of Engl ish as an L2 and Spanish as an L3. We ta ke these results to s how that multilingual speakers have one integrated shared abstract representation of passives. The find ings are compatible with the extension of the bilingual shared -syntax model Introduction to the shared -syntax model of bilingual lang uage production (Hartsuiker et al. 2004, Hartsuiker , Bernolet 2015) syntactic representations are shared between an L1 and later acq uired languages as mu ch as possible. Most of the evidence for this model comes from studies that examine processing in an L1 and a later acquired L2. The question of how speakers repres ent, and process subsequently acquired languages (L3 and beyond) is sti ll unanswered. To our knowledge, Hartsuiker and colleagues (2016) is the only study to have investigated priming between two non -native languages. Their findings support the shared -syntax model: if the representation of a structure is shared between langua ges, then all languag es can activate it with equal strength. Our stu dy tests the shared syntax model by examining how mul tilingual speakers of Italian as an L1 represent and process pas sive sentences in later acquired languages, specifically English (L2) a nd Spanish (L3). Our research questions were: 1. Do late multilinguals (acquiring an L2 and L3) share syntactic information between their L2 and L3? To answer this question, we examined wh ether cross -linguistic syntactic priming of passive sentences occurs b etween Spanish L3 and English L2. 2. Is the strength of priming modulated by language -linguistic structural priming between L2 and L3 influenced by conceptual information? If the share d syntax model also a pplies to a dditional languages, the prediction is that, provided sufficient proficiency, priming sh ould be possible between an L3 and an L2 (and vice -versa). In this study, we looked at priming from the L3 to the L2. Methods Participan ts 26 Italian native speakers (24 Female, 2 Male, M age = 28) took part in a cross - linguistic priming experiment (data co llection is ongoing ). Participants acquired English as an L2 and Spanish as an L3. Their linguistic background was assessed using a Lang uage Profile Question naire. I n the survey, participants were asked to rate their language level according to the criteri a of the Common European Framework (CEFR) in all four language modalities (writing, listening, speaking, and reading) in their L2 and L3 using a Likert -scale from 1 to 6. Design and procedure The study investigated primed production of passive sentence st ructures from Spani sh to English using a within -subjects 2 (structure) x 2 (animacy) factorial design. Example materials are shown in Ta ble 1. Participants r ead a pr ime sentence in Spanish and typed in a written description to a target picture in English. The experiment was administered remotely, using Psychopy (Peirce et al., 2019) on the Pavlovia.org platform. Table 1. Experimental cond itions. The animacy c onditio n of the agent (inanimate) was kept constant across conditions. Prime structure - Active Prime structure - Passive Animate patient El sol ceg\u00f3 al hombre. The sun blinded the man. El hombre fue cegado por el sol. The man was blinded by the sun. Inanimate patient El hurac\u00e1n arruin\u00f3 la cosecha. The hurricane ruined the crop. La cosecha fue arr uinada por el hurac\u00e1n. The crop was ruined by the hurricane. Analysis and results All descriptions to target pictures were scored for s yntactic structure. T o be considered a passive, descriptions had to contain the patient as syntactic subject, followed by the auxiliary be in any tense, followed by the agent introduced by the prepositio n by. Passives without an explicit agent (e.g., trunc ated passives) were s cored other, and excluded from statistical analyses. Shared syntactic representations in non-native languages 59 The data were analysed with generalised line ar models (McCullagh & Nelder, 1989) predicting the log odds (logit) of a passive se ntence. The best -fit model is summarised in Table 2. There was a signifi cant effect of prime structure, indicating that structural priming occurs from an L3 (Spanish) to an L2 (English). There was also a main effect of animacy: participants on average pr oduced 29% of passive responses after Animate patient primes as opposed to 17% after Inanimate patient primes. Animacy effects were independent of prime structure, suggesti ng that semantic features may drive production in multilingual speakers more than sy ntactic structure. Proficiency in the L2 and L3 alon e was not significant (this is likely to be due to lack of power). In order to investigate the relationship between pri ming and self-reported language proficiency, we computed a condensed measure of additional language dominance (i.e., which additionally a cquired non-native language is more dominant?). This measure was defined as the difference between the average proficie ncy scores - negative language dominance scores equal Spanish dominance, whereas pos itive scores reflect English dominance. The model sug gests that Language d ominance did not have a significant independent effect on the production of passive responses. How ever, there was a significant positive Prime Structure x Language dominance score in teraction, indicating that as the language dominance score increases, the production of passive responses after passive primes increases as well. Table 2. Model results. Predictors Coefficient SE z value p (Intercept) 0.09 x Language dominance 0.24 0.1 3.54 .0093 Animacy x Language dominance 0.03 0.1 0.80 >.1 Prime Structure x Animacy x Language dominance -0.10 0.1 -1.70 >.1 Discussion Our study confirms that priming can occur between two non -native languages (Hartsuiker et al. 20 16), in line with the extension of the bilingual shared -syntax model (Hartsuiker et al. 2004) to multilingual syntactic processing: provide d that speakers have a high enough proficiency in L2 and L3, they conveniently merge abstract representations of simi lar syntactic structure. Our results add to these findings that if two non -native languages are involved, in the case of L3 to L2 priming, target language profi ciency may need prime Ch. Facipieri , M. Vann , G. Bencini 60 language proficiency to observe significant evidence of shared -syntactic representations. Having only tested intermediate to advanced speakers of English and Spanish may have prevented us from se eing a clear modulati ng effect of only target language proficiency like the one found by Bernolet et al., (2013) and Hartsuiker & Bernolet (2015). Furthermore, our results confirm our initial prediction that participants would produce more passive respons es after animate pati ent primes regardless of prime structure. This suggests that the patient's inherent accessibilit y, more than its derived accessibility, allowed for the animate entity to be more easily retrievable and to be encoded in a prominent sente ntial position, namel y the subject of a passive sentence. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that syntacti c priming and animacy influence the choice of syntactic structure independently of each other (Pickering & Ferreira, 2008).

ExLing 20 22 Paris : Proce Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Sentence repetition as a function of episodic buffer: a pilot study in Croatian Mateja Gabaj1, Jelena 1Postgraduate doctoral study \"Speech, Language and Hearing Disorders\", Faculty of Education and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Za greb, Croatia 2Department of Speech -Language Pathology, Faculty of Education and Rehabilitation Sciences, University o f Zagreb, Croatia https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract In sentence repetition tasks, the function of the episodic buffer of wo rking memory is to adjust semantic and syntactic information stored in long -term memory. To explain how working memory uses linguistic knowledge about words and constraints on their order in sentences, the constrained sentence span task was adapted and dev eloped. The aim of the study was to determine how many words in sentences children could repeat under both conditions with and without articulatory suppression. Sixteen ten -year-old children participated in the study ( M = 10;04). The results showed that su ccess in repeating sentences under both conditions increased up to sentences with six words. This experimental task ac counts for the function of the episodic buffer when controlling various linguistic aspects. Keywords: sentence repetition, long -term lingu istic knowledge, episodic buffer, working memory Introduction In Baddeley's model of working memory, the episodic buff er has the task of communicating with long -term memory while integrating and storing information from the other two components of working memory - the phonological loop and/or the visuospatial sketchpad, depending on the modality of the information (Baddel ey, 2000 ). In verbal tasks, the episodic buffer allows syntactic and semantic information from long -term memory to interact with that fro m working memory. In immediate sentence recall tasks, it is thought to act as a system that adapts to the contribution of long -term linguistic knowledge, explaining the ability to repeat a larger number of related units of meaning in a particular order. Ot her theories of immediate recall emphasise that linguistic knowledge is interwoven with memory for immediate sentence r epetition (Acheson & McDonald, 2009). Baddeley et al. (2009) have developed a sentence repetition task that reflects the functioning of, or measures the capacity of, the episodic buffer of working memory. This task can be used to examine the span of immedi ate sentence memory when demands on working memory are increased while controlling for linguistic knowledge of words and constraints on their order in sentences. The M. Gabaj , J. Kuva Kraljevi 62 aim of the present study is to test this adapted task with Croatian -speaking children. Methods Participants Sixteen typically developing school -aged children participated in this pilot study (10;00 - 10;10 years old; M = 10;04 years, SD = 3.26 months). Children's non - verbal cognitive abilities were assessed using the Raven's Progressive Matrice s (Raven et al., 200 0). All children scored normal on the nonverbal IQ, confirming that they had no diminished intellectual abil ities (SR mean = 104; SR range = 90 - 128.75; SD = 12.25) and had no language difficulties. Experimental task For this study, a specific experimental sentence repetition task - the constrained sentence span task - was designed to investigate sentence memory span and to determine how working memory uses linguistic knowledge about words and constraints on their order in sentences sto red in long -term memory (Baddeley et al., 2009). In this task, sentences are constructed from a closed set of words (nouns, verbs and a djectives). Examples of 6 -word sentences formed from a closed set of words otvara stari zeleni auto. [(The) new neighbour opens (the) old green car]. This task is similar to a standard memory span procedure in which a smaller number of words are used repeatedly in diff erent places in sentences, taking into account the linguistic regularities and constraints of the Croatian language. Selecting a closed set of words and using a limited range of syntactic structures increases the demands on working memory during sentence r epetition and forces subjects to focus on their current memory, minimising the variability that may arise from their individual languag e knowledge or the form and content of the sentences. Furthermore, this allows for proactive interference of similar linguistic material, reducing the contribution of gist -based long -term episodic memory. The proactive interference paradigm ensures that pa rticipants focus on temporary binding in working memory. Design and procedure A 6x2 repeated measures design was used in which sentence length was manipulated by gradually increasing noun phrases (so that sentences were 3 -8 Sentence repetition as a function of episodic buffer 63 words long) and secondary tasks (performance without or with articulatory suppression to disrupt the phonological loop). Ten different sentences were designed for each sentence sequence, and each experimental condition was counterbalanced using a Latin square. As linguistic knowledge ha s previously been shown to influence immediate sentence r epetition , word order, semantic plausibility, word length and wo rd frequency were controlled. Therefore, all words were 2 -3 syllables long, of medium to high frequency based on data from the Children 's Frequency Dictionary of the Croatian Language (Kuva Kraljevi et al., 2021) and the Croatian Lexical Database (Kuva Kraljevi & Oluji, 2018), constructed in sentences in the canonical SVO order, and semantically plausible, as subsequently confirmed b y children's rating on a Likert scale of 1 -5 (M = 4.45). The experiment was conducted at school, in a quiet room. After listening to the audio recording of the sentences through headphones, the participants had to repeat each sentence as accurately as poss ible. Under conditions of articulatory suppression, they continuously repeated 1 -2-3-4 while listening to the sentences. Results and discussion Since this study focused on the number of correct words that could be repeated in a sentence, each word that th e children coul d recall was quantified. The repetition was correct if (1) the words were repeated in the correct order, i. e. there was no change of position between two adjacent words, (2) all inflexions were preserved and the number, gender and case of th e conten t words matched the target word. Inter -rater reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Thirty percent of the samples (results from five children) were randomly selected and evaluated by the first a uthor and an in dependent rater. Overall, the results showed excellent agreement between the two raters (ICC = .98). The mean proportion of words correctly repeated by the children for each sentence sequence and in relation to performance in the conditions without and with articulatory suppression (AS) is shown in Table 1. As expected, the results showed significant effects of sentence length , F(1.76, 52.65) = 132.70, p < .01, p\u00b2 = .82, but no effects of secondary tasks, F(1, 30) = 1.78, p = .192, p\u00b2 = .06, and no interaction between these two effects, F(1.76, 52.65) = 1.24, p = .295, p\u00b2 = .04. Sentence recall performance increased up to sente nces of six words, after whic h it began to decline . For example, the mean number of words in the retrieved 6 -word sentences was 5.69 (SD = .34) and in the articulatory suppression condition was 5.54 (SD = .46) (Table 1). Secondary tasks Without AS With AS 3-word sentences 2,99 4,99 (1.04 ) Table 1. Descriptive statistics data - mean proportion of words for each sentence sequence (with standard deviation) in relation to the two conditions Articulatory suppression did not interfere with the binding of words to sentences during retrieval. T hese results support the fact that articulatory suppression, which limits the involvement of the phonological loop that supports repetition, is not cognitively demanding enough to significantly impair sentence memoris ation and repetition . This study contri butes to the assumptions that the constrained sentence span task accounts for the function of the episodic buffer when controlling for different linguistic aspects from the word to the sentence level. Furthermore, the type of errors the children made could provide additional information about underlying language processing problems. References Acheson, D. J., MacDonald, M. C. 2009 .

It explores affective prosody by investi gating the relationship between v oice source parameter chang es and perceived affect. Firstly, it a ims to exa mine the relative contribution of voi ce sourc e shifts occurring globally across an utterance and shifts that are aligned to the proso dic structure o f the utterance. Secon dly, it aims to formulate a simple model for affect expression that could, in principle, be app lied to text -to-speech synthes is sys tems for Irish (Ga elic) dialects. The analytic methods to be used include voice source and intonation a nalysis of utterances produced to portray a range of emotions, and perception experiments with stimuli varying in te rms of global vs. lo cal, structured s ource manipulations. Keywords: emotion, synthesis, prosody, voice sou rce, affect Introduction Current linguistic prosodic research largely avoids analysis of affective prosody. In fact, most research in the area of affectiv e speech has been conduct ed by psychologists such as Scherer and colleagues (Scherer, 2003 ; Jusli n and Scherer, 2005). However, althou gh there is an emerging consensus that voice quality is central to the communication of affect, most analyses have tended to focus on global shifts in fu ndament al frequency (f0), intensity and tempo, while the crucia l parameters of voice quality (tone of v oice) are largely absent (but see, for example, Gobl and N\u00ed Chasaide, 2003). Furthermore, beyond global average values, th ere is little account of whethe r and to what extent the changes to the voice source are in fact glo bal shifts a ffecting entire utteran ces, or within - utterance shifts that take acc ount of their known prosodic structure. Building on earlier research on voic e quality and affect expr ession (e.g., N\u00ed Chasa ide and Gobl, 2022) , the present project sets out to explore aff ective prosody through analysis, and ultimately through synthesis, to investigate the relationship be tween voice source pa rameters (including f0) a nd per ceived affect. A first objective is to examine to what extent affective changes may be cue d by glob al, utterance -wide shifts in the source parameters and /or local shifts that are aligned to the prosodic st ructure of the utter ance. The second goal of this r esearch is to build a simple model for affect expression that can, in principle, be expl oited in speech synthesis. This goal A. N\u00ed Chasaide , Ch. Gobl 66 motivated by practical considerations , as it would be desirable to be able to implement basic aff ective shifts in the synt hetic speech output of an Irish (Gaelic) text -to-speech (TTS) system (www.abair.ie ) which is increasingly bei ng used in applications for education and for users with disabilities. We aspire to enable a synthetic uttera nce to be pro duced with some basic aff ective modulation, e.g., to render the narration of a stor y more engaging to a young user, o r to allow a disa bled user to modify the voice of speech -based systems they use to communicate. The research question for this project wou ld therefore be: Research questions What are the roles of glob al (utterance -wide) and local (within -utterance, prosodically structure d) changes in voice parameters (i.e., involving voice quality and fundamental frequency) in signalling affect ive states ? Hypothesis The signaling of affect is ultimately more a matter of prosodically structured shifts in the voice source parameters than glo bal shifts through the entirety of an utterance. Methodology The project involves the a nalysis of newly eli cited productio n data as well as drawing on past research in the area as a basis for the construction of synthetic stimuli which incorporate either g lobal or local voice source changes, as well as stimuli where both types of manipulations are incorporated. The analytic study Analysis is current ly ongoin g on recordings carried out in the semi -anechoic chamber of the Phonet ics and S peech Lab oratory at T rinity College Dublin. The subject is a young male speaker of Kerry Irish and a pro fessional actor. He was chosen based on the fact that the curren t Kerry Irish male synthetic voice (available at www.abair.ie ) is based on his voice, and this TTS system is envisaged as a potential testbed for the emerging model of affect manipulation. Declarative, semantically n eutral Irish se ntences with long open vo wels were created, containing two o r three (potentially) accented syllables. The subject was then asked to re ad the sentences so as to portray different affects, including neutral , angry, sad, happy/excited , interest ed, relaxed/con tented and bored. Multipl e repetitions were recorded, and the subject was advised to keep repetitions consistent in terms of intonatio n patterns. From the recordings, a few ex emplars were chosen on the basis of an informal listening session conducted at t he Phonetics and Speech L aboratory involving the authors and colleagues. The selection of the two final exemplars was based on the cri teria that (1) the utterances were perceived as good Explo ring the prosody of affective speech 67 portrayals of a desired affect, and (2) the intonati on pattern of the recording matched the ex pected intonation pattern which is typically found in the output of the TTS system, i.e., sentences had the t ypical falling contour of this dialect, and did not involve sh ifts in nu clear placement. Analysis methods The chosen exemp lars were then manually i nverse-filtered and the resulting estimate of the voice source sig nal was modelled using the Liljencrats -Fant (LF) model (Fant, Liljencrants and Lin, 1985) . For details o n the software system and the techniques used, see N\u00ed Chasaid e, Gobl and Mona han (1992) and Gobl and N\u00ed Chasaide (2010) . The LF model is a mathematic al glottal flow model that allows extraction o f voice so urce parameters. The main parameters of interest to this research are f0 ; EE (excitation s trength ) which is clos ely related to the overal l intensity of the signal; and RD, a measure relating to the perceived tension in the voice, where RD is typically high for lax voice and low for tense /harsh voice (see Laver, 1980, for an in -depth description of voice qualit y). Samples were then segmented and annotated using the Praat softw are (Boersma and Weenink, relative to t he prosodic st ructure of the utterances (example shown in figure 1) . Figure 1.

Recordings and resynthes is of a parallel set of stimuli will be carried out for a female synthetic v oice for the Connemara dialect, whose basic intonation con tours are roughly similar to the Kerry renditions. These resy nthesized stimuli will then be used on perception tests in order t o evaluate the effec tiveness of the manipulations in the perception of affect by listener judges.

Verbs agree wit h subjects in person an d number in the present and future t ense and in number and gender (in singular) in the past tense. Previous c omprehension studies on Rus sian found attraction effe cts both in number agreement e t al., but never compared the m. In production, Lorimor et al. (2008) studied both features in one expe riment, eliciting some numb er errors, but no gender errors (such errors were observ ed by Slioussar and Malk o (2016) , but the ir study did not includ e number agreement). Lorimor et al. conclud ed that gender agreement is more resistant to attraction , and experiments on Romance language s (e.g. Vigliocco et al., 1995) point to the same conclusion. A. Ivano va, N. Slioussa r 70 Experiment Method 130 Russian nativ e speakers ( 18-70 years old, mean age 22,4) took part in th e experiment. We constructed 28 target sentence sets , as in (1). In all s entences, the head of the s ubject noun phrase was a feminine or neuter noun in nominative singular1. The number and gender o f the accusati ve depend ent noun and the predicate varied ac ross seven experimental conditions shown in Table 1. All heads and depend ent nouns were inanimate an d syncretic (their accusative forms c oincided with their nominative forms) to maximize attraction effects (see Slioussar 2018; Slioussar et al. 2022 for the role of syncretism in agreement processing in Russian).

Dependent Three conditions were grammatica lly correct ( i, iii, vi in Table 1), four contained number (ii, iv) and gender (v, vii) agreement errors. In the conditions in which t he ungra mmatical features of the predicate matched the relevant features of the de pendent n oun (iv, vii) attraction effects cou ld be expected. Target sentences in different conditions were distributed across 7 experimental lists. There were also 66 grammatical filler sentences. The word -by-word self -paced reading methodolo gy on the IbexFarm platform was used in the experiment . After one third of the sentences participan ts were asked a comprehension que stion with a choice of two answers to ensure that they were paying attention. No participants were excluded based on low acc uracy, and bel ow, only RTs are discussed. Results Firstly , we excluded all RTs that exceeded a thre shold of 2.5 standard deviations, by region and condition, from further analysis. This led to the exclusion of 0.8% of the data. Mean reading times in differ ent conditions are show n in Figure 1 (we c hecked that the p icture was very similar for the sentences with feminine and neuter subjec t nouns and analyzed them t ogether). Comparing number and gender agreement processing in Russian 71 Figure 1. Average RTs per region (in ms) in the seven experimental conditions. Regions: were modelled with a mixed -effects regression in the R software . Random intercepts and random slopes by participant and by i tem were included in th e model. Three factors were consider ed: number (number agreement error: yes/no), gender (gender agreement err or: yes/no), match (the features of the subject match the features of the dependent noun: yes/no). Statistically significant differences b etween co nditions were found only on the fift h word (a participle, like 'found' factor ( SE=6,83, z=6,59, p<0,01) were significant, showing that readers sl owed down on a greement errors . As we can see from the -values , the effect of gender errors was more noticeable. The inter action bet ween number and match (=43,44, also re ached signific ance, i.e. similar attraction effects were detected for number and gender agreement . Other comparisons were not signif icant. Discussion Tucker et al.'s (2021) study on Standard Arabic was the only comprehension study comparing number and gend er agreement a ttraction. They found that number attraction effects were smaller in comparison to gen der agreement , but reached signi ficance earlier (on the verb, not on the following word). At the same time, Tucker et al . noted that number attraction in Ar abic appeared to differ from what was observed in other languages . Therefore, it was important to look at other languages to see if the comparison would yield similar results. Our experiment demonstrated that in Russian, number and gender agreement attract ion profiles a re very similar i n comprehension, both in terms of the effect size and timing. However , the delay provoked b y gender agreement errors (both with and without attraction) was more pronounced in comparison to number errors. How to explain these findings and t o rec oncile them with the results of production stud ies (Lorimor et al., 2008) showing that number attractio n errors a re more frequent? A. Ivano va, N. Slioussa r 72 Stronger reaction to gender errors may have the following explanation . Gender is a property of the lexeme , while number is a property of a particular form, most nouns have both singular and plural, but only one gender. Maybe, this also explains why number attraction errors are more frequent in production \u2014 gender agreement may be in general more resistant to errors. Howeve r, if an error is present \u2014 and in comprehension studies , they are purposefully introduced in the stimul i \u2014 the same retrieval mechanisms are activated to check number and gender features, so attraction profiles are similar. Further experimen ts are necessa ry to check whether these results would generalize to other constructions in which attraction is observed, m ost import antly, to relative clauses that were studie d by Tucker et al . (2021) , and to other languages with number and gender agreemen t. Our results are also interesting in the light of recent findings on Russian showing that in some other tasks that invok e memory , the number feature is more salient than the gender feature (Antropova et al., 2022) . We can conclude that different properti es of features become relevant depending on the nature of t he task.

Investigating vocabulary loss permits to find differences in the quality and quantity of linguistic knowledge that deteri orate s through attrit ion processes . This longitudinal study evaluated the effects of study abroad program s on L1 cognate and non -cognate word retrieval . Subjects were French -English bilinguals spendin g one to two semesters in an Engli sh-speaking country. Results of a picture -naming task show that th e participants experienced less tip-of-the-tongue states in their L1 than in their L2 and retrieved cognate s more easily than non -cognates . Profiling questionnaires helped to evaluate the co rrelation between those results and the ir monthl y exposu tip-of-the-tongue experiment; lexical retrieval; language dominance Introduction The phenomenon of non-pathological loss of a native or fi rst language (L1) is called attrition and can occur in a bilingual's (or multiling ual's) lif e when he or she acquires and uses an additional langua ge (L2) , leading to an impoverishment of the first language ( Schmid a nd K\u00f6pke, 2009). This provokes changes i n the structural aspects of the language and the speaker's proficiency in the firs t language . Previous research indicates that vocabulary is one of the more vulnerable linguistic abilities (K\u00f6pke and Schmid , 2011). T he attrition of the L1 is not only a con sequence of the lack of u se of it, but also a consequence of transling uistic influ ences that are entailed by the contact with the second language (Kroll & St ewart, 1994) . During studies abroad, a shift of domi nance c an ensue: the L1 is used less frequently, and lexical access becomes harder, while L2 proficiency increases . The competiti on between both languages as well as a dominance switch may lead to L1 attrition . Lexical access has been found to be one of the most vulnerable linguistic skills ; and tip -of-the-tongue occurrences hint a t a deterred acces s to the phonological for m of the word , whil e the concept is activate d. To account for TOTs in L2 , two main frameworks have been hypothesis (Gollan, Montoya, Cera & Sandoval, 200 8), which postulates that the more restricted use of L2 leads to weakened conne ctions between form and concepts , and language competition or cross -language interference , which V. Kamp , M. P\u00e9lissie r 74 assumes that impaired retrieval comes from com petition from the other language . This study focused on investigating the effects of studies abroad on L1 vocabulary loss . As it bec omes harder to retrieve words in the neglec ted language, more tip-of-the-tongue states should occur. Methods Participants 19 native speakers of French aged 19 to 25 took part in this study . All were university students completing a bac helor o r master 's degree and had intermediate to advanced proficiency in Engli sh. All participants were spending one (n=3) or two semesters ( n=16) abroad for studies in an Eng lish-speaking country . All participants filled out a questionnaire investigating their background as bilingua ls. This was then followed by monthly f orms to rec ord the frequency of use for both languages . Materials and proced ure The participants were teste d on L1 word retrieval on three occasions during their stay. A list of 420 stimul i were se lected , comprising 180 English non - cognate w ords, 180 French non -cognate words and 180 French -English cognate s. All stimuli were low -frequency words (frequency inferior to 50 per million occurr ences ) and were associated with black line drawings taken from the IPNP (Szekely et al., 2004 ) or drawn in the same s tyle by the authors . Six balanced sets of 120 words were created, three in each language . Cognates were the same in English and Fren ch equivalent sets . The pictu res were shown one by one on th e screen a nd the par ticipant had to name them as fast as possible while the experimenter re corded possible T OTs. We predicted that participants would ex perience more TOTs in Fren ch by the end of the year, fewe r TOTs in English, and name cognates more accu rately than non -cogn ates. Analysis and results Analyses were run in R ( R Core Team, 2022 ) with linear mixed -effect models and general ised linear mixed -effect . Accuracy data was anal ysed with a binomial linear mixed -effect model wit h a logit link with Accur acy as a d ependent variable and Language , Cognate status , Sessio n and their interaction as fixed effects. Random effects included an in tercept b y Participant and an intercept by Item. Analyses on the TOT accuracy data showed a significan t effect of Langua ge ( = -0,58, SE = 0.07, z = 7.69, p < .001), as participants experienced more TOTs in English than in French ( English: M = 9.31 %; French: M = 5.67 %). The effect of Cognate st atus (cognate or non -cognate) was also significant ( = 0.86, SE = 0.12, z = 6.95, p < .001) as TOTs were experienced more frequently when naming non-cognate pictures than cognate ones ( cognates: M = 5.31 Dominanc e shift during the stay-abroad experience 75 non-cognates: M = 9.70 %). Finally, there was also a significant effect of Session: performance in session 1 was significantly dif ferent from sessio n 2 and session 3 ( = -0,43, SE = 0.06, z = 7.31, p < .001). The analysis showed that there was a significant interaction between Session and Cognate status ( = 0,41, SE = 0.12, z = 3.49, p < .001 ; see Figure 1). Pairwise comparisons show ed that the cognate effect was present in each sessi on (all ps < .001), but that the effect was twice as big in session 3 ( = 1.269) than in session 1 ( = 0.594) (see Figure 1) . Figure 1. TOT rate as a function of Cognate status and Session (in both languages) Discussion This study investigated the L1 vocab ulary loss of French -English bilinguals spending a year abroad . Results of this exploratory exp eriment are in line with previous studies on two points: there was a facilitation effect linked to the cognate status of the sti muli and participants experience d more TOTs in their L2. However, t he results were inconclusive in relation to th e starting hypothesis , given that the number of TOTs decrease d over the course of the year more for cognates than for non -cognates , no matter the lang uage. Several reasons can explain the re sults that contradict the starting hypothesis. For one, the pool o f participants was not ideal i n the sense that three of them only stayed for o ne V. Kamp , M. P\u00e9lissie r 76 semester abroad an d that thr ee participant s were French Lang uage teac hers in their host countr y. Additionally , two semesters have proven to be too short a time to have any conclusive results regarding loss of lexical access in L1 , especially when the reality of study abroad programs is that studen ts tend to speak m ore of th eir L1 th an anticipated . As for the difference between the first session and the two that followed, one explanation can be that the experimenter was not as precise in the way she registered the answe rs as she was getting used to the task and the process a nd tende d to confuse re al tip-of-the-tongues with a \"feeling of knowing\" . If the experiment was to be redo ne, it wo uld also be import ant to hav e the option to record quickly resolved TOTs so as to have more accurate data. The fact that the TOT rat e diminis hed more for cognates than for non- cognates could point to habituation to the task . It could also suggest that there is increased non-selective acti vation (Marian & Spivey, 2003 ), due to more balanced bilingualism as the participants' proficiency in French does not decrease while their proficiency i n English increases. Addit ional rese arch is needed to inv estigate this possibility . References Bates, D., M aechler, M., Bolker, B., & Walker, S. 2015. Fitting linear mixed -effects models using lme4.

The analysis of the data revealed that the level of language proficiency, mode of narration (telling/retelling) affected their narrative abilities, as the measures of proficiency in HL were correlated with the macro - structure. The grammaticality analysis revealed that functional categories were the most vulnerable d omain for Russian heritage children, which may have been due to cross - linguistic interference or developmental/language acquisition pattern in the language - contact settin g. The number of errors was correlated with the language proficiency measures . Keywor ds: Russian Herit age children, narrative skills, macro -structure, grammaticality Heritage language development and narrative skills Heritage language maintena nce and deve lopment depend on family language policy, language dominance, frequency of use, lingui stic distance and similarity between the minority and the majority languages or (dia)lects of the society, multi -directionality of cross -linguistic influence and accommod ation (Rothman et al., 2019). The present study investigate d narrative skills of Russi an heritage child ren in Cyprus, with the focus on macro -structure (story structure, structural complexity and internal states terms), micro -structure and gram maticality, i.e. the extent to which utterances follow the grammatical rules of a language. Gramma ticality in narra tive tasks can predict language development (Bedore et al., 2010). Narratives can measure cognitive, linguistic and social skills of bilingu al and multi lingual children in a less biased way than standardized assessments of language. Narra tives can help to identify linguistic, cognitive, semantic and social abilities, communicative competence and cultural awareness of a child. Narrative skills are essentia l for children's success at school. There is a relationship between oral language (exp erience with and exposure to discourse) and literacy (Westby, 2012). Cultural communities, language environment, home language use, parental attitudes towards bilingual a nd bi -cultural learning, S. Karpava 78 the level of language proficiency are some of the factors tha t can affect the development of narrative abilities (Fiestas, 2004). The Study The participants of the study were 40 Russian -Cypriot Greek simultaneous biling ual children . Their age ranges from 4;0 to 6;0 (mean 5;2), and they attend kindergarten and primar y CG schools, whe re the language of instruction is Greek. The LITMUS -MAIN, the multilingual assessment instrument for narratives (Gagarina et al., 2015) was u sed for data collection. Their language proficiency in Russian was measured by the Russian Profici ency Test for Multilingual Children (RPTMC) (Gagarina et al., 2010). Background information was collected using parental questionnaires and interviews. The narratives wer e recorded, transcribed and analyzed in terms of macro -structure and grammaticality. G rammaticality per centages were calculated for each child. Results The analysis of the data revealed that Russian heritage speakers had better productive skill s than perce ptive lexical skills, and that they had superior performances with regard to noun prod uction in compari son to verb production, which was not the case for lexical comprehension. The difference between the two age groups regarding such language p roficiency m easures of their heritage Russian language as the comprehension of grammatical structu res, morphologica l marking on the verb, and receptive and productive lexicon confirmed that there was a developmental pattern regarding their heritage languag e, see Table 1.

Overall, this is in line with previous findings that the retelling mode elicits longer and more detailed n arratives wit h a more complex story structure than does the telling mode (e.g. Otwinowska et al., 2 020). The ages of the participants appeared to affect their narrative skills, particularly their use of ISTs, story structure and their comprehension of the story. The le vel of language proficiency affected their narrative abilities, as it was found that t he measures of pr oficiency in the heritage language were correlated with the macro -structure measures. There was an obvious effect of chronological age and l anguage profi ciency, both for production and comprehension, which is in line with previous studies (e.g. Lindgren, 2019).

Since d iscussions on vac cine hesitancy are often taken on social networking sites, data from Swedish social media are used to study and quantify the sentiment among t he discussants on the vaccination -or-not topic during pha ses of the COVID -19 pandemic . Out of all the posts analyz ed a majority showed a stronger negative sentiment , prevailing throughout the whole of the exami ned period, with some spikes or jumps due to t he occurrence of cer tain vaccine -related events distingui shable in the results. Sentiment analysi s can be a valuab le too l to track public opinions regarding the use, efficacy, safety, and importance of vaccinat ion. Keywords: vaccine hesitancy, sent iment an alysis, Swedish , explo ratory study Introduction and backg round According to the World Health Organization (2019) v accine hesitancy, \"the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines \", was one of the top -10 threats to global health even before the pande mic. Although vaccinations are con sidered as one of the most significant interventions to public h ealth, vaccine hesitanc y and resistance creates serious concerns for a significant p art of a population in many countries, including Swed en. Vaccine discussions ar e often taken online in vario us social media platforms. For many people, the use of su ch platforms is the major source for information related to health issues including vaccinations (Klimiuk et al., 2021 ). Consequently , the availa bility of such digital content enables researchers to rapidly analyze and monitor large am ounts of data, to e.g., identify and better underst and the vaccine -deniers' arguments against vaccinations which in t urn, can rapidly be spread as rumours to an even wider audience. The aim of this study is to investigat e the Swedish public sentiment reflected in discussions r elated to th e COVID-19 vaccines (Scannell et al., 2021 ; Yousefinaghani et al., 2021 ). Sentiment analysis could guide us to identify, classify and quantify posts related to vaccine hesitancy and provi de useful info rmation to assist public health experts and pro-vaccine organizations to formulate eve n more targeted policies and strategies to reduce ant i-vaccine reactions . This work is part of a project Dimitrios Kokkinakis , M.-M. Hammarlin 82 that investigates vaccination skepticism , and how i t can be understood as an expression of civic engagemen t in the present digital times. Data collection and preparati on The data in the study comes from a popular Swedish open discussion pla tform Flashback Forum . Fourteen threads have been chosen that discu ss topics related to vaccination, such as Vad ska man g \u00f6ra om man v\u00e4grar ta corona -vaccin? 'What to do if you refuse to take the corona vaccine? '; collec ted prospectively between Sept. 2020 - Jan. 2022; 21,000 unique posts from over 2000 unique users . For each post, we stored the tex t and relevant metadata suc h as the date of publication and the number of posts produced by each user. During prepro cessing, duplicate posts were remove d and transformed to lower case . The dataset was further tokenized ( s were conver ted to a text description ( : <smiling face with sunglasses >). Multiword ex pressions and phrasal verbs were also recognized, and their contiguous components were joined with an underscore prior to further processing (spanska sjuk Sentiment anal ysis ( Liu, 2012 ) is a n application that infers subjective aspects of writing such as opinions, feelings, and classify the polarity of a text as positive , negative , or neutral. Sentiment analysis is a technol ogy that all ows us to gain a wider public opinion behind c ertain topics and a picture of how public o pinion develops over time . There are many ways to approach the task (Birjali et al., 2021). Here, we apply a \"classic al\" dictionary -based approach ha ving a Swedish word list as its main component (SenSaldo ; Rouces et al., 2018). Each tokenized text fragment in each post, is assigned a sentiment value according to SenSaldo . Moreover, since the polarit y of individual words can change, when the se are used in sp ecific contexts, we also identif y sentiment shifters , i.e., modifiers that change the sentiment orientation of words , e.g., via negation . Finall y, the sum of the words' sentiment values for each post are summarized and scored , as the ratio of words ' sentim ent values by the total number of tokens in a post. E.g., for the det you iots who are hysteric al and the real numbskulls' there ar e 3 underlined negative words found out of the 12 , which return s a negative score of -25. Exploratory analysis Sentiment analysis is the p ractice of extra polating the sentiment of an idea or event by automatically class ifying written texts as some polarity value . In the specific context of vaccine hesitancy/ skepticism , the people's attitudes present a dominant negative polarity throughout the whole co vered period with 56.2% negative , 25.1% positive and 18.7% neutral posts . Figure 1 (left) show s the 25 most frequent positive ( left; the most freq uent is: 'fullt frisk' frequent is: 'allvarlig sjukdom ' serious disease ) Negative vaccine voices in Swedish social media 83 multiwords in the data as word clouds . Figure 1 (right) shows the proportion of positive/negati ve users in thread t3342731: Vaccinera de, n\u00e4r kan ni t\u00e4nka er ta en tredje dos? 'Vaccinated, when can you imagine taking a third dose? '. Using sentiment analysis, negat ive voices can be identified an d further analyzed usin g qualitatively driven mixed methods such as the sociologically -grounded narrative typology (Frank, 2013 ), and the exploration of the civic aspects of ethnological research . These are research directions that we have already started to explore in this projec t (cf. the Acknow ledgement s). Figure 1 (left). The 2 5 most frequent multiword sentiment s in the who le data (positive at the top and negative at the bottom ). Figure 1 (right) . The proportion of posi tive/ negative users in thread t3396531 . Conclusions, limitations and f uture work It is well establis hed that the In ternet provides valuable resources to fight vaccine hesitancy , provid ing insights to vaccine -undecided individuals concerns . Digital tec hnologi es such as sentiment analysis are important tools which can be used for gaining he lpful insights i nto various com plex heal th related topics (cf. Sandhya et al., 2021). Since this is an exploratory study there are many questions left for future work, for in stance to investigate whether the positive sentiment messages are t he pro -vaccinat ion messages whi le the negative sentiment messages are the voice of the op posite. The key motivation of sentiment analysis is to analyze a body of text for understandi ng the opinion expressed by it. Public sentiment is important to e.g., determining approp riate interventi ons and policie s, and therefore these have been used in Dimitrios Kokkinakis , M.-M. Hammarlin 84 many scientific and commercial applications. Nevertheless, sentiment analysis has it s limit ations with respect to accuracy, which can be lower for certain typ es of creative language use suc h as sarcasm an d irony (Hern\u00e1ndez Farias & Rosso, 2017). In the future, we would like to improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis tool by employi ng more advanced techniques that can also capture subtleties of opinion an d emotions beyo nd simple polari ty (Izard, 2009 ). The dictionary -based approach , perhaps i s not the best technique (Atteveldt et al., 2021). Thus, to demonstrate the ef fective ness of th is appro ach, a comparison between different methods (e.g., dictionary vs machi ne learni ng) is left for future research. Another limitation o f this work is th e use of a small set of social media po sts, and from only one availabl e site . This might cause a sampling b ias, therefore, soon we plan to enhance the dataset wi th posts f rom two other m ajor social medi a sites, such as Familjeliv (www.f amiljeliv.se/).

ExLing 20 22 Paris : Proce edings of Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Exploring the role of L1 reading ability when reading in L2 Anastasiia Konovalova , Vladislav Zubov Ludmila Verbitskaya Department St Petersburg University, Russia n Federation https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract The present rese arch is devoted to the stu dy of the role of L1 (Russian) reading ability when reading in L2 (Englis h). The text comprehension was assessed using a question and answer technique and a keywords method (Murzin, Stern 1991). Q&A results analysis did not reveal differences between the number of cor rect answers to questions for differen t texts in the same lan guage and the same texts in different, however, a significant difference in comprehension of one of the texts in L1 and another one in L2 was found. It is ass umed that this difference is due to a combination of text content and text language factors. Compa rison of a set of keywords will allow us to evaluate this contribution of these factors more specifically. Keywords: reading, text comprehension , L2, questio n and answer technique , keywords method Introduction The study of the mecha nisms of reading and te xt comprehensi on is one of the main topics of experimental linguistics. This topic is essential for the construction of theoretical models of speech perceptio n and in the development of reading theory. Text comprehension includes the construction of an abs tract meaning based on the decoding of lin guistic material, as well as the integration of new information and background knowledge into the mental text repres entation (Borisenko, Shulekina 2021). The success of text comprehension is influenced by many fact ors, such as r eader characteristics (age, reading experience, reading disorders, etc.), text characteristics (complexity, text format, genre), etc. The role o f the language system in text processing is well studied in psycholinguisti cs, pedagogy, psycholog y, neurophysio logy, however, the role on l anguage in text comprehension needs further exploration. L2 reading studies claim that L2 language knowledge, L1 reading ability, strategic knowledge, and background knowledge contribute to reading comprehension, e mphasizing the need to study each factor a s independent (McNeil 2012). A. Konovalova , V. Zubov 86 Materials The material of the study was two pairs of non -fiction prosaic texts from (Kuperman et al. 2022) , one text tells the story of the origin and meaning of the shaka gesture ('Shaka'), the second is about the god Janus ( 'Janus '). Russian and English texts readability indices were close (see Table 1 below). The text readability was as sessed using readable.com (Eng lish) and readability.io (Russian) services. Participants 112 native speakers of Ru ssian (93 female, age 18-59, Mage = 22.91) took part in the experiment . All participants speak English at the level B2-2 (B2 - 128 partic ipant s, C1 14 partic ipants ). The participants determined the language level them selves, based on their competencies. In addition, participants reported the number of years they have been learning English (M = 13.14). Method Participants were asked to read two texts in L1 and L2, write out 10 keywords from the te xts, and answer 8 quest ions on th e content of the text: 2 multiple choice questions, 2 questio ns that require a detailed answer, and 4 general questions. While answering the questi ons the participant could not return to the text. The keywords w ere defined for participants as 'words from t he text that are most important in terms of the text content '. Each participant assessed the subjective complexity of the text on a scale from -3 to 3 (for ease of analysis, the scale was converted to seven points, where - the easiest text, 7 - the most difficult) . The method of keywords extraction and anal ysis is described in [ Murzin, Shtern 1991 ]. A group of participants is asked to write out key words from the text. Each of the participants will extract their own set of ke ywords. Some words will be common, some will be different, which is due, on the one hand, to the same understanding of the text, and on the other hand, to the individual difference s in the understanding of both the content of the text a nd the t ask of index ing. For each word that appears in the answers, you can determine the absolute frequency of occurrence (m), as well as the relative frequency of occurrence (p): p = m / n, where n is the number of participants . The group of words that received the highest relative frequency of o ccurrence constitutes th e \"true\" set of keywords. Exploring the role of L1 reading ability when reading in L2 87 Results and discussion In this paper, only quantitative data will be analyzed (see Table 1 ). Table 1. Char acteristics of texts and average values of participants' answers . Text Lang uage Flesch -Kincaid Grade level SMOG formula Correct answers Subjective complexity rate Janus English 10.40 12.70 6.46 3.07 was f ound betw een the number of correct answers to questions to texts on L2 and the level of L2 proficiency (Spearman 's rho = 0.411, p < 0.001), as well as the number of years of studying L2 (Spearman 's rho = 0. 199, p < 0.038). Some studies s uggest that there i s a positive correlatio n between L2 proficiency and academic performance, others say that the relationship is not significant (see Al -Busaidi 2021 for a review). The discrepancy in f indings may be since there is no clear definition of th e concepts of langu age proficiency and aca demic achievement, variations in research design and data collection techniques and other reasons. All texts in a foreign language were evaluated more difficul t than texts in their native language (t = 4.38, p < 0. 001). No statistica lly significant correla tion was found between the subj ective text complexity assessment and readability indices (Spearman 's rho = -0.07, p = 304 for Flesch -Kincaid ; Spearman 's rho = 0.059, p = 0 .381 for SMOG ), which can be explained by t wo reasons: either the shortcomings of the readability index formulas for different languages, or the fact that the complexity of the text is a more voluminous concept than readability and is not direc tly related to readability (Hiebert 2011). Analysis did not reveal differe nces between the n umber of correct answers to questions for different texts in the same language (p Tukey = 0.493, p Tukey = 0.671) and the same texts in differ ent languages (p Tukey = 0.292, p Tukey = 0.449), however, a significant differen ce in comprehension of one of the tex ts in L1 and another one in L2 (p Tukey = 0.021) was found. It is assumed that this difference is due to a combination of text content and te xt language factors. A similar result was obtained for subjective assessments o f complexity: the m ost complex text w as Janus i n English, and the easiest was Shaka in Russian. Janus in Russian and Shaka in English were rated the same (pTukey = 0.104). In a further study, it is pla nned to analyze the keywords extracted by the participa nts when reading th e text on L1 and L2. Co mparison of sets of keywords can, firstly, assess the text comprehension skill on L1 and L2 in more detail, and sec ondly, descri be more specifically the contri bution of language processing to text comprehension.

This paper focuses on the way in whic h different classes of verbs affect the subsequent discourse in terms of implicit causality . We report on an offline sentence -continuation study that tested next mention preferences triggered by four Romanian classes of verbs and compare th em these results with verbal biases observed in other languages. Keywords: implicit causality, verbs, prono un resolution , next mention , Romanian Introduction Natural languages display a great variety of devices that may be used to speak of causal relations , such as prepos itions, sentence connectives (e.g. because, so ), or verbs , as for example impress or hit. The present paper focuses on implicit causal relations expressed int er-clausally by verbs. Implicit causality (IC) refers to the property of interpers onal verbs to re late two human or animate entities in such a way that one of the entities is \"implicated as the assumed locus of the underlying cause of the action or attitude (Garvey and Caramazza 1974: 460)\". The literature distinguishes between three c lasses of verbs in terms of their effect on the subsequent discourse : some, such as telephone or approach assign the cause of the event to the first noun phrase (NP1), the subject, while other verbs, such as fear or praise attribute the cause to the second noun phrase (NP 2), the object. The third class of verbs, such as see or hear, are considered neutral towards the assignment of the cause. The proportion of continuations picking up the subject or the object referent is referred to as IC bias (e.g. Crinena n & Garnham 2006 ). These biases towards the subject or the object referent are manifestations of an expectation about who will be mentioned next in the discourse, but they can also affect the resolution of a subsequent pronoun or the coherence relation use d in the next se ntence (Garvey et al. 1974, Kehler, Kertz, Roh de & Elman 2008, Hartshorne & Snedeker 2014 Chiriacescu 2011, Lindemann & Homan 2019). It was argued that this property is rooted in the argument structure properties of verbs. In the current pa per, we focus on next- mention biases triggered by interpersonal verbs. S.-I. Lindemann , M. Matei 90 One central question in the literature on IC pertains to the cross -linguistic and cross -cultural validity of these biases. Moreover, those studies comparing IC biases in different langu ages found that even though IC effects display similar patterns, the strength of these effects differs among languages. This paper reports on an off -line sentence -continuation study in which we tested the implicit causality biases of four classes of interp ersonal verbs in Romanian. The experimental study The aim of the study was to examine the implicit causality biases of 48 Romanian verbs in terms of their next-mention preferences . We furthermore investigated the coherence relations used to introduce the event in the immediately following sentence. Participants 56 monolingual native speakers of Romanian from the Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania, took part in the experimental study (age range: 18 -45 years, mean age 28 y ears, 29 female). It took ab out twenty minut es to complete each version of the study. Design, materials and procedure We selected 48 verbs according to two criteria: (i) they belong to one of the four classes of verbs discussed in Rudolph & F\u00f6rsterling (1997) : Agent Patient-Agent (PA), Stimulus -Experiencer (SE), Experiencer -Stimulus (ES); and (ii) they were tested in other languages with respect to their IC biases (e.g. Goikoetxea, Pascual & Acha 2008 ; Bott & Solstad, 2014 ). Two same -gendered human referents were mention ed in each exper imental item. We manipulated the verb class , by choosing verbs form the four main classes of verbs discussed in the literature on implicit causality (IC): AP, PA, ES, SE verbs, as illustrated in Table 1. Participants were instructed to writ e one sentence c ontinuation to each item , which did not end in a (pronoun or connective) prompt . The resulting corpus of 1886 continuations was annotated with respect t o choice of subsequent mention, i.e. whether participants opted to continue the next sen tence re -mention ing the initial subject (NP1) or the initial object (NP2). Predictions In light of previous findings ( e.g. Goikoetxea et al. 2008; Hartshorne & Snedeker 2013 ), we expect IC to affect the choice of subsequent mention, such that we obtain more subject contin uations for SE v erbs (i.e., NP1 biasing) object continuations for ES verbs (i.e., NP2 biasing). For AP an d PA verbs, we expect more heterogeneous results (e.g. Ferstl et al., 2011 ). Implicit causality in Romanian interperso nal verbs 91 Table 1. Sample experimental items with English translations Agent-Patient Marian l -a iertat pe Sorin. Gabriela . Diana liked Gabriela. Preliminary results Results show that implicit causality influences reference in terms of subsequent next mention. First, as expected, SE verbs were significantly more subject - biased ( at least 70%) than the ES verbs, which showed a clear preference for the initial direct object (at least 81%). The AP verbs showed a similar pattern , as the initial subject referents were more prone to be picked up in the immediately following matrix clause. Second, the distribution of the discourse r elations associated with the four verb types following a full stop reveals differences in terms of streng th and coherence type. Overall, participants preferred more explanation relations than any other type of continuation s. PA verbs prefer explanations in 92% of cases, while ES and SE verbs prefer them in 66% and 52% of cases respectively. For AP verbs, part icipants preferred elaborations (47%) and results (23%) rather than explanations (25%). We will discuss these results in light of cross -linguistic findings on implicit causality.

Scientific Bulletin of the Polit ehnica University of Timisoara 18 ( Paris of International Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France The L1 influence on the processing of L2 tense - aspect by L2 learn ers Yu Liu Department of Education , University of York , UK Abstract The present study aims to investigate the effect of L1 on the processing of L2 tense - aspect by adult Chinese and Arabic learners of English. A visua l-world eye -tracking task, a sentence -match ing task, and an acceptability judgement task were us ed to measur e the learners' L2 implicit and explicit knowledge. The preliminary results have suggested that L2 lea rners ' performance in on -line tasks was largel y influenced by their respective L1s, which suggests that late L2 learner s may not be able to fu lly acquire L2 morphosyntactic structure which are different in their L1. Keywords: cross -linguistic i nfluence, L2 tense -aspect, L2 processing Introduction The amount of research into the acquisit ion o f L2 tense -aspect has been increasing over the past t wo decades. Many previous studies have found that some learners have persistent difficulties or exhibit little pro gress in their learning and usage of L2 tense -aspect even they are advanced learners . Thi s often happens when the relevant L2 tense -aspect str uctures are different or absent in the learners' L1, which suggests that learners' L1 may have a strong or even pe rmanent influence on the acquisition of L2 gra mmatical knowledge. Some recent studie s (e.g., Roberts & Liszka, 2013) also found that even thou gh some lear ners are able to display explicit and correct knowledge of L2 tense - aspect, they are not ab le to apply their knowledge in real -time comprehension. A great majority of previous studies have fo cused on L2 learners from European language backgroun ds. Learners with Mandarin or Arabic L1 background are still underrepresented, and to my knowledge, the se two lear ner groups have not been paired together so fa r. Considering the two languages are very d ifferent in how they encode tense and aspect , it is w orth examining the influence of L1 by measuring L2 knowledge displayed by Chinese and Arabic learners. Methodology Participants The study includes one control group of native English speakers and two experimental groups of Chinese and Arabic native speak ers who learn English as a second language. All the participants were recruited at a university in Y. Liu 94 England, and th ey are all unive rsity students. All the L2 lea rners have achieved an IELTS score abo ve 6.5 or equivalent . Experiment design The present study employed two online measures and one offline measure to examine the participants' implicit and explici t knowledge . Firstly, a vis ual-world eye-tracking paradig m was adopted to look at the participa nts' anticipatory processing. Specifically, the participan ts are presented with a spoken sentence (e.g., The little girl washed her hands with soap after playing .) while vi ewing a visual image containing two pictures ( see Figure 1). It is anticipated that if th e participants are able to process the temporal infor mation encoded in the sentence, they would look more to the left picture area (completed event area) than the righ t picture area (ongoing event area) after hear ing the morphological form -ed. A tota l of 54 critical images and 54 fillers were created, and f or each critical visual image, three target sentences (one simple past, one present perfect, and one pr esent progr essive) were rec orded. Figure 1. Exampl e visual image used in the eye -trackin g task. Another sentence -matching task were used to look at participants' online sensitivity towards ungrammaticalities based on their reaction time. In this ta sk, partici pants are asked to judge a pair of sentences w hich are sequentially presented for th em an d decide whether the second sentence is identical to the first one in form. The response latency (RT) for each pair is analysed by focusing on the possible differences in the mean RTs be tween the grammatical and u ngrammatical pairs. A total of 48 crit ical items and 54 filler items were created . The set of 48 items comprised 16 items from each of the three grammatical constructions. Each test item contains two versions: the grammatical ver sion and ungrammatical vers ion. The ungrammatical version (the te nse/a spect violation) was designed by having a mismatch be tween the temporal adverbial in the topic position and the following verb (1, 2, 3). (1) Simple Past Two w eeks ago/* For the last two wee ks, Mike went to the birth day party of his best friend. The L1 influence on the processing of L2 tense -aspect by L2 learners 95 (2) Present Perfe ct For the last six months /*Six months ago , my two br others have studied Italian at a school in Rome. (3) Present Progressive Right now/*Last night Ella, is dan cing to her favourite song in her bedroom . In combinatio n of the two implicit measures, an acc eptab ility judgement task (AJT) was also included to measu re the participants' explicit knowledge. The test items are identical with the previous two tasks , and the partici pants need to judge the sentences regarding their grammatical acceptability using a scale from 1 (completely unacceptable) to 7 (completely ac ceptable). An oxford quick placement English test was also administered to the L2 learners. Results Eye-trackin g results , the average proportion of looks wer e computed in every 50ms time window o ver a period of 1800ms following the onset of the critical verbs (see Figure 1. An example time-course graph for two groups ). For the simple past items, L1 Engli sh and L1 A rabic groups showed similar preferential looks towards the completed event area at t he be ginning . Even though L1 Chinese group started looking more 550ms after the onset of the verb , the difference between their looks to the two areas was not si gnificant ( p=.091) . For the present perfect, both L2 lear ners showed delayed predication effect comp ared to the L1 English group, and all three groups st arted looking more to the ongoing event picture over time when hearing the verbs in the prese nt progres sive senten ces, which was confirmed by the time cluster a nalysis (p<.001). Figure 2. Mean pr oportion of looks to the two event areas for simple p ast items . Y. Liu 96 Sentence -matching results , for the simple past items, all three groups read the ungrammatica l pairs sli ghtly slower than the grammatical pairs, but the differences are not significant (L1 English group: b = 45.79, p=0.44; L1 Chinese group: b = Arabic group: b = 99, p=0.09 ). For the present perfect construction, L1 English group read the un grammatical pairs faster than the grammatical pairs ( b = -55.8, p=0.32), whereas the Chin ese and Arabic groups read them slower, but no statis tical significance were found (L1 Chin ese group: b = 30.9, p=0.55; L1 Arabic group: b = 39.26, p=0.48). Interestin gly, all three groups showed sensitivity towar ds the ungrammaticality in the present progressiv e sentences ( L1 English group: b = result , for the simple past i tems, all three groups rated ungrammatical sentences as less acceptable than grammat ical sentences (L1 English group: b = -1.07, L1 C hinese group: b = -1.22, L1 Arabic group: b = - 0.7, p<0.001 ). Similar results were found for present perf ect items ( L1 English: b = -1.46, p<0.001; L1 Chinese: b = -1.18, p<0.001; L1 Arabic : b = -0.59, p < 0.001 ), and for present progressive items (L1 English: b = -2.22, p<0.001; L1 Chinese: b ; L1 Arabic: b = -2.06, p<0.001). This suggests th at all three groups were able to distinguish t he incorrect use of tense -aspect . Discussio n Both Chinese and Arabic learners displayed correct explicit knowledge about English tense and aspect in the AJT task. However, unlike the L1 English and L1 Arabic g roups, the L1 Chinese group did not show any p redicative processing towards simple p ast items in the eye -tracking task which could be explaine d by the r eason that past tense is not grammaticalized in Chinese language. Both L2 learner groups were sensitive to the ungrammaticality of present progressive in the sentence -matching task, and th e usa ge of the progressive marker in Mandarin and the impe rfective f orm (express progressive meaning) in Arabic might have facilitated both L2 groups to show ant icipatory processing in the eye -tracking task. For the pr esent perfect, both L2 learner groups failed to show sensitivity to grammatical violations in th e sentence - matching task and displayed reduced predication effect in the eye -tracking task, which could also be th e L1 influence that the perfective form in Ara bic conveys both past meaning and pres ent p erfect meaning , and t he perfect marker in Mandarin is still not obligatory in some cases, and adverbials can be used to achieve the perfect meaning.

The results show that changing the response has an impact on response times . More importan tly, this impact occurs not only during the deci sion-making process but also throughout the task. This research may contribute to a better underst anding of response time data in off -line techniques and to fine -tuning experimental designs. Keywords ement; experimental ap proach has contri buted to a better understanding of the cognitive mechanisms involved in language comprehension and production from on -line and off -line techniques (cf., e. g., Fern\u00e1ndez & Cairns, 2018 ). However, serious concerns have been raised in the lit erature regarding methodological issues of the experiments, sometimes subtle but which can influence in many ways the resul ts. Off-line d ata from judgme nts about the well-formedness of linguistic stimuli are also subject to debate on methodological issues (e.g., Langsford et al., 2019, Leivada & Westergaard, 2020, Sch\u00fctze & Sprouse, 2013). Regarding data analysis and interpretation, in the experimental approach, the associ ation of question -answering times and the variables of interest can be tricky becaus e time mea sures a re influenced by multiple variables and unknown factors (Whelan, 2008). While this is true for outputs of both on -line and off - line techniques, researchers have prioritised the use of the former over the latter. On -line techniq ues are supp osed to capture p articipants' automatic processes in response to a linguistic stimulus. In contrast, off -line techniques capture the participants' conscious and reflexive p rocesses in response to ra 98 They are thus more likely to be influenced b y extra -linguistic variables (e.g., individual differences in working memory, attention, and degree of engagement with or during the task). In this work, we defend a more systematic at tention to off -line techniques and the value of the time measures extracted through them in linguisti c and psycholinguistic research. Our interest lies in participants' behaviours during task performance to identify signals regarding the degree of confiden ce, hesitation and engagement while deciding on a response. One of these behaviours refers to changes in responses and will be addressed in this paper. Method We analysed a dataset with 7,791 observations from questionnaires applied to 163 native Brazilia n Portuguese speakers (M age=27.4 5, SD=10.82; 118 females) with an undergraduate or a po stgraduate de gree in progress or completed. The data set is part of another study carried out by the authors (Louren\u00e7o -Gomes et al., in prep.) . The materials consisted of 16 experimental sentences an d 32 fillers and participants were instructed to indi cate, on a 7 -item Likert -type scale , the extent to which the situation de scribed in each sentence seemed accep table or realistic (1=not at all plausible; 7 =totally plausibl e). Participants had to fill in a consent form and a demographic and linguistic data form to complete the questionnaire. The questionnaires were implemented in a JavaScript web-based application that records (1) the responses, (2) any changes in responses , (3) how many times they are changed , and the time spent on (4) reading the stimuli , (5) marking the responses, and (6) submi tting them before proceeding to the following sentence . The study is part of an ongoing Project (Louren\u00e7o -Gomes, 2019) and had the approval of the et hics committee . Results The response times were categorized into five groups with probability quantiles for the statistical analyses. This approach was used as an alternative to the more commonly used data treatment since the distributi on of response times is highly skewed positive, and we have chosen not to exclude an y ob servations (considered outliers) nor proceed with a transformation in t he data (cf. Whelan, 2008, for a discussion). Our focus in this study is on general participant behaviours accompanying the performance of a linguistic task . Thus, we consider all time measures to be informative. R (version 4.2.0) and IBM SPSS (version 27.0.1.0) software wer e used for the analyses. With regard to the overall behaviour of the sample, the following was observed : (i) 550 cases (7.06%, of 7,991) of response changes in 1 42 participants ( 87.12%) ; (ii) in most cases (434, 78.91%), two responses were marked for the same item, and less frequently three (92, 16.73%) and between Tracking partic ipants' behavi our when performing lingui stic tasks 99 four and six (24 , 4.36%); (iii) the number of items with response changes in the same questionnaire varied between su bjects (Min. = 1, Max. = 12, M = 3.87, SD = 2.73). For the cases with no re sponse change (NRC) we found a uniform distribution of response times across t he categorised time groups and no significant difference was reached . In contrast, i n the response ch ange (RC) cases, a clear effect on the distribution of response times across time classes was observe d throughout the task (Figure 1). Figure 1. Graphic r epresentation of the contrast in the data distribution across time classes in cases with response cha nges (RC , on the left) and with no response changes (NRC , on the right) The results of the RC cases are as follows : The analysis showed significant differ ences in (i) time to read a sentence ( 2=11.302, df =4; p=0.023). A lower percentage of observations ( 14.6%) wer e in the class with the lowest reading times ; (ii) time to mark a first response ( 2=33.762, df =4; p<0.001). A higher percentage was clustered in the highest ti me class (26.5%) while 11.9% w ere in the lower time class; (iii) time to mark the last response ( 2=53.763, =4; p<0.001). A high percentage of observations (31.1% ) was found in the highest and lowest time classes (27.2%) ; and (iv) time to submit the response (2=11.925, df =4; p=0.018). The distribution of observations in the most extreme time classes did not vary markedly in this parameter compa red to the others ( 19.3%, 22%, 15.6%, 18.5% and 24.5%, from the lowest to the highest time class es, respectively). Considering all cases (RC and NRC), a significant association wa s found among: (i ) reading time and time to mark the last response ( 2=639.502, df= 16, p<0.001) . Lower and higher reading times were associated, respectively, with lower an d higher times to mark the last response; (ii) reading time and time to submit a respons e (2=478.251 , df=16, p<0.001). A high concentration of cases (51.3%) in the lowest time cl ass was found; (iii) time to mark last response and time to submit a response (2=2641,102, df= 16, p<0.001), where the concentration of cases was in the lowest t ime classes . ra 100 Final remarks There is a justified concern among researchers with the object of study , experimental design, materials, and data treatment and method of analysi s. Although assumed , participant s' general behaviours that may influence outcomes seem underexplored. By tradition, they have been included in a generic category as \"extra -linguisti c variables\". Perhaps, as a result, much is lost in interpreting the data. The work presented is part of an endeavour to pursue clues as to the degree of confi dence and hesitat ion in participants' responses and engagement while performing lingu istic tasks. Al though still exploratory, the topic is hoped to motivate further reflect ion and inspire future work.

ExLing 20 22 Paris : Proce edings of Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Testing the Endoskeletal Hypothe sis in English/Ger man bilingual code -switching Toby S. Lowthe r Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics, University of Oxford, UK https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract In this paper , I report an experiment which provides preliminary evide nce in favour of the Endoskeletal Hypothesis with respect to word order co nstraints on subordinate clauses in English -German bilingual se ntences. The debate between exoskeletal (structure -driven) and endoskeletal (lexically -driven) models of syntax remains a contentious i ssue in contemporary syntactic theory, yet there has been no theory - neutral attempt to distinguish between the prediction s of these two models. In this study, I utilise the unique opportunity presented by bilingual code -switched sentences to test the predi ctions of these two hypothesis against speaker judgements. The results of this exper imen t provide preliminary evidence in favour of the Endoskeletal Hypothesis (EnH). Keywords: Syntax, bilingualism, code -switching, Endoskeletal Hypothesis Introduction Within syntax, the merits of exoskeletal approaches (associa ting grammatical propertie s wi th structures) and endoskeletal approaches (associating grammatical prope rties with words) to syntax remain a contentious debate (Borer 2003). However, no prior experim ental work has tested these hypotheses in bilingual contex ts, which provide a unique opportunity to draw apart their empi rical predictions . In the present study , I examine d these differing experimental predictions through the lens of speak er judgements re garding word order in subordinate clauses in English -Germa n bilingual sentences. In subordinate clauses, English exhibits VO word order, while German has OV word order. Participants' preferences regarding word orde r can therefore tell us wh ich set of synta ctic constraints is being used in a given bilingual constr uction. The null hypothes is (H0) was that word order preference is unconditioned by linguistic context , varying by individual idiolect. I had two alternati ve hypotheses: that word o rder preference varied with the language of matrix clause and complementis er (H 1), as predicted by f unctional exoskeletal approaches; or that word order preference varied with t he language of the embedded verb (H 2), as predicted b y endoskeletal approaches The results of the study indicate that the Endoskeletal Hypothesis (EnH) holds true with respect to word order constraints in subordinate clauses in English -German bilingual co de-switched (CS) sentences. T.S. Lowthe r 102 Method ology Participants were recruited using the o nline recruitmen t service Prolific (www.prolific.co )[accessed 24.06.2021] and paid for their participation . A total of 79 participants completed the survey . Of these participants , 25 (31.6%) reported at least one pare nt speaking Engl ish at home, with 56 (70.9%) reporting at least one German speaking parent. The stu dy w as composed of a sentence judgement task and a forced choice task ( see Sc h\u00fctze and Sprouse 2013 ). The sentence ju dgement task involved rating written bi lingual English -German sentences on a 5 -point Likert scale ranging from 1 (a fully acceptable senten ce) to 5 (a fully unacceptable sentence). In the forced choice task, particip ants were presented with the matrix clau se, complementiser, and embedded subjec t of an English -German bilingual sentence, and asked to select one of two continuations or 'neither of the above'. A total of 94 stimuli were prepared for the sentence judgement task (10 practice sentences, 56 test se ntences, and 28 filler sentences ). For the forced choic e task, a total of 70 stimuli were prepared (10 practice s entences, 32 test sentence s, and 28 filler sentences ). Stimuli were pseudo -randomly allocated to four l ists per task using a Latin square metho d. Each participant was presented with a single list fo r each task, resulting in 98 responses per participant (a total of 7,742 responses, of which 1,738 were test sentences). The experiment was scripted in HTML and JavaScript for Ibex, and arm 01.07.2021, now defunct]. Tasks were completed successiv ely. All sentences were presented visually, and participant responses as well as response times were recorded. The data for the sentence judgement task were analysed using a linear mixed model fit by REML, modelling response score by linguistic condition, controlling for participant and test item. Interaction effects were examined with pairwise comparisons, using the Kenward -Roger degrees -of-freedom method and the Tukey meth od for p -value adjustment. In addition, summary statistics show significant outliers in response time , so I excluded high outliers for RT, using a Q3+(1.5*IQR) l evel filter as proposed by Tukey (1977). For the forced choice task, an initial generalised lin ear mixed model failed to converge. I therefore used a mul tinomial logistic regressi on m odel fit with a neural network, modelling categorical response value by l inguistic conditions. P-values were calculated with Wald tests, and this model was analysed und er pairwise comparisons. Results Sentence Judgement Task Visualisation showed a pref erence for VO order with English embedded verbs, and no clear word order preference with German embedded verbs . Endoskeletal Hypothe sis in English/Ger man code-switching 103 The linear model showed a significant main effect for word o rder (t = - 5.186, d.f. = 1,014, p < 0.0001 ), and interacti on effects for matrix clau se language by word order (t = -5.354, d.f. = 1,014, p < 0.0001 ) and embedded clause language by word order (t = -4.258, d.f. = 1,014, p < 0.0001 ). Pairwise comparisons con firmed that participants preferred a VO order with embedde d English verbs (p < 0.01) , and no significant preference for word order with a German embedded verb (0.345 < p < 0.83 4). In 'language -heavy' contexts where both the matrix clause la nguage and depen dent language variables differed from the embedded verb , the inverse pattern was obs erved: an English embedded verb in a German -heavy context showed no word orde r preference (p = 0.438), while a German embedded verb in a German -heavy contex t showed a prefe rence for VO order (p < 0.0001). Forced Choice Task Visua lisation showed a similar pattern to the previous task , except German embedded verbs seem to show a preference for OV order (see figure 1). Figure 1. Bar chart for forced choice task frequency o f response by condition, grouped by matrix clause language and dependent language. Pairwise comparisons on the multinomial logistic regression model confirmed the patterns observed in figure 1. With an English embedded verb, participants preferred a VO w ord order (p -values ranging from 0.0084 to < 0.0001) . In t he German case, the data a re less clear - a clear preference for OV is observed in the German monolingu al case (p = 0.0001), while the results for cases with German embedded verb and either a German matrix clause or T.S. Lowthe r 104 German dependents are not significant (p = 0.509, p = 0.988). Similarly, to the sentence judgement task, 'language -heavy' contexts show the opp osite pattern, with a strong preference for VO in English -heavy contexts despit e a German embed ded verb (p = 0.0005) and no preference in German -heavy co ntexts despite an English embe dded verb (p = 0.198). Discussion The results of this study suggest that verb phrase word order constraints in subordinate clauses in English -German bi lingual sentence s are typically determined by the embedded verb that heads the verb phrase, i.e., th at the EnH holds true. The data from 'language -heavy' contexts suggest that s peakers treat a single lexical item in a n otherwise monolingual sentence as a c ase of spontaneo us borrowing, rather than true CS, with predictable syntac tic differences. As partic ipant judgements appear to follow an endoskeletal pattern, and assuming an ap propriate relationship between linguisti c judgements and linguistic competence, these results suggest that exoskeletal theories of syntax (such as neocon structivist and cartograph ic approaches) are not psychologically plausible : they model linguistic compe tence as acting in a way which is not replicated by the psychological behaviour of speakers in the context of the present experiment . Thus, this study pr ovides an important contri bution, bringing experimental data and quantificational methods to bear on a fundamental question of syntax through t he lens of bilingualism.

On the other hand, except for the case of the Universi dad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California , in Mexico corpus linguistics ar e not used as an electronic resource for le arning English, particularly in Language Teaching or Translation. Thus, we show here a working method applied to a translation course for undergraduate students of English Language at the Universidad Veracruzana (Mexico). We consider the use of Sketch Engi ne and One Click term extractor, in order to assess what kind of impact (positive, negative or null) such tools might have when used to solve translation tasks in a set of engineering and medicine texts. Keywords: corpus linguistics, translation, terminol ogy, teaching, language . Introduction The CL is a research topic that has been gaining relevance in the most recent years in relation to its usage in language teaching. Therefore, it mig ht be highlighted that Gra nger has been one of its main exponents and the Pioneer in the research field focusing on the usage of CL for foreign languages teaching. In this regard, the corpus has been distinguished as a useful tool for teaching foreign languages, in this particular case of the English teaching. Notwithstandi ng, this methodology, as it is defined by McEnery et al (1996) , might not be limited to be exclusively employed for teaching English in a general way, but also in the translation field. This, with the aim to teac h and clarify specialized lexicon, which is denominated by Cabr\u00e9 (2011 ) as terminology. In this sense, a methodology, a strategy or a tool have not been implemented for students and professors ' performance regarding teaching as well as acquiring and managi ng with terminology adequately in English so as to translate specialized texts. Additionally, the hypothesis of this paper states that the use of CL turns out to be a useful tool for translation students in order to have a better understanding of terminolo gy in English and enhancing their F. Luna , C. Aguilar 106 translatio n performances. Notwithstanding, it also exists the possibility of a contra hypothesis which might argue that the CL might not have any type of effect on the students' work when developing their translations. Furthermore, it is valuable to highlight that this paper shows the quantitative data gathered by means of a questionnaire and two units of analysis in a preliminary s tudy by means of a pilot translation whose main aim is to analyse if the use of digital tool s such as SketchEngine to create a CL and th e extractor of terms OneClick through the translating processes of two abstracts from specialized areas impacts on the students' translation performance. Research methodology This explorat ory and empirical r esearch work is based on a quantitative method. This means that the main characteristics that stand out in this paper relies on statistics as well as graphs, the verification of the hypothesis, delimitation of approaches and measurement of phenomena. Also, this type of approach follows a deductive, sequential, and probative pro cedure, as well as the objective analysis of a reality . Moreover, the data collection technique employed in this research is a digital questionnaire designed in Go ogle Forms which con sists of 21 open -ended questions. Additionally, a couple of units of ana lysis were necessary to gather the valuable information regarding the impact of t he implementation of corpus linguistics as a tool for managing with terminology when translating. The participants considere d in this research study are 19 translation studen ts from different semesters (sixth, eighth, and ninth) enrol led in the class Taller de Traducci\u00f3n corresponding to the sixth period of the B.A. Lengua Inglesa at the Languages School of the Universidad Veracruzana during the period February - July, 2022. The population contemplated for this study is constituted by 13 women and 6 men who a re in a range of ages between 18 -23. Similarly, it is worth mentioning that the informants have an up per-intermediate level of English (B2) since some of them have already co ncluded the class of Ingl\u00e9s Avanzado and some others are currently taking it . Results This last section is devoted to discuss the main results regarding the impact th at the implementation of corpus linguistics had in the students' translation performance. Firstly , this work discusses about the number of accurate , incorrect and omitted terms in the informants ' translation performance of the pilot translation . The table 1 and the graphs from figure 1 show that the average of accura te terms translated from th e medicine abstract is 15.0 out of 17 terms from the text having 88.2% of accuracy; the average of incorrect terms translated is 1.4 out of 17 with the 8.2%; and the average of omitted terms is 0.5 out of 17 with the 2.9%. Further, the results also show the average of Corpus linguistic tools and terminology translation tasks 107 accurate terms translated from the engineering abstract which is 13 out of 15 terms with the 88.6% of accuracy; the average of incorrect terms translated is 0 out of 15 with the 0%; and the average of omitted terms is 1.7 out of 15 with the 11 .3%. Figure 1. Graphs of the pilot translation . Secondly, s o as to identify if there was an incidence after the implementation of Sketch -Engine and One -click as supportive digital tools for translating as well as some exercises for terminology acquisition, it was important to tes t students' performance with a translation performance evaluation . In order to allow informants to experience different areas, the inform ants who carried out the translation of the medicine abstract in the pilot, worked on t ranslating the engineering text in the evaluation. And the informants who worked with the engineering text in the pilot, worked on medicine in the evaluation. This unit of analysis figures out the number of accurate, incorrect and omitted terms in the info rmants' translation performance of the evaluation . The table 2 and the graphs from figure 2 show that the average of accurate terms translated from the engineering abstr act is 17.6 out of 19 terms having 92.6% of accuracy; the average of incorrect terms translated is 0.7 out of 19 with the 3.6%; and the average of omitted terms is 0.5 out of 19 with the 2.6%. Moreover, the results also show the average of accurate terms t ranslated from the medicine abstract shows an average of 17.6 out of 18 terms with the 97.7%; the average of incorrect terms translated is 0.2 out of 18 with the 1.1%; and the average of omitted terms is 0.3 out of 18 with the 1.6 %. F. Luna , C. Aguilar 108 Figure 2 . Graphs of the evaluation . Conclusion So as to conclude, it is possible to notice a slight improvement on the students' translation performance . Based on the results, the informants' performance of the group A show an improvement with the 4.4% regarding the accura te translated terms from the pilot (88.2%) to the evaluation (92.6 %); a decrease in incorrect translated terms with the 4.6% from the pilot (8.2%) to the evaluation (3.6%); and the omitted terms decrease 0.3% from the pilot (2.9%) to the evaluation (2.6%). With respect to the participants who belong to group B, the results show an impro vement with the 9.1% regarding the accurate translated terms from the pilot ( 88.6%) to the evaluation (97.7%); surprisingly, there was a negative but slight in crease in the incorrect translated terms with the 1.1% from the pilot ( 0%) to the evaluation ( 1.1%); and the omitted terms decrease 9.7% from the pilot ( 11.3%) to the evaluation ( 1.6%).

Syntactic theories argue constraints on LDD are universal and purely syntactic, predicting these constraints should hold across languages and constructions. This study probes into the acceptability of topicalization from English and Mandarin if-claus es and that-clauses through contex tualized accepta bility judgment experime nt, finding no adjunct island effect in either language, which supports the discourse approach, arguing that the discourse status of the extracted element in the construction is at play (focus status of the extracted element depends on the construction). If there is a focus status conflict between the element and construction, the penalty will appear. Keywords: syntactic islands, topicalization, experimental syntax, information struc ture. Introduction Constraints on LDD in natural languages are a prominent issue in linguistic theory since 1960s (Ross 1967), and there are three main approaches to their (un)acceptability. The syntactic approach argues they are syntactic and generalize across languages and across constru ctions (Huang, 1982). The processing approach claims processing factors such as frequency and high working memory load are at play given that sentences with islands may exhibit gradient acceptabil ity and individual variati on (Hofmeister & Sag 2010, Hofmeis ter & Sag 2010, Liu et al. 2022). The discourse approach assumes that semantic and discourse factors can explain the unacceptability of extraction from so-called islands in terms of their felicity in context. Based on the \"Back grounded Constructions are Island\" principle proposed by Goldberg (2006, 2013), Abeill\u00e9 et al (2020) proposed that the discourse function of the construction also plays a role: extracting an element out of a backgrounded constituent is worse when the extra cted element is focalized. Extractions do not necessarily make extrac ted elements become focus. Specifically, the extraction elements are focalized in wh-questions and it-clefts, but not in topicalizations. This paper will focus on the so-called adjun ct island constraint, comparing the acceptability of topicalization from if-adjuncts and that-complements in English and Mandarin by corresponding native speakers. R. Mao, A. Abeill\u00e9 , B. Hemforth , E. Gibson 110 Kush et al. (2018, 2019) and Bondevik et al. (2021) observed an if-adjunct penalty in Norweg ian wh-questions, but not in topic alizations. Gibson et al. (2021) and Abeill\u00e9 et al. (2022) replicated the adjunct penalty in English wh- questions without context, but neither in wh-questions with context, nor in relative clauses . Myers (2012) tested Mand arin topicalizations out of if-adjuncts and becaus e-adjuncts, finding a lack of adjunct island effect in Mandarin. In corpus studies on Danish and English, M\u00fcller & Eggers (2022) found extractions from adjunct clauses and relative clauses happen at a non-trivial rate in relativization and topicalization structure (Danish), but not in wh-questions. Method We conducted contextualized acceptability judgment experiments on IBEX, testing topicalization from English and Mandarin if-claus es and that-clauses. We had a 2x2 design crossing tion (extraction vs. non-extraction) and Clause-type (if-clause vs. that-clause), generating four conditions in both languages, as illustr ated in (1) and (2). 16 experimental items and 80 filler items compose the English experi ment. Mandarin experiment comprises 20 experi mental items and 37 fillers. Participants were presented with sentence pairs and asked to rate the second sentence on a 1-7 Likert scale, followed by corresponding yes/no comprehen sion questions. Only data from participants with an accuracy rate above 80% were analyzed , and the effective data comprise judgment from 46 US natives (recruited through prolific), and 60 Mandarin natives living in Mainland China (recruited through social media).

Topicalization out of English and Mandarin if-clauses and that-clauses 111 Predictions Accord ing to the traditional syntactic approach, topical ization from if-clauses should be rated worse than extraction from that-clauses because of the \"adjunct island\" constraint . However, if topicalizations are not extractions in Chine se (there is a null pronou n) (Xu & Langendoen, 1985), the adjunct penalty may only arise in English. Regarding processing approaches, distance -based processing theories predict no differences betwee n topicalization from if- clauses and that-clauses, and the higher frequency of topic structures in Mandarin (Pan & Paul 2018) should favor these compared with English. Since topicalization is not a focalizing construction, the discourse approach predicts no differences between the two clause types in both languag es. Results and discussion We computed Bayesian models in R. The results of English (Figure 1a, 1b) and Mandarin (Figure 2a, 2b) show a high probability for a main effect of topicalization (higher acceptability in non-topicalized sentences) and no effect of clause type. However, there is a relatively higher probability for an interaction in the Mandarin experiment where the difference between extraction and non-extraction is bigger for if-clauses. The lack of distinction between clause types challenges the traditional syntactic approac h because there was no island effect in either language. Mandarin participants rated the topicalization conditions much higher than the corresponding English ones, which may be explained by easier processing due to frequency since Chinese is a topic -promin ent language (Li & Thompson, 1981), using topic structures more frequ ently. Our results also refute the putative cross-linguistic difference between English (island sensitive) and Mandarin (island insensitive) (Zenker & Schwa rtz, 2017) at least for the constructions investigated here.

However, non -lexically stressed languages such as Korean or French present more variations in their mechanism of stre ss clash resolution . Acoustic analys is examples taken from the spontaneous speech corpus Orfeo show that there is no stress shift of the first stressed syllable whe n the gap between the phono logically stressed vowels exceeds some 250 ms . This gap depends o n the speech rate, a slow rate l eading to maintain the mor pholog ically stressed syllable in place, whereas a fast speec h rate would reduce the gap between the stressed vowels below 250 ms and will lead to a stress shift . This 250 ms gap value is linked to the minimum interval required by delta brain oscillations to synchronize the perception of stressed syllables. Keyword s: Syllabic s syllabic stress in lexically stressed lang uages such as English or Italian is assumed to be locate d on some syllable of lexical wo rds (verbs, nou ns adjectiv es an d adverb s), categor ies opposed to grammatica l words (pronouns, conjuncti ons, etc.) . However, non -lexically stressed languages ( e.g., French, Korean) place syllabi c stress on some word final syl lable according to a rhythmic ru le separating consecutive stressed syllables by an interval between 250 ms and 1250 -1350 ms (Martin, 20 18). This property of stress in F rench leads to the definition of an accent phrase as a sequence of words , the last of which is stressed on it s final s yllable . As lexical words do no t have to be necessarily stressed as in English or Italian, a n accent ph rase can contain more than on e lexical word, as in la ville de Strasbourg or l'air du t emps, etc. Stress clash The so -called stress c lash condition has b een analyzed for some time, whe ther for lexical ly stress ed languages like English (Liberman and Prince, 1997), or for non-lexical ly, rhythmic, stress ed language like Fr ench. ( Garde , 1968). In both cases, the question pertain s to a stress shift when two consecutiv e stressed syllable s occur. Ph. Martin 114 Two oft en-cited examples include an oxytonic first word , such as thirteen and kangar oo leading to realizations such as thirteen men and kangaroo saddle. In contemporary French, the word stress is oxyton, and paroxyton if the last pronounced syllab le includes t he vowel [ ]. A stress clash configuration can therefore only occur if the second word involved is monosyllabic, such as noir or verte in soulier noir or la cein ture verte, with both wo rds belongin g to the same syntac tic unit. Most of the rece nt (Jun and F ougeron, 2 002) or old (Dell, 1984) analyses either propose rules accounting for these stress shifts, or describe them as possible but not obligatory while remaining undecided on their c onditions of realization. We pro pose here a unique explana tory principle based on the temporal properties of sequences of stressed syllable . Stress and brain waves Electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis , exploring the relationship between brain waves and t he perception of syllables , has shown that theta b rain wav es, varying in the rang e 4 Hz to 10 Hz, i.e., between 100 ms and 250 ms, synchronize syllabic perception in listeners ( Ghitza, 2013 ). Without this synchronization, syllabic perception becomes less e fficient, since it is triggered by unorganized theta waves on the tempor al axis. On the other hand, delta brain waves, whose periods vary between approximately 250 ms and 1 250-1350 ms, have been shown to be synchronized by speech stressed syllables (Martin , 201 5). They also trigger the p erception of syllable as s tressed even in the lack of relevant acoustic parameters of stress . In the absence of speech, the delta waves oscillat e freely in the ir frequency range, but the occurrence of effectively stressed sy llables provoke their temporal alignment . Therefore , stressed s yllables ensure th e regu lation of accent phrases linguistic processing , necessarily taking place in the ra nge of delta waves variation , i.e., between 250 ms and 1250 -1350 ms. To satisfy this co ndition, the intervals between consecutive stressed syllab les m ust therefore fall within this interval. As a result, stressed syllables must imperatively be spaced apart by a minimum of 250 ms and a maximum of 1250 -1350 ms, whether in production or in perception , even in silent reading, and independently of thei r linguistic function. Experimental data from spontaneous speech recordings in French presented below do support clearly this hypothesis, showing that consecutive stressed syllables remain in place while separated by a gap of more than some 250 ms . Experim ental data The analyzed experimental data presenting potentially stress clash conditions were extracted f rom t he ORFEO corpus, which brings together various corpora of spontaneous speech in French. Example s were easily located thanks Brain waves and syllabic stress clash 115 to the integrated conc ordan cer of the WinPitc h software (20 22). This software automatically displa ys the speech sound corresponding to the select ed concordancer text, together with its acoustic analysis, spectrogram and melodic and intensity curve s. In the examples given below, the numbers betwe en potentially stress cl ashed words give the measured gap in ms, taken from the peak of the stressed stllable vowel s. Parentheses indicate the sy ntactic group involved , and the spe ech rate is given in number of s yllables per second. Gap < 250 ms 1.1 First wor d of the sequence with 1 syllable et je crois que ce qu'il a vou moment -l\u00e0 c'est que c'\u00e9tait pas du tout du tout noir (et tout 200 blanc) mais que au contr aire par exemple blanc) 8.2 syl/s (07madmc110912 ) 1.2 First word of the sequence with 2 syllable s or more with stress shift il y a d eux ampoules blanches et une ampoule apporter lumi\u00e8r e et 1.3 First wo rd of the sequence with 2 syllable s or more unstressed la reine prend le linge ell ass\u00e9 c'est un syl/s l\u00e0 280 ms 5.5 syl/s il et e (unine08a03m ) These d ata show clearly that the stress clash condition does not involve a first stress shift when th e gap between stressed vowels is greater than 25 0 ms . Ph. Martin 116 Moreover, the complexity of the co nsonant clusters potential ly present between consecutive stressed syllables does by itself avoid a stress shift when the distance between the two syllables is below 250 ms . We als o note, at least on th ese sample s of spontane ous speech, that stress drop in the event of a collision i s not at all the rule when the first word is not monosyllabic (cases 1.2) . Moreo ver, when a stress shift occurs , the first stress is not necessa rily locate d on the first syllable of the first pluris yllabic word (when it exists), b ut could be on the final s yllable of a preceding word (cases 1.3) . Whether by this mechanism or by shifting the stress , the speaker creates stress groups of longer duration, so as to ensure eurythmy between successive stress groups (Martin, 2018) . Conclus ion The minimum and maximu m gap between two succe ssive stressed syllables, linked to the range of delta brain waves periods , is the key which gives a proper account of stress cla sh resolution in French , and potentially for o ther non-tonal languages as well .

The dat a comprised r ecordings of s tory reading and retelling from 20 L1 speakers in 1928 (archived and digit ised) and 14 in 2020 -21, with 848 7 F0 contours in total. Results show geographic and diachronic variability between speakers who ac hieve high pitch within +/-50ms of the strong -syllable vowel -midpoint, and those who prefer delays of 100 ms or more . Greater d elay characterises more conservative varieties in 1928, and this is reflec ted in the patterns of change between then and 2020 -21. Keywords: phonetics, Irish (MI) is considered pros odically distinct from the other regional macrovarieties of Irish by vir tue of phonological lexical prominence (variably termed 'stress ' or 'accent ') occurring outside of initial position subjec t to weight sensit ivity. This has been hypothesised to derive historically from high pitch occurring one or more syllables after lexical prominence (Blankenhorn 1981 ). As part of a broader investigation of phonetic exponents of lexical and phrasal prominence , the timing relationship between metrically strong syllables and high pitch was examined . Naturalistic data from story reading and retelling by speakers of MI from two eras were collecte d for analysis . The Doegen Records (Royal Irish Academy 2009) provided digitised 1928 wax-cylinder recordings of 20 L1 speakers from Counties Kerry , Clare, Cork, Waterford, and Tipperary with birth years 1846-1892. Corre sponding modern data ( 2020-21) were collected from 14 L1 speakers from the survi ving Kerry, Cork, and Waterford varieties with birth years 1932-2001. Background on Munster Irish prosody Regarding intonation itself, previous work on MI comprises both British School descriptions and Autosegmental -Metrical (AM) approaches . There is a general preferenc e for falls and rise -falls described for MI varieties , generally given H*+L labels in AM work . A minority of L *+H accents hav e been described f or Kerry and Cork , and may align with British School description s for Cork of high peak s syst ematically occurring out of phase with metrical ly strong syllables (\u00d3 Cu\u00edv 1944 ). C. McCabe a s ystematic statis tical inve stigation in the author 's PhD of prominence correlates across di- and tri syllabic words of different weight -structures , and of nonwords controlled struc often diverge. Loca tion of intensity -prominence generally varied as a function of w eight structure , suggesting this to be a better diagnostic of lexical prominence location . Changes in F0 height were unrelated to item weigh t structur e, consistent with proposals in the literature that in MI this is a property of phrasal prosody alone (Windsor et al. 2018 ). Frequent occurrence of high pitch outside of metrically strong syllables is directly relevant for Blanke nhorn 's (1981) hypothesis of non -initial lexical prominence in MI deriving from intonational (mis)alignment . This further relates to issues of identifying the location of le xical prominence , and of the historical timeline for the purported MI system 's development . For the present data, i t was hypothesised that more conservative 1928 data would show more frequent late align ment of high p itch, whereas modern data with mor e Eng lish influence wo uld show closer coordination between the two . Methods To investigate the timing relationship betwee n hypothesised phrase -level F0 movement and lexical -level , a modified form of Ahn et al.'s (2021) Points, Levels and Ranges ( PoLaR ) intonation al transc ription system was used. This is based on turning points (TPs) in the F0 conto ur, and was selected (i) for its modular nature, and (ii) to avoid prematurely attribu ting phonological labels (e.g. H*+L or Praat (Boersma Weenink 2021 ). In a PoLaR transcription, the midpoint of a metrically strong syllable's vowel is labelled with <*>, after which individual TPs in the F0 co ntour are identifie d in a separate tier . On a thi rd tier , a local F0 range is specified in Hertz . A script is then used to automatically assign each TP a 'level' within the F0 range specified ; any number of levels is possible, five - the system default - were chosen for this analys is. Two sligh t modifications wer e made to this syste m to facilitate operationalisataion of annotation. First, o n the basis of the aforementioned findings for lexical -level prom inence , increased intensity was selected as criterion identi fying metrically of 6 was set for individual contours . If a described contour was found to require more than 6 TPs for ad equate definition of its s hape, it either required d ivision into two pa rts, or one or more TPs was superfl uous. Interva ls of high p itch wer e labelled in each contour , either as sing le TPs for 'sharp' peaks or as a stretch between two TPs for longer plateaux ; these were either two TPs of the same PoLaR level , or within one lev el of each other. Measurements for the annotated contours were extracted automatically . Each contour was then assigned to one of 7 timing categories based on where Timing of high pitch in Munster Irish 119 the labelled high int erval began relative to the strong -syllable vowel -midpoint : 'On-Time ' (+/-10ms ), total o f 8487 F0 contours were transcribed and measure d. The vast majority of described contours are declarative (ri se-)falls, and patterning is roughly equivalent between prenuclear (non -final) and nuclear (final) positio n. The distribution o f the contours acros s the seven timing categories is summarised in Tables 1 -2, with co lour-coding to indicate frequency of occurrence . Table 1. Distribution o f intonation contours across timing categories for the five region al varieties attested in the 1928 data (4782 conto urs). Region Freq. Timing Kerry Distribution of intonation c ontours across timing categories for the three regional varieties attested in the 2020 -21 data (3705 contours ). Region Freq. findings eme rge. First, in the 1928 data ( Table 1 ), there is a divide between Cork /Kerry and W aterford/Tipperary/Clare . Cork and Ker ry exhibit a clear preference for large delays between strong -syllable vowels midpoi nts and the onset of high pitch (100ms or more ). The rem aining three subregions show closer coordination between high pitc h and metrical strength , with most high intervals beg inning within 50ms of the stron g-syllable vowel midpoint . Second , the 2020-21 Cork and Kerry data (Table 2 ) show a change C. McCabe 120 towards the latter close -coordination tendency , while Waterford is virtually unchanged from 1 928. Both Cork and Kerry retain a substantial minori ty of large delays , but these are now outnumbere d or roug hly matched by contours in the +/ -50ms range. Discussio n and conclusion Comparison of high -pitch timi ng in equivalent Munste r Irish data from 1928 and 2020-21 show s subgrouping of regional varieties and change between eras . I suggest that the variation evident i n these findin gs relate s to relative conservatism in these regions and eras . In 192 8, Cork and Kerry supported robust Irish -speaking communitie s, including a l imited number of remaining monolingual s. By con trast, Water ford, Clare, and Tipperary speaker - communit ies were already under heavy pressure from English, with only Waterford surviv ing into the 21st century. Mean while changes in the Cork and Kerry data in 2020 -21 are in the latter 's direction , correlating with the geographi cal and numerical decline of Irish as a robust community language . Finally, I speculate that ambiguity from conservative phrase -level high-pitch misalignment has complicate d identif ication of lexical -level prominence - location in previous accounts of MI. This calls phonological account s of MI prominence -assignment based on traditional dialect descriptions in to question . System atic, c ritical examination o f the phonetic basis f or phonological accounts of lexical and phrasal prosody is lly beyond Irish .

Dislocations are often considered to be \"substandard in formal registers\" (Lambrecht 1994: 12). In French, mul tiple copies of the subject are licit in spoken data, whereas translations into English preclude them (De Cat 2007). We analysed 4 36 translations of French dislocated segments in the novel Voyage au bout de la nuit (C\u00e9line 1932) and a contemporary corpus f or spoken data from Corpus de Fran\u00e7ais Parl\u00e9 Parisien (CFPP) (Branca -Rosoff & Lefeuvre 2016) by and Google. Beyond prototypical X, c'est dislocations, translation toolkits continue to misfire, and this might be due to the lack of spoken data in train ing sets of NMT. Keywords: dislocation, language pairs French English, neural machine translation Introduction This paper replicates the challenge set approach proposed by Pierre Isabelle and colleagues for English into French (Isabelle et al. 2017). The idea is to target the difficult linguistic features and observe the output of machine translation systems like Google Translate and DeepL . Our focus for our challenge set is dislocations; structures where double constituents are licit in the source text (l ike two grammatical subjects in French) but not in English. Dislocations are universal (Lambrecht 1994) and all languages seem to have identical forms of topic -marking. Syntactically, two positions can be considered. One is called theme or Left Dislocati on (LD), a clause and a constituent to its left. In the example \"[Peter] I've known him for a long time\" (Westbury 2016), Peter is a dislo cated segment which occurs before the clause. The other is right dislocation (RD). In the example \"He lived in Africa , [the wizard] (Lambrecht 1994) right dislocation has the wizard at the right edge of the sentence. Pragmatically , a linear arrangement of linguistic elements in a sentence affects information packaging. Our dislocation challenge set of French examples encompasses a pragmatic need (usually expressed by thematization ) and a syntactic constraint (only one subject) for the translations into Engl ish. Methodology Our corpus includes Voyage au bout de la nuit from the INTERSECT parallel corpus (Salkie 2022). The reference translation in English of the French sentence s in which dislocation occurs was obtained using AntPConc software. B. Namdarzadeh , N. Ballier 122 In addition to this classic subcorpus, a contemporary corpus for spoken data from the Corpus de Fran\u00e7ais Parl\u00e9 Parisien (CFPP) des an n\u00e9es 2000 (Branca - Rosoff & Lefeuvre 2016) was also sear ched using the Universal Dependency (UD) annotation to retrieve the possible disloc ations with the dependency relation. Annotation was performed with the {UDpipe} package in R. The corpora yielded 2,54 6 occurrences, out of which we analysed 436 translatio ns by DeepL and Google translate. We briefly report the discrepancies in the transla tions of dislocations observed in our corpus. Results While we do not report recall for the automatic detection of dis locations with UD, the precision of our retrieval method was pretty accurate for the 218 analysed dislocations (91% and 98 %). Few false p ositives were detected but more frequently for the written data (appositions and parentheticals mistaken as dislocatio ns) than for the spoken data (repairs and repetitions ). Table 1. Distribution of main dislocation types and success rate for the c'est dislocation in our data. corpora multiple c'est \"subject copy\" in the translation Voyage (n=109) 15 62 Google = 17, D eepL = 11 CFPP (n=109) 22 73 Google = 30, DeepL = 32 The detailed typology of di slocations observed in the data is beyond the remit of t his paper. We describe the complexity of the dislocations in Table 1 by reporting multiple cases of dislocations withi n sentences, much more frequent in our spoken data. We focus on the dominant type of dislocations (<left dislocated item>, c'est dislocati ons) and compare the two toolkits on their ability to produce translations that avoid the repetition of the subject (w e call it \"subject copy\"). C'est constructions often have \u00e7a nstituent like \u00e7a c'est vrai (C\u00e9line 1932), which is t ranslated as that is true . Despite the high number of occurrences of c'est construction in both of our corpora (62 occurrences out of 109 sentences for the novel and 73 occurrences out of 109 sentences for CFPP ), there is still a deficiency in translating this construction by the toolkits. Google tends to produce more \"subject copies\" in typical examples . The picture is m ore blurred for more complex cases like l'amour c'est elle la mis\u00e8re ... (C\u00e9line 1932 ), Google outperforms DeepL and translates it as love is misery ... with the suppression of the extra subject which is not required in English, whereas DeepL output is closer to the ST translation suggesting the love it is it the misery... . Left dislocated i tems can also be stacked as instances with more than tw o constituents for topic -marking function (Raquel 2002). For example, in Lui, le p\u00e8re, je l'apercevais... (C\u00e9line 1932), which includes double topicalization, all the initial subjects are translated by t he two translation toolkits as him, the father, I The neural machine translation of dislocations 123 .... . In the other example, normal... (Branca -Rosoff , Lefeuvre 2016), Google keeps the structure of double topicalization as in the French source text and translates it into me it always seemed to me... normal , whereas, DeepL omits the ext ra subject and translates it into I always thought it was... normal . Many dislocations have a tonic pronoun as the lef t dislocated item, prototypically the moi, je construction in French sentences. It can be tricky for the MT systems. In translating the sour ce text mais autrement non moi je trouve j'aime -Rosoff , Lefeuvre 2016), Google follows word -by-word strategy translating it into but otherwise not me I find I like . DeepL omits th is part of the source text and suggests but otherwise I like it . Discussion and conclusion We retained the original absence of punctuation (commas) of the CFPP, which is even mor e distinct from the canonical training data of the toolkit. For instance, translating the French ST le 2016), DeepL suggests the park Mabille it is park of Beaumonts now they arranged it well . The zero article for Parc de Beaumonts may account for the absence of recognition of the pattern. We revised the transcription of CFPP and added commas where appropriate to check the ability of the MT toolkits . Re-punctuating the sentences (see our [,]) did not solve the it subject copy issue. Analysing only 436 translations of dislocated constructions p roduced by Google and DeepL still outlines meaningful patterns for the toolkit translations of this tricky structur e. The partial success with c'est dislocation suggests training data is crucial for the results. Les frequent structures tend to be mistransl ated, especially for spoken data. Overall, the challenging dislocated segments mainly originate from spoken languag e and this might suggest that more spoken data should be include d in the training sets of neural machine translation. While parentheticals se em to ease the translation of dislocations, more complex structures with stacking remain an issue for NMT toolkits. The topic - marking function and some tropicalized object construc tions can also be challenging. The overall patterns differ in the two toolki ts. On the one hand, Google seems to keep the paratactic structure of the French source sentence, i.e., to produ ce a word -by-word translation of the structure and to rei terate the words. If anything , Google tends to be more source -based for the translation of dislocations and more systematically preserves the original pun ctuation. On the other hand, DeepL outputs are h ypotactic in a sense that even for double constituents, the toolkit suppresses reiterations or links the constituents using subordinating con junctions. B.

However, cognitive processing of such wo rds has not been studied yet. A translation priming experiment was designed to examine the processing of 64 unadapted English loanwords in Croatian. Croatian native speakers with diff erent levels of English proficiency participated in the study. A signific ant translation priming effect was observed in both language direc tions, while language direction and proficiency did not show a significant effect on participants' reaction times. Th is suggests that the most frequent unadapted English loanwords are well i ntegrated into Croatian despite their unadapted forms and processe d highly efficiently by Croatian speakers of variab le English proficiency levels. Keywords: bilingualism, lexical ac cess, English loanwords, translation priming, lexical decision task Introduction In the study of bilingual lexical access, r esearch has gen erally supported the non-selective approach, at lea st in the early stages of word recognition. A number of models of bilingual word recognition recognize the importance of factors such as age of acquisition (AoA), language exposure and use . Exposure to Eng lish has been rapidly increasing due to its role as a global language. Many Croa tian speakers are daily exposed to English, which is why it has been recognized as a part of societal as well as individual bilingualism (e.g., Mihaljevi Djigunovi et al., 2006). English has also become the dominant donor language for many languages, includin g Croatian. As a result, many u nadapted English words (e.g., 'shopping', 'e -mail') have become part of C roatian informal communication. In other words, all Croatian speakers a re exposed to them, regardless of their proficiency in English. Research on cognitive processing of unadapted E nglish loanwords is still very scarce. This study aims to contribute to t his line of re search by investigating lexical access to unadapted English loanwords in Croatian speakers with different levels of language proficiency. E. Pavlinui Vilus , I. Bogunovi , B. oso 126 Methods A translation priming experiment was designed to examine the processing of 64 unadapted Eng lish loanwords in Croatian. The words were selected based on their frequency (Bogunovi et al., 2022), and the existence of adequate Croatian translation equivalents. All English words w ere concrete nouns. Concreteness was established using ratings in Brys baert et al. (2013). A tot al of 37 Croatian native speakers (18 female, 19 male), students from the University of Rijeka, participated in the study. To test the participants' vocabulary knowledge, Lexical test (LexTale) ( Lemh\u00f6fer & Broersma , 2012) was use d. Translation priming eff ect was examined with a lexical decision task. The participants completed the task in both language directions (L1 -L2/L2 -L1), each presented in a separate expe rimental block. List of experimental stimuli consisted of 128 prime -target pairs. The ratio of ps eudowords was .50. Identical sets of words were used for primes and targets, with four lists counterbalanced across participants. There were 16 items in each o f the four experimental conditions: L1 asynchrony was set to 250 ms . Results To examine the effect of translation equivalence, language direction and profici ency on reaction time, a 2 (proficiency) x 2 (equivalence) x 2 (la nguage direction) ANOVA with repeated measures on equivalence and direction variables was used. Three participants were excluded from further analysis due to low accuracy of answers . ANOVA showed a significant effect of equivalenc e on reaction time, F(1,31) = 9.7 9, p = 0.004. The participants responded significantly faster when primes and targets were translation equivalents ( M = 557.49, SD = 19.72) compared to pairs which were not translati on equivalents ( M = 652.49, SD = 37.60). At the same time, languag e direct ion did not have a significant impact on reaction time, F(1,31) = 1.99, p = .168. In other words, L1 -L2 pairs ( M = 629.92, SD = 36.12) had similar reaction times as L2 -L1 pairs ( M = 580.06, SD = 25.70). Finally, proficiency in English did not have a signif icant effect on reaction time, F(1,28) = .77, p = .387 ; i.e., participants with higher proficiency ( M = 582.26, SD = 36.07) had similar reaction time as those with lower level of pro ficiency (M = 627.73, SD = 37.18). In ad dition, the interaction b etween p roficiency, equivalence and language direction was significant, F(1,31) = 4.25, p = .048, but mainly due to one proficiency group . No significant difference between two proficiency g roups and two language directions for equ ivalent pairs was found (p > .05) . In the case of non-equivalent pairs, participants with lower proficiency needed more time to respond to L1-L2 pairs ( M = 791.66, SD = 86.81) compared L2 -L1 Lexica l access to unadapted English loanwords in Croatian 127 pairs ( M = 598.91, SD = 47.85), p = .004. No such difference w as observed in participan ts with higher proficiency, p > .05. Discussion and conclusions A significant p riming effect was observed in both language directions, which is in line with previous research (e.g., Basnig ht-Brown & Altarriba, 2007; Schoonbaert et al., 2009; Smith et a l., 2019) . However, the effect of language direction was not significant , meaning t hat the effects in both directions were of similar strength. This is unexpected , since previous studies have generally found a smaller translation priming effect in the L2 -L1 directio n (Chaouch - Orozco et al., 2022; review in Wen & van Heuven, even bilinguals (Basnight -Brown & Altarriba, see Du\u00f1abeitia et al., 2010, for different results). Lexical representations of L2 words are thought to be comparab le to thos e of L1 words only in balanced bilinguals . However, the participants in t he present study were not balanced bilinguals. This suggests that the Croatian speakers are highly familiaris ed with the most frequent unadapted English loanwords. These wor ds seem to be well integrated into the mental lexicon of Croatian speakers, regardl ess of their proficiency in English. This assumption is further supported by the fact that the effect of prof iciency on reaction time was not significant. The interaction be tween prof iciency, equivalence and language direction showed that lower proficiency speakers responded faster to L2 -L1 non-equivalent pairs compared to L1 -L2 pairs. One possible explanation co uld be that unadapted English loanwords are used in specific con texts, whi ch is why L2 word recognition might have been delayed by semantically unr elated L1 primes. On the other hand, the fact that no such interaction was observed in higher proficiency spe akers could be due to their exposure to English words in both L1 and L2 en vironments. Another possible explanation for the observed asymmetry could be a more frequent usage of English loanwords in spoken than in written language in Croatian . Taken together , the results of this study show that t he processing of unadapte d English loanwords might follow different patterns compared to the processing of L2 non -loanwords. However, this line of research is still relatively underdeveloped, so future research could reveal more about the specific aspects of loanword processing.

Non -cognate priming ExLing 20 22 Paris : Proce edings of Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Comparing pre-linguistic normalization models against US English listeners ' vowel perception Anna Persson1,2, T Florian Jaeger2 1Swedish Language and Multilingualism , Stockholm University, Sweden 2Brain and Cognitive Sciences , University of Rochester , USA https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract We investigate the role of pre -linguistic normalization in the perception of US English vowels . We train Bayesian ideal observer (IO) models on unnormal ized or normalized acoustic cues to vowel identity usi ng a phonetic database of 8 /h -VOWEL -d/ words of US English. We then com pare the IOs' predictions for vowel categorization against L1 US English listeners' 8 -way categorization responses for recordings of /h-VOWEL -d/ words in a web -based experiment. Result s indicate that pre -linguistic normalization substantially improves the fit to human responses from 74% to 90% of best-possible performance . Keywords: speech perception, vowel normalization, computatio nal model Introduction One of the central challenges f or human speech perception is that talkers differ in pronunciation - i.e., how they map linguistic categories and meanings onto the acoustic signal . While this challenge is always present, it is most ev ident when listeners first en counter talkers with unfa miliar pronunciations. What mechanisms allow li steners to overcome this challenge - often rapidly, even after brief exposure - remains unclear. One highly influential hypothesis holds that inter -talker differences are removed via low -level pre -linguistic a uditory normalization of acoustic cues. There is now at least a dozen of competing normalization proposals (e.g., Lobanov, 1971; N earey, 1978) . Previous work has fo und that normalization reduce s inter-talker variability due to , e.g. anatomical or physiolog ical (e.g., Adank et al., 2004 ; Disner, 1980; Labov, 2 010). This leaves open whether listeners actua lly employ n ormalizati on, and which n ormalization a pproach best explains listeners ' vowel cate gorization. Only a relat ively small number of studies has addressed these questions (e.g. Richter et al., 2017, for US English ). Here , we contribute to this line of research by compari ng normalization accou nts again st nove l data on the perception of US Eng lish vowels. A. Persson , T.F.Jaeger 130 Methods Predicti ng speech perception fro m phonetic databases To compare how well different normalization approach es explain listeners' vowel perception , we employ a model of Bayesian inference , ideal o bservers (IOs, see e.g. , Kleinschmidt & J aeger, 2015). To provide predictions about human perce ption, IOs need estimates of the ( 1) the prior probability of the vowels in the current context and ( 2) vowel -specific cue distrib utions . Since we use the IOs t o provide predictions for an 8 -way forced choice categorization e xperiment (see below), we set (1) to a uniform prior of .125 for each of the eight vowels. We obtained ( 2) from a phonetically anno tated database of L1 US Engli sh vowel productions (Xie & Jae ger, 2020) . This assumes \u2014as do all major theories of speech perception \u2014that listeners acquire implicit knowledge of the category -specific distribution of phonetic cues. The database includes 1,240 recordings of eight VOWEL -d words ( heed, hid, head, had, od d, hut, hood, who'd , N=9 tokens per word from each of 17 female and male talkers) . All words ar e annota ted for the first three formants (F1 -F3) as well as the mean fundamental frequency (F0). IOs were trained on the unnormali zed or normalized F1 and F2 c ues, the primary cues to US English vowel i dentity . Specifically, we considered nine types of nor malization. The first four transform F1 and F2 from the untran sformed acoustic space (Hz) into one of four perceptual spaces hypot hesized to underlie human aud itory perception ( Mel, Bark, ERB , and semit ones). The remaining five approaches const itute normal ization in a narrowe r sense: they center and/or standardize F1 and F2 based on their marginal distribution across all eight vowels (e.g., Gerstman, 1968; Loban ov, 1971; Miller, 1989; and two Nearey, 1978) . While the Xie & Jaeger database is c omparatively large for a phonetically annotated corpus, it is small compared to the amount of input that human learners receive du ring language acquisition. To avoid over -fitting IOs to the database , we used 5 -fold cross -validation : we trained five differe nt IOs for each of the 10 d ifferent unnormalized, transformed, or normalized approaches. Each IO was trained on 80% of the recordi ngs from each vowel of each talker in the database. The predictions of e ach of the 5 * 10 IOs were then compared against human responses from a perceptio n experiment described next . Vowel categorization experiment We exposed L1 US English listeners (N=22) to the h-VOWEL -d productio ns of one female L1 US English talker from the Xie & Jaeger database . The experiment was administra ted on Amazon Mechanical Tu rk and consisted of 144 trials ( 9 recordings per vowel * 8 vowels * 2 repetitions ). On each trial, participants saw all 8 h-VOWEL -d words displayed on screen (order counter - balanced across pa rticipants) and then heard one of the recordings (in randomized o rder, group ed by repetition of the recording into t wo blocks). Participants were instruct ed to click on the word they heard th e talker say . US English listeners ' vowel perception 131 Result s and discussion Human perform ance Participants' responses matched the vowel intend ed by the talker on 71.1% o f all trials. This illustrates the challenge posed by cross -talker varia bility and individual difference s in listeners' lang uage backgrounds: without informative exposure to th e unfamiliar talker and in the absence of disambiguat ing context, listeners cate gorize recordings incorrectly in at least 1 of 4 cases! We then calculat ed, f or each of the 72 recording s, how much listener s agreed on its categorization. On average, the most frequent response for a recording was given on 72% o f all trials (out of 2 tria ls for each o f the 22 participant s). This provides an important reference against which to compare model performance : 72% re cognition accuracy is what one would achieve in pred icting human performance if one employs the accuracy -maximizing decision rule (c riterion choice), and always categorizes recording s based on the most frequent responses given by listen ers (henceforth expected ceiling performance ). Model performance The pe rformance of the IOs was assessed by comparing their predictions for human resp onses, i.e., their posterior probability of inferring human categorization responses (Figure 1) . We make five observation s. (1) All models overall perform substantially above ch ance (Figure 1, left panel) . (2) Transformations fro m the acoustic space into p erceptual spaces does not improve model performance, but (3) normalization can: IOs trained on normalized cues, perform signi ficantly better than the IO trained on unnormalized cues (53.1%, SE =0.3%, p <2e-16), except (mean accurac y 50.3%, SE =0.5%) . The two highest performing IOs employ Nearey's log -mean (mean accuracy 64.9%, SE =0.5%) or Lobanov accuracy =0.5%). high perfo rmance of general procedures such as and Lobanov , replica tes previou s findings , both from studies comparing against human responses (e.g., Richter et al., 2017 ) and simulated responses (e.g., Escudero & Bion, 2007). Gerstman normaliza tion, however, still outperformed untransformed mode ls in previous studies (unl ike here) . The improvements due to normalization are substantial: the unnormalized IO achieves 74% of the best possible performance (the ex pected ceiling perf ormance), whereas t he best performing normalization IOs achieve 90% of the best possible performan ce. (4) Points 1 -3 also hold for each vowel is separately (right panel). Finally, (5) no single normaliza tion procedure outperforms all others normalization procedure on all vowels (right panel, Figure 1). Even for the two best-fitting IOs, there is at lea st one vowel for which they are not among the best models . A. Persson , T.F.Jaeger 132 Figure 1.

Dots indicate mean accuracy across the five folds.

Our results suggest that pre -linguistic normalization (or computationally similar algorithms) provide a plausible explana tion for the remarkable adaptive abilities of human speech perception. We find that models based on norm alized F1 and F2 cues can a chieve up to 90% of the achievable accuracy . Future work should determine whether the remaining 10% can b e achieved by adding additio nal cues (e.g., F3 or vowel duration), or wh ether they point to additio nal mechanisms (e.g., rep resentational changes or ch anges in decision -making, Xie, Jaeger, & Kurumada, 2022). Similarly, it is possible t hat the effects we o bserved for normalization co uld be accounted for by alternative mechanis ms (ibid ). References Escudero, P. , Bion, R. A.H. 2007.

Forty -two professional conference interpret ers comple ted three tasks (comprehension, production, and simu ltaneous interpreting of sentences ) in high-quality and low -quality audio conditions . The first sentence (of the type , \"The man/ woman is at t he location \") was accompanied by a visual array with three images : the smallest object (Target X), the bigger obje ct (Foil) and the biggest object (Target Y ). Gaze patterns and pupil diameter were measure d during the s econd sentence (of the type, \"The Target X is next to the Target Y\") in a blank -screen paradigm. There were 12 visual arrays for each task . We found that participants shift ed their attenti on to the mentioned target earlier in adverse sound conditions in both the comprehension and the interpret ing task , and cognitive load is higher during interpr eting than it is during comprehension. Keywords: visual world paradig m, attentional shift, cognitive l oad, language comprehension, simultaneous interpreting . Introduction This study aims to investigate the effect of sound quality on attention and cognitiv e load in the comprehension, production, and simultaneous interpreting of sentences by analysing partic ipants' eye movements toward s sequentially occurring targets. To that end, we designed a blank scree n visual -world eye - tracking experiment to measure att entional shift patterns. Pupil diameter was used as an indicator of real -time cognitive load. In this p aper, we report and briefly discuss results for sentence comprehension and simultaneous interpreting . Methodology Forty-two Geneva -based professional co nference interpreters participated in the stu dy. All interpreters were L1 speakers of either French, Ge rman, Spanish, Italian or Russian and had English as an L2 language. Thirty -six experimental visual arrays were created; 12 for each experimental task, i.e., comprehension, production, and simultan eous interpretation. Each array contained three images rep resenting objects of different sizes: the smallest K. Seeber, D. Pan 134 object (Target X), the bigger object (Foil) and t he biggest object (Targe t Y), e.g., a shrimp, a jelly fish, and a whale. For the comprehension and the interpreting task, participants heard an introductory sentence and a critical sentence. The introductory sentence provided context (e.g., \" The man is at t he aquarium\"). The criti cal sentence described the lo cation of the two t argets in relation to each other (e.g., \"the shrimp is next to the whale). In the co mprehension task, participants were asked to look at the screen and listen to the sentences. In the interpreting task, participants were asked to look at the screen and sim ultaneously interpret all sentences into their respective L1. The experiment was ba sed on the blank screen paradigm (Altmann 2004), where images of objects are not visible during the critical part of the sentence . Consequently, p articip ants only saw the visu al stimuli during the first, introductory sentence , while during the critical sen tence the screen was blank. The audio stimuli for half of the trials had a frequency range of 125Hz to 15KHz (i.e., high quality: HQ), the other half of 300Hz to 3400Hz (i.e., low quality: LQ). Tasks were blocked and randomly rotated. To illustrate partic ipants' shifts of visual attention among objects ov er time, bootstrapping was used . Resampled datase ts were created, and a one-sample t - test on fixation proportions was conducted after each resample , without assumpti ons about the population distribution (Stone et al. 2021) . A divergence point represent s the first time point followed by at least ten conse cutive time points with significant t -values. Then, w e used a non-parametric bootstrap to create new datasets by re sampling participant, timepoint, and obje ct type (Target X vs Target Y, Target X vs Foil, and Target Y vs Foil). The bootstrap comprised 2000 iterations . Pupil diameter was used as an indica tor of real-time var iations in cognitive load during sentence comprehension (Just and Carpenter 1993) and simultaneous interpreting (Seeber 2013). Results Bootstr apped means and CIs for HQ and LQ of the com prehensio n task are plotted in Figure 1. In the HQ co ndition, during the PePOI \"the X\" , participants tend to look at Target X , the mentioned obje ct, more than at Target Y, the significant divergence begin ning 933.78 [820, 990] ms after sentence onset . Similarly, d uring the P OI \"the Y\" , participants look at Target Y , the mentioned object, more than Target X , albeit with a very late divergence onset at 3131.516 [2644.57, 3554.5]. In the LQ condition, during the POI \"the X\" participants ' preference of looking at Target X, the mentioned object, over Target Y, is no longer significant and merely a tre nd. During t he POI \"the Y\" , participants look at Target Y , the me ntioned object, more than at Target X, with a significant divergence onset at 2555.244 [2494.57, 257 4.57]. Participant s' The effect of sound quality on attention and load in language tasks 135 shift from Tar get X to Target Y occurs about 300ms earlier during the LQ condition .

Bootstrapped means and CIs for HQ and LQ of the inter preting task are plotte d in Figure 2. In the HQ condition, during the POI \"the X\" , participants tend to look at Target X , the mentioned obje ct, more than at Target Y, although the first significant divergence occurs at 1165.07 1[1136.5, 1196.5] ms from sentence onset , and thus during the POI \"is next to \". During the POI \"the Y\" participants tend to look at Target Y , the mention ed target, more than Target X, although the significant divergence onset does not start before 4045.1 K. Seeber, D. Pan 136 [3940.1, POI \"the Yinterpr etation \". In the LQ condition, the only significant divergence between looks a t Target X and Target Y starts at 3760.1[3680.1, 3840.1] , during the POI \"the Y interpretation \", with participants looking at Target Y more than at Target X. Like in the comprehen sion task, visual attention to Target Y shifte d earlier in the LQ condition. The analysis of parti cipan ts' pupil size across tasks and sound quality conditions shows significantly larger pupil diameter d uring POI \"Target Y \" as compared to \"Target Y \" in bot h tasks . During comprehens ion, LQ s ound did not significantly affect pupil dia meter. During interpretin g, pupil size was significantly larger than during comprehension, and LQ sound engendered significan tly larger pupil diameter than HQ sound. Conclusion Sound quality modul ates the shift of visual attention (measured as proportion of fixations) to mentioned objects during comprehension and simu ltaneous interpreting , suggesting a quanti tative and a tempora l effect. On the one hand, low sound seems to decreas e the likelihood of shifting visual at tention to the first object mentioned . On the other hand, it appe ars to increase the speed with which visual attention is allocated to the second object mentioned. Cognitive load (measured a s pupil diameter ) is signif icantly higher during interpreting than it is during comprehension. Als o, whil e the low -quality sound used in this experiment did not modulate load during comprehension, it generated significantly higher load during simultaneous interpreting. Regardless of the task, load significantly increases towards the end of the se ntence. References Altmann, Gerry T.M. 2004.

Kseniia Studenikina Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, Lomonosov Mos cow State University, Russ ian Federation https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract Parameterizin g agreemen t variation requires the analysis of multiple language factors . This paper investigates th e role of number morphology in determining agreement strategy. I n present study , I consider the variation in Russian noun phra ses with coordinated modifiers , also kno wn as nominal right node raising constructions (NRNR) . Previous studies pointed out semant ic, discourse and syntactic factors parameterizing th e agreement variation. Using experimental study, I show that the type of noun number inflection imposes certain r estrictions on the possible agreement strategy in Russian NRNR . I argue that considering n oun morphology enables to opt for the theoretical app roach explaining variation in this construction. Keywords: number morphology, agreement, variation, coo rdination, right node raising Introduction In order to parameterize agreement variation in a certain construction, it i s necessary to list the variety of factors which can be iden tified as predictors for choosing one or another agreeing option . The present paper dea ls with the influence of morphological factors on the agreement strategy. The study invest igates variation i n Russian noun phrases with coordin ated modifiers , also known as nominal right node raising constructions (NRNR, Shen 2018) . Nominal right node rais ing construction s Russian nominal right node raising constructions are noted to demonstrat e number agreement variation: both distributive strategy (singular noun) and summative strategy (plural noun) are acceptable (1). Previously semantic, disco urse and s yntactic factors parameterizing the agreement variation were considered (Kodzasov 1987 ). However, the role of noun morphology in Russian has no t been studied before. (1) vysok -ij i nizk-ij student / student -y tall-SG and short -SG student .SG / student -PL 'the tall and the short student ' K. Studenikina 138 The correlation between the morphology and the agre ement was described for Bulgarian (Harizanov & Griban ova 2015 ). The regular numb er morphology of the noun enables only summative strategy (2) while the irre gular numbe r morphology -SG.M nation -PL/ nation .SG 'the Bulgarian and Russian nations ' (3) naj-nisk-o-to i naj-visok -o dete/ most -tall-SG.N child/children 'the short est and tallest child ' The syntactic analysis proposes an ATB -movement, number feature is assumed to be privative. The difference between regular and irregular morphology is explained by early insertion of lexical roots and late insertion of inflec tion morphemes (Em bick & Halle 2005). The root is inserted before syntactic movements, but the plural feature arises in syntactic derivation. Therefore, contextual allomorphy is impossible. Experimental study In order to examine the relation between the nu mber morphology an d the agreement in Russian, I conducted a self -paced acceptability experiment (Likert scale 1 -7). It tested 2 factors: the noun number (singular/ plural) and the morphological noun type : suppletion and stem alternations (4), suffix altern ations (5), and plurale tantum (6b), regular nouns (7). Statistical analysis was conducted with linear mixed models.

Studenikina 140 Thus, the analysis with ATB -movement explains the preference of singular forms with stem alternations. However, the acceptability of both singular and plural forms with suffix alternations and with regular morphology is impossible if the number feature is privative. I argue that multidominance analysis should be applied (Shen 2018 ). According to this approach, the number feature is equipollent, which explains the acceptability of singular a nd plural forms with suffix a lternations and with regular morphology. Since the multidominant structure is derived after the insertion of lexical roots, the contextual allomorphy becomes impossible on this stage. Thus, it explains the unacceptability of pl ural forms with suppletive mo rphology and stem alternations.

However, its origins are little understood. Accounts differ on whether it is an Irish transfer feature or an Early Modern English retention. To investigate the possibility of this being a synchronic transfer feature from Irish 448 DRESS tokens recorded from bilingual L1 Irish speakers were acoustically analysed and compared with 450 DRESS tokens from monolingual English speakers from the same r egion. L1 Irish speakers of English showed a higher degre e of pre -nasal raising than monolingual English speakers. However, an equivalent analysis of the bilingual speakers' Irish ( 113 tokens) shows no evidence of pre -nasal raising. These findings cast dou bt on the possibility of an Irish origin for DRESS -raisin g in Irish English. Keywords: Irish English, DRESS -raising, PEN-PIN merger, contact Irish English Introduction Phonological accounts of western Irish English describe raising of the vowel in the DRESS lexical set (Kallen 2012, Peters 2016 ). Historically occurring in a wide variety of phonological contexts , it is now largely a pre-nasal phenomenon , hence its being termed the PEN-PIN merger. Peters ' 2016 study of Galway City English found this merger to be a recessive feature, occurring mainly in the speech of the older population . The origins of DRESS -raising in Irish English are subject to speculation . Kallen (2012) and Henry (1957 , p. 76 ) have drawn parallels with Early M odern English (brought to Ireland during the 17th century), which exhibited /e/- raising before /s/, /l/ or /n/ + consonant . Others (\u00d3 Baoill 1997, O'Sullivan 1942 as cited in Peters 2016 ) have attributed DRESS -raising to phonological transfer from Irish, which is said to demonstrate raising of // to / / in nasal environments in Connacht and Munster (\u00d3 Siadhail 1989 Baoill (1997) parallels Irish mid -vowel raising in both Connacht and Munster. Varieties of Irish English spoken by L1 Irish speakers provide a setting for investigati ng the extent of phonological transfer from Irish to English . Such varieties are reported to exhibit particularly extensive Irish influence (\u00d3 h\u00dardail 1997) and, as put by Harris , (1991, p. 45) are an \"obvious research site for testing assumptions about th e influence of Irish on the development of Irish English\" . K. Tallon 142 To shed light on the plausibility of an Irish source for Irish English DRESS - raising , this study addresses the follow ing research question: Do L1 Irish speakers of English have a particularly exte nsive presence of dress -raising when compared to monolingual English speakers from the same region? Methodology Data collection Two sets of participants from the Connemara Ga eltacht (Irish -speaking region) in the west of Ireland were recorded . Group 1 con sisted of ten L1 Irish speaker s (Irish -English bilinguals) ; Group 2 consisted of ten monolingual English speakers . Each group comprised five male and five female speakers, giving a total of twenty participants . Participants were recorded individually in their own homes. Two English datasets were recorded from each participant : a short interview and a series of sentences . This resulted in a total of 448 DRESS tokens for bilingual speakers (191 interview tokens, 257 sentence tokens ) and 450 DRESS tokens for m onolingual speakers (198 interview , 252 sentences). Additionally, an Irish dataset (interview and sentences) was collected from the bilingual speakers , giving 113 // tokens. Recordings were made using an AT2020 USB microphone and an Apple Macbook Pro. Data analysis F1 and F2 measurem ents were extracted for all vowel tokens via Praat . To facilitate investigation of a PEN-PIN merger 753 (total) KIT tokens and 144 tokens of / / in Irish were also measured. These measurements were Z-score normalised in R ( R Core Team 2022) to facilitate interspeaker comparison. The ggplot function in R was used to visualise the data . DRESS tokens were subdivided into pre -oral and pre -nasal ( PEN) contexts to investigate pre -nasal raising . To quantify the degree of raising for each group of speakers, Pillai scores were calculated via MANOVA tests in R as a measure of overlap between vowel groups . Results Figure 1 demonstrates that L1 Iri sh speakers show ed greater overlap of PEN and KIT vowels than monolingual speakers. The degree of vowel overlap for each speaker is represented by Pillai scores given in Table 1. These results confirm that bilingual speakers have a larger degree of overlap between PEN and KIT vowels than monolingual speakers. In addition, monolingual speakers DRESS and PEN vowels show little separation when compared to those of bilingual speakers . DRESS-raising in Connemara English: the role of Irish 143 Figure 1. Scatterplot of DRESS , KIT AND P EN vowels for bilingu al (L1 Irish) English and monolingual English. Table 1. Summary of Pillai scores for vowel groups of each dataset . Irish // tokens were similarly divided into pre -nasal and pre -oral contexts and were plotted with Irish / / tokens for contextualisation . Figure 2 shows that the bilingual speakers' produ ction of Irish / / vowels did not mirror that of their English, i.e. no evidence of expected // raising was present in the Irish tokens. In addition, t he Pillai scores for Irish were closer to those for monolingual English than for bilingual English . Discussion and conclusion L1 Irish speakers showed a greater degree of pre-nasal DRESS -raising than monolingual English speakers from the same region . The role of L1 Irish transfer in such a discrepancy is naturally considered . However, b ilingual speakers did not show equivalent raising in their Irish (Figure 2 ).

Research on Stockholm University , Sweden 2Brain & Cognitive Sciences , University of Rochester , US https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract Listeners can understand talkers despite cross -talker variabi lity in the mapping from phonetic cues to linguistic categories. The mechanisms that und erlie this adaptive ability are not well understood. We test to what extent listeners can adapt their interpretation of speech based on the distribution of phonetic cue s in the recent input, and whether prior expectations about how talkers typically sound guide and constrain this process. Keywords: speech perception, speech adaptation, distributional learning Introduction Spoken language is highly variable - a given tal ker's /d/ in \"din\" may sound more like another's /t/ in \"tin\". These differences arise from multiple sources including physiological, linguistic, and extra -linguistic factors. Despite the absence of invariant acoustic cue s to a talker's intended category, listeners usually comprehend talkers with apparent ease. When faced with unfamiliar accents, listeners often adapt with little exposure (e.g., Bradlow , Bent 2008). The mechanism s underl ying such adaptation are not yet fully understood . One hypothesis holds that as listeners encounter a talker, they incrementally learn the statistics of that talker's input and integrate it with their prior expectations of how talkers should sound ( cf. ideal adapter , Kleinschmidt , Jaeger 2015). We exposed US American English (AE) listeners to recordings of AE that was phonetically manipulated between participants. All listeners heard word recordings starting with /d/ or /t/ (e.g., \"dill\" or \"till\"). Recordings varied in the primary phonetic cue to the /d/ -/t/ contrast (voice onset time, VOT). Between participants, an initial exposure phase shifted the VOT distributions for /d/ and /t/ by +0, +10, or +40msecs. We assessed the consequences of those shifts during subsequent test phase s that were identical across all participants. Methods Our approach closely follows previous work (Clayards et al. 2008, Kleinschmidt , Jaeger 2016, Theodore , Monto 2019 ) but extends these paradigms in ways intended to increase the ecological validity of the stimuli and M. Tan, R. Sabatello , I. Savic , T.F. Jaeger 146 exposure dist ributions. Our d esign choices were also motivated by intentions to computationally model the incremental changes in listener behaviour at each phase of exposure . Here, however , we report empirical observations. Materials Previous work employed stimuli that sounded r obotic (Clayards et al.; Kleinschmidt & Jaeger, 2016 ) unnatural cue correlations (Theodore & Monto, 2019 ). We used a Praat script (Winn, 2020) to create t hree human -sounding minimal pair VOT continua (dill -till, dip -tip, and din-tin) from origin al voice recordings of a 23 -year-old female AE native speaker. The continua ranged from -100ms to +130ms VOT in 5ms steps. To avoid unnatural correlations with secondary cues to onset stop voicing in AE, we set the F0 at vowel onset to follow its nat ural c orrelation with VOT, as observed in the original recordings . Similarly, the duration of the vowel was set to follow the natural trade -off relation with VOT reported in Allen & Miller (1999). Design To assess incremental changes in listeners' categor izatio n functions, we employed a multi -block exposure -test design (Fig. 1) . Exposure was manipulated between participants. We first estimated listeners' expectations for a typical talker's VOT means and variances of /d/ and /t/. These estimates were based both o n a norming experiment with our stimuli (N=24) and a phonetic database of AE onset stop voicing (Chodroff & Wilson, 201 7). We then made three exposure conditions that shifted the VOT distributions for /d/ and /t/ by +0ms, +10ms, or +40ms relative to our 't ypical talker' estimate (Fig. 2). Previous work set exposure distributions in the voiced and voiceless categories to have equa l variance and to be distributed symmetrically around the category mean. Neither is the case for natural language. We thus sampled stimuli (see Fig. 2) from distributions with unequal variances observed in natural language (e.g., Chodroff & Wilson, 2017). Figure 1. Block design of experiment with number of critical trials in each block . Test blocks were identical within and between conditions . Lines show the underlying distributions of the exposure and test stimuli . Block transitions were concealed from p articipants . Listeners' categori sation behavio ur in exposure blocks consisted of 12 VOT -items ( from -5ms-70ms), counter - balanced by minimal -pairs. In total there were 234 tr ials (including 18 catch trials that served to assess participant attention). Participants 122 AE listeners (male = 61; mean age = 37.6 years, SD = 12 years) were recruited from the Prolific crowdsourcing platform, and randomly assigned to one of the three exposure conditions (+0ms, +10ms, and +40ms shift). Procedure Participants first underwent a headphones test and were given instructions to answer as quickly and as accurately as possible before the experiment began. On each exposure trial, participant s clicked on a green button to play the recording of the word. Simultaneously, written forms of possible responses were displayed on the top left and top right of the screen. As shown in Fig. 2, half of the exposure trials labelled the voicing category: e. g., if a recording was intended to be voiced , both displayed words started with \"d\" ( e.g., displaying \"dill\" and \"dip\" for a \"d/till\" recording). The other half of the trials were unlabelled (e.g., displaying \"dill\" and \"till\" for a \"d/till\" recording). Upon clicking on the word heard the next trial commence d. Test trials were always unlabelled. The order of trials and the left -right placement of responses was randomized for each participant, and counter -balanced across participants . Figure 2. Histograms of distributions of /d/ and /t/ for the three exposur e conditions. Black density lines are identical across panels and show the VOT distribution that the +0ms condition is sampled from. Results and discussion Figure 3 shows listener categorisation behavi our at each test block. We focus on the estimated cate gory boundary (point of subjective equality , PSE). Block 1 indicates participants' PSE before informative exposure , indicating participants' prior expectations about the VOT distribution of /d/ and /t/ for this talker . Our previous estimate of th is PSE (24.5, which determined the +0ms exposure distributions) proved to be about 20 ms lower than the PSE observed for Block 1 (44.7 ms). M. Tan, R. Sabatello , I. Savic , T.F. Jaeger 148 By Block 2, the PSE of all exposure conditions ha d shifted. The directi on and magnitude of these shifts qualitatively follow the predictions of an ideal adaptor (or similar theories of incremental adaptation). Specifically, (1) the PSEs for the three conditions order in the same way as the means of exposu re distributions (+0m s < +10ms < +40ms); (2) the PSE of Block 2 shifted leftwards relative to Block 1 for the +0ms and +10ms conditions, in line with the observation that the prior PSE was actually about 20ms to the right of what we intended to be the +0ms condition (so that + 0ms is actually -20ms exposure and +10ms is actually -10ms exposure); and, finally, (3) the PSE of Block 2 shifted rightwards relative to Block 1 for the +40ms conditions (which is actually +20ms exposure once the correct prior PSE is considered). These P SEs remained fairly unchanged through Blocks 3 -6: the remaining 96 exposure trials had only minor effect s that showed mostly in the most extreme shift (+40ms exposure ). This suggests that participants learned the distributions of the talker quickly -after e xposure to 48 trials (2nd panel). Of note is that, despite these rapid changes in PSEs, the extent to which PSEs change d was greatly limited: even though the +0ms and +40ms exposure distributions differed by 40ms, the PSEs for those two conditions only dif fered by 10 -14ms. While these results are broadly consistent with exemplar and Bayesian theories of incremental adaptation, they also raise novel questions. In particular, it is unclear why shifts are both so quic k\u2014which would seem to imply weak weighting of prior expectations \u2014and yet strongly constrained \u2014which would seem to imply strong weighting of prior expectations. To the best of our knowledge, this tension has not previously been discussed but strikes as an important characteristic of speech adaptatio n to be understood. Figure 3.

We predicted a differential access to idiomatic representations due to different bilingual experiences. Untrained bilinguals and professional translators were compa red on the availability of cognitive resources to process idiom s for late r translation, employing a dual task paradigm. Our hypothesis was that translators would count on more available cognitive resources (i.e., more automatic behavior). Contrary to our predictions, results showed that translators, compared to bilinguals, exe rted higher levels of cognitive control over the task, possibly to guarantee the high -quality standards required by professional translation. Findings are discussed in light of theore tical models of bilingual idiomatic processing and professional practice. Keywords: idiom s, figurative language, bilingualism, translation . Introduction Idioms (e.g., hit the road ) are \"multiword conventional expressions whose semantic meaning cannot be d erived from the comprehension of the individual words in the sentence \" (Cacciari , Tabossi, 1988) . Scholars have investigated how idioms are processed and represented in the native (L1) and second language (L2). Studies have shown that idioms are processed more quickly than non-idiomatic matched literal expressions by native speakers and by some proficient L2 speakers who, due to greater exposure, can use a direct access route to retrieve the idiom entry instead of computing the individual words included in it (e.g., Carrol , Conklin 2014). The processing differen ces between idiomatic and non -idiomatic expressions have been accounted for by theoretical models that explain how idiomatic expressions are processed . These models vary as to the degree of the idioma tic figurative meaning being directly (or less directly) related to the literal meaning of its individual components. Specifically, hybrid models (e.g., Sprenger et al. 2006) posit that idiomatic entries are connected to/and retrieved through both the idio m's unitary lexical concept as well as the simple lemmas comprised in it. Hybr id m odels of idiomatic processing have been successfully applied to the bilingual domain, but whether they hold for professional translation is still unknown . The pr esent study explored the predictions of the hybrid models regarding a differential access to G. Togato , T. Bajo, P. Macizo 150 the idiom entry depending on whether translation expertise modulate s the strength of the associative links among st the idioms ' constituent lemmas (i.e., a direct r oute) . Intere stingly, it has been demonstrated that bilingua l idiomatic processing is modulated by idiomatic cross -linguistic (in)congruency ; specifically, authors have shown that the degree of idiomatic similarity across languages modulates the facilitation effect obs erved for idiomatic expressions in bilinguals (e.g., Titone et al. 2015) . Hence, (in)congruency will be critically considered in the present study . The only studies that have established a link between idiomatic processing and (early stages of) translatio n practice have focused on 1) language brokering experience (i.e., informal translation practice ) and 2) formal training in translation (e.g., L\u00f3pez et al. 2017). This is the first study that explores bilingual idiomatic processing as a function of profess ional translation expertise . Hypothesis and method ology Our hypothesis was that professional translators , relative to untrained bilinguals, would be able to map L1 and L2 idiomatic expressions (at the idiom entry level) in a relatively automatic way. We b ased our prediction on the idea that training in translation tasks allows comprehension and re trieval processes to be fast and automatic, which plays a key role in the allocation of task - relevant cognitive resources. We employed a translation task where we manipulated the cross -language congruency between idiom s (i.e., congruent vs. incongruent), a nd compared them to matched control expressions. To measure the degree of automaticity we asked participants to detect a tone while processing the idioms for post erior translation. In the tone detection methodology , the more cognitive resources are needed to process the idiomatic expression, the fewer resources will be left to process the tone. RTs to the tone will provide an index of the cognitive resources requir ed to process idioms by bilinguals and translators, and the ease to accomplish the task (i.e., automaticity). All the materials used in the experiment underwent normative studies to control relevant sociolinguistic and demographic variables . Results RTs for congruent idioms showed the \"usual \" idiomatic superiority effect for both bilinguals and translators ; in fact, RTs in response to the secondary task were faster while processing congruent idiom s relative to control sentences . However, translators were sl ower than bilinguals in tone detection when the tone was placed on incongruent idioms . This was not due to an inferior translation performance since accuracy analys es showed that translators outperformed bilinguals in correct translations both bilinguals and translators 151 Hence, the locus of the differences between the groups in the availability of cognitive resources might come from the degree to which they activated the L1 and L2 equivalent idiomatic entries relative to the activation of the individual le mmas across the two lang uages . All participants needed to activate the equivalent idiomatic entries to translate the idiom s correctly ; however, untrained bilinguals' errors while translating incongruent forms might be due to a word -by-word trans lation approach (i.e., the use of c o-activated individual words in the L1 and L2), relative to the activation of the equivalent idiomatic entries across languages. This interpretation was supported by additional analyses indicating that untrained bilingual s experienced significantly more word -by-word translations [i.e., He kicked the bucket = Pate\u00f3 el cubo (literal) instead of Estir\u00f3 la pata (idiomatic)] compared to the translators . These results suggest that translators , despite needing more cogni tive resources to process incongruent forms (slower RTs to tone detection), have more direct access to translation equivalent s at the superlemma level, and adopt a chunked approach to translation . Additionally, translators might be activating the figurati ve meaning of sentences even when they should not (i.e., while processing control units ). Therefore, we might interpret the relatively slower RTs previously observed in the processing of incongruent forms as due to the concurrent co -activation of the word -by-word me aning and the idiomatic meaning of the sentence. The translators might be increasing the t ime needed to detect the tone possibly because they need more cognitive resources to control for th e concurrent coactivation. Discussion and conclusions Our study indicated that t he facilitation effect for congruent idiom s did not depend on professional practice. However, differences between bilinguals and translators emerged when they processed incongruent idiom s: less automatized behavior and higher levels of cognit ive control were put into motion by translators to guarantee high -quality standards in translation. These results confirm the impact of cross -linguistic (in)congruency on bilingual idiomatic processing. This pattern can be accommodated within the hybrid mo dels of idiomatic processing : the se models posit that the lemmas of an idiom are bound together by one common entry in the mental lexicon and activated twice. Thus, until the appropriate meaning is sele cted, both the individual literal meaning s and the fig urative one would be activated and kept available . In addition, results of the study suggested that congruency was boosted by representational and linguistic overlap across languages, resulting in faste r G. Togato , T. Bajo, P. Macizo 152 of lemma/idiom co mpetition for incongruent idioms . Why were the simultaneous co -activation and related interference caused by incongruent idiom s detected in translators and not in bilinguals ? Although inhibitory control has been suggested as the way bilinguals select the required language, this mechanism does not seem appropriate to perform professional translation tasks (e.g., Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al. 2010; Togato et al. 2017). Our study is in line with hybrid models of idiomatic processing and those studies based on the idea that b ilinguals and translators may differ as to the way they negotiate their two languages.

In Romanian lingu istics , lexical blending has been seldom men tioned, interest resting only in speech error s, and not in the deliberate phenomenon as a full y- fledged word formation p rocess of Romanian mo rphology. We believe that our data analysis suggests a shift in Romanian word form ation tendenc ies, possibly under the pervasive influence of English. Keywords: lexical blen ding, elicitation experiment, Romanian language, word formation, language change Introduction Lexical blending, i.e. the process of coining a new lexeme o ut of (at least) two other source lexemes with some material loss from one or both source -words (Bauer, Lieber, Plag 20 13, Renner 2022 , a.o.) is a minor word formation p rocess (Bauer 2021) with a sharp increase in productivity not only in present -day English (Kemmer 2 003, Mattiello 2019), but also in other European languages, such as Polish (Konieczna 2012) or Bulgarian (Stamenov 2015). For present - day Roman ian, we have observed a similar tende ncy that we wanted to study more closely, especially since the phenomenon did not re ceive a ttention in Romanian linguistics before, not being included among Roma nian word formation reference works . Since lexical blending is specific to Englis h and the English influenc e seems to be the driving force fo r the increased produ ctivity of lexical blending in other languages , and since little, if anything has been said about Romanian lexical blending as a word formation process, thus implying that compounding would be used in naming hybrid objects, our hypo thesis was that Romanian native speaker s with a n above -average knowledge of Englis h wo uld produce more blends in English , but more compound s and fewer blends (if any) M.

Stimuli and task The stimuli , 50 images of hy brid non-existent objec ts (e.g. half-orang e, half- pear pear fruit), balanced to repre sent ani mals, fruits, objec ts and m ixtures (e.g. a half-frog, ha lf-broccoli entity ), retrieved online ( e.g. from Pinterest) or manipulated by the authors , were chosen to display differe nt degrees of phonetic si milarity between the expected source -words in Romanian , rangin g from no common features (e.g. banan 'banana ' + kiwi 'kiwi') to a large on phonemes (e.g. banan 'banana '+ ananas 'pineapple '). Subjects were asked to name each object us ing a single wor d in Romanian for 25 images and the same for English . The order of the language block s was counterbalanced across participants and s ubjects were able to self -pace the images . 57 subjects recorded themselves, and 52 subjects wrote down the answers . Due to t he pandemic con ditions, the experiment wa s carried out online. Figure 1. An image disp laying a half-orange, half -pear hybrid fruit . The task summ ary was repeated on each slide. Romanian lexical blendi ng: from zero to hero. 155 The 109 subjects produced 5488 word s, sometimes creating two names for the same image . 59 words presented a language mixing effect (e.g. mandarlic < Ro. mandarin 'tangerine' + En. garlic) so we could not assign them to any langu age and were d iscarded from the final analysis that compr ised 2727 Romanian and 2702 English words . Subjects used lexical blending, compounding , broaden ing (participants used one of the source -words to name the hybrid ), affixation or a random proper name not connected with the objects as naming strategies . Some word s were coded ambiguous either because the word formation process used was opaque or because they can have multiple i nterpretations . Table 1. Th e naming strategies used by subjects in Romanian and English . Romanian Englis h Blends 68.50% 64.66% both l anguages , lexical b lending was the preferred strategy used for naming hybrid objec ts. While this is in line with the literature for English as the morpho -semantic iconicit y of blend ing plays a ma jor part (Renner 2020), it contra dicts the expectation s for Romanian : the traditional naming strate gy for hybrid objects is compounding as shown in the literature or (academic ) dictionarie s that record already -establ ished words ects (see, for instanc e, struocmil 'ostrich -camel ', a literary creation that has come to be used ironically for any mixture of two different things whose outcome is considere d pointless ). Our results mirror the ones obtained for Ukrainian by Borgwaldt, Kulish & Bose (2012) . The aut hors argue that the ir subjects invest ed more effort in the naming task because they were friends of the researc hers. But this explanation does not hold in our case, since our subjects were students who fulfil led the task for co urse credits , were only told that they need to follow the instruct ions and that there were no correct or expected answers , and did the task in their own p ace. Another un expected result is the fact that the subjects produced slightl y more blends in Ro mania n than in English , perhaps be cause students are more used to creat ing new wor ds in Romanian, their mothe r tongue, than in English . Neverthel ess, the English and Romanian b lends obtained are comparab le, suggesting that, contrary to the non -existent Romanian literature on the subject , the process seems to be just as alive in Roma nian as in English , at least for Conclusion and further research Our results suggest that, most probably under the English influence, lexical blending has beco me the preferred strategy for naming hybrid objects at least for the Romanian native speakers in our study both in English and Roma nian, possibly indicating a shift in the Romanian word fo rmatio n patterns . Further testing is neces sary to establish whether lexical b lending is restric ted to Romani an native speakers o f a particular age or/and with a good c ommand o f English or no t.

ExLing 20 22 Paris : Co nference of Expe rimental Linguis tics, 17-19 October 202 2, Paris, France Word recognition in Developmental Language Disorders in Greek Konstantinos Vasileiou , Georgia Andreou Department Greec e https: //doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract To this day, characteristics of the online visual perception in DLD remain quite unexplored . This study aimed to investigate the dynamic recognition of spoken words for nouns and ve rbs in children with D evelopme ntal Language Disorder whose spoken language is Greek. 9 children with DLD participated in this pilot study and their eye movements were recorded as they searched among a n array of pictures for the target picture in response t o hearing a single . The result s showed that children with DLD presented a stronger performance of recognition for verbs than nouns while the more the word information the quicker the recognition. Keywords: Developmental Language Disorder, eye -tracking , word recognition Introdu ction The term Developmental Language Disorder (DLD ) refers to persistent difficulties in acquiring, understanding, producing or using written and spoken language that arise during development and cause significant limitations in the communication abilit ies of th e person. The language deficits of the disorder are not consistent with the individual's mental age and are not attributable to another neurodevelopmental or sensory disorder or other neurological condition (ICD -11, 2018). The areas of deficits cove r the w hole range of language, namely semantics, syntax, morphology, phonology and pragmatics (Leonard, 2014). While language processing based on verb argument structure in children with DLD has been studied, this has been done mainl y with off -line method ologies . Visual world paradigm (Tanenhaus et al., 1995 has made the online investigation of language feasible . This model basically makes use of eye-tracking while the child simultaneously sees a n image and listens to the correspondin g naming thus offering real-time measurements of language processing. The aim of the present work is to investigate the dynamics of spoken word recognition for nouns and verbs in children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) as part of a pilot study which attempts to ada pt and replicate the study of Andreu, Sanz -Torrent and Guardia -Olmos (2012). In particular, it will be studied if children with DLD show better performance in identifying verb and noun targets in response to auditory/visually presente d words in the K. Vasileiou , G. Andreou 158 Greek l anguage and whether verbs with a larger number of arguments take longer to retrieve due to more complex encoding in the semantic lexicon. Methods All participants had Greek as their mother tongue, normal vision, hearing, mental abilit y and lack of neurolog ical, s ensory and emotional deficits. Nine (9) children (6 boys - 3 girls) with DLD and age ranging from 4;6 to 7;11 years took part in this study. A language assessment based on the standard criteria given by ICD -11 for the diagnosis of DLD was addressed by the researcher . The assessment included intelligence scales, language tests, temperament and socio -economic questionnaires, tests of psycho -emotional development and assessment of oral structure and motor function. 18 nouns and 18 verbs ( six one-argum ent, six two-argument, and xix three - argument) made up the target words. Care was taken to weight number of syllables , frequency of occurrence and age of acquisition in words of the same category. Each word was paired with a correspon ding image rated as hi ghly visual by a group of adults. Each target image was then combined with 3 other images (distractors) so that the resulting set of four images always include d 2 object images and 2 action images. The words were uttered and recorded by a native Greek spea ker whi le they were placed in four square quadrants on the computer screen. The duration of the spoken target word was constant (i.e. 1 sec) and was embedded in a 4 -sec mp4 file. Participants were instructed to look at the picture tha t would be heard until it disappears from the screen. Familiarization tests precede d. A region of interest was defined for each target image based on screen coordinates to coincide with the rectangle surrounding the image. Results Figure 1 demonstrates t hat the proportion of no fixations is smaller to the more complex verbs. The proportions were calculated by excluding any trial track losses (i.e. events where the participants did not show any gaze to the picture ) and then dividing the rest of the events to the total number of trials per word. In fig ure 2. the pro portion of successful trials over time is presented . 3 time windows are noted (i.e. 200 -1000ms, 1000 -2000ms, 2000 -4000ms). Success was defined as a first fixation to the correct stimulus. The rate of increase was similar and linear across the different wor d type s during the first and second time window. Nevertheless, for times larger than 2000ms the rate was smaller, implying that the time to first fixation was likely to be during the 2000ms and if the child failed to fixate on the correct picture, it was unlikely that would do so for times larger than 2000ms. A Poisson regression accounting for child -specific clustering using random effects was performed . The main outcomes were fixation times and time to first fixation . 19% increased fixations in verbs of type 1 (1-argument) compared to Word recognition in Developmental Language Disorders in Greek 159 nouns was found. This increase was marginally significant. Another 21% of increased fixations on verbs of type 2 and 28% of increased fixations on verbs of type 3 c ompared to nouns were found and both increases were signific ant. Respectively, overall children needed approximately 5% less time to first fixation when it came to verb type 1 or verb type 2 compared to nouns, whereas same time to first fixation between a noun and a verb of typ e 3 was noted. In addition, there was a 17% decrease in the fixation counts when the word consisted of 3 or 4 syllables compared with 2 -syllables words. This result was significant. Respectively, children with DLD needed 32% and 21% m ore time to first fixa tion to a word with 3 or 4 syllables c ompared with 2 -syllable words. These results were significant. Figure 1. Proportion of fixations and no -fixations for each word type . Figure 2. Proportion of fixations to the nouns (no), on e-argument (v1), two - argument (v2) and three -argument verbs over time from the video onset . K. Vasileiou , G. Andreou 160 Accounting for age, sex, duration of speech therapy, Raven's PM scores and language scores , no effect of any was found. That meant that both the number of fixati ons and the time to fi rst fixat ion did not change for any one unit in the language, cognitive or demographic scores. Conclusion The current work intended to collect data about the way Greek speaking children recognize nouns and verbs as measured by an on -line eye -tracking experiment. As a result, children with DLD demonstrated a tendency to recognize verbs in a faster way than nouns, while as the number of the verb arguments increased, the recognition was becoming faster. These findings not only did they not replicate the resul ts the o riginal study in Spanish speaking children with DLD offered, but also showed quite the contrary. Since Greek literature has not still offered rich data on the online understanding of words in the DLD population, this pilot stu dy suggested that in s ome way the verb argument information helped children with DLD to achieve a quicker recognition of more complex words . That would be attributed to the more concrete semantic nature of verbs with more arguments (i.e. sell) as opposed t o the more abstract na ture of verbs with fewer arguments (i.e. cry ) that were used in this study . Since the more the word information the quicker the word recognition, a significant role of the semantic links the children own may be arose. A control group as well as the enrollm ent of a bigger population will shed light on the initial research question invigorating the observation power of the current study .

Proceedings Ex Ling 20 22: 13th International Con ference of Experimental L inguistic s, 17-19 October, Paris, France Testing variables of linguistic prestige in sociolinguistic questionnaires Tobias Weber Graduate School Language & Literature, Ludwig -Maximilians -Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnche n, Germany paper outlines a questio nnaire to investigate the influence of sociolinguistic descriptions on language attitudes and prestige. It follows a design commonly employed in customer choice and ma rket research: A (semi -)fictitious entity is presented to different respondents with a ra nge of descriptors or values to test the effect of particular variables of interest. Respondents are then asked to rank or share their perception of the entity's diffe rent attributes. This design can be transferred to sociolinguistic descriptions regarding speaker numbers, degree of urbanity, institutional support, or historical importance. The goal is to learn more about sociolinguistic factors that influence language attitudes and to be ab le to quantify their effects. This knowledge can be used by activis ts and stakeholders when discussing language vitality. Keywords: sociolinguistics, prestige, language attitude, ideology, survey Introduction Perceptions about langu ages, their prestige, formulated as attitudes or ideologies are difficult to operationali se. These concepts touch upon abstract understandings of language, identity, or speakerhood, which are equally complex in their formalisation. At the same time, many s ocial sciences dealing with preferences and attitudes have long -standing traditions of me asuring these for their research. This paper outlines a questionnaire type inspired by customer and market research that can be used to understand the formation of pre stige and to quantify the importance of different factors. A pilot of the questionnaire is currently circulating. Background In the sociolinguistic research tradition, language regard or attitude research has been largely carried out through qualitative, ethnographic study on the one hand, or judgements of grammaticality and perception (e.g. the matched -guise test) on the other (cf. Garrett 2010). As a parallel development in the sociology of language (Fishman 1991), researchers using an abstract perspecti ve on language and its users have attempted to describe the same phenomena based on quant itative measurements, such as speaker numbers, enrolment in language courses, or economic benefits. A prominent example can be seen in Abram de Tobias Weber 162 Swaan's Q-value or communication value calcul ated for a range of official state languages (2001). While the comm unication value is not equal to linguistic prestige, qualitative sociolinguistic research confirms that speakers consider the notion of \"usefulness\" of a language when planning language acq uisition or transmission (Vigouroux & Mufwene 2020). The approach p resented in this paper aims to reconcile these research strands by offering a tool to operationalise and measure effect sizes for different variables that influence linguistic prestige and the perception of languages based on individual responses to a ques tionnaire. Market researchers investigating consumer choice face a similar situation where they can either ask customers about particular products and brands or attemp t to generalise decisi ons based on abstract attributes of the industry and its goods. Wh ile a company might be very interested to hear about its comparative prestige among competitors, the reasons for these differences may remain opaque because it is diffi cult to control for al l variables in real -world examples. Likewise, a perception test or attitude questionnaire on a set of languages can produce very insightful reports on particular sociolinguistic settings, yet leave the underlying generative mechanism in parts to the invest igators' interpretation. To provide deeper understanding of these mechanisms and the interaction between variables, market research also uses fictional cases to test hypotheses or experiment with particular variables - the same method can also be applied t o sociolinguistic research. Methodology As indicated above, this research is based on a questionnaire, yet its central ideas may also be applied to interviews: A (semi -)fictitious sociolinguistic description is presented to the respo ndents who are asked t o describe their attitudes towards the language and its speakers a fterwards. The latter part can be conducted through the evaluation of declarative statements, estimation of similarity and social distance, likeliness to interact with the language (e.g. as a learner, in social activism, financial support), or through open -ended interview questions. The descriptions can be varied between different groups, in accordance with the purpose of the study. For the pilot study, these variables were speaker numbers, i nstitutional support, Global North vs. Global South, and urban lif estyle. While some of these variables like speaker figures could be coded with their real values (for linear regression), these were treated as ordinal or binary data i n the pilot to keep th e number of experimental groups manageable (i.e. [larger] vs. [sma ller], [+institutional support] vs. [ -institutional support]). In addition, the marginal effect of speakers, schools, or village counts on perception and prestige canno t be calculated on thi s atomistic level beyond extreme cases such as languages with 0 or 1 speaker. Similarly, de Swaan's Q- value also uses a ratio of speakers for the calculation of communicative value. Variables of linguistic prestige in sociolinguistic questi onnaires 163 It is important to note that the texts are purposel y phrased in a way tha t can trigger stereotypes, emphasise aspects of ethnolinguistic vi tality, or present generalisations about the language and its speakers. Many linguists, myself included, would contest this essentialist presentation of a sociolinguist ic situation for any l anguage. Subsequently, a stereotyped description of real -world examples can be considered unethical, as they replicate historical injuries. With fictitious examples, these descriptions exist within a grey area of ethics: the general s tyle of presentation m ay be deprecated but the examples serve as a blank canvas for the experiment. There are certain boundaries that must be respected, even with fictitious languages; racial slurs, religious discrimination, or colonial stereotypes are to be avoided in all cont exts. The text should rather evoke the impression of a travel guid e or encyclopedia entry. Importantly, all participants are informed about the fictitious nature of the examples after completing the questionnaire, with further informa tion on how existing language communities may be supported.

Historical importance Recent archaeological findings suggest that, in [before the colonisation], the ___ lived in a network of smaller city states. - Discussion This section will discuss som e insights from the pi lot and participant feedback that will be used to improve the exp erimental design further. First, participants generally found this novel approach to be engaging, as it led to reflections about their own language use and linguistic at titudes. At the same t ime, the abstract nature of the questions caused some difficultie s for some respondents who stated that \"it was difficult for me to answer questions because I have not Tobias Weber 164 heard of [these] languages\". There is no straightforward solution, as most non - linguists will not be aware of many languages outside of their everyday li ves. The presented approach using fictitious examples circumvents availability bias but requires more explanation of the task in the questionnaire. Second, the question naire drew some critic ism levelled at the ranking or explicit formulation of attitudes. This social desirability bias was especially prominent among student respondents stating that \"no language is better or prettier than another [...] I did not want to answ er those questions\". W hile I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment (\"I would love to see more people speak minority languages\"), most respondents have studied a foreign language themselves and thus made a decision for or against some of the world's langu ages. This link to dec ision making could be used for an improved version of the questio nnaire, where participants estimate the probability of learning the (fictitious) language or attending a cultural event of the community. Furthermore, a different presen tation of the ranking questions may reduce reluctance to respond honestly. Last, it wa s uplifting to see that respondents (mostly students in Germany) expressed an interest in learning more about linguistic diversity and minority languages. The experiment al approach may help t o broaden the range of languages studied in attitude surveys, as a set of languages the respondents know will always favour languages of wider communication and global languages. While the fictitious examples do not count as languages , they provide a refer ence point in the data for the vast majority of languages that ar e unfamiliar to the participants. To this end, the experiment aims to increase their visibility in research. References De Swaan, A. 2001. Words of the World: The Globa l Language System. Cam bridge, Polity Press. Fishman, J. 1991.

The \"flip -flop\" phenomen on has been observed in J\u00ecn entering tones . Both Lli\u00e1ng and B\u00ecngzhu J\u00ecn have two entering ton es, namely, Ynr\u00f9 tone and Y\u00e1ngr\u00f9 tone. The B\u00ecng zhu entering tones have a \"Yn -low vs. Y\u00e1ng -high\" contrast, which is opposi te the L li\u00e1ng \"Yn - high vs. -low\" contrast. 34 . This study reconstru cts a four-stage path that shows how this \"flip-flop\" , Lli\u00e1ng \"Yn -high tion J\u00ecn is a major , which is spoken in Shnx provin ce and neighboring regions . B\u00ecngzhu and Lli\u00e1ng two main dialects of J\u00ecn spok en in Shnx and Sh nx provinces . These t wo dialects both have two entering tones, namely, Y nr\u00f9 tone and Y\u00e1ngr\u00f9 tone (Shen 2006). It is generally assumed that Yn tone has a higher pitch than Y\u00e1ng tone within the same Middle Chinese tone category . Howev er, we find that the B\u00ecngzhu entering tones have a \"Yn -low v s. Y\u00e1ng -high\" contrast, which i s to the L li\u00e1ng \"Yn -high vs. Y\u00e1ng -low\" contrast. Wang (1967) first proposed the linguistic concept \"flip -flop\" to describe alternations of two tones, in which the high tones become low tones and th e low tones becom e high tones in certain linguis tic environments. By analysing 34 native Lli\u00e1ng and B\u00ecngzhu J\u00ecn Chinese speakers' recordings , and demonstrating pitch of Ynr\u00f9 tone (T4a) and Y\u00e1ngr \u00f9 tone (T4b), we identify four stages with re gard to the devel opment of the two entering tone s. We argue that the contrast of B\u00ecngzhu entering tones has evolved from that of L li\u00e1ng. Y. Wei 166 Method ologies The \"multi -register and four -level\" tonal model (Zhu 1999 , 2005) , the universal tonal inventory, and t he evolutionary c omparative method (Zhu 2014, 20 18) are the main methodologies applied in this study. 34 native Lli\u00e1ng and B\u00ecngzhu J\u00ecn Chinese speakers' recordings have phonologically an alyzed . The software Praat was used to reduce noise on some re cordings, to annotate the recor ded tokens for tonal measurements, to extract pitch values, and to draw up spectrograms, etc. The method in Zhu (2010 ) was adopted to measure the tone -bearing par t of each token and to normalize the inter - and intra -speaker v ariations. Data analys es In thi s section, we demonstrate the evolution of J\u00ecn entering tones, to reconstruct a path that s hows how the L li\u00e1ng \"Yn -high vs. Y\u00e1ng -high\" contrast. We think the \"flip -flop\" that happened in J\u00ecn entering tones is a gradual phonetic change rather than a sudden reversal. Stage one: high T4a vs. low-dipping T4b The first stage is that T4a is a short high tone while T4b is a mid -short low - dipping tone. Five tonal systems belong to stage one as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1 . All the five systems are L li\u00e1ng dialect. -2-1.05-0.10.851.8 0 100 200 300Shilou-cgh T4b -dipping Four -stage evolution of J\u00ecn Chinese entering tones 167 The pitch height, esp ecially the height of tonal head of T4a, is as high as \"5\" on the scale of modal register under the framework of the multi -register -four- level model. T4b, as a low -dipping tone, is obviously lower than T4a. Stage two: lowering T4a vs. low -dipping T4b econd -level In the second stage, similar to the first stage, T4b is a low -dipping tone. However, T4a is gradually lowering its pitch height. Stage two has 10 systems, of which nine ar e Lli\u00e1ng dialect, and one is B\u00ecngzhu dialect. -2-0.90.21.32.4 0 300 100 200 200 300Qixian-wj T4a T4b two : lowering low -dipping T4b In stage three, when T4a continues lowering, T4b starts to change as well.

Stage four: low T4a vs. high T4b Stage four is the final stage, in which T4a is lower than T4b.

Conclusio ns This study , by providing the illus trative examples of L li\u00e1ng and B\u00ecngzhu entering tones, exhibits a four -stage evo lutionary path to explain how the Lli\u00e1ng \"Yn -high vs. Y\u00e1ng -low\" contrast final B\u00ecngzhu \"Yn - low vs. Y\u00e1ng -high\" contrast. The process of change is shown schematically in Figure 5. Figure 5. A schematic process of the \"flip -flop\" of L li\u00e1ng and B\u00ecngzhu entering tones . At the first stage, the T4a is a short high to ne while the T4b is a mid -short low tone with a dipping contou r. In stage two, the T4a begins to lower its height and lengthen its duration, to gradually become a mid -tone wit h a falling contour. From stage three, as the T4a continues lowering, the T4b sta rts changing as well to avoid merging with each other. The T4b , originally a low - dipping tone, becomes a back -dipping tone by raising its tonal head. For the final stage, the T4a becomes a mid - or low -falling tone, and the T4b becomes a high-falling tone. By the end of these four stages, the two entering tones have finished the \"flip -flop\" process from de fenqu / , 343-356. Wang, William S -Y. 1967. Phonological features of tone.

The consensus is that in the d isyllabic prosodic words in Shanghainese, F0 differences in lexical tones are neutr alized in the second syllable and that VOT and closure duration are the primary cues in maintaining the voicing/register con trast. However, a Shanghainese sandhi patterns: F0 is started to replace VOT and closure durati on as the primary cue for voicing/register contrast in the second syllable position. This process of F0 gradually acquiring the status of th e primary cue in the sandhi tone is very similar to tone split in initial positions in other language . Keywords: Tonogenesis, Cue weigh ting, Sound change, Sandhi pattern, Shanghainese . Introduction It is well -known that obstruents affect t he F0 of the fol lowing vowel, and the vowels f ollowing a voicele ss onset tend to have relatively higher F0 in many languages (e.g., Kirby & Ladd, 2015). Furthermore, in tonal languages where F0 differences indicate lexical contrasts, the relation bet ween v oicing and F0 is often manifested as co -occurr ence restrictions between tone and the onset consonant of tone -bearing syllables . In Shanghaine se, a disyllabic prosodic word gets its surface sandhi tone by delinking the tone of the second syllable and spread ing the tonemes of the first syllable over the two syllables. Fo r example, the prosodic word /3a v3b/ vLH/ has a surface form [M vH] (e.g., Yip, 1995). In Shanghainese, as traditional ly described, the functional cost of neutraliz ing tone in second syllables is mitigated by the preservation of vocal fold vibration. Some pre vious studies suggested that vocal fold vibration is no longer the primary cue (e.g., Chen & Wang, 2012), while others show that th e two categories have multidim ensional acoustic and articulatory correlates, including a signific ant difference in Closure of Duration of onset stop (CD) (Shen, Wooter & Wang, 1987) and in breathiness concentrated mainly at the onset of the following vowel (e.g., Ren, 1992). The lexica l contrasts can st ill be maintained when the primary cue changes . Such a change is reminiscent of tonogenesis, a type of cue shift that has been studied extensively (e.g., Hyman, 1973 ). In this work, w e want to explore how Z. Wei 170 the cue reweighting of F0, VOT, CD, and various pho nation -related measurements reshape s Shanghainese sandhi /u3b i3a in3b 4b in3b XY/ (The person am finding is XY). In total, 180 tokens were used in the experiment (4 disyllabic prosodic w ords \u00d7 3 repetitions \u00d7 15 speakers). Speakers Fifteen native speakers of Shanghainese participated in this work and were divided into three age groups: younger than 40 (7 participants), 40 - 60 (5 participants), and older than 60 (3 participants). All p articipants were recorded on a Komplete Audio 6 recorder with a C544L Vocal micro phone. Data analy sis The data were normalized using z-score . Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Jackson, J. E., 1991) was used to reduce the dimensionality of phonation - related measures . Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Schertz, 2020) was used to determine the weights of each acoustic property in production. Results A principal component analysis was first run on all phonation Hz). The main results are t hat the first principal component (PC1) accounted for 49.2% of the variance of the measures, and the second principal component (PC2) accounted for 27.1%. PC1 was highly correlated with -0.494), and correlated H1* -A2* -0.59), H1*-A2* -A3* (r = - 0.515). Therefore, PC1 and PC2 were used to represent phonation in the LDA models below. Accor ding to Figure 1 and 2, each age group has it s own strateg y. In /p3a T1a/3b/, VOT is the primary cue only for elder speakers , and F0 becomes the primary cue in /p3a T1a/3b/ in young speakers . In /b3b T1a/3b/, VOT is always the primary cue , but its relative weight has been greatly diminished for middle - aged and youn g speakers. In /b3b T1a/3b/, there was no such increase of F0. However, since the rela tive weight of VOT is greatly weakened, we can likewise observe an increase of F0 in the transition from the middle -aged to the young generation. Cue reweighting in Shanghainese sandhi patterns 171 Figure 1. Visualize d LDA re sults for /p3 t\u00b9/ and /p3 /b3b t\u00b9/ and /b3b d\u00b3/. Overall, the LDA results exhibit a negative trend in that the height of the bars reflecting CD went down as mu ch as F0 went up. Whether it keeps its status as a secondary cue in each generation depends on the relationship between F0 and VOT. Meanwhile, the relative weights of PC1 and PC2 are lower than that of the previously mentioned F0, VOT, and CD on the second syllable in both sandhi pat terns, suggesting the relative unimportance of phonation for the voicing/register contrast. Discussion and conclusion The first conclusion we can draw from the resu lts is the relative unimportance of phonation. It is well kno wn that the effect of obstruen ts on F0 is manifested mainly through the F0 co -occurrence restriction on the tone -bearing syllables ( e.g., Hyman, 1973 ), and both the obstruent properties and F0 are controlled by laryngeal adjustment (e.g., Ohala, 1978 ). Many studies inves tigate the mechanisms of consonant articulation that account for the local F0 perturbation (e.g., Halle & Stevens, 1971). Since our experiment is done within the sandhi domain, whether this inconsistency that exposed the F0 -phonation relationship behaves differently in different contexts requires further study . In addition, the relative weight of VOT undergoes a significant decrease, and the relative importance of CD exhibits a negative correlation with F0. Chen's Z. Wei 172 research ( 2011) on th e consonant -F0 interaction on t he second syllables in Shanghainese suggests that there was usually a significant F0 perturbation caused by vocal fold vibration, which is generally consistent with the present study's findings. Still, the consonan t-F0 intera ction does not result in a dire ct trade -off between the two cues: the decrease in the absolute weight value of VOT between elders and middle -aged speakers is not mirrored by an increase in F0 or CD. On the contrary, the absolute value of F0 rise s more in 3 a-1a/3b and finally achieves pr edominant cue status in the younger group's production of 3a -1a/3b. The results indicate an interesting fact: the essence of this sound change at the production level is that F0 is gradually gaining its importance. The result s suggest that the tone sandhi pattern in Shanghainese is changing: in the second syllable of a sandhi domain, F0 is overtaking CD and VOT as the primary cue in younger generations. From a wider perspective, looking at the phonetic nature of the cue reweig hting in Shanghainese sandhi pa tterns will enable us to understand better the tone split that widely happens among Eastern and Southeast ern Asian languages.

Proceedings Ex Ling 20 22: 13th International Con ference of Experimental L inguistic s, 17-19 October, Paris, France Mandarin and Spanish basic color terms vis -\u00e0-vis Mingshan Xu1, Catalana, Univer sitat Aut \u00f2noma de Barcelona , Spain Abstract It is still debated how many basic color terms (BCTs) Mandarin has and how they are used compared to Western languages like Spanish . For clar ifying this, we analysed the performanc e of 21 Mandarin speakers and 2 1 European Spanish speakers in two related tasks: the list task and the color naming task. Our results suggest that Mandarin has 9 BCTs in line with Gao and Sutrop (2014), while Spanish has 11 BCTs , in line with Lillo et al. (2007 ). We further found that Mandarin speakers use some of the common BCTs less consistently than Spanish speakers. Overall, both languages partition the color space similarly . Our findings reinforce the view that th ere are universa l constraints on color naming, that are compatible wit h subtle cross -cultural differences in how colors are used . Keywords: basic color terms , Mandarin , Spanish , list task , color naming , cross -cultural variation Introduction Despite numero us prior studie s, important questions persist about basic color terms (BCTs) in the world's languages , including their exact number in many languages . According to Berlin and Kay (1969), Mandarin is a stage -V language with six BCTs . However, subsequent res earch using cor pora and perceptual - cogn itive methods has increased this number to nine (Gao and Sutrop, 2014), or perhaps eleven ( Hsieh et al., 2020). According to Sun and Chen (2018) , this uncertainty stems from a lexical problem: compared to other langua ges, Mandarin has more synonyms for eac h color category , so that basic color categories are referred to in more diverse (and thus inconsistent ) ways (see also Hsieh et al. , 2020 on dialectal differences). A second pending issue is to determine whether BCTs in Mandarin are distributed across the spectrum like in other languag es, as already found in several many pairs on non -related languages, such as English vs. Japanese (Kuriki et al. , 2017) . In this paper, we contribute to this debate around the exact numb er and use of BCTs in Mandarin . We use Spanish for comparisons . Method Two experiments were conducted: the color list task and the c olor naming task (Davies & Corbett , 1994). For the color list task, we recruited 19 native M. Xu, J. Zhu, A. Ben\u00edtez-Burraco 174 speakers of Mandarin from Mai nland China (F = 10 , age range 23 -30, mean age = 27.2, SD = 2.3) and 19 na tive speakers of European Spanish (F = 9, age range 21 -44, mean age = 25.5, SD = 5.0). In this task, p articipants were asked to list and write down all the color names from their nat ive language they c ould remember . The maxim um time allowed for this was 5 minutes. For the color naming task , we included 2 additional participants, up to a total of 21 Mandarin speakers (F = 11, age range 20 -30, mean age = 26.7, SD = 2.8) and 21 European Span ish speakers (F = 10, age range 21 -44, mean age = 25.7, SD = 4.8). In this task, p articipants were asked to name the 330 standard chips from the Munsell color chart, as used in the World Color Survey (www.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/) , in an unconstrained wa y. Chips were prese nted in a random order, which changed from one subject to another. It took approximately 30 -40 minutes for each participant to complete the task. Subjects with color blindness or vision problems were excluded from bo th tasks. Data treatm ent and analysis In the list task, f or each of the color s that were mentio ned by at least 5 subjects , we calculated its cognitive Salience index (S) (Sutrop , 2001) , which measures the perceptive/cognitive bias that predisposes individu als to focus on it. In the naming task, for each of the dominant terms (i.e. terms used for at least half of the participant s for a given tile ), we calculated its Specificity Index (SI) (Gao & Sutrop, 2014) , which measures the consensus among subjects for using it . To establis h the number and th e identity of the BCTs i n each language, we relied on the results from both tasks (following the minimal criteria proposed by Gao and Sutrop , 2014) , as well as the criteria for BCTs proposed by Berlin and Kay (1969) ). Finally, in order t o clarify how BCTs are used in each languag e, we used a multidimensional s caling to assess individual difference s in naming for each BCT. We also used the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to determin e the distribution of BCTs across the Munsell color chart. Results In the li st task, Mandarin speake rs generated 78 different color terms (M = 27.3), most of which were compounds and modified terms (e.g. anhong 'dark red'), while Spanish speakers generated 81 different color terms ( M = 18.7) , with most of them being single -word te rms (e.g. teja 'brick red'). The highest cognitive Sali ence values were found for hong 'red' (S = .39), huang 'yellow' (S = .23) and lan 'blue' (S = .21) in Mandarin, and for azul 'blue' (S = .3 3), rojo 'red' (S = .3 1) and verde 'green' (S = .22) in Spanis h. In the color naming t ask, Mandarin gave more differe nt color names to each chip (M = 9.69, SD = 3.78 ) than Spanish speakers ( M = 8.34, SD = 3.75 ) and this difference was significant (t(658) = 4.743, d = .36, p <.001). However, t he hig hest SI value was f ound for 'black' in both languages . Overall, our result s suggest that Mandarin has 9 BCTs: hei 'black', bai 'white', zi 'purple', l\u00fc 'green', huang 'yellow', lan 'blue', hui Mandarin and Spanish basic color terms vis-\u00e0-vis 175 'gray', fen 'pink' and hong 'red', whereas revealed that Mandarin spe akers showed more individual difference s than Spanish speakers when using 'grey' (F (1,40) =12. 61, p = .001), 'red' (F (1,40) = 4.29, p = .045), 'blue' (F (1,40) = 6.15, p = .02) and 'purple' (F (1,40) = 11.39, p = .002). By contrast, Spanish -speakers show ed more variability w hen referring to 'r ed', 'blue', and 'purple ', as illustrated by the additi onal peaks in the density plots (Fig. 1): one additional peak (burdeos 'bordeaux' ) e 'blue' category , and two additional peaks for the 'purple ' category ( violeta 'violet ' and lila 'lilac'). Despite these differences, both languages partition the color space similarly (see Fig. 2). Figure 1. Density plot s for r ed, purple and blue category in Spanish and Mandarin Chinese . Figure 2. Map of the distri bution of basic color categories for Mandarin speakers (left) and Spanish speakers (right). Discussion and conclusion Conway et al. (2020) have recently suggeste d that the BCTs in th e Berlin-Kay scheme should b e clustered according to their information con tent and communicative efficiency: warm colors (red, orange, yellow, brown), intermediate colors (purple, pink) and cool colors (blue, green) , with cool colors being the less informa tive and efficient. Nonethel ess, in our sam ple, we have found an opposite trend, with hong 'red', huang 'yellow' and lan 'blue' the most salient colors . At th e same time, we have found that 'black' is used s imilarly in both languages , which parallels pr evious research (e.g. Ratliff et al., 2010) , seemingly because blacks are prevalent in natural images . Regarding the exact number of BCTs in both languages , we suggest that Mandarin has 9 BCTs, in line with Ga o and Sutrop (2014). Contrary to some M. Xu, J. Zhu, A. Ben\u00edtez-Burraco 176 other studies ( e.g. Sun & Chen, 2018 ; or Hsieh et al., 2020 ), we found no evidence of cheng 'orange' and zong 'brown' being dominant color s in Mandarin. This can be due to methodological con cerns (we rel ied on a free-choice paradigm , but not on a fixed -choice para digm), or to sampling concerns (we tested Continental Mandarin speakers, but not Taiwanese Mandarin speakers ). With regards to Spanish, our results support the view that it has 11 BC Ts, in line with Lillo et al. (2007). Inter estingly , in our experiment, the term celeste 'light blue' obtained a high S value (S=0.07) and po ssessed an SI value (SI=0.14) . This suggests that this term might be emerging as a 12th BCT in Spanish . Likewise, w e found that Spanish -speaker s use d more tha n one term for 'purple ' and for 'blue', with these two terms, violeta 'violet' and celeste 'light blue' , respectively, showing S value s that were similar to the BCT marr\u00f3n 'brown '. This sugges ts that additional color categories might be emer ging in Spa nish, in the line of Levinson's (2000) emergence hypothesis. Overall, d espite some differences between Mandarin and Spanish in the variability of BCT use, both languages partition the color space similarly . These is suggestive of some universal constraint s on color naming , probably due to the common psychophysics of human color perception . References Berlin, B., Kay, P. 1969 . Basic c olor terms .

In both experiments, target wor ds are monosyllabic, and naming latency is the dependent var iable. Experiment 1 (pictures as distractors) examines whether lexical tone is relevant during lexical selection. Trials with exact homophone distractors (zh vs. zh) were named significantly more slowly simpl e homophone distractors (zh Experiment 2 (pseudo -word transcriptions as distractors) examines the relative timing of lexical tone encoding. It was found that : (1) lexical tone encoding is no later than syllable e ncoding and preced es the encoding of withi n-syllable segments; (2) lexical tone encoding takes less time syllable encoding. Keyword s: spoken word produc tion, lexical tone, Mandarin Chinese, lexic al selection, form encoding . Introduction The spoken wo rd pr oductio n process has four identifiabl e stages: conceptualization, lexical selection, form encoding, and articulation . Much has been learned about the spo ken word production process by studying Indo- European languages such as En glish. Mandarin Chinese, a Sino-Tibetan language , differs from Indo-European languages in many crucial aspects . Research into the Chinese language has yielded va luable insights regar ding how language -specific characteristics shape spoken word production. O ne well - known example is the syllabl e-retrieval hypothesis of Chin ese (O'Seaghdha et al., 2010) , which states that form encoding in Chinese spoken word productio n starts with accessi ng the syllable, followed by the specificat ion of within -syllable segments ; in contrast, in langua ges such as English, form encoding starts with accessing the segments, which are then assembled into a syllable. The use of contrastive lexical tone, whose p rimary acoustic correlate is the pattern of fundamental frequency (F0) rea lization over a syllable , is one sal ient characteristic of Chinese . However, little is known regarding the role of lexical tone in Chinese spoken word production . The present study a ddresses this gap Y. Zeng , R. Fiorentino , J. Zhang 178 Figure 1. Experiment 1 example items . by examining the role of lexical tone in Mandarin spoken word production , focusi ng on the le xical selection stage and the form encoding stage . Experiment 1: lexical tone during lexical selection Experiment 1 investig ates whether lexical tone is relevant during lexical selection i n Mandarin spoken word producti on. If lexical tone is u sed during lexical selection, exact homoph ones (zh vs. zh) and simple homophones (zh vs. zh\u00fa) should behave differently . Methods Thirty -four Mandarin speakers (8 males; mean age = 27.25, SD = 5.52) participated in Experiment 1. Figure 1 illustrates examp le items in Experiment 1. The target s are 82 monosyllabic Mandarin words. Each target is paired with an exact homophone distractor , a simple homophone distractor , and two unrelated distractors , corresponding to the three conditions in Experiment 1 : Exact H omophone , Simple Homophone, and Unrela ted. Experiment 1 consists of three sessions, which took place o ver three days over the internet . Session 1 familiarize d the participants with the stimuli. Session 2 verified participants' mastery of the stimuli and c ollected control measurements for stat istica l modelling . The main picture naming task using picture distractors (Picture -picture Interf erence) occurred in Session 3 , where each unique target -distractor combination was repeated twice. The n aming latency of each tr ial was manually obtained from the a udio recording s of the Picture -picture Interference task. Mixed-effects modelling was conducted using the lme4 package (version 1.1 -27.1) in R (version 4.1.1) . The dependent variable was the log -transformed namin g latenc y, and the indep endent variabl es inc lude Condition (also included as a random slope) and five control measurements (Sassenhagen & Alday, 2016) . The control measurements are not detailed in this paper due to space limit ations . The best model was a utomatical ly selected using the buildmer package (version 2.1) . The raw data and analysis scri pts can be accessed from this link. Results Condition was significant in the selected model (p = 0.011) . The Exact Homophone c ondition (914.60 ms ) yielded a longer naming latency than the Simple Homophone condition ( 908.14 ms ; p = 0.061 ). There was also a significant Condition by Stimulu s Repetition interaction (p = 0.038 ). In Experimental investigat ion of Mandarin lexical tone production 179 Repetition 1 , the Exact Homophone condition (963.39 m s) was named significantly more slowly than the Simple Homophone condition ( 945.66 ms; p = 0.001), but this difference was not significant in Repetition 2 ( p = 0.60). Discussion Experi ment 1 revealed evidence for t he differen tiation of exact homophones and simple homophones , suggesting that lexical tone mediates lexical selection in Mandarin spoken word production. During lexical selection, t he competition between exact homophones is stronger than between simple hom ophones, resulting in longer naming laten cy in the Exact Homophone condition. The difference between the Exact Homophone condition and the S imple homophone Condition was significant in Repetition 1 but not in Repetition 2. This is best explained by contin uous inform ation flow from lexical select ion to form encoding. The p honological overlap between a target and its distractor in the Exact Homophone condition is larger . The facilitation from the form encoding stage (phonologica l facilitation, henceforth) is thus expec ted to be stronger in the Exac t Homophone condition. In Repetition 1, participants were less familiar with the stimuli, and the phonological activation of the distractors was relatively weak, so the results w ere dominated by lexical competition . In Repetit ion 2, participants were more familiar with the stimuli, and the corresponding phonological activation of distractors w as higher . Consequently, phonological facil itation overcame lexical competition, leading to no d ifference between the Exact Ho mophone and Simple Homophone conditions . Experiment 2: lexical tone during form encoding Experiment 2 exam ines the relative timing of lexical tone encoding by comparing it to syllable encoding , which has been found to precede segmental encoding in previou s studies (e.g., O'Seaghdha et al., 2010) . Methods Twenty -six Mandarin speakers ( 11 males; mean age = 27. 90, SD = 4.84) participated in Experiment 2. The distractors in Experiment 2 are sound transcriptions of Mandarin pseudo -words. This way, the distract ors primari ly influence the form encoding stage of target naming. The target s are 108 monosyllabic Mandarin words (e.g., , m\u00e0i, wheat ), each paired with three types of distractors: (1) Syllable -related (mi); (2) Tone -related (s\u00f9n); (3) Unrelated (s\u00fan). three levels of SOA (stimulus -onset asynchrony ) regarding the timing of a target and its distractor: (1) -100 ms , where a distractor precedes its target by 100 ms; (2) 0 ms, where a target and its distractor appear simultaneously; (3) +100, where a target precedes its distractor by 100 ms. The procedure, data processing, and statistical analysis were similar to Expe riment 1 . Y. Zeng , R. Fiorentino , J. Zhang 180 Results The Syllable -related condition was named significantly faster than the Unrelated condi tion at all SOA levels ( p-values < 0.028). The Tone -related condition (886.43 ms ) was named significantly faster than the Unrelated condition (889.21 ms) at the -100 ms SOA level ( p = 0.032), and marginally faster than the Unrelated condition at the 0 ms SOA level ( 921.08 ms vs. 921.74 ms; p = 0.071). Th e Tone -related condition tend ed to be named more slowly than the Unrelated condition at the +100 ms S OA level, but the difference was not significant ( 927.1 9 ms vs. 924.19 ms ; p = 0.10). Discussion The Experiment 2 results suggest that lexical tone encoding is no later than syllable encoding, as both Syllable -related and Tone -related conditions were name d faster than the Unrelated condition at the -100 ms SOA level. This finding also impl ies that lexical tone encoding precedes segmental encoding (cf., O'Seaghdha et al., 2010) . Moreover , all SOA levels show phonological facilitation in the Syllable -related condition, suggesting that lexical tone encoding takes less time than syllable encoding . Conclusion Our study demonstrates that lexical tone participates in lexical selection and form encoding in Mandarin spoken word production. First, lexical tone media tes lexical selection, so the competition between exact homophones is stronger than between simple homophones (Experiment 1) . Moreover , after being utilized in lexical selection, lexi cal tone is also encoded early during form encoding, potentially concurre nt with the access of the syllable, followed by the encoding of within -syllable segments (Experiment 2) . The Experiment 2 data also suggests lexical tone encoding takes less time than syl lable encoding .

Proceedings Ex Ling 20 22: 13th International Con ference of Experimental L inguistic s, 17-19 October, Paris, France Classifier versus taxonomic relations in a similarity judgement task Jiahuan Zhang Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, The Univ ersity of Camb ridge, UK Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR , China https://doi.org/10.36505/ExLing -2022/13 Abstract Compared with non -classifier speakers, classifier speakers often showed more sensitivity to classifier -oriente d parameters (also referred to as conceptual saliency) such as animacy, shape and function - the purported \"classifier effect \". This study thus further testified the classifier effect through a similarity judgement task. Chinese speakers (N=41) rated signi ficantly lowe r than English speakers (N=41) in taxonomic pairs, but not in thematic, classifier or filler pairs. However, both gr oups consistently rated highest in the thematic pairs, followed by the taxonomic, classifier and filler pairs. Chinese speakers also spent longer time than their English counterparts in each pair condition. A subset analysis of taxonomic pairs indicated a varying degree of disparity on conceptual saliency . Findings together suggested an implicit classifier effect from Chinese spea kers, but cla ssifier relation itself was not employed as a predominant parameter for object perception. Keywords: Chinese classif iers, similarity judgement, conceptual structure, object saliency Introduction Classifiers are gramm atical a reference -tracking device , Chinese classifiers are unique in their semantic association with the internal property of head nouns, which leads to the discussion of the relationship between language and cognition. Much research adduced evidence to t he purported classifier effect from Chinese speakers through a range of conceptual categorisation tasks (e.g., Gao & Malt, 2009; Saalbach & Imai, 2007 ; Speed et al., 2021 ). However, classifier types (e.g., shape, animacy, and function) as the representativ e of conceptual saliency can also affect categorisation decision (e.g., Wang & Zhang, 2014) , which have been limitedly considered insofar. This study thus a ims to further scrutinise whether the classifier effect is modulated by classifier type s. Methodolo gy Participants Participants were 41 native Chinese speakers (female=29, M age=24.16, SD age=2.58) and 41 native English speakers (female=26, Mage=22.31, SD age=2.71) , all were university students.

Zhang 182 Materials The majority of the targets and items were selecte d from previ ous classifier - related similarity judgement tasks (Gao & Malt, 2009; Saalbach & Imai, 2007), with one modification being the counterbalance of classifier types, i.e., shape, animacy, and function across feature conditions. Seventy -two trials we re construct ed, including 18 quintuplets of objects. Each quintuplet consisted of one target and four objects representing each of the four features to the target. The first feature shares the same Chinese classifier but does not overlap with taxonomic or thematic fea tures (e.g., river -scarf). The second feature is the taxonomically correlated item with the target (e.g., river -sea), and the third one is thematically correlated (e.g., river -water). The last one is the filler pairs. All trials in each version were automa tically randomised across the three blocks and all participants by Gorilla. Procedure In each trial of the task, participants were shown an image (with its written word in red shown beneath) and a written word of another item simul taneously. A Likert -scale (1 for strongly dissimilar and 7 to strongly similar) was presented on the lower half of the screen along with the test item. Participants were asked to judge the similarity between the two items. To avoid confirmation bias, parti cipants were told tha t there was no clear definition for \"similarity\" , so that they could not follow any prescribed rules and have to define the concept themselves. Figure 1a and 1b illustrated an example for the English and Chinese version, respectively. Reaction time s (RTs) on each trial were automatically recorded. Participants were encouraged to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible, without time limit imposed. Figure 1a. English example . Figure 1b. Chinese e xample . Results The ana lysis of responses & RTs A mixed -effects OLR model was fit to the data, formula: response ~ L1*feature+(1|participant)+(1|item), Hess=TRUE. Figure 2 a demonstrates the results. There was a significant interaction between L1 and feature. The Classifier versus taxonomic relations in a similarity judge ment task 183 drop from taxono mic to classifier pairs was less by 1.022 ( p < 0.001) with Chinese group in comparison to the English one. Referring to Chinese group as the base level, the estimated for English group was significantly positive at 1.266 ( p < 0.001) in taxon omic pairs. C hinese and English groups gave comparable ratings for other feature conditions. Figure 2a. Responses across L1 and features . Figure 2b. RTs (ms) across L1 and feature . RTs were log transformed to ensure normality. A linear mixed -effects model was fi tted, formula: lmer(rtlog ~ L1*feature + (1 | participant) + (1 | item). Overall, there was no interacti on (Figure 2b). Chinese group needed significantly longer time than the English group on each critical feature condition: classifier ( = 0.204, p < 0.05); p < 0.05) and thematic ( = 0.191, p < 0.05). Subset analysis - the analysis of taxonomic p airs There was a significant interaction between L1 and type ( = -0.830, p < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons showed that the English group rated significantly higher in each type than the Chinese group , and the significance levels are: animacy ( = 2.254, p < 0.001), followed by function ( = 1.424, p < 0.01), and shape ( = 1.251, p < 0.05), respectively. Discussion and c onclusion s In contrast with many previous studies (e.g., Schmitt & Zhang , 1998), the present study did not obtain the classifier effect. One possibility could be the research design. This study deliberately paired classifier items across the taxonomically superordinate boundary ( cf. Saalbach & Imai, 2012), such as river- scarf for class ifier tiao2, to avoid potential bias on taxonomic categoris ation . Another explanation is that incorporating taxonomic and thematic pairs probably skewed the judgements towards apparent semantic relation, which is different from when classifier pairs were o nly pitted against with fillers ( see Schmitt & Zhang, 1998 ). Still, what can be rest assured is that the classifier - related feature was noticeable to English speakers although not exposed to J. Zhang 184 Chinese before (see also Saalbach & Imai, 2012; Speed et al., 2021). These together support that classifier relation is refl ective of universal conceptual structure , not linguistically restricted (Speed et al., 2 021). Intriguing ly, Chinese speakers rated significantly lower in taxonomic pairs compared with English speakers. My interpretation is that the habitual use of classif iers may have underlyingly formulated a more fine -grained scale for taxonomic categorisa tion, in line with the hypothesis in Wang and Zhang (2004). The longer RTs may also account that the Chinese speakers showed more sensitiv ity to processing object categ orisation because of the use of classifiers. The group differences in taxonomic pairs potential ly offered us a unique window to discuss the classifier type effect underpinning by conceptual saliency. The more salient features, reversely, attracted a lower rating because of a higher level of corresponding sensitivity. The varying magnitude of significances showed convergence with Chinese classifier acquisition studies (e.g., Zhang , Gnevsheva 2022) and cognitive research (e.g., Gao, Malt 2009). Taken togethe r, the above findings suggest that Chinese speakers did not capitalise on classifier categorisation rule in their object conceptual reasoning, at least not in a moment -to-moment fashion (Saalbach , Imai 2007, Speed et al. 2021). Synthesising the discussion , the indirect, elusive classifier effect o btained in this study is concluded as an \"implicit classifier effect \".
