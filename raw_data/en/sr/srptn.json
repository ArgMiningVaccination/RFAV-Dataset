This document was published on 2 8 January 2021. As other COVID -19 vaccines become widely used, receive national approvals and possess phase III clinical trial data, they will be added to this document . 1.How do the different vaccines work , i.e., mRNA vaccines vs viral -vector ? Category Developer Mechanism Nucleic acid vaccines (proteins that direct production of other proteins): mRNA or DNA Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech A person receives genetic material \u2014 mRNA \u2014 that encodes the viral protein. When these genetic instructions are injected the muscle cells translate them to make the viral protein directly in the body. This gives the immune system a preview of what the real virus looks like without causing disease. This preview gives the immune system time to design powerful antibodies that can neutrali se the real virus if the individual is ever infected.

N ew England Journal of Med icine 2020 (30 Dec ) ePub ahead of print. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389 Category Developer Mechanism Viral -vector vaccines Oxford/AstraZeneca Viral vector -based vaccines use the body's own cells to produce antigens. They do this by using a modified virus (the vector) to deliver the genetic code for the antigen, which then triggers an immune response. The vaccine mimics what happens during natural infection with certain pathogens \u2014 especially viruses. This has the advantage of triggering a strong cellular immune response by T cells as well as the production of antibodies by B cells.

Lancet 2021;397(10269):99- 111. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140 - 6736(20)32661- 1/fulltext 2.How many doses can be taken from each vial of COVID -19 vaccine? Follow guidance from the national regulator that approved the vaccine. Overfilling is common practice in vaccine production. However, this will depend on the specific COVID -19 vaccine and the associated guidance. For g uidance on vaccine storage, handling, safety and security (USA) , https://www.ashp.org/- Moderna Each multidose vial contains a suspension of the vaccine. Once the suspension is thawed and the first dose (0.5ml) withdrawn, the vial should be held between 2\u00b0 and 25\u00b0C (36\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F) . Record the date and time of first use on the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine vial label. Discard the vial after six hours. Do not refreeze. A fa ct sheet for healthcare providers (USA) is available here: https://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download Pfizer /BioNTech Once thawed, dilute vial contents with 1.8ml sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. After dilution, one vial contains up to six doses of 0.3m l. Vial labels and cartons may state that after dilution, a vial contains five doses of 0.3m l. Follow the information provided by your national regulator regarding the number of doses per vial after dilution as it often supersedes the number of doses stated on vial labels and cartons (also refer to question 17) . The vaccine does not contain a preservative. Discard any unused vaccine six hours after diluti on. Do not refreeze. A fact sheet for healthcare providers (USA) is available here: https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download University of Oxford/AstraZeneca Each multidose vial contains 5ml of solution (10 doses) or 4ml of solution ( eight doses) depending on the pack size marketed. Discard any unused vaccine six hours after dilution.

Moderna The Moderna COVID -19 vaccine multiple- dose frozen between - 25\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C (-13\u00b0 and 5\u00b0F). Store in the original carton to protect from light. Do not store on dry ice or below - 40\u00b0C (-40\u00b0F). Vials can be stored refrigerated between 2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 and 46\u00b0F) for up to 30 days prior to first use. Unpunctured vials can be stored between 8\u00b0 and 25\u00b0C (46\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F) for up to 12 hours. After the first dose has been withdrawn, the vial should be held between 2\u00b0 and 25\u00b0C (36\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F) . Discard vial after six hours. Do not refreeze. A fact sheet for healthcare providers (USA) is available here: https://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download You can t rack expiry dates here: https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine -eua/providers/vial- lookup Pfizer /BioNTech Store in - 80\u00b0 to -60\u00b0C (-112\u00b0 to -76\u00b0F). Store in the thermal container at - 90 to - 60\u00b0C (-130\u00b0 to -76\u00b0F). Store in the original package in order to protect from light. Once removed from the freezer, the undiluted vaccine can be stored for up to five days at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (35\u00b0 to 46 \u00b0F) and up to two hours at temperatures up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) prior to use. During storage, minimise exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light. Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions. After dilution, store the vaccine at 2\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) and use as soon as practically possible and within six hours. The vaccine does not contain a preservative. Discard any unused vaccine. Once diluted, the vials should be marked with the dilution time and discarded within six hours of dilution. Do not ref reeze.

Do not freeze. Keep vials in outer carton to protect from light. Information for healthcare professionals (UK) is available here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/ 948334/Information_for_UK_healthcare_professionals_on_COVID -19_Vaccine_AstraZeneca.pdf Summary of v accine storag e temperatures Unopened vials Opened vials Thermal container Freezer Room temperature Room to to for 12 hours 2\u00b0 5 days or up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for 2 hours 2\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C 77\u00b0F) for 6 h ours 4.What should be done with vaccines that are not used within specified period s? The overriding principle sh ould be to avoid wastage. If , following a vaccination programme, there is surplus vaccine, consideration should be given to vaccinating healthcare staff or redistributing the vaccine to other clinical areas (if the cold chain can be assured). Unopened vials should be used before their expiry date. Any vaccine remaining in opened vials must be discarded after 6 hours. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose, discard the vial and any excess volume. 5.How different is the administration of these vaccines? Vaccine Dosing and method of administration Moderna The vaccination course consists of two separate doses of 0.5ml each. The second dose should be administered between four and 12 weeks after the first dose. Intramuscular (IM) injection only, preferably in the de ltoid muscle. Pfizer /BioNTech Administered intramuscularly after dilution as a series of two doses (0.3m l each) at least 21 days apart University of Oxford/AstraZeneca Administered intramuscularly as a series of two doses (0.5m l each) 1 month apart. 6.Does the new vaccine require specific equipment or other requirements at pharmacies? Pfizer /BioNTech For storage an ultra -low temperature freezer with a temperature between -80\u00b0 and -60\u00b0C (-112\u00b0 and -76\u00b0F) is necessary (the thermal container in which the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine arrives may be used as temporary storage). Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine can be stored frozen in the thermal shipping container for up to 30 days if maintained properly or in the refrigerator for five days (120 hours). For equipment specifications and needs, you should consult and coordinate with your national immunisation program me. Vials must be kept frozen between - 80\u00b0 and -60\u00b0C (-112\u00b0 and -76\u00b0F) and protected from light until ready to use. Information for healthcare professionals (UK) is available here: 19/info -by-product/pfizer/pfizer -bioNTech -faqs.html A fact sheet for healthcare providers (USA) is available here: https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download See Question 3 for information about other COVID -19 vaccines . 7.What PPE and other safety measures/procedures are required? For v accine administration , COVID -19 personal protective equipment (PPE ) includes: Face mask: Recommended for a ll healthcare providers (N95 masks not recommended) . Follow national protocols . Eye protection: Recommended in a reas of moderate/substantial community transmission . Optional in areas of minimal/no community transmission unless otherwise indicated as a part of standard precautions Gloves: National protocols should be follo wed. Information on PPE is available here : https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/downloads/COVID -19- vaccine -administration -PPE -508.pdf An a ide-memoire on infection prevention and control p rinciples and procedures for COVID -19 vaccination activities is available here: https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/338715 8.Can pharmacists participate in national vaccinatio n programmes? This varies globally - please refer to national policy. A ll COVID -19 vaccination providers (including pharmacists) participating in vaccination programmes will need to store and handle COVID -19 vaccines under proper conditions, including main taining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with a uthorised emergency use or vaccine package insert, manufacturer guidance, and any relevant national guidance. The following should be noted: Mon itor storage unit temperatures at all times, using equipment and practices that comply with national guidance ; Comply with immuni sation program me guidance for handling temperature excursions; Monitor and comply with COVID -19 vaccine expiration dates ; Preserve all records related to COVID -19 vaccine management for a minimum requirement specified nationally ; and Comply with national instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID -19 vaccine and diluent, including unused doses . A ll staf f members who receive vaccine deliveries as well as those who handle or administer vaccines should be trained in vaccine- related practices and procedures. 9.What are the contraindications to receiving the COVID -19 vaccines? Is a positive IgG test (i.e. , previous exposure to coronavirus disease) an exclusion criterion for vaccination? Contraindications to COVID -19 vaccines are as follows: Moderna Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine or any of its components Immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine or any of its components (including polyethylene glycol [PEG]) Immediate allergic reaction of any severity to polysorbate (due to potential cross- reactiv e hypersensitivity with the vaccine ingredient PEG) F or more information, see COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna , European Medicines Agency : https://europa.eu/!mY63cn Pfizer /BioNTech Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients For more information (USA), see Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines Currently Authorized nes/covid -19/info -by- product/clinical -considerations.html#Contraindications For more information see European Medicines Agency : https://europa.eu/!Jq76yd University of Oxford/AstraZeneca H ypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. A positive IgG test (i.e., having been exposed to the disease) is not an exclusion criterion for vaccination; available data suggest that previously infected individuals can be at risk of COVID -19 reinfection and could benefit from vaccination. The administration of COVID -19 vaccines should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness. Individuals with bleeding disorders may receive a COVID -19 vaccine i f considered safe to do so by a physician familiar with th e individual's bleeding risk . For more information, see COVID -19 The Green Book Can COVID -19 vaccines be co -administered with other vaccines ? The COVID -19 vaccine series should routinely be administered alone, with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration of any other vaccine. However, circumstances in which COVID -19 and other vaccines may be administered within a shorter period in clude tetanus toxoid -containing vaccination as part of wound management, measles or hepatitis A vaccination during an outbreak or to avoid barriers or delays to mRNA COVID -19 vaccination . For more information (USA), see Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines Currently Authorized nes/covid -19/info -by- product/clinical -considerations.html#Contraindications F -19 The Green Book: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/ 948757/Greenbook_chapter_14a_v4.pdf G uiding principles for maintaining immunisation services during COVID -19 pandemic can be found do the supply chains work for COVID -19 vaccines? Each of the COVID -19 vaccine s manufacturers have developed logistical plans and tools to support transportation, storage and temperature monitoring. T he World Health Organization provides information on vaccine management and logistics support here : https://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/en/ I nformation from Pfizer on m anufacturing and distributing the COVID -19 vaccine is available here: https://www.pfizer.com/products/coronavirus/manufacturing- and -distribution You can find a vaccine storage 12. How will equitable access to the vaccine be maintained across nations of all income levels? COVAX is a global collaboration aimed not only at accelerating the development and manufacture of COVID -19 vaccines (as well as diagnostics and treatments), but also at guarantee ing rapid, fair and equitable access to them for people in all countries. COVAX is coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the WHO. It will act as a platform that will not only support the research, development and manufacturing of a wide range of COVID- 19 vaccine candidates, but also negotiate their pricing. The ai m is for a ll participating countries, irrespective of income levels, to have equal access to COVID -19 vaccines once they are developed. More information about COVAX is available here: https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/covax - explained 13. What are the possible adverse events of COVID- 19 vaccine s? And if they occur, how should they be managed at the pharmacy ? Vaccine Adverse reactions from clinical studies Moderna Pain at the injection site (92.0%), injection site (14.7%), and erythema a t the injection site (10.0%). Information for healthcare providers (USA): https://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download Summary site (84.1%), fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle pain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%), fever (14.2%), injection site swelling (10.5%), injection site redness nausea (1.1%), malaise (0.5%), and lymphadenopathy (0.3%). S evere allergic reactions have been reported following the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials. Information for healthcare providers (USA): https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download University of Oxford/AstraZeneca Injection site tenderness (>60%); injection site pain, headache, fatigue (>50%); myalgia, malaise (>40%); pyrexia, chills (>30%); and arthralgia, nausea (>20%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and usually resolved within a few days of vaccination. By day 7 the incidence of subjects with at least one local or systemic reaction was 4% and 13% , respectively. When compared with the first dose, adv erse reactions reported after the second dose were milder and reported less frequently. Information for healthcare professionals of an acute anaphylactic reaction occurring following vaccine administration, appropriate treatment must be immediately available on site. 14. What are the n ext steps in terms of safety and testing? Manufacturers have submitted pharmacovigilance plans to regulators to monitor the safety of COVID - 19 vaccines. This includes a plan to complete longer -term safety follow -up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials as well as other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the COVID -19 vaccine s and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner. In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration expects manufacturers whose COVID -19 vaccines are authori sed under an e mergency use authorisation to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue approval (licensure). F or more information, see FDA Briefing Document s for the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine here : https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download and for the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine here : https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download 15. What advi ce should be given to patients ? F ollow national guidance based on the approval for use information. Generally, provide a patient information leaflet for recipients of the vaccine or their care givers. Explain if the vaccine has been approved for emergency use and give the recipient or care giver the option to accept or refuse the vaccine. Explain the significant known and potential risks and benefits of the COVID -19 vaccine, and the extent to which such risks and benefits are unknown. Also provid e information about available alternative vaccines and the risks and benefits of those alternatives T he most common side effects are : Ten derness, swelling and/or redness at the injection site; Fatigue ; Headache ; Muscle ache ; and Fever/high temperature (37.8\u00b0C [100\u00b0F] or greater) . I f these cause some discomfort for the patient, paracetamol may be taken (if not contraindica ted) or a community pharmacist can be contacted for advice.

What are the practice implications , including how to handle the vaccine vials and injection technique ? Vaccine Practice including handling and injection technique Moderna Storage and handling Moderna COVID -19 vaccine multiple- dose vials are stored frozen between - 25\u00b0 and -15\u00b0C (-13\u00b0 and 5\u00b0F.). Store in the original carton to protect from light. Do not store on dry ice or below - 40\u00b0C . Vi als can be stored refrigerated between 2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 and 46\u00b0F) for up to 30 d ays prior to first use. Unpunctured vials can be stored between 8\u00b0 and 25\u00b0C ( 46\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F) for up to 12 h ours. Do not refreeze. After the first dose has been withdrawn, the vial should be held between 2\u00b0 and 25\u00b0C (36\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). Discard vial after 6 hours. Do not refreeze. D ose preparation The Moderna COVID -19 vaccine multiple- dose vial contains a frozen suspension that does not contain a preservative and must be thawed prior to administration . R emove the required number of vial(s) from storage and thaw each vial befor e u se. Thaw in refrigerated conditions between 2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 and 46\u00b0F) for 2 hours and 30 minutes. After thawing, let vial stand at room temperature for 15 m inutes before administering. Alternatively, thaw at room temperature between 15\u00b0 and 25\u00b0C (59\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F ) f or 1 hour. After thawing, do not refreeze. Swirl vial gently after thawing and between each withdrawal. Do not shakethe vial . Do not dilute the vaccine. The Moderna COVID -19 vaccine is a white to off -white suspension. It may contain white or translu cent product -related particulates. Visually inspect th e v ials for other particulate matter and/or discoloration prior to administration. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered. Each dose is 0.5m l. A fter the first dose has been withdrawn, the vial should be held between 2\u00b0 and 25\u00b0C (36\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). Record the date and time of first use on the vial label. Discard vial after 6 hours. Do not refreeze. A dministration Visually inspect each dose of the v accine in the dosin g syringe prior t o a dministration. The white to off -white suspension may contain white or translucent product - related particulates. During the visual inspection : o Verify the final dosing volume of 0.5 mLo Confirm there are no other particulates and that no discoloration is observed o Do not administer if vaccine is discolo ured or contains other particulate matter Administer the vaccine intramuscularly. A fa ct sheet for healthcare providers (USA) is available here: https://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download Vaccine Practice including handling and injection technique Pfizer/ BioNTech Storage and handling During storage, minimise exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light. Do not refreeze thawed vials. Cartons of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine multiple dose vials arrive in thermal containers with dry ice. Once received, remove the carton s i mmediately from the thermal container and store in an ultra -low temperature freezer between - 80\u00b0 and -60\u00b0C (-112\u00b0 and -76\u00b0F ). Vials must b k between - 80\u00b0 and -60\u00b0C (-112\u00b0 and -76\u00b0F ) and protected from light until ready to use. If an ultra -low temperature freezer is not available, the thermal container in which the v accine arrives may be used as temporary storage when consistently r efilled to the top of the container with dry ice. Refer to the re- icing guidelines packed in the original thermal container for instruction s r egarding the use of the thermal container for temporary storage. The therma l c ontainer maintains a temperature ran ge of - 90\u00b0 and -60\u00b0C (-130 and -76\u00b0F). Storage within this temperature range is not considered an excursion from the recommended storage condition s. Vi al preparation Thaw vials before dilution For vials t hawed under refrigeration \u2014 t haw and then store undiluted vials in the refrigerator (2\u00b0 to 8 \u00b0C [35 \u00b0 to 46 \u00b0F]) for up to 5 days (120 hours). A carton of 25 vials or 195 vials may take up to 2 and 3 hours, respectively, to thaw in th e r efrigerator. A smaller number of vials will thaw in less time. For vials t hawed at r oom temperature \u2014 f or immediate use, thaw undiluted vials at room temperature (up to 25 \u00b0C [77\u00b0F ]) for 30 minutes. Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions. Vials must reach room temperatur e b efore dilution. Undiluted vials can be stored at room temperature for no more than 2 hours. Before dilution invert the vial gently 10 times. Do not shake the vial . I nspect the liquid in the vial prior to dilution. The liquid is a white to off -white suspension and may contain white to off- white opaque amorphous particles. Do not use if liquid is discoloured or if other particles are observed. D ilution Only use sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection as the diluent. Using aseptic technique, withdraw 1.8 m l of diluent into a transfer syringe (21 - gauge or narrower needle). Cleanse the vaccine vial stopper with a single- use antiseptic swab. Add 1.8 ml of diluent into the vaccine vial. Equalize vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial by withdra wing 1.8ml of air into the empty diluent syringe. Gently invert the vial containing the v accine 10 times to mi x. D o not shake the vial . I nspect the vaccine in the vial. The vaccine will be an off -white suspension. Do not use if vaccine is discoloured or contains particulate matter. Record the date and time of dilution on the vaccine vial label. Store between 2\u00b0 and 25\u00b0C (35\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F). Discard any unused vaccine 6 hours after dilution. Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single- use antiseptic swab, and withdraw 0.3ml of the v accine prefer able using a low dead -volum e sy ringe and/or needle. Administer immediately. Administration Visually inspect each dose in the dosing syringe prior to administration. Th e v accine will be an off -white suspension. During the visual inspection, verify the final dosing volume of 0.3m and confirm there are no particulates or discoloration. D o not administer if vaccine is discolo ured or contains particulate matter. Administer the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine intramuscularly. After dilution, vials of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine contain up to six doses of 0.3mL. Low dead- volume syri nges and/or needles can be used to extract up to six doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles ar e u sed, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a sing le v ial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle e ach dose must contain 0.3ml of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot providea full dose of 0.3ml, discard the vial and contents. Do not pool excess vaccin e f rom multiple vials. A fa ct sheet for healthcare providers (USA) is avaipoable here : https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download University of Oxford /As traZeneca Storage and handling Unopened multidose vials should be store d in a refrigerator (2 to 8\u00b0C [35\u00b0 to 46 \u00b0F]). Do not freeze. Keep vials in outer carton to protect from light. After first use, u se vials as soon as practically possible and within 6 hours. The vaccine can be stored between 2\u00b0 and 25\u00b0C (35\u00b0 and 77\u00b0F) durin g Ad ministration The v accine is a colourless to slightly brown, clear to slightly opaque solution. The vaccine should be inspected visually prior to administration and discarded if particulate matter or differences in the described appearance ar e o bserved. Do not shake the vial. Each vaccine dose of 0.5ml is withdrawn into a syringe for injection to be administered intramuscularly. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe foreach individual. It is normal for liquid to remain in the v ial after withdrawing the final dose. The vaccine does not contain any preservative. Aseptic technique should b e u sed for withdrawing the dose for administration. After first dose withdrawal, use the vial as soon as practically possible andwithin 6 hour s (stored at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C [35\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F ]). Discard any unused vaccine. To facilitate the traceability of the vaccine, the name and the batch number ofthe administered product should be clearly recorded for each recipient. D isposal COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca contains genetically modified organisms. Any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Spills should be disinfected with an appropriate antivira l d isinfectant.
