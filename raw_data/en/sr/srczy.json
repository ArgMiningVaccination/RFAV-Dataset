Herbal medicine is growing in popularity in the US and currently the number of visits to Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) providers outnumbers the number of visits to primary care physicians (Bussmann 2010). Herbal medicine is one type of alternative medicine used by trained professionals, known as herbalists and healers. Herbal medicine is effective when used properly because herbs contain organic chemicals with healing properties used to treat illness and disease throughout the entire body. Even with proven results of effective healing, herbal remedies are not classified as prescription drugs, but as dietary substances . In this comparative study, I examined herbalism as found in the alternative healing systems of Chinese medicine and Native American medicine. A local Chinese herbalist and a Native American healer were interviewed to analyze their healing beliefs in reference to diagnosing and treating patients with herbal medicine. I also analyzed how the beliefs and... Nigeria's historical underpinnings and cultural inclinations have made the country lend itself to some cultural ways, beliefs and practices that have come to be peculiarly known to Nigeria. One of such practices has been the practice of herbal medicine and the seeming belief by a handful of the people in its effectiveness and expediency. Often, these medicines are used as a complement to orthodox medicine. However, there have also been cases of the herbal medicine's toxicity, mostly because these drugs are not supposedly laboratory-tested or endorsed by appropriate regulatory agencies. Consequently, there have been massive incursion and patronage of Chinese and Ghanaian herbal products by the Nigerian market to the detriment of the local substitutes, which have been labeled as concoctions. This paper therefore seeks to explore and examine the implication of policies on herbal medicine practice in Nigeria's nation building efforts, with emphasis on local content development The Marxian Conflict Theory was employed as theoretical framework against which a clear explanation of the relationship that determine patronage and utilization of Nigerian Herbal products can be understood. It was recommended that Nigeria revisits its policies on herbal medicine practice as this area is one of the important aspects of Nation building.. Keywords: Herbal Medicine, Nation Building and Policy Historia, Ciencias, Saude - Manguinhos 2018 The massive waves of Chinese migrants arriving in California and Lima in the second half of the nineteenth century played a crucial role in expanding Chinese medicine in both settings. From the late 1860s on, herbalists expanded their healing system beyond their ethnic community, transforming Chinese medicine into one of the healing practices most widely adopted by the local population. This article uses a comparative approach to examine the diverging trajectories of Chinese healers in Peru and the USA, as well as the social and political factors that determined how this foreign medical knowledge adapted to its new environments. Complementary Therapies in Medicine 2007 International Conference on ICT for Africa 2013, February 20-23, Harare, Zimbabwe This paper is located within global debates about indigenous knowledge (IK) and Africa's complementary and alternative medicine (e-ACAM). The paper explores whether it is possible to document all types of indigenous knowledge about Africa's complementary and alternative medicine (e-ACAM) following that this medicine encompass common and uncommon knowledge of which the latter is practised secretly as it is a source of livelihoods to traditional medicine practices. The framework presented in this paper stem from the notion that the ethnophamacological information of medicinal plants is fast disappearing and in view of the rapid loss of such knowledge, its documentation as well as a better understanding of its botanico-historical roots has become an essential task. With further research we realized that there is a major challenge and constraint that may inhibit the documentation of all types of indigenous knowledge about Africa's complementary and alternative medicine. We therefore propose measures within intellectual property rights (IPR) in the form of patents that could be implemented in order to document those types of knowledge about Africa's complementary and alternative medicine that are secret and are a source of livelihoods to traditional medicine practices. Key words: Indigenous knowledge, Complementary and alternative medicine, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) - patents. During the last decade, there has been a dramatic rise in the availability and use of medicinal herbal preparations. Medical journals are now publishing case reports of adverse reactions to herbal therapy. With increasing use, and more importantly, increasing awareness of potential hazardous effects, these reports are liable to increase in frequency. It has been found that herbs and drugs can interact in the same way as drug/drug interactions occur. All medicinal agents have potentially unexpected effects including toxicity and interactions and herbs are no different. Drug-herb interactions are based on the same pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles as drug-drug interactions The data existing for most plants to guarantee their quality, efficacy and safety is insufficient. The concept that herbal drugs are safe and free from side effects is not always true. Harmonization and improvement in the process of regulation is needed for safety aspects related to phytomedicines. During pregnancy it can be dangerous to consume some herbs and herbal remedies. Some herbs contain steroids that can affect the baby's development during pregnancy and/or nursing. Many women turn to herbal remedies during pregnancy for nausea and uterine tonics. Infants and children may be even more susceptible to some of the adverse effects and toxicity of these products because of differences in physiology, immature metabolic enzyme systems, and dose per body weight. Although information promoting the use of herbal medicine is widespread, true evidence-based information about the efficacy and safety of herbal medications is limited. Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 2003 The legal struggle between pharmacists and herbalists in Turkey became actual again, as new regulations are put to force in 2012. In Turkey, legal regulations are steadily changing in favor of pharmacists and against the professional interests of herbalists since the 19th century. Taking into account the dissolved organisational system with which herbalists transmit professional knowledge, the question emerges as to how herbalists respond to ongoing political, economic and cultural change. The transformation of the legal framework that mark the domain of herbalists in Turkey, points to increasing bureaucratization and state involvement. The first historical encounter between herbalists and pharmacists started the process of radical change in the field of drug production in Ottoman lands, already in 1850's. After the first certified pharmacists graduated from the pharmacy class of the Istanbul Imperial Medical Faculty in 1840, the first regulation prohibiting the production of drugs by anyone without a pharmacy diploma followed in 1853. Today, the Herbalist Associations are struggling to bring formal education into their professional practice, so that the limits of their area of expertise can be protected against competing market agents. However, the shift to school-trained and state-certified herbalists means a major change in the texture of this traditional urban healing profession.
