We seek interfaith dialogue, creating opportunities for cooperative, constructive and positive interaction between people of different religious traditions and/or spiritual or humanistic beliefs. In addition to religious groups that meet on a regular basis, Spiritual Life sponsors seasonal rituals, holidays and celebrations. We also provide programming for students who find their spiritual path outside organized religions, by offering opportunities to connect more deeply with oneself, or pursue the bigger questions of meaning and purpose. This is done in many ways: - art and music - yoga and dance - nature - silence - labyrinth walks Interfaith Leadership Our Interfaith Leadership course provides an overview of the components of interfaith leadership. Learn about the basic principles of interfaith work, dive deeply into the theological claims that guide individual engagement with the religious other, and obtain first-hand experience working and serving across lines of religious difference.
