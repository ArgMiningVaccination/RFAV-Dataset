THERAPIES & TREATMENTS OFFERED AT SAFFRON & SAGE Acupuncture Acupuncture is a holistic health technique in which trained practitioners stimulate specific points on the body by inserting thin needles into the skin. To keep the body working properly, Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that any excesses or deficiencies in yin or yang need to be corrected. By addressing the body as a whole, acupuncture is one way to bring the body back to its normal balance. ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC TESTING Advanced Diagnostic Testing can be used to help figure out what disease or condition a person may have based on their signs and symptoms. Diagnostic tests may also be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, and make a prognosis. BOTANICAL MEDICINE Botanical Medicine is comprised of plants (or substances that come from plants) that are used to treat illness or symptoms based concerns. Plants have been used in this way in all cultures from pre-history on. Our Clinical Herbalists are multi-modality trained and can customize based on your specific needs and goals. The Saffron & Sage pharmacy is fully stocked with a variety of herbs, flower essences and blended teas to support the health and wellbeing of our community. BREATHWORK Breathwork is a healing method that employs a high-vibrational energy, created by the breath. This high vibrational state allows for deep resolution by full integration of body, feelings, mind, and spirit. Approximately 70% of the toxins in our body are released through the breath. Breathing deeply and intentionally supports both the strength of our immune system and respiratory function. Very simply put: breath equals life. Coaching Life Coaching discovers your obstacles and challenges while examining your personal and environmental conditions. We focus on what is happening currently, where you want to go, and how to bridge the gap to achieve your goals. Life Coaching is about identifying personal obstacles, assisting and providing motivation, while pinpointing specific resistance to change. Combination Services All our services and therapies are bio-individualistic, meaning they are designed specifically for you based on symptoms or goals. Our Doctors and Holistic Practitioners are multi-modality trained and can combine different therapies into a single treatment to best support your physical, mental or emotional state. Popular combinations include Acupuncture + Massage, Massage + Fire Cupping, Reiki + Acupuncture. There is no up-charge for combination treatments. ENERGY THERAPY Energy therapy is holistic technique that targets the energy fields around the body. It channels and redirects energy to remove blockages. It can be done as a hands-on practice, no touch, sensory based or aromatherapy. Energy Therapy supports the body in the self healing process by assisting with realigning the vibrational field of the physical body. Working in the energetic body helps alleviate and soften energy that has slowed down to matter, manifesting as thoughts and physical ailments in the body. FACIALS At Saffron & Sage we offer two different categories of facials to relax, refresh and rejuvenate. All Steam + Clean facials include a deep cleanse, facial steam & extractions. Facial therapy is a form of body work in which different touch techniques are applied to provide relaxation and restoration by manipulating the skin and muscles to promote overall health of facial structure and skin. All our facials promote healthy skin while easing tension in the facial muscles. It is incredibly relaxing and rejuvenating, helping you look and feel better. Fire Cupping Fire Cupping is the most traditional form of cupping that uses glass cups and heat (from fire) to create suction. This 'lift' created by the suction, creates space for fluid to move and helps drain toxins and waste from the cells; then moves that waste out of the body. Cupping removes any stagnation in the body and opens the meridians so that Qi (vital energy) can flow freely. It also helps to rejuvenate certain meridians and organs that are not functioning at their best. Cupping is known to help activate the lymphatic system, promote blood circulation, and is good for deep tissue repair. HYPNOTHERAPY Hypnotherapy is the applied use of hypnosis. Hypnosis is a state of deepened physical relaxation and heightened concentration, in which direct communication with the subconscious mind can greatly increase the effectiveness of positive change. During a hypnotherapy session, you will be guided into a deep meditative state where you'll be able to focus within, draw upon your innate wisdom and harness powerful inner resources to awaken your own natural healing power. IMMUNITY TREATMENTS With the onset of cold and flu season + the current COVID crisis, the need to support and strengthen the immune system function is crucial.

In combination with our Clinical Herbalists, our team will be able to guide and support a journey of health as it revolves around the food we eat. SPIRITUAL DIRECTION We often find ourselves drawn to spiritual direction during times of suffering or success. Whether we experience the loss of a loved one or a loss of identity we are looking for a space to rest and renew our spirit as we explore the effects of that loss. When it comes to experiences of success we often find ourselves being drawn inwards and into the depts of our essence, renewing our vision and becoming clear on values and desires. SOUND THERAPY Sound Therapy is a form of sensory therapy that has been used by various cultural groups for centuries. Sound Therapy utilizes music and specialty instruments combined with deep self-reflection techniques to improve health and wellbeing while 'submerging' participants in a full body listening experience.
