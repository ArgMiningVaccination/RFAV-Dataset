The surgeon uses a length of vein from a leg to make one or more grafts to bypass the blockages in the coronary artery and then restores the blood flow to normal. Cost Containment: Activities designed to hold down the cost of health care. Cost containment activities include coverage for expanded benefits (like outpatient surgery, pre-admission testing, and different levels of hospital care), thorough review of claims, development of the continually evolving forms of health care (like HMOs and PPOs), and emphasis on health education and health promotion. Courtesy Discount - Professional Courtesy Discount: A discount, or waiver, of professional fees sometimes extended by a provider. An example may be a discount given to other medical professionals or their family members.

Each procedure or service is identified with a unique five-digit code published in the Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology - Fourth Edition (CPT-4). CPT-4 Code Modifiers: A two-digit code used to indicate that a particular procedure deviated from the usual service for a specific CPT code. [Return To Table Of Contents](#TOC) D Date of Visit = Date of Service = Medical Event: Because the date on which the patient visited the provider (the Date of Service) is covered by one Medical Event Form, these terms tend to be used synonymously on MPC.

This does not include visits to public or 'free' clinics where the services are covered by public and/or private funding sources. Full Established Charge: The amount that a provider bills even though a different amount is expected due to discounts or adjustments. For patients covered by a capitation agreement, this is the amount that would be charged to a fee-for-service patient. Further Treatment or Consultation: This refers to additional medication, tests, examination, surgery, procedures, or consultations in addition to the treatments and consultations the patient had already received. [Return To Table Of Contents](#TOC) G Gallbladder Surgery (Cholecystectomy): Removal of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is cut away and removed (laparoscopically or manually) through an incision in the upper right part of the abdomen. This operation is done when gallstones or some other gallbladder problem cases serious symptoms. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped sac or undersurface of the right lobe of the liver holding bile from the liver. The bile is stored and while in the gallbladder is concentrated by removing water. Global Fee: A global fee is one charge that covers services rendered on more than one day.

Health Aide: A nursing assistant who provides personal care and home management services to allow patients to live in their own homes. They work under the supervision of a physician or registered nurse and may help patients bathe, exercise, and dress. They may also check the patient's temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respiration rates, and help give medications. Health Care Events: Visits to and care received by medical providers. Each MPC event is unique and is identified by the following three elements: - The RU member; - The medical provider; and - The date(s) of the visit/service. Health Clinic: Refers to a facility where doctors, nurses, or other medical persons give medical care and advice but is not located at a hospital. Health Insurance: Coverage that provides persons with health-related benefits. Coverage may include the following; hospitalization, major medical, surgical, prescriptions, dental, and vision. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): Federal legislation that went into effect April 14, 2003. HIPAA created national standards for ensuring the privacy of health care records. It establishes guidelines for medical providers, pharmacies, and health insurers to follow in handling health care information that identifies individual patients. One important section of the law requires medical providers to obtain a signed authorization form from a patient before releasing information about that patient to a third party who is not involved in providing health care. The law also created requirements for the information that must appear on the MEPS authorization form. Health Maintenance Organization (HMO): An organized system of health care which assures the delivery of an agreed-upon set of health maintenance and health treatment services to a voluntarily enrolled group of persons. With an HMO, a person must generally receive care from HMO physicians; otherwise the expense is not covered unless the HMO referred the person or there was a medical emergency. With an HMO, the cost of a visit is typically covered in full or you have to pay a small amount (co-pay). HMOs have a variety of organizational structures that involve the relationship between the HMO and its physicians. These include: - Staff Model - The HMO physicians are salaried employees of the HMO and practice in the HMO's facilities. Some Staff Model HMOs have a fee schedule with the kind of charges that would apply to any patient they treated who was not an HMO member. Thus, on the MPC Medical Event Form, you will usually be able to obtain \"the full established charge\" but not the amount and source of payment or the reason for the difference between charges and payments, as those items do not apply to HMO members. - Group Model - The HMO contracts with a separately incorporated medical group to provide service to the HMO's members. - Network Model - A variation of the group model in which the HMO contracts with several medical groups. - IPA Model - The HMO contracts with individual physicians or small groups of physicians to provide services to members.
