Natural Medical Solutions celebrates the beginning of a new scholastic year by presenting a number of integrative solutions which could improve mental efficiency. CAFFEINE Caffeine may be the world's most frequently consumed psychoactive substance that stimulates the central nervous system, heart rate, and respiration. It is a naturally occurring compound found in the leaves, seeds, or fruits of more than 60 plants, including coffee beans, cacao beans, kola nuts, guarana berries, and tea leaves. Caffeine has an extended background regarding its use for enhancing mood and cognitive (mental) function. Caffeine may be useful when consumed before a cognition-related task. It also seems to increase working memory and improve reaction time, however, it has reduced effect on long-term memory. GINSENG The name ginseng pertains to several varieties of the genus Panax of the Araliaceae family. Several studies report that Panax ginseng can improve mental performance in healthy people. Based on reviews, in healthy people, therapy with Panax ginseng was linked with improved speed of attentiveness, accuracy and time of reaction, overall mental efficiency, and psychomotor performance. Long-term study should concentrate on identifying whether such results could be targeted to clearly defined subgroups and whether longer treatment duration provides advantage. ROSEMARY Rosemary is an aromatic evergreen bush cultivated in many areas of the world. The fresh and dehydrated leaves are used regularly as a food preservative and in customary Mediterranean cuisine as a seasoning ingredient. A previous study showed that aromatherapy that includes essential oils from rosemary may improve cognitive efficiency. BORON Boron is known as a micronutrient present in vegetation and is believed to be important for animal growth and development. An original human study reports improved proficiency with tasks requiring eye-hand coordination, attention, perception, short-term memory, and long-term memory with boron supplementing. BACOPA Bacopa monnieri is known as a creeping natural herb that grows in marshy locations and is commonly planted in freshwater regions. It is indigenous to India and Australia but has propagated across the tropics. Bacopa is traditionally used in Ayurvedic treatments to boost memory and cognition. The fall is coming soon and the leaves are turning into array of colors. But the temperatures are still warm? Which is great....Right? Not always. Although your body is exposed to the radiance of the sunlight and the vitamin D which it nourishes, you feel sort of sluggish and sad, which makes you feel depressed as though you are in a dark room... Depression is a symptom that consists of sadness, crying, fatigue, lethargy, body aches and pains, irritability, loss of interest in things that you previously enjoyed, and isolating yourself from friends and family. These symptoms can strike at any time given time. About 9.5 Americans experience an episode of depression at some time during his/her life. Approximately 1 in 10 of these may commit suicide in the course of his/her trauma. Studies may have shown that depression results from the influence of several genes acting together with environmental or other factors. However, there are several reasons why this illness can be immediately treated through the hands of a naturopathic physician. Depression comes from [hormonal imbalances](/hormones.html) in which we battle against within our daily lives. The deficiency in what we eat can alternate a person's mood when dealing with depression. It's important for us to regulate our bodies by keeping our blood sugar stable. For instance, people often notice feeling more anxious if they skip meals. Eating regularly is an easy way for us to stabilize our moods. Individual food reactions can also play a role in mood changes. There are several easy ways of identifying problem foods, one of which is the elimination diet. In this diet, you take out the most common reactive foods for a period of 2-4 weeks and notice changes in mood: Another way to identify potential food problems is through blood testing immunoglobulin G (IgG antibodies.) IgG helps to battle bacterial and viral infections. Comprising up to 80% of all of these essential proteins, it is the smallest, yet most abundant, human antibody. This can be produced up to 3 days after you eat a problem food. There are several Naturopathic labs that offer these tests, which give a more personalized and inclusive guideline on specific foods to avoid. Other testing such as: AMINO ACID TESTING Amino acid assessment can help in many conditions, such as depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, digestion and absorption, catabolic processes, and more. MINERAL TESTING Macro and micro mineral elements are required throughout many metabolic pathways. Mineral imbalances can contribute to cancer, dysfunctional immune regulation, chronic degenerative diseases, aging, emotions and more. IGG4 ALLERGEN TESTING Food sensitivities can trigger many different symptoms including inflammatory bowel disease, gas/bloating, fatigue, mood swings, anxiety, ADD/ADHD, headaches/migraines, skin problems, RA, sinusitis, and recurrent ear infections. GI EFFECT TESTING Gastrointestinal health is the key in digestion, nutrient absorption, and ridding the body of waste and pathogens. Poor digestion and malabsorption can lead to immune dysfunction, nutritional insufficiencies, food allergies, toxicities, and various disease states. TOXICITY TESTING Elemental (mercury, lead, etc.) and environmental (xenobiotics, chemicals, etc.) are more common than you think and may contribute to a host of chronic illnesses, including allergies, asthma, autoimmune disease, brain fog, certain cancers, cognitive difficulties, diabetes, fatigue, fibromyalgia, hormonal imbalances, infertility, obesity, tremors, and more. FATTY ACID TESTING Ensuring the right fatty acid balance is essential in autoimmune conditions, cardiovascular health, depression, allergies, skin conditions, and more. TESTING Organic acids are metabolic intermediates produced in pathways of central energy production, detoxification, neurotransmitter breakdown, and intestinal microbial activity. Depression affects all individuals, regardless of their background. It can affect everyone of any age also. Sadly, there is a stigma and fear that encompasses mental disorder issues, and a few people still see disorders like depression as a sign of weakness. Understanding the most recent depression statistics could expand awareness about mental illness. Realizing how broad it is could help decrease the stigma\u2014which may inspire more people to look for treatment. The most common types of depression are Major Depression, Persistent Depressive Disorder (formerly known as dysthymia), and Seasonal Affective Disorder. Major Depression is where a dark temperament is all-expending and one loses enthusiasm for activities, even ones that are typically pleasurable. Side effects of this kind of depression are trouble sleeping, changes in appetite or weight, lack of energy, and feeling useless. Considerations of death or suicide may happen. Persistent Depressive Disorder alludes to low mood that has gone on for no less than two years yet may not achieve the intensity of Major Depression. Numerous individuals with this kind of depression can work every day, however, they feel low or dreary a great part of the time. Other depressive symptoms may incorporate hunger and sleep changes, low drive, low confidence, or sadness. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) develops as days get shorter in the fall and winter. The disposition change may result from modifications in the body's common day by day rhythms, in the eyes' sensitivity to light, or in how chemical emissaries like serotonin and melatonin work. Mental attitudes and emotional states can be important elements in healing and disease.
