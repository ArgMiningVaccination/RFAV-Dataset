On April 17, 2020, we initiated a randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial of CCP vs normal saline inhospitalizedpatientswithCOVID-19inNYCandLongIsland,New York, requiring noninvasive oxygen supplementation.When the spring 2020 COVID-19 wave abated in NYC sites,the trial expanded to other regions in the US and continueduntilMarch15,2021. Methods Trial Design and Oversight CONTAIN COVID-19 was an investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled were enrolled fromApril 17, 2020, to March 15, 2021, at 21 hospitals at 7 centersin Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, and Long Island, New York;New Haven, Connecticut; Miami, Florida; Houston andTyler, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; and Milwaukee, Wiscon-sin.Theinstitutionalreviewboardsofeachparticipatingcen-ter approved the study. The New York University CONTAINCoordinatingCenterandDataSafetyMonitoringBoard(DSMB)providedtrialoversight.Patientsorlegallyauthorizedrepre-sentatives provided either written or witnessed oral in-formed consent for participation in accordance with institu-tional review board-approved consent procedures. The trialprotocolisavailablein Supplement1 . Patient Population Eligible patients were adults aged 18 years or older hospital- ized for 3 days or less or with symptoms of respiratory ill-ness for 7 days or less (to include patients with presumablyearly phases of disease) who required noninvasive oxygensupplementation and had a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction test.Exclusion criteria were receipt of pooled immunoglobulinin the preceding 30 days, contraindication to transfusion,invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal mem-braneoxygenation,volumeoverload,consideredunlikelytosurvivepast72hoursbasedoninvestigatorassessment,andreceipt of a COVID-19 vaccine (after vaccines were avail-able). Patients whose clinical outcomes were deemed notassessable after hospital discharge were also excluded. Raceand ethnicity data were obtained from entries in the medi- cal record, as reported by the participants, using fixed cat-egories. Race and ethnicity data were included to provideadditional information about participants included in thestudy and the potential generalizability of the results. Randomization and Risk Stratification A centralized electronic system was used to randomly assignenrolledpatientstoreceiveCCPorplaceboina1:1ratiostrati-fied by enrollment site and risk status using randomizationblock sizes of 4 and 6 to maintain balanced group sizes. Allo-cation was concealed. Patients, treating clinicians, trialpersonnel, and outcome assessors were blinded to groupassignment. Patients were stratified as high or average riskfor COVID-19 progression. High-risk participants were aged60 years or older or younger than 60 years with at least1 of the following criteria: chronic pulmonary or heart condi-tions, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, body massindexgreaterthanorequalto35(calculatedasweightinkilo-grams divided by height in meters squared), diabetes, orimmunosuppression. 20Average risk participants were younger than 60 years without any high-risk condition(Supplement1 andeMethodsin Supplement2 ). Trial Interventions One unit of CCP (approximately 250 mL) was infused within 24 hours of randomization at a rate of less than or equal to500 mL/h. From April 2020 to January 2021, participants atMontefiore Medical Center received CCP from donors whoparticipated in the Montefiore COVID-19 convalescentplasma donor program. 21-23Because CCP could not be trans- ferred between institutions, all other sites used CCP fromNew York Blood Center donors with a reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody test on the SARS-CoV-2 MicrosphereImmunoassay. 24Criteria for high-titer CCP were not avail- able in April 2020. From January 2021 onward, all sites usedCCP qualified by the New York Blood Center as high titer bya signal to cutoff value greater than or equal to 12 on theKey Points Question (Reprinted) jamainternalmedicine.com Downloaded https://jamanetwork.com/ recipients normal saline of equivalent volume. The trial product wasmasked with an opaque covering to ensure blinding of treat-ing clinicians, research staff, and participants. The CCPSARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG titers were determined retro-spectively(eMethodsin Supplement2 ). Outcomes The primary outcome was clinical status based on the par- ticipant scores on the 11-point WHO Ordinal Scale for Clini-cal Improvement (WHO scale) 2614 days after randomiza- tion; the secondary outcome was clinical status on the scale28 days after randomization. WHO scale scores range from0 to 10, with 0 indicating uninfected and no viral RNAdetected and 10 indicating dead. Mortality at 14 and 28 daysafter randomization was a tertiary outcome (eMethods inSupplement2 ). Subgroup Analyses The following exploratory analyses were proposed in the protocol: (1) CCP and participant plasma SARS-CoV-2 SpikeProtein binding antibody titer and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles and func-tional assays, (3) rates, levels and duration of SARS-CoV-2RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, (4) SARS-CoV-2 variants,(5) clinical status at other visit days, mortality and rates ofdischarge, (6) lymphocytes, neutrophils, and cytokines,and (7) moderating effect of concomitant medications\u2014including corticosteroids, remdesivir, and anticoagulants onCCP effects. Studies 2 through 6 are not reported becausethey have not been completed. Analyses 1 and 7 were pre-specified as exploratory. We report CCP and participantplasma antibody titers (analysis 1) and effects of corticoste-roids and remdesivir, which became standard of care duringthe study (analysis 7), because of their explanatory powerand the insights they provide into the primary outcome.Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted for the fol-lowing characteristics at randomization: age, WHO score,symptom duration, concomitant medications, CCP SARS-CoV-2 titer, and pretransfusion plasma SARS-CoV-2 IgGserostatus. Post hoc analysis was conducted to evaluatetreatment effects over time. Adverse events were systematically collected between randomization and study end point, including occurrence oftransfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associatedcirculatory overload, and other allergic reactions. Participant and CCP SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein IgG and CCP Neutralizing Titers convalescent plasma high 50(CCP for analy-sis, dichotomized at the 2). COVID-19 convalescent plasma-neutralizing titers weredeterminedviaavesicularstomatitispseudovirusassay(Q2)asdescribed. 22 Stopping the Trial The DSMB conducted interim analyses every 2 to 4 weeks.The statistical analysis plan specified that the DSMB con-sider stopping the trial for success with P(cumulativeadjusted odds ratio [cOR]<1) greater than or equal to 95%and P(cOR<0.8) greater than or equal to 50% (statisticalanalysis plan in Supplement 3 ). The stopping rules for harm and safety were defined, respectively, as P(OR>1) greaterthan or equal to 80% and P(OR adverse event >1) greater than or equal to 75% (statistical analysis plan in Supplement 3 ). There were no prespecified stopping criteria for futility.However, after reviewing data on 920 participants on March 12, 2021, the DSMB recommended ceasing enrollment onMarch 15, 2021, based on slowing recruitment, the need forrapid reporting, and a 0.2% probability that the study wouldmeet criteria for success if enrollment continued to 1000participants. Statistical Analysis Thetrialdesignusedabayesianapproachbasedoncontinu-ous monitoring, allowing real-time decisions giventhe urgency to find effective treatment. There was no maxi-mum sample size, but enrollment of 1000 participants wasanticipated. We used a skeptical prior distribution, N(mean,0; SD, 0.354) for the treatment effect to ensure a type I errorrate less than 5% and conducted regular monitoring usingbayesian techniques. Simulations based on prespecified cri-teriaandfoundthetypeIerrorratewaslessthan5%.Conver-genceofthebayesianmodelswasconfirmedthroughinspec-tionoftraceplots(eFigure1in Supplement2 ). 29 COVID-19convalescentplasmaandplaceborecipientWHO scores were compared, with the placebo group as the refer-ence arm. Primary and secondary outcomes were analyzedwithabayesianproportionalcumulativeoddsmodelwithad-justment for the following prespecified covariates: age, sex,prerandomization WHO score, symptom duration, and thestratificationvariables:riskstatus(highvsaverage)andstudysite. We examined goodness-of-fit of the model and con-firmedtheproportionaloddsassumption(eTable1,eFigure2inSupplement2 ). For the primary outcome, CCP efficacy was defined as a cOR less than 1 and clinically meaningful effects weredefined as cORs less than 0.8. Trial success was defined byposterior probability distributions of the cOR (P[cOR]): high,greater than or equal to 95% for effectiveness, and moder-ate,greaterthanorequalto50%forclinicalmeaningfulness.Between-group differences were reported using point esti-mates based on median, 95% credible intervals (CrI), andposterior probabilities drawn from the estimated posteriordistribution. Analyses were performed using R, version 4.0.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) (statistical analysisplaninSupplement3 ).EfficacyandSafetyofCOVID-19ConvalescentPlasmainHospitalizedPatients Original Investigation Research jamainternalmedicine.com (Reprinted) JAMA Internal Medicine February2022 Volume182,Number2 117 Downloaded From: https://jamanetwork.com/ University on 02/08/2022Results FromApril17,2020,toMarch15,2021,13027participantswere evaluated;941wererandomized( Figure1).Day28follow-up ofthelastparticipantwascompletedonApril12,2021.Ofthe941randomizedparticipants,medianagewas63(IQR,52-73)years, 556 patients were men (59.1%), 385 were women(40.9%),and673(71.5%)hadprerandomizationWHOscoresof 5 (patient is hospitalized and requires oxygen by mask ornasal prongs).

The primary outcomedid not meet the prespecified definition for CCP efficacy.However, e xploratory subgroup analyses revealed a possible benefit of CCP in Q2 (April-June 2020), when all participantswere enrolled in NYC and Long Island, most received high-titer CCP, and most did not receive remdesivir and/or corti-costeroids. These medications were incorporated intoCOVID-19 care after the corticosteroid results from theRECOVERY trial were reported in July 2020 30and the US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency useauthorization for remdesivir in May 2020 followed byapproval in October 2020. 31,32 Consistent with the ACTT-I32and CONTAINCOVID-19trial,useofthesemedicationsatrandom-izationresultedinheterogeneoustreatmenteffects.Atday14, CCPuseappearedtoimproveclinicalstatuswhenonlycorti-costeroids were in use, but there was no evidence of CCPbenefitwhenremdesivirandcorticosteroidswerebothinuse,and those who received both may have done worse.

Less than 15% of our cohort had cancer or otherimmunosuppressing conditions that are associated withan impaired SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. A benefit ofCCP has been shown in these patients. 33The largest CCP effect was in Q2, particularly at day 28, when its effect(P[cOR<1] = 93%)approachedtheprespecifiedbayesiandefi-nition of efficacy. Retrospective analysis showed the medianQ2 CCP-neutralizing titer was greater than 1:160, whichlikely fulfilled criteria for high-titer CCP, 34,35whereas the CCP that was used during Q3 to Q5 was likely not high titer.Recently aggregated randomized clinical trial data suggesthigh-titerCCPisnecessary,althoughitmaynotbesufficient,to benefit hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 36Clearly, there is a need for standardized platforms and thresholds toqualify CCP for use. Nonetheless, CCP may have had hetero-geneous effects over time as viral variants changed in this population. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants on our resultsis unknown, but 60% of Q5 enrollments were at iota variants predominated, 37and sur- veillance data identified alpha and beta variants in Miamiand alpha in Houston. 38 Although exploratory subgroup analyses suggested CCP may be beneficial in participants aged 65 years or older andthose with less severe disease (WHO 5), the posterior prob-abilitiesofthesefindingsexhibitedconsiderableuncertainty.Nonetheless, consistent with these findings, other hospital-izedpatientstudiesidentifiedapossibleCCPbenefitinolderpatients 13-15,17andthosewithlessseveredisease.9,14,17Given the absence of overall CCP benefit in our trial and random-izedclinicaltrialsofhospitalizedpatientswithseveretolife-threateningdisease, 14-18,36itispossiblethatpatientswithless severediseasecouldbenefitthemostfromCCPtherapy.Fur-Figure 3.

Limitationsofthetrialincludethattheprimaryoutcome at day 14 was likely too early for a disease now known tohave a prolonged course. Therefore, day 28 findings may bemore important clinically. In addition, there were heteroge-neous treatment effects over time, perhaps related to chang-ing patient characteristics, treatment options, and other fac-tors. Compared with Q3 to Q5, Q2 participants were CCP with a median neutralizing titer greaterthan 1:160 and were not receiving remdesivir or corticoste-roids. COVID-19 convalescent plasma obtained in the NYCarea was used in non-NY sites and may not have matched local viral species, 38,41and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 vari- ants, which were not studied, may have reduced CCP effi-cacy over time. Because most Q3 to Q5 participants receivedCCPwithaneutralizingtiterlessthan1:160,morethan1unitmay have been beneficial. 18Participants with shorter symp- tom duration had higher mortality and we may have inad-vertently enrolled patients with more severe disease byusing symptom duration as an inclusion criterion. Analysisof the association between serostatus and CCP efficacy, asdone by others 42was restricted by sample availability.
