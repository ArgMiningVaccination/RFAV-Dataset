Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply to those clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer's benefit plan document may c ontain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state cover age mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of s ervice; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment and have discretion in making individual coverage determinations. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other coverage determinations. Overview This Coverage Policy (CP) addresses kidney transplantation, pancreas -kidney transplantation, and pancreas transplantation alone. See CP 0355 for liver -kidney transplantation. Coverage Policy Kidney Transplantation Kidney transplantation is considered medically necessary when ANY of the following criteria are met: adults (i.e., >18 years of age) measured or calculated creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than or equal to 20 mL/min/1.73m 2. Page 2 of 16 Medical Coverage Policy : 0146 pediatric (i.e., 18 years of age) stage 4 chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR <30 mL/min per 1.73m2) end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on regularly administered dialysis Simultaneous Pancreas- Kidney (SPK) Transplantation Simultaneous pancreas -kidney (SPK) transplantation is considered medically necessary when BOTH of the following criteria are met: medical necessity for kidney transplantation is met, and EITHER of the following indications: diabetes mellitus (if individua l is at least 18 years old must be on insulin) pancreatic exocrine insufficiency Pancreas Transplantation Alone (PTA) Pancreas transplantation is considered medically necessary for an individual who meets ONE of the following criteria: diabetes mellitus (if individual is at least 18 years old must be on insulin) pancreatic exocrine insufficiency requires the procurement or transplantation of a pancreas as part of a multiple organ transplant for technical reasons Pancreas- After -Kidney (PAK) Transplantation Pancreas- after -kidney transplantation (PAK) is considered medically necessary when pancreas transplantation criteria are met. Not Covered Kidney, pancreas, or pancreas -kidney transplantation for an individual with ANY of the following contraindications to transplant surgery is considered not medically necessary: malignancy that is expected to significantly limit future survival persistent, recurrent or unsuccessfully treated major or systemic extra -renal infections systemic illness or comorbidities that would be expected to substantially negatively impact the successful completion and/or outcome of transplant surgery a pattern of demonstrated patient noncompliance which would place a transplanted organ at serious risk of failure human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease unless ALL of the following are noted: CD4 count greater than 200 cells/mm3 HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) undetectable Stable anti -retroviral therapy for more than three months Absence of serious complications associated with HIV disease (e.g., opportunistic infection, including aspergillus, tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, or resistant fungal infections; or Kaposi's sarcoma or other neoplasm) Living donor pancreas transplantation (i.e., partial pancreas transplantation, segmental pancreas transplantation) is considered experimental, investigational or unproven. Organ transport systems (mechanical preservation machines) for use with kidneys and/or pancreas transplantation is considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY indication. Page 3 of 16 Medical Coverage Policy : 0146 General Background Kidney Transplantation End-stage renal disease (ESRD) occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to function at a level that is necessary for day -to-day life. ESRD almost always follows chronic kidney failure, which may exist for 10- 20 years or more before progress ion to ESRD . Glomerular filtration rat e (GFR) is considered the best measure of kidney function. While the lower limit of normal GFR varies with age, a GFR level below 60 mL per minute per 1.73m2 represents loss of one half or more of the adult level of normal kidney function. A GFR of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 is considered to be abnormal in all ages other than neonates. Kidney failure, (i.e., chronic kidney disease [CKD] stage 5) is defined as either a GFR below 15 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 which, in most cases is accompanied by signs and sympt oms of uremia, or a need to start kidney replacement therapy (i.e., dialysis or transplantation) for the treatment of complications of decreased GFR (Johnson, et al. 2004; Levey, et al. 2003). Patients with advanced CKD (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative [K/DOQITM] CKD Stages 4 and 5) have a high propensity for progression to ESRD in a relatively short period of time with well -known multiple comorbid conditions and poor outcomes . Kidney transplantation is the grafting of a kidney from either a li ving or deceased (i.e., cadaver) donor. Both pediatric and adult kidney transplant recipients have increased survival compared to patients who remain on dialysis. Kidney transplantation should be timed to occur as close as possible to when the recipient w ould be expected to require dialysis; however, transplantation should be delayed in patients who may regain kidney function (e.g., malignant hypertension, severe, acute tubular necrosis). Transplantation performed prior to the need for dialysis is called p reemptive transplantation. It confers a survival advantage to the recipient and is more common for recipients of living -donor kidneys. Preemptive kidney transplant has been shown to provide better outcomes compared to transplant after any period of time on dialysis; however, because of the shortage of donors, preemptive transplantation may not be possible. Kidney transplantation is an accepted and successful treatment for many individual s with ESRD . The transplant evaluation should begin when it is clear that the patient is destined to develop ESRD. In the event of subsequent renal graft failure, retransplantation is often performed. Calculation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR): A new eGFR equation, the Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collab oration (2021 CKD -EPI) equation in which the race variable was removed and the coefficients for the other variables (age, sex, and seru m creatinine) were recalibrated, was published (Inker, the Kidney Foun dation and Americ an Society of Nephrology Task Force recommended that the 2021 CKD -EPI equation be implemented for eGFR reporting (Delgado, et al., 2022). The Board of Directors of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) unanimously approved a measure to require transplant hospitals to use a race -neutral calculation when estimating a patient's level of kidney function. Effective July 27, 2022, OPTN now requires all transplant hospitals to use race- neutral calculations when estimating a candidate's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for any purpose covered by OPTN policy. A prospective cohort study used National Institute of Diabetes and Digest ive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) public repository data for the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) multicenter study (Zelnick, et al., 2021). For the present analysis, Zelnick et al. included the 1658 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) wh o self-identified as Black. Results demonstrated that inclusion of the race coefficient in the estimation of GFR was associated with greater bias in GFR estimation. Specifically, over a median follow -up time of 4 years, use of the race coefficient in the creatinine- based CKD -EPI equation was associated with an eGFR that was a mean of 4.8 mL/min/1.73m 2 higher than when no race coefficient was used. Not using the race coefficient to estimate GFR (vs the standard race- based calculation) was also associated wit h a 35% higher risk of achieving the transplant referral threshold of an eGFR less than 20 mL/min/1.73m2, with a decrease in median time to achievement of an eGFR less than 20 ml/min/1.73m2 of 1.9 years. The authors concluded that t he biases in race -based GFR estimates, while numerically modest, may be associated with delays in potential preemptive transplant referral and eligibility among Black patients with CKD. Page 4 of 16 Medical Coverage Policy : 0146 Living donor: An integral part of the nation's organ donation system is the living donor . Living donors can be related or unrelated to the recipient. Living kidney donation eliminates the recipient's need for waiting time on a national waiting list, are often more successful, and can add psychological benefits to both donor and recipient. Nonethel ess, the benefit to the recipient of a live- donor organ must outweigh the risks to the donor. In the absence of a living donor, many transplanted kidneys come from deceased (i.e., cadaver) organ donors. Retransplantation: In general, retransplantation is considered by some to be a controversial procedure, in part due to ethical concerns over the limited supply of organs. A wide range of donor, recipient and other transplant - related factors can influence graft survival. In the event of renal graft failure, renal replacement therapy consists of either dialysis or retransplantation. Although allograft survival is considered good, it is considerably less compared to the primary transplant . Candidates awaiting kidney retransplant are often allosensitized and may be less likely to receive a transplant than primary candidates. As a result, some transplant centers have developed ongoing efforts involving desensitization protocols to prevent antibody -mediated acute rejection. Although desensitiz ation protocols may be considered for deceased donor kidney, protocols are generally attempted with living donation so that antibody response against donor tissue can be monitored; patients proceed to transplant surgery only if antibody levels are low. Aut hors contend that desensitizing highly sensitive patients improves clinical outcomes (short -term patient and graft survival) however acute antibody -mediated rejection is a barrier in 20-30% of patients and there is no consensus regarding which protocol is ideal . Pancreas Transplantation The standard treatment for control of blood sugar levels in type I diabetes mellitus (DM) is the use of exogenous insulin; however, this does not entirely restore normal glucose metabolism. Most people who are newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are usually treated with a combination of diet, exercise, and an oral medication. Some oral medications (e.g., metformin) improve the body's response to insulin. Other medications cause the body to produce more insulin. Some people will need to add insulin or another injectable medication because their blood sugar levels are not controlled. Using a combination of treatments (oral medication plus insulin) generally means that the person can take a lower dose of insulin, compared with if insulin treatment is used alone. Pancreas transplantation has been demonstrated to improve the quality of life of people with diabetes, primarily by eliminating acute complications. Pancreas transplantation eliminates the need for exogenous insulin, daily glucose monitoring and many dietary restrictions imposed by diabetes. Additional benefits of pancreas transplantation include the elimination of life- threatening risks of hypoglycemic unawareness and prevention and reversal of diabetic n ephropathy . Pancreas transplantation may be performed: alone (i.e., Pancreas Transplantation Alone [PTA]), or simultaneously with kidney transplants (i.e., Simultaneous Pancreas -Kidney [SPK]) or after a kidney transplant (i.e., Pancreas After K idney [PAK]) Evidence in the scientific published literature support s pancreas transplantation as an appropriate therapeutic intervention for individuals with diabetes on insulin or who have pancreatic exocrine insufficiency who require or have previously had a kidney transplant. Pancreas transplantation is a well -established and accepted method of treatment for these individuals, par ticularly the type 1 diabetic. More recently, pancreas transplant has become an accepted method of treatment for type 2 diabetics, with both short -term and long- term outcomes commensurate with type 1 diabetes patients ( Gruessner, et al., 2017; Redfield, et al., 2015; Weems, et al., 2014; Margreiter, et al., 2013, Light, et al., 2013; Wiseman, et al., 2012; Sampaio, et al., 2011; Chakkera, et al., 2010). Gruessner et al. (2017) reported patient, pancreas, and kidney graft survival rates increased significantly over time and reached 95.8, 83.3, and 91.1%, respectively, at 3 years post -transplant for transplants performed between 2009 and 2015. Living Donor Panc reas Transplantation: Both the American Diabetes Association and UNOS recognize and provide information regarding living donor pancreas transplantation. Living donor pancreas transplantation has been performed in a few centers, including those outside the United States; however it is not considered widespread in clinical practice. In many cases, the living pancreas donor is a relative of the recipient. In the United States living donor pancreas transplantation has been largely st udied at one center, the University of Minnesota. Between January 1, 1994 to May 1, 2013, a total of 46 living -donor segmental pancreas transplants Page 5 of 16 Medical Coverage Policy : 0146 (LDSPTx) includi ng 40 SPK, 2 PAK, and 4 PA were performed at the University of Minnesota (Kirchner, et al., 2016). Kirchner et al. stated that the rate of LDSPTx has significantly decreased over the last few years (on intent) in order to assess donor outcomes and safety pri or to actively continuing the living donor (LD) pancreas program. The new onset of diabete s mellitus ( DM) requiring oral hypoglycemic management was diagnosed in 7 (15%) donors and insulin- dependent DM in 5 (11%). LD pancreas transplantation (especially SPK) should be offered in carefully selected donor -recipient pairs if metabolic risks for the donor are minimized by careful pre- donation screening and meticulous post -donation follow -up with interventions to prevent significant weight gain. Kirchner et al. concluded that LDSPTx can be performed with good recipient outcomes. The donation is assoc iated with donor morbidity including impaired glucose control. Donor morbidity can be minimized by using risk stratification model and pre- donation counseling on life st yle modifications post -donation (Kirchner, et al., 2016). The evidence for living donor pancreas transplantation is limited and primarily in the form of few retrospective reports and patient -registry data (Henderson, et al., 2018; Lam, et al., 2017; Kirchner, et al., 2016; Choi, et al., 2016; Sutherland, et al., 2012). Donor and recipient selection criteria for living donor pancreas transplantation have not been clearly defined in the medical literature. Long- term clinical outcomes for the donor and recipient have not been reported. I n the shor t-term, there is limited evidence supporting normalizing insulin production for selected recipients but concerns remain regarding negative metabolic impact to donors. Note: For islet cell transplantation, see Coverage Policy 0107 Pancreatic Islet Cell T ransplantation. Retransplantation: For all three types of pancreas transplants, survival rates for a second transplant are lower than for the primary transplant, although an elective retransplant may be considered suitable for a select group of patients. The medical literature suggests in some patients, a retransplant could improve health outcomes after graft loss, although there is insufficient data regarding health outcomes associated with third and subsequent pancreas transplants to allow strong conclus ions. Contraindications to Kidney Transplantation, Pancreas -Kidney Transplantation, and Pancreas Transplant Alone Many factors affect the outcome of a solid organ transplant. A fairly rigid selection process is required in order to obtain the best resul t for each patient. In addition to the absolute contraindications noted in the Coverage Policy above, relative contraindications to pancreas or pancreas -kidney transplantation include, but are not limited to, the following: active substance abuse within the last six months, including tobacco, alcohol and narcotic/other addictive pain medications potential complications from immunosuppressive medications that are unacceptable to the patient cerebrovascular disease or accident or progressive neuropathy or myopathy that is not amenable to rehabilitation body mass index (BMI) less than 17 or greater than 33 any active medical process that is currently not optimally treated and/or stable and that is likely to result in end- organ damage or medical emergency without appropriate management, such as active peptic ulcer disease, diverticular disease, active hepatitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, hypertension, autoimmune disease or cytopenia untreated osteoporosis with a T -score greater than 2.5 standard deviations (SD) from mean or Z-score greater than two SD from mean hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis hepatitis C with hepatic disease uncorrected abdominal aortic aneurysm greater than four centimeters advanced age peripheral vascular disease not amenable to surgical or percutaneous therapy as evidenced by: asymptomatic stenosis greater than 75% or symptomatic carotid stenosis of less severity ankle brachial index less than 0.7 or substantial risk of lim b loss with diminished perfusion systemic infection making immune response risky, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the recipient or cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the donor Page 6 of 16 Medical Coverage Policy : 0146 Additionally, there are other conditions that may affect the outcome of kidney transplantation, pancreas -kidney transplantation and pancreas alone transplantation and require further investigation to ensure the best chance for successful transplantation: history of recurrent infection or bladder dysfun ction indicates the need for a urological evaluation potential for renal malignancy should be screened by use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) or renal ultrasound reflux nephropathy, history of recurrent infections, nephrolithiasis, heavy proteinuria, hypertension resistant to therapy, or enlarged or symptomatic polycystic kidneys should be evaluated for potential nephrectomy For pancreas -kidney transplantation further investigation for the following should occur to ensure the best chance for successful pancreas -kidney transplantation: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): MRI to evaluate for intracranial aneurysms Professional Societies/Organizations In 1984 the National Organ Transplantation Act directed the Secretary of HHS to 'establish by contract the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) which shall be a private, non -profit entity that has an expertise in organ procurement and transplantation'. The United Net work for Organ Sharing (UNOS) is the current OPTN Contractor. OPTN policies are updated annually and are rules that govern operation of all member transplant hospitals, organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and histocompatibility labs in the U.S. Policies are made through a collaborative process involving committees, the board of directors and the public. The UNOS/OPTN Policies have established waiting time criteria for Kidney T ransplantation depending on the age of the transplant candidate. 8.4.A Waiting Time for Candidates Registered at Age 18 Years or Older If a kidney candidate is 18 years or older on the date the candidate is registered for a kidney, then the candidate's waiting time i s based on the earliest of the following: 1. The candidate's registration date with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or measured or estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than or equal to 20 mL/min. 2. The date after registration that a candidate's GFR or measured or estimated CrCl becomes less than or equal to 20 mL/min. 3. The date that the candidate began regularly administered dialysis as an End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patient in a hospital based, independent non -hospital based, or home setting. 8.4.B Waiting Time for Candidates Registered prior to Age 18 If a kidney candidate is less than 18 years old at the time of registration on the waiting list, then the candidate's waiting time is based on the earlier of the following: 1. The date that the candidate registered on the waiting list regardless of clinical criteria. 2. The date that the candidate began regularly administered dialysis as an ESRD patient in a hospital based, independent non- hospital based, or home setting. The UNOS/OPTN Policies for Pancreas T ransplant includes the following: 11.3 A Pancreas Registration Each candidate registered on the pancreas waiting list must meet ONE of the following requirements: Be diagnosed with diabetes Have pancreatic exocrine ins ufficiency Require the procurement or transplantation of a pancreas as part of a multiple organ transplant for technical reasons Page 7 of 16 Medical Coverage Policy : 0146 11.3 B Combined Kidney -Pancreas Registration (i.e., Simultaneous Pancreas -Kidney [SPK]) Each candidate registered on the kidne y-pancreas waiting list must be diagnosed with diabetes, or have pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with renal insufficiency. 11.4 A Kidney -Pancreas Waiting Time Criteria for Candidates Less than 18 Years Old To accrue waiting time for a kidney -pancreas transplant, a kidney -pancreas candidate who is less than 18 years old at the time of kidney -pancreas registration does not have to meet the qualifying criteria according to Policy 11. 4 B below. 11.4 B Kidney -Pancreas Waiting Time Criteria for Candidates A t Least 18 Years Old If a kidney -pancreas candidate is 18 years or older on the date the candidate is registered for a kidney - pancreas, then the candidate begins to accrue waiting time once the candidate has met ALL of the following conditions: candidate i s registered for a kidney -pancreas. candidate qualifies for kidney waiting time according to Policy 8.4: Waiting Time. candidate is on insulin. Once a kidney -pancreas candidate begins to accrue waiting time, the candidate will remain qualified for waiting time. Organ Transport Systems (Mechanical Preservation Machines) While a donated kidney is outside of the body it is starved of oxygen, the halting of circulation allows small clots to form, which damages the organ. This damage remains a major bar rier to transplantation as it renders many organs unusable and is associated with decreased survival of the kidneys which are transplanted. Traditionally kidneys were kept in ice (termed static cold storage). Machines which drive cold (hypothermic machine perfusion) or warm (normothermic machine perfusion) solutions through donated kidneys aim to decrease the damage done during transport and therefore improve the outcomes for these kidneys (Tingle, et al., 2019). U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): LifePort Kidney perfusion transporter (Organ Recovery Systems, Inc.) was FDA -approved July 31, 2003 (K021362) . It is intended to be used for the continuous hypothermic machine perfusion of kidneys for the preservation, transportation and eventual transplant ation in to a recipient. The RM3 Renal Preservation System from Waters Medical Systems received 510k FDA -approval on October 22, 2004 (K042224). Indications for Use: The RM3 Renal Preservation System is intended to be used to maintain kidneys for transplant. Paragonix SherpaPak Kidney Transport System is single- use, disposable cold storage device intended to standardize and control donor kidney preservation and transport. The Paragonix (Providence, RI) SherpaPak Kidney Transport System received 510k FDA -approval on March 30, 2018. It is intended to be used for the static hypothermic preservation of kidney organs during transportation and eventual transplantation into a recipient. Paragonix SherpaPak Pancreas Transport System is intended to be used for the static hypothermic preservat ion of pancreas organs during transportation and eventual transplantation into a recipient. The Paragonix (P rovidence, RI) SherpaPak Pancreas Transport System (PTS) received 510k FDA -approval on December 20, 2019. Organ Assist Products B.V. (an affiliati on of XVIVO Perfusion AB) KIDNEY ASSIST -transport received 510k FDA-approval on January 20, 2022. The KIDNEY ASSIST -transport is intended to be used for the pulsatile hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion of kidneys for the preservation, transport, and eventual transplantation into a recipient. X-Therma received Breakthrough Device designation from the FDA May 3, 2022 for its XT -ViVo \u00ae preservation solution and TimeSeal\u00ae organ transport device. XT -ViVo is used to perfuse and cleanse a donor's kidney before or soon after it is removed from the donor. During hypothermic storage and transportation to the recipient, the Page 8 of 16 Medical Coverage Policy : 0146 solution is left in the organ vasculature. The TimeSeal Organ Transport Device is designed to keep adult donor kidneys static hypothermic dur ing transit and subsequent transplantation into a recipient leveraging XT -ViVo. Literature Review - Kidney : Published studies in the peer -reviewed literature demonstrate mixed findings when comparing mechanical preservation machines and cold storage trans port. The data remains insufficient to conclude these devices are medically necessary. In a randomized controlled trial that spanned ten kidney transplant centers in five European countries, Husen et al. (2021) compared short -term oxygenated hypothermic m achine perfusion preservation (end -HMPO2) after SCS versus SCS alone. A total of 127 kidneys (48.5%) in the end -HMPO2 group versus 135 (51.5%) in the SCS group were successfully transplanted ( 262 kidneys ). Kidney Assist transport devices (Organ Assist BV) were used. Results demonstrated no significant difference in one- year graft survi val: 92.1% (n = 117) in the end - HMPO2 group vs 93.3% (n = 126) in the SCS gr oup (P = .71). The secondary end point analysis showed no significant between- group differences for delayed graft function, primary nonfunction, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and acute rejection. In a multi -country randomized controlled trial, Moers et al. (2009) randomly assigned one kidney from 336 consecutive deceased donors to machine perfusion and the other to cold storage (672 recipients). The primary end point was delayed graft function (requiring dialysis in the first week after transplantation). LifePort Kidney Transporter machines (Organ Recovery Systems) were used. Results demonstrated delayed graft function developed in 70 patients in the machine- perfusion group versus 89 in the cold -storage group (P = 0.01). One- year allograft survival was superior in the machine -perfusion group (94% vs. 90%, P = 0.04). Overall, 3- year graft survival was better for machine- perfused kidneys (91% vs. 87%; P = 0.04). Three -year graft survival after machine perfusion was also superior to that after cold storage for kidneys donated after brain death (91% vs. 86%; P = 0.02) but not for kidneys donated after circulatory death. The 3- year graft -survival advantage after machine perfusion was most pronounced for ki dneys recovered from donors who had expanded criteria for donation (86% vs. 76 %; P = 0.01) (Moers, et al., 2012). Kox et al. (2018) performed a post -study (Moers 2009/2012) subgroup analysis after dividing the data set into four cold ischemia time (CIT) groups (less than 10 hours, 10 -15 hours, 15 -20 hours, and more than 20 hours). An analysis was performed to investigate whether the observed differences in delayed graft function (DGF) incidence would lead to a long- term effect of hypothermic machine perfu sion (HMP) versus SCS on graft survival in each of the 4 CIT groups. For HMP and SCS, respectively, the graft survival rates were 88.0% versus 81.3% for 0 to 10 hours of CIT, 91.9% versus 90.1% for 10 to 15 hours, 93.8% versus 88.5% for 15 to 20 hours, and 84.9% versus 83.7% for more than 20 hours of cold ischemia. There was no statistically significant 3- year graft survival benefit for HMP preserved kidneys in any of the four subgroups. A randomized controlled trial conducted in China (Zhong, et al., 2017) compare the effect of machine perfusion (MP) and cold storage (CS) in protecting kidneys harvested from DCDs. A total of 141 kidney pairs from DCDs were randomized. One kidney from each donor was randomly assigned to MP and the contralateral kidney was assigned to CS. LifePort Kidney Transporter machines (Organ Recovery Systems) were used. Results demonstrated a 3- year graft survival rate in the MP group was significantly higher than that in the CS group (93% vs. 82%, P=0.036) . Literature Review - Panc reas: Static cold storage (SCS) is still the standard method of preservation for pancreases. Hypothermic machine perfusion and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) are under investigation. In contrast to other organs, the use of NMP in the pancreas is stil l limited by the injurious enzymes produc ed during perfusion. Future successful human trials will be crucial (Hamaoui, et al., 2019; Branchereau, et al., 2020; Doppenberg, et al., 2021). Professional Societies/Organizations: The OPTN Policies document, Policy 16 on Organ and Vessel Packaging, Labeling, Shipping, and Storage states the following regarding Mechanical Preservation Machine: \"Members may use a mechanical preservation machine to transport organs. A mechanical preservation machine may be reused only if it is properly cleaned and sanitized and all labels from previous donor organs are removed\" (7/27/2022). Page 9 of 16 Medical Coverage Policy : 0146 The OPTN Executive Committee Proposed Strategic Plan 2021 -2024 lists the following Initiative , \"Review policies to determine whether future cha nges will be necessary to encourage or facilitate machine perfusion of organs. A listed Key Metric includes \" An increase in the number of transplants of machine perfused organs \". The 'First World Consensus Conference on Pancreas Transplantation' (Boggi, et al., 2021) stated that \"No recommendation was drawn on the use of machine perfusion because of lack of clinical studies\". The American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Foundation Choosing Wisely\u00ae Initiative: No relevant information found. Use Outside of the US The NHS Organ Donor Register is the equivalent to the US' UNOS . In Japan, an Organ Transplant Law took effect in October 1997 and the Japan Organ Transplant Network (JOTNW) was established to deal with heart and liver transplants in addition to kidneys. The Canadian Organ Replacement Register (CORR) is a pan- Canadian information system and is responsible for maintaining a list of contact information for dialysis, transplant and organ procurement centers across Canada as well as producing in- depth reports and analyses on long- term trends on organ transplants.
