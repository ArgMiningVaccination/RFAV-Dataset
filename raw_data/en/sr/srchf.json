Ann Intern Med ; 174(8): 1118-1125, 2021 08. Article in English | MEDLINE | covidwho-1181776 ABSTRACTMultiple candidate [vaccines]to prevent COVID-19 have entered large-scale phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, and several have demonstrated substantial short-term [efficacy]. At some point after demonstration of substantial [efficacy], placebo recipients should be offered the efficacious [vaccine]from their trial, which [will]occur before longer-term [efficacy]and [safety]are known. The absence of a placebo group could compromise assessment of longer-term [vaccine]effects. However, by continuing follow-up after [vaccination]of the placebo group, this study shows that placebo-controlled [vaccine efficacy]can be mathematically derived by assuming that the benefit of [vaccination]over [time]has the same profile for the original [vaccine]recipients and the original placebo recipients after their [vaccination]. Although this derivation provides less precise estimates than would be obtained by a standard trial where the placebo group remains unvaccinated, this proposed approach allows estimation of longer-term effect, including durability of [vaccine efficacy]and whether the [vaccine]eventually becomes harmful for some. Deferred [vaccination], if done open-label, may [lead]to riskier [behavior]in Hence, deferred [vaccination]via blinded crossover, where the [vaccine]group receives placebo and vice versa, would be the preferred way to assess [vaccine]durability and potential delayed harm. Deferred [vaccination]allows placebo recipients timely access to the [vaccine]when it would no longer be proper to maintain them on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunologic and [clinical subject: Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic / Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic / COVID-19 Vaccines / COVID-19 Type of study: Cohort study / Experimental Studies / Prognostic study / Randomized controlled trials / Reviews Topics: Vaccines Limits: Humans Language: English Journal: Ann Type: Article Similar MEDLINE ...
