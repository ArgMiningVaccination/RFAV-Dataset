Otherwise known as a hysterosalpingogram. That's a big scary word so let's break it down! Hystero = uterus Salpingo = tube Gram = picture of Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is basically a picture of your fallopian tubes. I like to think of the fallopian tube as the embryo transport system. It's where the egg and sperm come together and it's how the embryo will travel to the uterus. Part of fertility screening is not just for FSH, estradiol, and AMH for women. It's not just to see how fast the swimmers are swimming. It's also important to make sure that the fallopian tubes are open! It's the \"T\" in the tushymethod.com In today's episode of The Egg Whisperer Show, I'm talking more about HSG. Read the full show notes on Dr. Aimee's website Do you have questions about IVF?

When trying to conceive it takes both an egg and sperm cell. And, as you'll hear Dr. Ghayda explain, we now have access to more tests for male factor infertility, and they are more affordable and accessible than ever. He and I both believe it's very important for people, and fertility patients (everyone, really!) to know their options and to be educated about what they can do to improve sperm quality, to test sperm quality. This can help make the whole journey the best it can be, and be one that hopefully leads to good outcomes. Dr. Ghayda is a reproductive urologist. He is currently an assistant professor at University Hospitals in Cleveland, Ohio and the Chief Medical Officer at Legacy, a company that is revolutionizing how men and couples test and freeze sperm, from home.

She helps get The Egg Whisperer Show on the air, on YouTube, and everywhere. But, what you might not know is that she is a podcaster with her very own show (Jump Start Your Joy) and for the last year, she's been talking all about how you can find joy in the messy middle. So, when she published her first book I knew it was time for her to come on and share her joy-filled wisdom with all of us, and so I'm delighted to have her join me today on the show. What I love about Paula is that she finds joy even in the hard times, and in unexpectedly difficult situations. And, we could all use more of that right now. Paula is a podcast producer, a certified life coach, and studied religion at Yale. Her mission is to bring more joy into the world in the work that she does, and her first book is Jump Start Your Joy: Heart-Centered Ways to Find Joy in the Messy Middle.

(And knowing how beloved this book is, it probably comes as no surprise that this popular book has sold over 40 million copies in 42 languages). It goes without saying that I am beyond honored to have her join me today as the guest on The Egg Whisperer Show. In this conversation, we're talking about what inspired Heidi to write the first What to Expect When You're Expecting, her community of 20 million moms, the non profit she founded that helps at-risk moms, and what's changed since the book first came out 25 years ago. Time magazine named Heidi one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World for 2011, and she and her husband Erik have received numerous awards for their humanitarian work, including, in June of 2022, the highest award given to civilians by the department of defense, the Fisher Distinguished Civilian Humanitarian award.

Tip 1: Be kind to yourself, and know that things like baby announcements, or nosy questions from family members are triggering to many fertility patients. That doesn't make it easier, but it might help to know you're not alone in the feelings. Some of these triggers can come from unexpected places. Tip 2: To work through triggers: talk about the trigger, acknowledge the trigger, become aware of what triggers you, and then \"figure out what works best for you to get past the trigger\" when they do come up. Tip 3: Allow yourself to feel your emotions. Don't push them aside. Find a trusted friend, family member, spouse, partner or coach to help you. They don't have to understand what you're going through, the key is that they are able to listen to you and let you talk. Abbe Feder is a fertility coach and the founder and CEO of InCircle Fertility. She and her husband host the podcast Maculate Conception, and she is the creator of the (In)Fertility Cards of Affirmation. We had the pleasure of meeting at a panel with Fertility Rally and I could not be more excited to have her on the show to talk about how to be emotionally resilient during fertility treatment. Today, we're talking about what it means to be a fertility coach, how to find support for your journey, and how to develop more resiliency when facing the ups and downs of being a fertility patient.
