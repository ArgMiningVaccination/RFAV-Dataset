Taking a lead in popula - tion management, Clinical Nurse Leaders (CNLs) have expanded their responsibilities to include case management of individual patients, development of complex care plans to optimize care as a means of avoid - ing 30-day readmissions and improving nursing knowledge in all facets of nursing care. Nurses promote nursing excellence through proactive assessment of quality care, retrospective audits of performance, and peer assessments of professional practice. It is exciting to watch the ownership of nursing professional practice as embraced by the Nursing Professional Governance Organization (NPGO). The voice of the front-line nurse caregiver is as valued as any nurse in any specialty area including the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO). I delight in the respect garnered by the ROPH nurses in prob - lem-solving processes while working in concert with physicians and ancillary departments. I revel in the community recogni - tion of ROPH nurses, be it in teaching healthy lifestyles, providing health screening in clinics, or packaging food for the food pantry. ROPH nurses use loving care in practicing their profession in all settings. That loving care has brought an unprecedented number of patients to our Emergency Department while maintaining shortest wait times, high patient satisfaction and best practice management of stroke and cardiac events. Subsequently, to expand our role in cardiology care, we are now the home for the Rush system Cardiac Rehabilitation Program. Nurses are active in planning a new Emergency Department. The NPGO is innovative in recognizing and supporting the need for more clinical sites for colleges of nursing on a 24/7 basis. NPGO is capitalizing on the 14% MSN-educated bedside RNs to offer clinical instructors who are current, relevant and available for those clinical rotations. ROPH nurses are unique and insightful as they innovate to meet the impending healthcare demand for more nurses and intervene for the future care needs of our community.

After receiving the ANCC\u00ae Magnet Designation last year, ROPH nurses didn't rest on their laurels. Our nurses recognize the importance of diligence in improving nursing practice and providing excellent care. They demonstrated this com - mitment by again receiving the Gold Seal of Approval from the Joint Commission for inpatient diabetes care. With this latest approval, ROPH nurses can boast a decade of excellent nursing care in diabetes. In addition to this notable achievement, our nurses remain committed to improving our practice at the bedside through unit-based education, unit and hospital quality improvement projects and interdisciplinary collaboration. Despite the pursuit of excellence, gaps in nursing care can occur. Our nurses don't shy away from these challenges. To address these nursing practice concerns, task forces are created. Professional Governance at Rush Oak Park Hospital supports these initiatives, which empowers all nurses to be stakeholders in the care they provide. Our nurses have remained committed to excellence outside the walls of Rush Oak Park Hospital by improving the health of our community. Our nurses volunteer their time by providing blood pressure screenings at food pantries and healthcare education for the homeless population at Housing Forward. Our nurses can be seen distributing water and providing first aid at local foot races. Coat and book drives are organized and provide vital resources to vulnerable populations within our community. We, the ROPH nurses, celebrate a year of many successful accomplishments. As we continue our journey of excellence, we remember that the well-being of our patients and families is at the center of all we do.

The mission of the WTC is to provide women with continuum of care, tools for recovery and parenting skills to maintain a sober lifestyle as they rebuild their life and future. The services provided are as follows: detox, residential treatment for pregnant/postpartum women, women with children and women without children, outpatient treatment, recovery home, methadone clinic, children's ser - vices, criminal justice program and parenting classes and counseling. Elizabeth Stewart, Unit Director of the Skilled Care Unit at ROPH, as part of her Doctorate of Nursing Practice in Advanced Public Health, worked to implement a set of important health promotion strategies to improve outcomes in both the clients as well as the staff of this WTC. Beth described in her final paper and presen - tation that health promotion is important to the process of recovery from substance abuse. She describes that people with substance use disor - ders have higher rates of both infectious disease and chronic illness coupled with lower levels of self-care related to their substance use than the general population (Kelly, et al, 2015). She found that health promotion activities such as screenings, health education, exercise, journaling and smoke cessation during recovery have been linked to extended lengths of sobriety (Bradbury-Goals, 2013; Fareed et. Al, 2010; Weinstock, Barry & Petry, 2008) In the population that lives at the WTC, the rates of some of these illnesses are far greater than those of the national average for the same illness. Hepatitis inci - dence is at 10.9% compared with 1% nationwide, HIV/AIDS inci - dence is at 3.2%% compared to less than 1%, sexually transmitted infections incidence is at 8.8% compared to less than 1%, respirato - ry disease incidence is at 24.8% compared with 11.3% and anemia incidence at the WTC is at 10.6% compared with less than 1% in the general population (Center, 2016; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2016a; CDC, 2016b; CDC, 2016c; Healthy People 2020, 2016; American Society of Hematology, 2016). Beth engaged administrators, clients and nurses in a variety of activities to elicit feedback on how to best impact these import - ant disparities. Through surveys, interviews and focus groups, she gathered information on how to implement a program that would best meet the needs of the organization in addressing health promotion of the clients at the center. A weekly Health Aware - ness Group (HA) had previously been established at the Cnter to attend to the need for health promotion as part of the treatment program, however clients and staff expressed dissatisfaction with processes around this program. There was a concern that the program was not evidence based, lacked structures such as a formalized curriculum and was not supportive of Department of Alcohol and Drug Abuse (DASA) regulations to which the WTC is responsible to adhere. Surveys of the nurs - ing staff elicited that 90% of WTC nurses did not feel they had the necessary resources to effectively lead the HA. Clients expressed that the HA meetings were often chaotic and disorganized. As Beth began to utilize this feedback to create a compre - hensive strategy to improve these gaps, her program goal was to \"increase self-management of health issues and positive lifestyle choices in women being treated on Residential Units 2 and 4 at the WTC.\" She utilized the Theory of Planned Behavior to guide the interventions. This theory was supportive because it stipulates that if a behavior change is desired, a change in the level of intention must be facilitated through the changes in the attitudes and beliefs about subjects norms and perceived be - havioral control (Ajzen, 2001). OBJECTIVES Implementation of this program was done in multiple phases. Early inclusion of principles re - lated to professional governance structures and behaviors helped propel the success of both nurse empowerment and client benefit in the program. The objectives for the program were: + Create a nurse education committee to guide program development and to manage evaluation and sustainability of the program. + Develop a standardized, evidence-based curriculum for use by nurses in already estab - lished weekly HA Groups. + Formalize the Center's insti - tutional structures supporting the HA Groups. + Create evaluation tools for use as a part of a formalized evaluation plan. OUTCOMES All 10 nurses at the WTC completed surveys before education and curriculum roll out. In the pre-survey, only 10% of the nurses agreed that they possessed the knowledge and had adequate resources to lead the HA Group. Post survey elicited that 90% of them felt they had the knowledge and the resources to be successful. Nurses particularly discussed improved knowledge related to nutrition and chronic disease management.COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP TO IMPROVE HEALTH AWARENESSCOMPASSION IN PRACTICECARING RELATIONSHIPS Excerpts taken with permission from: Stewart, E. (2017) A program to increase health promotion for women in residential treatment for substance abuse disorders. Rush College of Nursing Paper 2017 NURSING ANNUAL REPORT36 client chart audits were conducted before program implementation and 33 were audited post program imple - mentation for nurse observa - tions of client behavior. The mean percentage of document - ed engaged clients compared with disengaged increased from 67% pre-program to 74% post-program. Some activities that highlighted this engage - ment were clients reading out loud, asking questions, speak - ing about the topic and/or participating in the activities. Pre- and post-tests were given each week of the HA program. Correct answers increased an average of 28% for the clients who attended the nutrition/ infectious disease session; 90% for the 24 clients who attended the physical activity/chronic disease session and 43% for the 20 clients who attended the smoking cessation/substance abuse and the body session. Because literature links engagement in health-pro - moting activities and contin - ued recovery from substance use (Bradbury-Golas, 2013) and because regular health screening and health edu - cation lead to reduced drug use (Fareed et.al., 2010), it was imperative for a program like this to be developed at the WTC. A program may have failed and not made an impact if developed without the engagement of the clinical staff and administrators in professionally stimulating work. Beth's work to standard -ize, empower and advocate for the nurses at the WTC was the first step in impacting the overall health outcomes of the clients at the WTC. The cur - riculum content and activities directly met the unique needs and health promotion topics very uniquely needed in this vulnerable population. ROPH is proud to have had Beth's leadership in a community setting, improving nursing practice and patient outcomes and transforming healthcare for the better. Outcomes of this project were impressive and the WTC was very thankful to have had Beth contributing through her DNP in this capacity.

Addictive Behaviors 33, 1072-1075RUSH OAK PARK HOSPITAL ANNUAL REPORT NURSING2017 10 EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE RUSH OAK PARK HOSPITALMany sources are documenting and predicting a nursing shortage. This impending shortage is multifactori - al. Firstly, the shortage will be caused by a projected decreased supply of nurses in the workforce. This is due to the following reasons: 1. Nurses who may have naturally left the work force have remained during the econom - ic instability in recent years, as those nurses re - tire, the artificial effect of their presence in the workforce will be evident, 2. Nursing schools report shortages in faculty and clinical rota - tions which lessens the profession's ability to prepare nurses and 3. There is an existent high attrition rate in nursing due to the demands of the profession- the average turnover rate across the country is approximately 17.2%. (Snavely, 2015; Nursing Solutions, 2015). ROPH nurses take accountability for ade - quate nurse staffing in all clinical areas and have developed a stra - tegic plan to prepare for this nursing shortage, both at ROPH and within the healthcare community as a whole. ROPH outperforms the national average for low nurse turnover rate and has worked diligently to achieve a current rate of 9% for 2017. While this retention positively impacts the staffing at ROPH, the goal of improving retention was aimed at preventing burnout and stress. Another opportunity for professional ownership to avoid STUDENT CLINICAL ROTATION MODELGETTING AHEAD OF ITEVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 4091 4054 a nursing shortage lies with the preparation of increasing num - bers of nursing students through partnerships with area colleges of nursing. \"The preparation of an expanded workforce... will require... advances in the education of nurses across all levels... expanding nursing faculty, increasing the capacity of nursing schools, and redesign - ing nursing education to assure that it can produce an adequate number of well-prepared nurses able to meet current and future health care demands\" (IOM, 2010; Macy, 2016). In the past, ROPH had requests from numerous colleges of nursing for clinical rotations of varying types. Previous mind - sets regarding these requests limited the amount of clinical rotations that ROPH would accommodate. Karen Mayer, the CNO, realized the link between clinical rotations and the preparation of future nurse employees for both ROPH and the nuring community was not being considered. In Spring of 2017, the Nursing Professional Governance Organization Ex - ecutuve Committee led a new initiative to expand the number of clinical rotations that ROPH could accommodate and to greatly support the ongoing faculty shortage. The goal was for all clinical sites and shifts to maximize their contribution for preparation of new nurses. Throughout this new initiative, a strong collaboration with several area schools of nursing was established, namely, Rush University College of Nursing, Dominican University, Loyola University and Lewis Universi - ty. Aside from placing prelicen - sure students, ROPH partners with schools to facilitate many doctoral level student projects and clinicals as well as post-li - censure clinical nurse leader (CNL) students learning the CNL role as it is modeled at ROPH. Through these various part -nerships, ROPH has been able to participate in an advisory ca - pacity to some of these schools, serving to help troubleshoot how they can accommodate a greater volume of students. Additionally, ROPH direct care nurses and unit leadership have given input through a series of meetings to ascertain what resources are needed to ensure accommodation of a greater volume of students. To address these issues, two conference rooms were designat - ed with lockers for student/faculty usage in the organization. Addi - tional computers and workspaces were purchased for the units and directions about available parking were distributed. RN precepting of students education is being developed both within ROPH and through partnership with colleges. A ROPH point person has been assigned to be the liai - son for both the colleges and the organizational needs. A rotation information sheet was created to be completed by the faculty and posted on each unit regarding the specifics and learning objectives of their groups. Feedback was given to the schools regarding the availability of off-shifts and increased preceptor availability if students were able to follow an individual RN schedule rather than a whole class placed on a unit on a set day and week. Increased rotations on off-shifts, weekends and with pre - ceptors is being realized. Perhaps one of the most valuable con - tributions that ROPH has made towards this program is the re - cruitment of nurses to be clinical instructors. Through negotiations with both ROPH HR and partner HR departments, ROPH RNs have the opportunity to work as an instructor for .1 or .2 FTE within their 1.0 or 0.9 without needing to have overtime hours during the semester. The partner college then reimburses ROPH for the instructor time and the RN maintains their benefits as a ROPH employee. This has incentivized a valuable pipeline of instructors to area schools struggling to find enough faculty. ROPH is committed to ongoing pursuit of the prepara - tion of the next generation of nurses. Please see graphic display of the increases made in only 2 years. ROPH leaders are seeking to proactively lead this initia - tive recognizing if all hospitals increased clinical site availabili - ty by 50%, the increased college enrollment might obliterate the pending RN shortage. The vision of ROPH nursing is to be a 24/7 nursing teaching facility that champions this concept and creates an excellent stream of nurses for the future. ROPH 2017 NURSING ANNUAL REPORT EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE 11IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES Some of the opportunities and changes have been made as a result of this ongoing initiative and growing partnerships. ROPH IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES/AREAS FACILITY + Conference rooms designed and designated for students with, lockers, refrigerator space for lunches, mobile computers, ther - mometers, seating, and parking. PRECEPTOR + Need for competency education regarding precepting students + Availability for RN orientees COMMUNICATION + Notice of preceptor assignments so that no student shows up without planning + Better understanding of which activities of patient care each group of students can safely perform. + Clinical Instructor job role defined and developed + RNs had interest in being faculty, but were deterred by the fact that they would lose their full time FTE status and thus have a benefits change- Karen Mayer advocated for HR to cover full FTE and have colleges reimburse ROPH for time as instructors. PARTNER IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES/AREAS CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR + Need to improve the matching of faculty to clinical area of expertise + Instructor clinical experience may be dated + Expand faculty knowledge and student experience of non-acute settings such as ambulatory and perioperative ROPH RN EMPLOYEES AS FACULTY + Full time benefits needed, only less than part-time positions available as clinical instructors. + Not interested in working over 40 hrs/week as a second job. + Onboarding education for clinical instructors varied and unstructured SCHEDULING + Colleges all seeking only Tuesday/Thursday day shift rotations, due to didactic content on other days + Early morning didactic classes impede pm or night clinical scheduling + Faculty not available to work off shifts or weekends + Focus on inpatient care + Students never experience full load of patients + Students never experience reality of off-shift or weekend hours + When organization is willing for 24/7 rotations, schools may have opportunity to alter teaching structure which will assist with increased volume of student prep through clinical rotations.RUSH OAK PARK HOSPITAL ANNUAL REPORT NURSING2017 12 CRITICAL THINKING RUSH OAK PARK HOSPITALAs presented in the past in Rush Oak Park Hospital (ROPH) Annual Reports from Nursing, the Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) role has been integral to patient outcomes, staff engagement and interdisciplinary collaboration. The CNL role was originally piloted in 2012 on the Telemetry unit with a focus on the Congestive Heart Failure population. Initial success with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid core measure compliance relative to that population as well as a decreased read - mission rate fostered replication in the ICU and on 6 West, another Medical Surgical Unit for other patient populations. In 2015 and 2016, there was a movement within the Rush System for Health to redesign the Care Delivery Model relative to care management. A partnership between social worker and clinical expert care manager roles was established. This change, which was directed by NPGO based on the widespread success the CNLs had accomplished, initiated the formation of a separate unit for the CNLs at ROPH, under one Unit Director (UD), with matrix reporting to the Rush System for Health Care Management department and the Chief Nursing Officer. The creation of this unit allowed for the creation of standardized role competencies, education and metric responsibilities house wide so a comprehensive CNL Program could be established at ROPH. Denise Wienand was hired as the UD of the CNL Program in 2016 and the CNL structure was shifted to allow for at least one CNL to partner with one Social Worker (SW) per unit on care management needs. Karen Mayer, CNO, ROPH and the Unit Directors from each pa - tient care unit partnered together to create a budget neutral CNL Program expansion. This part - nership has been key to ongoing programmatic success as regular meetings between the unit management and CNL program leadership seek to find optimal ways to meet both the unit needs as well as organizational needs. Under the direction of NPGO Executive and Education Committees, the CNLs assumed responsibility of housewide nurs - ing-related educational programs and needs. It became evident that the CNLs were integral to many organizational initiatives. Each CNL was assigned as a sup - port to various initiatives such as The Joint Commission Diabetes and Stroke certifications, ANCC Magnet Designation, NICHE Designation, IDPH Regulatory requirements, Colleges of Nurs - ing Programs and Community Engagement, to name a few. The CNL role does not detract from the expertise of any one discipline, rather they function as connectors between the disciplines and the patient's care plan, with an emphasis on improving patient education, outcomes and seamless coordina -CNL ROLE CHANGE CATALYZES THE TEAM & OUTCOMESCONNECTORS IN CHIEFCRITICAL THINKING Care Management: Patient & Famil yUtilization Management Clinical Documentation Improvement Clinical Nurse LeadersSocial WorkersClinical Nurse Leader New RoleCare Management Acr oss Continuum Organizational Initiatives Education & Quality: Unit & Organization Level 3.03.54.04.55.05.5Average Length of Stay for All Payors & Medicar e Patients 5.31 4.9 4.71 YTDCare Management: Patient & Famil yUtilization Management Clinical Documentation Improvement Clinical Nurse LeadersSocial WorkersClinical Nurse Leader New RoleCare Management Acr oss Continuum Organizational Initiatives Education & Quality: Unit & Organization Level 3.03.54.04.55.05.5Average Length of Stay for All Payors & Medicar e Patients 5.31 4.9 4.71 2016 YTD2017 NURSING ANNUAL REPORTtion throughout the continuum. The CNL support the MDs for Core Measure compliance, transitions of care, advanced care planning and complex care planning. The CNLs connect with the RNs on quality metrics, education support, patient flow and patient education. The CNLs lead interdisciplinary rounds every day, reviewing com - plex and high utilizer cases on a daily basis, with participation from the entire interdisciplinary team. The CNLs connect with APNs both within the hospital and in the ambulatory or skilled nursing environment to assure safe transition or to divert un - necessary admissions. The CNLs communicate with ambulatory RNs and administrators to create better continuity of the patients care plan, to ensure follow-up appointments are made and to ensure the environment is safe when leaving the hospital. CNLs were added to other key areas such as the Emergency Department (ED), 3 center-or - thopedic and medical surgical population, the Skilled Care Unit and Rehab units. With an emphasis on the CNL as partner to SW on every unit, the CNLs had to redefine their job descrip - tion, associated competencies and attend specialized education. Some examples of the special - ized education that CNLs have received are: Rush Leadership Academy, American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (AAACN) Care Coordination and Transitions Management core curriculum, Milliman and Interqual education to assess best level of care, research competen - cy modules to prepare the CNL group for institutional review board (IRB) usage and study, and National Incident Management System (NIMS) to prepare the group for disaster and emergency management. One major initiative the CNLs have led is to develop, in partnership with the interdisci - plinary team and Dr. Michael Silver, CMO, ROPH, the creation of complex care plans and high utilizer group plans to better meet the needs of the most complex patients. These plans function to guide intervention upon arrival to the ED to enact evidence-based care coordination strategies that troubleshoot the patient's ongoing physical, social, psychological or emotional needs. These have been successful at reducing the incidence of these patients' admissions so they are able to thrive in the community and at home more independently. There are multiple other strategies within the CNL Program. A CNL-led admission process tracks outpatient goals and connects the team and pa - tient with the overall care plan. The CNLs engage in discharge education both inpatient and outpatient. They engage in social determinant screening and meet weekly with SW to discuss outli - er patients that are not meeting key benchmarks for care. They have developed several tools in the electronic medical record (EMR) to document their inter - actions with patients and staff, both inpatient and outpatient. The CNL program score - card reflects an emphasis on care coordination, education and organizational initiative support. They work to improve the 30-day all-cause readmission rate, decrease average length of stay, improve applicable quality indicators, enhance nursing staff engagement and interdisciplin - ary collaboration as measured in employee engagement surveys, and decrease observation case rates in the ED, improve effi - ciency of flow, communication and continuity throughout the organization. The CNL role has optimized interdisciplinary collaboration by functioning as a connector and advocate for the patients continuous provision of care across many clinical settings.

Gleaning from the literature, she understood that staff perceptions of safety directly correlate with decreased adverse patient outcomes within the hospital environment (Huang, etal, 2010). With a focus on improving AHRQ Cul - ture of Safety scores relative to staff perception of safety during handoffs, inpatient falls with in - jury rate, and a desire to increase the numbers of safety events reported as a reflector of a healthier environment, Angela put in place many important initiatives. She reviewed the liter - ature for themes that could guide her work. She found three themes that would have potential impact at ROPH: the importance of inconsistent communi - cation, interruptions and bedside handoff formaliza - tion. With relation to in - consistent communication the literature described only 70-80% of informa - tion is documented in the electronic medical record (EMR), that inconsistent communication is linked to over 80% of adverse events and often times is the root cause of sentinel events (Popovich, 2011; Staggers and Biaz, 2013; TJC, n.d.) AHRQ and a variety of other sources discussed the fact that often errors occur as a result of interrruptions and that these errors can result in poor patient safety outcomes (AHRQ, 2015; Maughan, Lei and Cydulka, 2011; Spooner, etal, 2015). The literature was very supportive of effective bedside handoff as a means to improve patient safety and satisfaction, while also decreasing falls during change of shift and other adverse events throughout the rest of the shift (Radtke, 2013: AHRQ, n.d., Sand-Jeckin & Sherman, 2014; Kerr, etal, 2013; Rush, 2012). Part of the planning for a focused improvement strategy aimed at improving patient safety through effective handoffs focused on meeting with stakeholders, surveys of staff relative to the topic of handoff, the development of a handoff process and comprehensive inpatient staff education related to that process. A standardized handoff flowsheet was created in the EMR and observations were performed of real-time handoff process. Ancillary departments within inpatient nursing received education as well. Angela's project was imple - mented over the course of 2016 into 2017. Through Angela's leadership the 2017 AHRQ Culture of Safety Survey Hand - offs and Transitions Section results increased to meeting the 90th percentile benchmark score. Historically, this score from 2010 to 2013 had remained stagnant at the 10th to 25th per - centile, with some improvement in 2015 and 2016 up to the 50th percentile. This achievement underscores the important work that took place to engage staff in a solution, make that solution possible and standardize the process for sustainability. An indepth look at some of the questions in the safety handoffs 14 TECHNICAL EXPERTISE RUSH OAK PARK HOSPITALTransferring essential information about patient care is an integral component of communication in health care. Within health - care organizations this is known as \"handoff\". Effective handoff supports the delivery of important safety and care coordination information from one caregiver to another so that the continuity of care can be seamless. The literature has been replete with examples of ineffective handoffs, especially during transitions, as they relate to in - creased adverse events and patient safety risks (Friesen, M., White, S., Byers, J. 2008). Angela Cooper, Director, Inpatient Nursing at Rush Oak Park Hospital (ROPH) sought advice and approval of the NPGO Executive Committee and unit UACs to study this important concept and seek improvements at ROPH as part of her Doctorate of Nursing Practice in Systems Leadership.

The question, \"Import - ant patient care information is often lost during shift changes \"score was 55.6% in 2015, increased to 57.9% in 2016 and was 75% in 2017, moving the ROPH scores on this question from the 50th percentile to the 75th percentile. The question, \"Shift changes are problematic for patients in this hospital\" went from 47.1% in 2015 to 55.2% in 2016 to 75% in 2017, which moved the ROPH scores from the 50th percentile to the 75th percentile. Unassisted falls during handoff time decreased by 75%. Pre and post survey results showed internal staff perception of improvement of various handoff related activites. The benefits of this project have impacted both staff satisfaction and patient safety. Subsequent to the outcomes achieved in the implementa - tion units, Angela has worked to expand the project to an interdepartmental scope. She is seeking to include to procedur - al areas and implement within the direct admission process.

Underscoring the transforma - tive change that is underway in healthcare where the focus on patient care is increasingly in the outpatient and community environment, this paper encouraged the empowerment and preparation of nurses in these settings. \"Improving the health of our nation will require reframing our health care system from one that emphasizes acute, episodic, interventional care to one that engages patients and providers together, in health promo - tion, disease prevention and early intervention\" (Bodenheimer, Bauer, Syer & Olayiwola, 2015) Ambulatory nurses work across the continuum of care, in many cases as the only nurse in each setting, and increasingly, they are managing complex patients with comorbidities and complex social determinants that make effective access to care problematic. \"Ambulatory care RNs are well-prepared to assume an expanded role in the design and de - livery of high quality care, defying traditional boundaries, while working in redefined interprofessional relationships, expanded community partnerships, and non-traditional health care set - tings\"( AAACN, 2017). Ambulatory RNs at Rush Oak Park Hospital (ROPH) and Rush University Medical Center are well positioned to care for this burgeoning, complex, aging patient population. They have been included and recognized in achievement of ANCC Magnet Designation for both organizations. The 2019 standards for ANCC Magnet designation have emphasized the need for evidence from a variety of new ambulatory settings. ROPH ambulatory nurses will be key in ongoing recognition by the American Nurses Credential - ing Center. Beyond Magnet recognition, however, am - bulatory nurses at ROPH are included in a culture of nursing excellence through ongoing practice management. Nursing Professional Governance Organization (NPGO) unit advisory committee meetings, representation on NPGO's Executive Committee and inclusion in the Rush System clinical ladder for ambulatory nurses encourages advancing education and certification along with project manage - ment, community outreach and leadership in their own clinical settings. Recently the Rush College of Nursing Clinical Nurse Leader masters program student was interested in the primary care setting. The student was able to obtain an immersion experience in the North Riverside Rush Oak Park Physician's Group office. ROPH is proud to support academic centers working to prepare future nurses for this emerging healthcare setting. One ongoing national am - bulatory initiative is that of the identification and development of Nurse Sensitive Indicators (NSI) for the ambulatory setting. Just as the inpatient setting developed NSIs over twenty years ago such as CAUTI, CLABSI, HAPU and Falls, the ambulatory setting is seeking to do the same to measure the important impact that nurses have on patients. ROPH has begun reporting NSIs for the ambulatory surgery areas and is included in the AAACN/CALNOC nation - al pilot for it's primary care clinics. Both of these initiatives represent ROPH's continued trend of leadership within the nursing profession and it's ability to have a visionary response to the patient needs challenging healthcare around the world.
