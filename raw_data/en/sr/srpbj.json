I created a guided meditation to support you during this challenging time. This practice is the most popular meditation I have taught over the years because it balances your nervous system, your sympathetic or fight and flight/stress response and your parasympathetic which is the rest and digest part of your nervous system. A balanced nervous system helps us metabolize stress and boosts our immune system. If you are new to meditating or you have a regular practice, I hope you will try it out. You can listen below. Or click here to download. [Metabolize Stress Meditation](https://www.courtneypinkerton.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Metabolize-Stress-Meditation.m4a) The guided meditation is 9 minutes. You can enjoy it sitting in a chair, cross-legged on a cushion or even laying flat on your bed like in corpse pose in yoga. Once you do this guided meditation you can actually integrate this simple body practice in micro breaks throughout your day. Please try it out and share with a friend you think could use some support. We are all in this together.
