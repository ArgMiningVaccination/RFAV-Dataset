Described as spiritual guide, he uses the ancient Chinese tradition of Qi Gong - pronounced chee-gong - to harness the body's natural energy to achieve peace and calm. In China, this practice has been used for over 4,000 years to treat physical illnesses such as cancer, as well as mental health issues. The idea is to reset your energy, clearing any meridian pathway blockages that might be holding you back, to create clarity of mind and awaken one's true nature. Think of it as an alternative to yoga or tai-chi - it's part of the same family. Whether you think the notion of Qi Gong is a tall order or not, there is certainly a demand to find a deeper meaning and a sense of calm. Falun Gong, which describes itself as an enlightened version of Qi Gong, was [banned in China](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/29/nyregion/banned-china-thriving-new-york-mystical-exercise-regimen-draws-immigrants-deeply.html) after fears it had reached cult-like status, although members say they were persecuted for their beliefs. Nonetheless, traditional Qi Gong practitioners are keen to distance themselves from Falun Gong and in the 90s, there was a reported rise in Qi Gong classes and centres as an alternative to yoga or tai-chi. Indeed, Van Spall's client base is far-reaching; he works with politicians, business executives and actors as well as visitors to the Como Hotels and Resorts where he hosts regular residencies - most recently at its Metropolitan London branch. He'll back there again between 8 and 14 October. But does it work and what happens in Van Spall's sessions? He explains the origins of the practice and asks if there are any physical issues I would like to focus on. I tell him about a damaged knee that I haven't been able to run on since a nasty fall four months before. He asks how I want to feel - I say energised, calm and hopeful. He tells me that he'll learn a lot about me during our non-contact treatment, which he'll tell me about afterwards when he offers coaching advice. I am, of course, sceptical but curious. Next, he tells me to look in a full-length mirror and take in my stance, and specific parts of my body. He noted how one of my shoulders sloped at more of an angle than the other. Then I was asked to lay on a bed with a towel on top, eyes closed and legs uncrossed. He said I might fall asleep, but I might not, but I should allow any thoughts or worries to enter in and out of my mind. He said I might experience physical sensations. He would tell me to open my eyes when his work was done. So, I closed my eyes and tried to be open-minded. I didn't fall asleep, but I could feel the heat of his hands around my head and, reluctantly, I did feel a burning round my feet which kept twitching. Perhaps it was all psychosomatic, but I have to report as it happened. After about 15 to 20 minutes, Per told me to open my eyes. He asked me to think about something, anything and to my surprise I couldn't. For someone who usually has 10 things on their mind constantly, it was certainly an odd sensation. He calls this having a clear head and being present. He told me to look in the mirror again. It's perhaps a question of perspective, but my shoulders were aligned in a way they weren't before. My posture was different. His insight into my personality was a little unnerving - telling me things about myself that there was no way he could have known based on the two-minute conversation we'd had prior to my treatment, nor if he had looked at my social media accounts. He calls himself paranormal, but there's an argument that someone with harnessed empathy skills and a strong sense of intuition could have achieved the same. I did feel lighter and certainly calmer, not reborn but certainly more serene and energised. I felt clear. He told me that my energy had been realigned and to expect to feel even more revitalised after I'd slept. I did feel better that weekend, but when I went running the following week - optimistically wanting to believe Per's cure - my knee still buckled, so perhaps the skills of Qi Gong can only take you so far. So is there something in it? In terms of physical ailments, I certainly saw no sign of being healed. But would I use Van Spall as a way of supplementing yoga or meditation techniques? Yes. Its qualities and science are elusive, but for a fast-track to calm and clarity, his sessions are worthwhile. For more information "}
