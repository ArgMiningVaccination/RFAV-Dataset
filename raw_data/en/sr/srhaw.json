Anthroposophic medicine (AM) is a comprehensive integrative approach practiced by fully trained health professionals in over 30 countries worldwide. It represents a best practice example of \"Integrative Medicine\" as defined by the Academic Consortiumfor Integrative Medicine and Health (www.imconsortium.org). AM was founded in the 1920's through the collaboration of Dr Ita Wegman MD and Rudolf Steiner PhD. It identifies within each individual four levels or organisational principles: (1) material or physical level accessible by physical/technical examination as in conventional medicine; (2) level of life-force (vitality), (3) a psychological or emotional realm, and (4) the level of the Ego or spiritual individuality. Essential to the anthroposophic medical approach is a methodology that develops the observation and contemplative skills of the individual practitioner. Schooling in this methodology is an integral part of the IPMT training week. This year we are pleased to welcome Dr Roman Huber along with Dr Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler to the conference. Dr Huber is the director of the University of Freiburg's programme in integrative medicine. In addition to his conventional medical training, he has a background in naturopathy, acupuncture and anthroposophic medicine. Dr Gl\u00f6ckler directs the week and will deliver the evening lectures. Participation in the week is open to those health professionals who have either qualified in a registered field of practice or are on a specific path of training. For medical doctors this week serves as part of the pathway to certification as an anthroposophic doctor.
