Rash Eosinophilia Paresthesia Tremor Arthralgia Weakness Allergic reaction Postmarketing Reports Limitation of use Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis Warnings Black Box Warnings Neurotoxicity, manifested as both bilateral auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, can occur in patients with preexisting renal damage and in patients with normal renal function treated at higher doses and/or for periods longer than those recommended. High-frequency deafness usually occurs first and can be detected only by audiometric testing Vertigo may occur and may be evidence of vestibular injury Aminoglycosides are potentially nephrotoxic Risk is greater in patients with impaired renal function and in those who receive high doses or prolonged therapy. Rarely, nephrotoxicity may not become apparent until the first few days after cessation of therapy Use with caution in premature infants and neonates because of renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported following parenteral injection, topical instillation (as in orthopedic and abdominal irrigation or in local treatment of empyema), and oral use of aminoglycosides, especially when given soon after anesthesia or muscle relaxants If blockage occurs, calcium salts may reverse these phenomena, but mechanical respiratory assistance may be necessary Avoid concurrent or sequential use of neurotoxic and/or to avoid from all aminoglycoside package inserts include amphotericin B, bacitracin, cephaloridine, ethacrynic acid, furosemide) because they increase risk of ototoxicity When administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue Contraindications Documented hypersensitivity Cautions Caution in patients with renal impairment Not intended for long-term therapy; caution in patients with renal failure (not on dialysis), hypocalcemia, myasthenia gravis, and conditions that depress neuromuscular transmission Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, reported; before therapy instituted, evaluate for previous hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides; if anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue therapy and institute appropriate supportive measures Hypersensitivity pneumonitis reported; if hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs, discontinue therapy and manage patients as medically appropriate Higher frequency of hemoptysis and bronchospasm, reported with treatment; if these occur, manage patients as medically appropriate Aminoglycosides can cause nephrotoxicity; close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction may be needed when prescribing drug Higher frequency of ototoxicity reported with treatment; closely monitor patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction; if patients develop tinnitus this may be an early symptom of ototoxicity Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function; if neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts, but mechanical assistance may be necessary Higher frequency of exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease reported with treatment; treat patients as medically appropriate if this occurs Aminoglycosides can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero Pregnancy & Lactation Pregnancy Category: D Lactation: excretion in milk unknown/not recommended Pregnancy Categories A: Generally acceptable.

Patient Handout amikacin injection AMIKACIN - INJECTION (A-mi-KAY-sin) COMMON BRAND NAME(S): Amikin WARNING: This medication can cause serious kidney problems and nerve damage, resulting in permanent hearing loss (including deafness or decreased hearing) and balance problems. The risk is increased if you are older, already have kidney disease, or if you have a severe loss of body water (dehydration). Your risk is also increased if you receive high doses, or with longer use of this medication.Tell your doctor right away if you notice ringing/roaring sounds in the ears, hearing loss, dizziness, or an unusual decrease in the amount of your urine.Careful monitoring by your doctor will reduce the risk of these side effects. Monitoring may include hearing, kidney, urine, and drug blood level tests.Avoid other medications that may increase your risk for these serious side effects if taken together with amikacin. See also Drug Interactions section. USES: This medication is used to prevent or treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. Amikacin belongs to a class of drugs known as aminoglycoside antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. HOW TO USE: This medication is given by injection into a vein or muscle. It is given as directed by your doctor, usually every 8 hours. The dosage is based on your medical condition, weight, lab tests, and response to treatment.If you are giving this medication to yourself at home, learn all preparation and usage instructions from your health care professional. Before using, check this product visually for particles or discoloration. If either is present, do not use the liquid. Learn how to store and discard medical supplies safely.For the best effect, use this antibiotic at evenly spaced times. To help you remember, use this medication at the same time(s) every day.Continue to use this medication until the full prescribed amount is finished, even if symptoms disappear after a few days. Stopping the medication too early may allow bacteria to continue to grow, which may result in a return of the infection.Tell your doctor if your condition lasts or gets worse. SIDE EFFECTS: See also Warning section.Nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, or loss of appetite may occur. Pain/irritation/redness at the injection site may rarely occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: numbness/tingling, muscle twitching or weakness, seizure.This medication may rarely cause a severe intestinal condition due to a bacteria called C. difficile. This condition may occur during treatment or weeks to months after treatment has stopped. Tell your doctor right away if you develop: diarrhea that doesn't stop, abdominal or stomach pain/cramping, blood/mucus in your stool.If you have these symptoms, do not use anti-diarrhea or opioid products because they may make symptoms worse.Use of this medication for prolonged or repeated periods may result in oral thrush or a new yeast infection. Contact your doctor if you notice white patches in your mouth, a change in vaginal discharge, or other new symptoms.A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.This is not a complete list of possible side effects.
