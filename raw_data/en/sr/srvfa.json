Who Are We? We are the Philadelphia Immunization Program. We keep Philadelphia healthy by averting vaccine-preventable diseases and increasing immunization coverage across the city. Part of the Philadelphia Department of the Public Health Division of Disease Control, we are federally-funded to oversee the government purchase and local distribution of vaccines. By monitoring the use of these vaccines, we help providers maintain their vaccination inventory. Not a health care provider?
