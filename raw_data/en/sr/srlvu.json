The fact of your birth, and that you have made it this far in life, is proof of the creative power that flows through you. Your curiosity about and longing to express it will resource your ability to do so. It is that simple. Medicine painting classes and workshops are not simply about learning to paint. They are an opportunity to go on a medicine journey where paint and canvas are the mediums. They allow you to dive deep into a healing process in an area of life that is seeking to shift and is that ready to open to greater awareness. True's breadth of experience and training as a psychologist, shamanic practitioner, yoga teacher and Intentional Creativity teacher allows her to lead participants through a deep exploration of themselves, guiding them into expanded awareness of their consciousness and wisdom through the oracle of the painting they create. In addition to painting, you will be guided in meditations and journeys, journaling, and wanders on the landscape. Sessions may also include yogic movement and as would facilitate your process. True has taught these workshops to people with no painting experience and to people with formal art training. No two workshops are the same because True tailors them to facilitate each participant's inquiry, adapting the process moment to moment to meet the shifts in co-creative consciousness.

The shamanic path is a relational one creating deep rootedness with one's true nature, past the conscious mind and what is known. Shamanic healing as it is offered at Road to Bliss is woven through three main traditions. Though there are characteristics that are universal to all shamanic practices, there are also unique systems and distinct lineages. My work is an integration of the lineages I study as well as the initiation rites and the personal transformation that I have received through them. More than simply a set of techniques, a shamanic healing session is a co-creation between you and I, sourced by our respective openness to soul work and being in relationship with spirit and the non-ordinary. Healing takes place through cooperative power and communication with the natural world, our own bodies and senses, dream and journeying, rhythm and movement, mythology, as well as relationship with our personal ancestry. Teachings from the Americas, Europe and South East Asia influence my offerings. One of the first major systems I studied was of the Q'ero people of the Peruvean Andes with Lucinda Brogden and Petra Le Bleau. This lineage focuses on balancing masculine and feminine energies through cultivating relationship with the sacred feminine and the natural world. Ritual and ceremony as well as the use of personal awareness and intuition are integral to this system. Through this lineage I have received the rites of the Nusta Karpay and the Nusta T'ikariy and am a mesa carrier. Ceremonial Drum, 2022, True [Niasziih](https://wildernessfusion.com/) healing taught by Wilderness Fusion has also been foundational in my work. Niasziih (pronounced Ni-a-zee-EYE) is a nature-based system of healing that uses the technology of tracking to map one's inner landscape. Tracking allows for an expanded awareness and deep contact to heal the body, mind, and spirit. Touch is used in this system to facilitate the deepening of that awareness. The Niasziih teachings have been passed down from Lipan Apache elder, scout, and shaman, Stalking Wolf to other healers with the intention of them being broadly taught and shared. I have been initiated as a shaman through this lineage after several years of intensive study and personal evolution. Just as the Niasziih system uses the body as a vehicle for deep contact with inner wisdom, so does the practice of yoga. Yogic practices are infused in the shamanic healings I offer through the use of movement and posture, breath and meditation, as well as mantra and sound. These practices allow for expanded awareness through embodiment on a core level. In addition to the above, I have received mentorship from two Medicine Women. The first is [Annie Bloom of the Buffalo Dreaming Lodge](https://buffalodreaminglodge.com/) in Utah. This mentorship has guided me to the wisdom available through sacred wandering, dreamwork and ceremony. I was with [White Star Medicine Woman of Flower Eagle Medicine Lodge](https://flowereagle.com/) in North Carolina. White Star guides me in the teachings of The Original Clan Mothers (The work of Jamie Sams) and the divine feminine, shamanic drumming, working with spirit guides, dreamwork, movement and pipe ceremony. Lastly, the medicine of Shaman, Sandy Phocas, has also influenced my own, particularly in the realms of Niasziih healing, past life relationships, intergenerational trauma and healing, the use of breath, shamanic drumming and journeying as well as Systemic Constellations. If this path calls to you, consider honoring the call. In our work together, I will use my own guidance and intuition so you can access the deeper parts of yourself. This will allow you to create freedom from past wounding and to have a somatic experience of your own wisdom and healing. Sometimes facilitated by touch, healing takes place on an energetic level that you will experience as a practical and intuitive clarity of how to create new patterns of vitality and harmony in your life. Healing sessions are one hour long and are $150. These sessions are not covered by insurance and are private pay only. "}
