Departmen t'ofJustice Office ofLegal Counsel Office of the Deputy Assistant Attorney General Washington. D.C. 20530 March 14,2003 . Memorandum for William J. Haynes IT, General Counsel of the Department of Defense Re: Military Interrogation ofAlien Unlawful Combatants Held Outside the United States You have asked our Office to' examine the legal standards governing military interrogations of alien unlawful combatants held outside the United States. You have requested that we examine both\u00b7 domestic and international law that might be applicable to the conduct of those interrogations.l. In Part I, we conclude that the Fifth and Eighth Amendments, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, do not extend to\u00b7 alien enemy combatants held abroad. In Part IT, we examine federal criminal law. We explain that several canons of construction apply here. Those canons .of construction indicate that federal criminal laws of general applicability do not apply to .\u00b7properly~authorized interrogations of enemy combatants, undertaken by military personnel in the course of an armed conflict. Such criminal statutes, if they were misconstrued to apply to the interrogation of enemy combatants, would conflict with the Constitution's. grant of the Commander in Chief power solely to the President. Although we do not believe. that these laws would apply\u00b7 to authorized military interrogations, we outline the various federal crimes that apply in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States: assault, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 2261A(2000). In Part IT.C., we address relevant criminal prohibitions that apply to conduct outside the jurisdiction of the United States: war crimes, 18 West Supp. 2002). . In Part III, we examine the international law applicable to the conduct ofinterrogations. First, we examine the U.N. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Apr. 18, 1988,1465 D.N.T.S. 113 (\"CAT\") and conclude that U.S. reservations, understandings, and declarations ensure that our international obligations mirror the standards of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2340A. Second, we address the U.S. obligation under CAT to undertake to prevent thecoromi ssion of\"cruel, inhuman, ordegrading treatment orpunishment.\" We conclude that based on its reservation, the United States' obligation extends only to conduct By delimiting the legal boundaries applicable to interrogations, we of course do not express or imply any views concerning whether and when Iegslly~permissible means of interrogation should be employed. That is a policy judgment for those conducting and directing the interrogations. Declassify under authority of Executive Order 1958 By Acting General Counsel, Department of Defense By Daniel 1. Dell'Orto UNCLASSIFIED 31 March 2008 I 2 that is \"cruel and unusual\" within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment or otherwise \"shocks the conscience\" under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Third, we examine the applicability of customary international law. We conclude that as an expression of state practice, customary intemationallaw cannot impose a standard that differs from U.S. obligations.under CAT, a recent multilateral treaty on the same sUbject. In any event, our previous opinions make clear that customary international law is not federal law and that the . President is free to override it at his discretion. In Part IV, we discuss defenses to an allegation that an interrogation method might violate any of the various criminal prohibitions discussed in Part ll. We believe that necessity or self~defense could provide defenses to a prosecution. I. U.S. Constitution Two fundamental constitutional issues arise in regard to the conduct of interrogations of al Qaeda. and Taliban detainees. First, we discuss the constitutional foundations of the President's power, as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, to conduct military operations during the current armed\u00b7 conflict. We explain that detaining ~dinterrogating enemy combatants is an important element of the President's authority to successfully prosecute war. Second, we address whether restraints imposed by the Bill ofRights govern the interrogation of alien enemy combatants during armed\u00b7 conflict. Two constitutional provisions that might be thought to extend to interrogations-the Fifth and Eighth Amendments-do not apply here. The Fifth Amendment provides in relevant part that \"[n]o person ... shall be deprived of Hfe, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const., amend V~2 .The Eighth Amendment bars the \"inflict[ion]\" of \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" U.S. Const., amend. Vill. These provisions, however, do not regulate the interrogation of alien enemy combatailts outside the United States during an international armed conflict. This is clear as a matter of the text and purpose oftheAmendments, as they have been interpreted bythefederal courts.3 .A. The President's Commander-in-Chief Authority We begin by discussing the factual and legal context within which this question arises . . The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks marked\u00b7 a state of international anned conflict between the United States and the al Qaeda terrorist organization. Pursuant to his Commander-in-Chief power,as supported by an act of Congress, the President has ordered the Armed Forces to carry out military operations against al Qaeda, which includes the power both to kill and to capture 2 The Fifth Amendment further provides that \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital crime, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury[,]\" that no person \"shall ... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy:' .\"nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\" \"nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" These provisions are plainly inapplicable to the conduct ofinterrogations. . As we explain in Part ill, U.S. obligations under intemationallaw are limited to the prevention of conduct that . would constitute cruel, unusual or inhuman treatment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. See id. . The applicable standards under the Fifth, Fourteenth, and Eighth Amendments are thus useful to understanding U.S. obligations under international law, which wediscuss in Part Ill. UNCLASSIFIED 3 4 SECIffi'FH(OFO~J members of the enemy. Interrogation arises as a necessary and legitimate element of the detention of al Qaeda and Taliban members during an armed conflict. 1. The War with al Qaeda The situation in which these issues arise is unprecedented in recent American history. Four coordinated terrorist attacks, using hijacked commercial airliners as guided missiles, took place in rapid suc~ession on the morning of September 11, 2001. These attacks were aimed at critical government buildings in the Nation's capital and landmark buildings in its financial center, and achieved an unprecedented level of destruction. They caused thousands of deaths. Air traffic and communications within the United States were disrupted; national stock exchanges were shut for several days; and damage from the attack has been estimated to run into .the tens of billions of dollars. .Government leaders were dispersed to ensure continuity of governinent operations.. These attacks are part of a violent campaign by the al Qaeda terrorist. organization against the United States that is believed to include an unsuccessful attempt to destroy an airliner in December 2001; a suicide bombing attack in Yemen on the U.S.S. Cole in 2000; the bombings of the United States Embassies in Kenya and in Tanzania in 1998; a truck bomb attack on a U.S. military housing complex in Saudi Arabia in 1996; an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993; mdthe ambush of U.S. servicemen in . Somalia in 1993. The September 11, 2001 attacks triggered the Nation's right under domestic and international lawto use force in self-defense.4 In response, the Government has engaged in a broad effort at home and abroad to counter terrorism. Pursuant to his authorities as Commander in Chief, the President in October, 2001, ordered the Armed Forces to attack al Qaeda personnel and assets in Afghanistan, and the Taliban militia that harboredthem~ Although the, breadth of that campaign has lessened, it is still ongoing. Congress has provided its support for the use of forces against those linked to the September 11 attacks, and has recognized the President's constitutional power to use force to prevent and deter future attacks both within and outside the United States. S. J. Res. 23, Pub. L. No. 107-40,115 Stat. 224 (2001). The Justice Department and the FBI have launched a sweeping investigation in response to the September 11 attacks, and Congress enacted legislation to expand the Justice Department's powers of surveillance against terrorists .. See The USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (2001). Last year, Congress enacted the President's proposed new cabinet department for homeland security in Article 51 of the U.N. Charter declares that \"[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.\" The attacks of September 11, 2001 clearly constitute an armed attack against the United States, and indeed were the latest in a long . history oral Qaeda sponsored attacks against the United States. lbis United Nations Security Council recognized this on September 28,2001, when it unanimously adopted Resolution 1373 explicitly \"reaffirming the inherent right of individual and collective self-defence. as recognized by the charter of the United Nations.\" 1bis right of self\u00ad .. defense is a right to effective self-defense. In other words, the victim state has the right to use force against the aggressor who has initiated an \"armedattack\" until the threat has abated. The United States, through its military and intelligence personnel, has a right recognized by Article 51 to continue using force until such time as the threat posed by al Qaeda and other terrorist groups connected to the September 11 th attacks is completely ended.\"Other treaties re-affirm the right of the United States to use force in its self-defense. See, e.g., Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, art. 3, SepF. 2, 1947, T.I.A.S. No. 1838,21 U.N.T.S. 77 (Rio Treaty); North Atlantic Treaty, art. 5, Apr. 4,1949,63 Stat. 2241, 34 U.N.T.S. 243. . UNCLASSIFIED ------------- 4 ...... _.........._--\u00ad order to implement a coordinated domestic program against terrorism. The Homeland Security Act of2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135. Leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban, with access to active terrorist cells and other resources, remain at large. It has been reported that \u00b7they have regrouped and are communicating with their members. See, e.g., Cam Simpson, Al Qaeda Reorganized, German Official Says, Minister Fears Reprisals if U.SA attacks Iraq, Star-Ledger, Jan. 26, 2003, at 18. In his recent testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on February 11, 2003, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, testified that another al Qaeda attack was anticipated as early as mid.:.February. See Rowan Scarborough & Jerry Seper, Bin Laden Tape Vows Al Qaeda Will Aid Iraq; Says U.S. Bombing Nearly Killed Him, Wash. Times, Feb: 12,2003, at AI. It appears that alQaeda continues to enjoy infonnation and resources that allow it to organize and direct active hostile forces against this country, both domestically and abroad. Given the ongoing threat of 'al Qaeda attacks, the capture and interrogation of al Qaeda operatives is imperative to our national security and defense. Because of the asymmetric nature ofterrorist operations, information is perhaps the most critical weapon for defeating al Qaeda~ Al Qaeda .is not a nation-state, and has no single country or geographic area as its base of operations. It has no fixed, large-scale military or civilian infrastructure. It deploys personnel, material, and finances covertly and attacks without warning using unconventional weapons and methods. As the September 11, 2001 attacks and subsequent events demonstrate, it seeks to launch terror attacks against purely civilian targets within the United States, and seeks to acquire weapons of mass destruction for such attacks. Because of the secret nature of al Qaeda's operations, obtaining advance information about the identity of al Qaeda operatives and their plans may prove to be the only way to prevent direct attacks on the United States. Interrogation of captured al Qaeda operatives could provide that', information; indeed, in many cases interrogation may be the only method to obtain it. Given the massive destruction and loss of life caused by the September 11 attacks, it is reasonable to believe that information gained from al Qaeda personnel could prevent attacks of a similar (if not greater) magnitude from occurring in the United States. 2. Commander-in-Chief Authority , In a series of opinions examining various legal questions arising after September 11, we have explained the scope of the President's Commander-in\"':Chiefpower.5 In those opinions, we explained that the text, structure and history of the Constitution establish that the Founders entrusted the President with the primary responsibility, and therefore the power, to protect the security of the United States. The decision to deploy military force in the defense of U. S. interests is expressly placed under Presidential authority by the Vesting Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1, cl. 1, and by the Commander-in-ChiefClause, id., \u00a7 2, cl.1.6 The Framers understood'the , S See, e.g., Memorandum for Timothy E. Flanigan, Deputy Counsel to the President, from John C. Yoo, Deputy . Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: The President's Constitutional Authority to Conduct . Military Operations Against Terrorists and Nations Supporting Them (Sept. 25, 2001) (\"Flanigan Memorandum\"); Memorandum for Alberto R. Gonzales, Counsel to the President, from Patrick F. Philbin, Deputy Assistant Attorney .General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Legality o/the Useo/Military Commissions to Try Terrorists (Nov. 6,2001). Q See Johnson v. Eistmtrager, 3:W U.S. 763, 789 (1950) (president has authority to deploy United States armed forces \"abroad or to any particular region\"); Fleming v. Page, 50 U.S~ (9 How.) 603, 614-15 (1850) (\"As UNCLASSIFIED SEeR\u00a3T~lOFOR\"\" 5 SI5CIlETRlOFO~l 'Commander-in-Chief Clause to grant the President the fullest range of power recognized at the time of the ratification as belonging to the military commander. ill addition, the structure of the Constitution demonstrates that any power traditionally understood as pertaining to the executive-which includes the conduct of war\"fare and the defense of the nation-unless expressly assigned to Congress, is vested in the President. Article IT, Section I makes this clear by stating that the \"executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\" That sweeping grant vests in the President the \"executive power\" and contrasts with the specific enumeration of the powers-those \"herein\"-granted to Congress in Article I. .Our reading of the constitutional text and structure are confirmed by historical practice, in which Presidents have ordered the use of military force more than 100 times \u00b7without congressional authorization, and by the functional consideration that national security decisions require a unity in purpose and energy that characterizes the Presidency alone.7 As the\u00b7 Supreme Court has recognized, the Commander-in-Chief power and the President's obligation to protect the nation imply the ancillary powers necessary to their successful exercise. \"The first of the enumerated powers of the President is that he shall be Commander-in-Chief of the Anny and Navy of the United States. And, of course, the grantof war power includes all that is necessary and proper for carrying those powers into execution.\" Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 788 (1950). ill wartime, it is for the President alone to .decide what methods to use to best prevail against the enemy. See, e.g., Flanigan Memorandum at 3; Memorandum for Charles W. Colson, Special Counsel to the President, from William H. .Rehnquist, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: The President and the War Power: South Vietnam and the Cambodian Sanctuaries (May 22, 1970).8 The President's commander-in-chief, [the President] is authorized to direct the movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at his command, and to employ them in the manner he may deem most effectual\"); Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 776 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (The \"inherent powers\" of the Commander in Chief \"are clearly extensive.\"); Maul v. United States, 274 U.S. 501, \u00b7515-16 (1927) (Brandeis & Holmes, H., concurring) (president \"may direct any reven~e cutter to cruise in any waters in order to perform any duty ofthe service\"); Commonwealth o/Massachusetts v. Laird, 451 F.2d 26, 32 (1stCir. 1971) (the President has \"power as Commander-in-Chief to station forces abroad\"); Ex parte F.Cas. 922 (C.C.S.D. Ohio 1863) (No. 16,816) (in acting \"under this power where there is no express legislative declaration, the president is guided solely by his own judgment and discretion\"); AuthOrity to Use United States Military Forces in Somalia, 16 Op. O.L.C. 6,6 (1992). .' . 7 Judicial decisions since the beginning of the Republic confllll1 the President's constitutional power and duty to repel military action against the United States and to take measures to prevent the recurrence of an attack. As Justice Joseph Story said long ago, \"[i]t may be fit and proper for the government, in the exercise of the high discretion confided to the executive, for great public purposes, to act on a sudden emergency, or to prevent an irreparable mischief, by summary measures, which are not found in the text of the laws.\" The Apollon, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 362, 366-67 (1824). lfthe President is confronted with an unforeseen attack on the territory and people of the United States, or other immediate, dangerous threat to American interests and security, it is his constitutional responsibility to respond to that threat with whatever means are necessary. See. e.g., The Prize Cases, 67 U.S. (2 Black) 635, 668 (1862) (\"If a war be made by invasion of a foreign nation, the President is not only authorized hut . bound to resist force by force ... without waiting for any speciaUegislative authority.\"); United States v. Smith, 27 E. Cas. 1192, 1229-30 (C.C.D.N.Y. 1806) (No. 16,342) (paterson, Circuit Justice) (regardless of statutory authorization, it is \"the duty ... of the executive magistrate .. to repel an invading foe\"); see also 3 Story, Commentaries \u00a7 1485 (\"[t]he command and application of the public force ... to maintain peace, and to resist foreign invasion\" are executive powers). '. . 8 See also Memorandum for William J. Haynes, n, General Counsel, Department of Defense, from Jay S. Bybee, Assistant Attorney General, Offia of Legal Counsel, Re: Legal Constraints to Boarding and Searching Foreign Vessels on the High Seas at 3 (June 13, 2002) (\"High Seas Memorandum\") (\"[T]he Commander-in-Chief and UNCLASSIFIED BI5CRETRlOPOffi\\l 6 complete discretion in exercising the Commander-in..:Chief power has been recognized by the courts. In the Prize Cases, 67 U.S. (2 Black) 635, 670 (1862), for example, the Court explained that whether the President \"in fulfilling his duties as Commander in Chief' had appropriately responded to the rebellion of the southern states was a question \"to be decided by him\" and which the Coun could not question, but must leave to \"the political department of the Government to which this power was entrusted.\" See a/so Hamilton v. Dillin, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 73, 87 (1874) (by virtue of the Commander-in-Chief Clause, it is ''the President aione[] who is constitutionally invested with the entire charge ofhostile operations.\"). One of the core functions of the Commander in Chief is that of capturing, detaining, and interrogating members ofthe enemy. See, e.g., Memorandum for WilliamJ. Haynes II, General Counsel, Department of Defense, from Jay S. Bybee, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: The President's Power as Commander in Chief to Transfer Captured Terrorists to the Control and Custody of Foreign Nations at 3 (Mar. 13, 2002) (\"Transfers . Memorandum\") (''the Commander-in-Chief Clause .constitutes an independent grant of \"Substantive authority to engage in the detention and transfer of prisoners captured in armed conflicts\"). Itis well settled that the President may seize and detain enemy combatants, atleast .for the duration of the conflict, and the laws ofwar make clear that frisoners ma~ be interrogated for infonnation conc.erning the enemy, its strength, and its plans .. Numerous Presidents have ordered the capture, detention, and questioning of enemy combatants during virtually every major conflict in the Nation's history, including recent conflicts such as the Gulf, Vietnam, and Korean wars. Recognizing this authority, Congress has never attempted to restrict or interfere with the President's authority on this score. ld. C. Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause We conclude below that the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause is inapplicable to the . conduct of interrogations of alien enemy.combatants held outside the United States for two independem reasons. First, the. Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause does not apply to the President's conduct of a war. Second, even if the Fifth Amendment applied to the conduct of war, the Fifth Amendment does not apply extraterritorially to aliens who have no connection to the United States. We address each of these reasons in turn. First, the Fifth\u00b7 Amendment was not designed to restrict the unique war powers of the President as Commander in Chief. As long ago as 1865, Attorney General Speed explained the unquestioned rule that,. as Commander in Chief, the President waging a war may authorize Vesting Clauses grant the President the authority not just to set broad military strategy, but also to decide all operational. and tactical\u00b7 plans.\"); Memorandum for Daniel J. Bryant, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legislative Affairs, from John C. Yoo, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Applicability 0/ 18 U.S.c. \u00a7 4001(a) to Military Detention 0/ United States Citizens at 2 (June 27, 2002)' (The . Constitution \"vests full. control ofthe military operations ofthe Uriited States in the President\"). 9 Although Article 17 of the\u00b7 Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 . U.S.T. 3517, places restrictions on interrogation ofenemy combatants, members ofal Qaeda and the Taliban militia are not legally entitled to the status of prisoners of war under the Convention. See generally Memorandum for Alberto R. Gonzales, Counselto the President and William J. Haynes, II, General Counsel, Department of Defense, fromJay S. Bybee, Assistant Attomey General, Office ofLegal Counsel, Re: Application o/Treaties and Laws to al Qaeda and Taliban Detainees (Jan. 22, 2002) (\"Treaties and Laws Memorandum\"). UNCLASSIFIED 7 SECMYf'}fiOPORfi soldiers to engage in combat that could not be authorized as a part of the President's role in enforcing the laws. The strictures that bind the Executive in its role as a magistrate enforcing the civil laws have no place in constraining the President in waging war: Soldiers regularly in the service have the license of the government to deprive men,the active enemies of the government, of their liberty and lives; their commission so to act is as perfect and legal as that of a judge to adjudicate .... Wars never have been and never can be conducted upon the principle that an army is but a posse comitatis ofa civil magistrate.. MilitaryCommissions,l1 Op.Att'y Gen. 297, 301-02 (1865) (emphasis added); see also The Modoc Indian Prisoners, 14 Op. Att'y Gen. 249, 252 (1873) (\"it cannot be pretended that a United States soldier is guilty of murder ifhe kills a public enemy in battle, which would be the case if the municipal law was in force and, applicable to an\u00b7 act committed under such circumstances\") .. As Attorney General Speed conciuded, the Due Process Clause has no application to the conduct of a military campaign: That portion oithe Constitution which declares that 'no person shall be deprived. . . of his life,liberty, or property without due process of law,' has such direct reference to, and connection with, trials for crime or criminal prosecutions that comment upon it would seem to be unnecessary. Trials for offences against the laws of war are not embraced or intended to be embraced in those provisions.... The argument that flings around offenders against the laws of war these guarantees of the Constitution would convict all the soldiers of our anny of murder; no prisoners could be taken and held; the anny could not move. The absurd consequences that would of necessity flow from .such an argument show that it cannot be the true construction-it cannot be what was intended by the framers of the instrument. One ofthe prime motives for the Union and a federal government was to confer the powers of war. If\u00b7 any provisions of the .. Constitution are so in conflict with the power to carry on war as to destroy and make it valueless, then the instrument,instead of being agreat and wise one, is a miserable failure\"a felo de se. 11 Op. Att'y Gen. at 313-14. Moreover, the Supreme Court's reasoning in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez; 494 U.S. 259 (1990), addressing the extra-territorial application of the Fourth Amendment is equally instructive as to why the Fifth Amendment cannot be construed to apply to the President's conduct .of a war: The United States frequently employs AnnedForces outside this country-over 200 times in our history-for the protection of American citizens or national security.... Application oithe Fourth Amendment to those circumstances could significantly disrupt the ability of the political branches to .respond to foreign . situations involving our national interest. Were respondent to prevail, aliens with no attachment to this-.country might 'well bring actions for damages to remedy UNCLASSIFIED 8 claimed violations of the Fourth Amendment in foreign countries or in international waters.... [T]he Court of Appeals' global view of [the Fourth Amendment's] applicability would plunge [the political branches] into a sea of uncertainty as to what might be reasonable in the way of searches and seizures conducted abroad. Id. at 273-74 (citations omitted).10 If each time the President captured and detained enemy aliens outside the United States, those aliens could bring suit challenging the deprivation of their liberty, such a result would interfere with and undermine the President's capacity to protect the Nation and to respond to the exigencies ofwar. II . The Supreme Court has repeatedly refused to apply the Due Process Clause or even the Just Compensation Clause to executive and congressional actions taken in the direct prosecution of a war effort against enemies of the Nation. It has long been settled that nothing in the Fifth Amendment governs wartime actions to detain ordeport alien enemies and to confiscate enemy property. As the Court has broadly stated in United States v. Salerno; 481 U.S. 739, 748 (1987), \"in times of war or insurrection, when society's interest is at its peak, the Government may detain individuals whom the government believes to be dangerous\" without violating the Due Process Clause.' See also Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U.S. 160, 171 (1948). Similarly, as the Supreme Court has explained with respect to enemy property, \"[b]y exertion of the war power, and untrammeled by the due process or just compensation clause,\" Congress may \"enact[] laws directing seizure, use, and\u00b7 disposition of property in this country belonging to subjects of the enemy.\" Cummings v. Deutsche BankUnd Discontogese/lschajt, 300 U.S. 115, 120 (1937). These authorities of the federal government during armed conflict were recognized early in the Nation's history. Chief Justice Marshall concluded for the Court in 1814 that \"war gives to the sovereign full right to take the persons and confiscate the property of the enemy wherever found.\" Brown v. United States, 12 U.S. (8 Cranch) 110, 122 (1814). See also Eisentrager, 339 U.S. at 775 (\"The resident enemy alien is constitutionally subject to summary arrest, internment and deportation whenever a 'declared war' exists.\"); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 587 (1952). As the Court explained in United States v. Chemical Found\" Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 11 (1926), Congress is \"untrammeled and .free to authorize the seizure,' use or appropriation of [enemy] properties without any compensation .... There is no constitutional prohibition against confiscation of enemy properties.\" See also White v. Mechs. Sec. Corp., 269 U.S. 283, 301 (l925) (Holmes, J.)(when U.S. seizes an enemy itmay \"do with itwhat itliked\") .. 10 Indeed, drawing in part on the reasoning of Verdugo-Urquidez, as well as the Supreme Court's treatment of the destruction of property for the purposes of military necessity, our Office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations. See Memorandum for Alberto R. Gonzales, Counsel to the President, and William J. Haynes, n, General Counsel, Department of Defense, from John C. Yoo, Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Robert J. Delahunty, Special Counsel, Re: Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Te17'0rist Activities Within the United States at 25 (Oct 23, 200 I). 11 Our analysis here should not be confused with a theory that the Constitution somehow does not \"apply\" during wartime: The Supreme Court squarely rejected such a proposition long ago in Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) . 2, 119-20 (1866), and at least that part of the Milligan decision is still good law. See, e.g., Kennedy v. Mendoza\u00ad Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 164-65 (1963); United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U.S. 81, 88 (1921) (\"[T]he mere existence of a state of war could not suspend or change the operation upon the power of Congress of the guaranties and limitations of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments ....\"). Instead, we conclude that the restrictions outlined in the Fifth Amendmenr:simply do not address actions the Executive takes in conducting a military campaign against the Nation's enemies. .sECRi3T/~*OFORNUNCLASSIFIED 9 SEcm;MI0FO~1 The Supreme Court has also stated a general rule that, notwithstanding the compensation requirement for government takings of property under the Fifth Amendment, ''the government cannot be charged for injuries to, or destruction of, private property caused by military operations of armies in the field.\" United States v. Pacific R.R., 120 U.S. 227,239 (1887). For .\"[t]he terse language of the Fifth Amendment is no comprehensive promise that the United States will make whole all who suffer from every ravage and burden of war. This Court has long recognized that in wartime many losses must be attributed solely to the fortunes of war, and not to the sovereign.\" .United States v. 'Caltex, Inc. (Philippines), 344 U.S. 149, 155-56 (1952). See also Herrera v. United States, 222 U.S. 558 (1912); Juragua Iron Co. v. United States, 212 U:S. 297 (1909); Ford v. Surget, 97 U.S. 594 (1878). These cases and the untenable consequences for the President's condUct of awar that would result from the application of the Due Process Clause demonstrate its inapplicability during wartime-whether to the conduct of interrogations or the detention of enemy aliens. Second, even if the Fifth Amendment applied to enemy combatants in wartime, it is clear that that the Fifth Amendment .does not operate outside the United States to regulate the Executive's conduct toward ,aliens. The Supreme Court has squarely held that the Fifth Amendment provides no rights to non-citizens who have no established connection to the country and who are held outside sovereign United States territory. See Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S; at 269 (\"[W]e have rejected the claim that aliens are entitled to Fifth Amendment rights . outside the sovereign territory of the United States.\"). See also Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001) (\"It is well established that certain constitutional protections[, such as the Fifth Amendment,] available to persons inside the United States are unavailable to aliens outside of our geographic borders.\") (citing Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 269; and Eisentrager, 339 U.S. at 784). As the Supreme Court explained in Eisentrager, construing the Fifth Amendment to apply to aliens who are outside the United States and have no connection to the United States: would mean that during military occupation irreconcilable enemy elements, guerrilla fighters, and 'werewolves' could require the American JUdiciary to assure them freedoms of speech, press, and assembly as in the First Amendment, right to bear arms as in the Second, security against 'unreasonable' searches and seizures as in the Fourth, as well as rights to jury trial as in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Such extraterritorial application of organic law would have been so significant an innovation in the practice of governments that, if intended or apprehended, it could scarcely have failed to excite contemporary comment. Not . one woidcan be cited. No decision of this Court supports such a view. 339 U.S. at 784. See also Harburyv. Deutch, 233 F.3d 596, 603-D4(D.C. Cir. 2000), rev'd Supreme Court in Eisentrager,. Verdugo-Urquidez, and Zadvydas, and the District of Columbia Circuit in Harbury, have all held that there is no extraterritorial application of the Fifth Amendment to aliens.\"). Indeed, in Harbury v. Deutch, the'D.C. Circllit expressly considered a claim that various U.S. officials had participated in the torture of a non-U.S. citizen outside the sovereign territory of the United States during peacetime. See 233 F.3d <y: 604--05. The D.C. Circuit rejected the contention that the Due UNCLASSIFIED SECRE'FlP'lOFORH --10 Process clause applied extraterritorially to a person in such circumstances. The court found .Verdugo-Urquidez to be controlling on the question, and detennined that the Supreme Court's rejection of the extraterritorial application the Fifth Amendment precluded any claim by an alien held outside the United States even when the conduct at issue had not occurred in wartime. See id. at 604 (finding that \"the Supreme Court's extended and approving citation of Eisentrager [in Verdugo-Urquidez] suggests that its conclusions regarding the extraterritorial application oithe Fifth Amendment are not ... limited\" to wartime). We therefore believe that it is clear that the Fifth Amendment does not apply to alien enemy combatants held overseas. D. Eighth Amendment A second constitutional provision that mi\u00b7ght be thought.relevant to interrogations is the Eighth Amendment. The Eighth\u00b7 Amendment, however, applies solely to those persons upon whom criminal sanctions have been imposed. As the Supreme Court has explained, the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause \"was designed to protect those convicted of crimes.\" Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 664 (1977). As a result, \"Eighth Amendment scrutiny is appropriate only after the State has complied with the constitutional guarantees traditionally associated with criminal prosecutions.\" Id. at 671 nAO. The Eighth Amendment thus has no application to those individuals who have not been punished as part of a criminal proceeding, ip'espective of the fact that they have been detained by\u00b7the government. See Bell v. Wolfish,441 U.S. 520, 536 n.16 (1979) (holding that condition of confinement claims brought by pretrial detainee must be considered under the Fifth Amendment, not the Eighth Amendment). The Eighth Amendment therefore cannot extend to the detention of wartime detainees, who have . . ( been captured pursuant to the President's power as' Commander in Chief. See Transfers Memorandum at 2 (concluding that \"the President has since the FOWlding era exercised exclusive and virtually unfettered control over the disposition of enemy soldiers and agents captured in time of war\"). See also Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 316 F.3d 450,463 (4thCir. 2003) (the President's powers as Commander in Chief \"include the authority to detain those captured in anned struggle\"). The detention\u00b7 of enemy combatants can in no sense be deemed \"punishment\" for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. Unlike imprisonment pursuant to a criminal sanction,. the detention of enemy combatants involves no sentence judicially imposed or legislatively required and those detained will be released at the end ofthe conflict. Indeed, it has long been established that '''[c]aptivity [in wartime] is neither a punishment nor an act of vengeance,'\u00b7 but 'merely a temporary detention which is devoid of all penal character. '\" William Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 788 (2d ed. 1920) (quoting British War Office, Manual ofMilitary Law (1882)). Moreover, \"[t]he object of capture is to prevent the captured individual from serving the enemy.\" In ,:e Territo, 156 F.2d 142, 145 (9th CiT; 1946). See also Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 784 (1950); MarcoSassoli & .Antoine A. Bouvier, How Does Law Protect in War? Cases Documents and Teaching Materials on Contemporary Practice in International Humanitarian Law 125 (1999) (the purpose of detaining enemy combatants\"is not to punish them, but ... to hinder their direct participation in hostilities\") .. Detention also serves another vital military objective-i.e., obtaining intelligence from captured combatants to aid in the prosecution of the war. Accordingly, the Eighth Amendment has no application here. UNCLASSIFIED II II. Federal Criminal Law A. Canons of Construction We discuss below several canons of construction that indicate that ordinary federal criminal statutes do not apply to the properly-authorized interrogation of enemy combatants by the United States Anned Forces during an anned conflict12 These canons include the avoidance of constitutional difficulties, inapplicability of general criminal statutes to the conduct of the military during war, inapplicability of general statutes to the sovereign, and the specific governs the general. The Criminal Division concurs in our conclusion that these canons of construction preclude the application of the assault, maiming, interstate stalking, and torture statutes to the military during the conduct of a war. 1. .Interpretation to Avoid Constitutional Problems As the Supreme Court has recognized, and as we will explain further below, the President enjoys complete discretion in the exercise of his Commander~in-Chief authority in conductiIig operations against hostile forces. Because both \"[t]he executive power and the command of the . military and naval forces is vested in the President,\" the Supreme Court has unanimously stated that it is \"the President alone [] who .is constitutionally invested with the entire charge ofhostile operations.\" Hamiltonv. Dillin, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 73,87 (I 874)(emphasis added). In light of the President's complete authority over the conduct ofwar, in the absence of a .r clear statement from Congress otherwise, we will not read a criminal statute as infringing on the President's ultimate authority in these areas. We presume that Congress does not seek to provoke a constitutional confrontation with an equal, coordinate branch of government unless it has unambiguously indicated its intent to do so. The Supreme Court has recognized, and this Office has similarly adopted, a canon of statutory construction that statutes are to be construed in a manner that avoids constitutional difficulties so long as a reasonable alternative construction is available. See, e.g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988) (citing NLRB v. Cat~olicBishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490, 499-501, 504 (1979))\u00b7 (\"[W]here.an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutiOIlal problems, [courts] will construe [a] statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\"). Cf United States Assistance to . Countries That Shoot Down Civil Aircraft Involved in Drug Trafficking, 18 Op. O.L.C. 148,149 (July 14, 1994) (\"Shoot Down Opinion\") (requiring \"careful examination of each individual [criminal] statute\"before concluding that generally applicable statute applied to the conduct of U.S; government\u00b7 officials). This canon of construction applies especially where an act of Congress could be read to encroach upon powers constitutionally committed to a coordinate branch of government See, e.g., Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800-01 (1992) (citation omitted) (\"Out ofrespect for the separation of powers and the unique constitutional position of the President, we find that textual silence is not enough to subject the President to the .provisions of the [Administrative Procedure Act]. We would require an express statement by 12 One exception to this general statement is the War Crime~ Statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2441, which expressly applies to the military's conduct of war. 'I11is statute does not apply to the interrogat;ions in the current conflict for the reasons we explain infra Part II.C.l. UNCLASSIFIED ---------------' 12 , SElCR\u00a3TftiOf?OR:Pi .Congress before assuming it intended the President's performance of his statutory duties to be reviewed for abuse of discretion.\"); Public Citizen v. United States Dep't of Justice, 491 U.S. , 440,465-67 (1989) (construing Federal Advisory Committee Act not to apply to advice given by American Bar Association to the President on judicial nominations, to avoid potential constitutional question regarding encroachment on Presidential power to appoint judges). In the area of foreign affairs and war powers in particular, the avoidance canon has special force. In contrast to the domestic realm, foreign affairs and war clearly place the President in the dominant constitutional position due to his authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive and his plenary control over diplomatic relations. There can be little doubt that the conduct of war is a matter that is fundamentally executive in nature, the power over which the Framers vested in a unitary executive. \"The direction of war implies the direction of the common strength,\" Alexander Hamilton observed, \"and the power of directing and employing the common strength' forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority.\" The Federalist No. 74, at 415. Thus, earlier in this current armed conflict against the al Qaeda terrorist network, we concluded that \"[t]he power of the President is at its zenith under the Constitution when-the President is directing military operations of the anned forces.\" Flanigan Memorandum at 3. Correspondingly, during war Congress plays a reduced role in the war effort, and the courts generally defer to executive decisions concerning the conduct of hostilities. See, e.g., The Prize Cases, 67U.S. (2 Black) 635,670 (1862). Construing generally.applicable statutes so as not to apply to the conduct of military operations against the enemy during an armed conflict respects the Constitution's basic allocation of wartime authority. .As our Office recently explained in rejecting the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2280, which prohibits the seizure of vessels, to conduct during the current war: we have previously concluded that the President's authorityin the areas of foreign relations and national security is very broad, and that in the absence of a clear statement in the text or context of a statutory prohibition to suggest that it was Congress's intent to circumscribe this authority, we do not believe that a statute should be interpreted to impose such a restriction on the President's constitutional powers. . \"High Seas Memorandum at' 8 n.5. Federal courts similarly have agreed 'that federal statutes ' should not be read to interfere with the Executive Branch's control over foreign affairs unless Congress specifically and clearly seeks to do so.' See, e.g., Dep 't ofNavy v. Egan, '484 U.S. 518, 530 (1988) (\"unless Congress specifically has provided otherwise, courts traditionally have been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs.\"); Japan Whaling Ass'n v. American Cetacean Soc'y, 478 U.S. 232-33 (1986) (construing federal statutes to avoid curtailment oftraditional presidential prerogatives in foreign affairs). Courts will not lightly assume that Congress has acted to interfere with the President's' 'constitutionally superior position as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief in the area of military operations. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 529 (quoting Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 293-94 (1981)). See also Agee, 453 U.S. at 291 (deference to executive branch is \"especially\" appropriate \"in the area ... of... national security''); = UNCLASSIFIED SECRElTli'iOf?OR'>l ;suo 13 In order to respect the President's inherent constitutional authority to direct a military campaign against al Qaeda and its allies; general criminal laws must be construed as not applying to interrogations undertaken pursuant to his Commander-in-Chief authority. Congress cannot interfere with the President's exercise of his authority as Commander in Chief to control the conduct of operations during a war. See, e.g.,\u00b7 Memorandum for Daniel J. Bryant, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legislative Affairs, from. Patrick F. Philbin, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Swift Justice Authorization Act (Apr. 8, 2002); Flanigan Memorandum at 6; Memorandum for Andrew Fois, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legislative Affairs, from Richard L. Shiffrin, Deputy AssistantAttorney General, Office of . Legal Counsel; Re: Defense Authorization Act (Sept. 15, 1995). As we have discussed above, the President's power to detain and interrogate enemy combatants arises out ofhis constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. Any construction of criminal laws that regulated the President's authority as Commander in Chief to determine the interrogation and treatment of enemy combatants would raise serious constitutional questions whether Congress had intruded on the President's constitutional authority. Moreover, we do not believe that Congress enacted general criminal provisions such as the prohibitions against assault, maimmg, interstate stalking, and torture pursuant to any expr~ss authority that would allow it to infringe on the President's constitutional control over the operation ofthe Anned Forces in wartime. In our view, Congress may no more regulate the President's ability to detain and interrogate enemy combatants than it may regulate his ability to direct troop movements on the battlefield. In fact, the general applicability of these statutes belies any arguinent that these statutes apply to persons under the direction of the President in the conduct ofwar.13 To avoid this constitutional difficulty, therefore, we will construe potentially applicable criminal laws, reviewed in more detail below, not to apply to the President's detention and interrogation of enemy combatants pursuant to his Commander-in-Chief authority. We beli'eve that this approach fully respects Congress's authority. First, we will not read a statute to create constitutional problems because we assume that Congress fully respects the limits of its own constitutional authority and would not knowingly seek to upset the separation of powers. Second, we will not infer a congressional attempt to spark a constitutional confrontation with the executive branch in wartime unless Congress clearly and specifically seeks to do so. 13 It might be thought that Congress could enact legislation that regulated the conduct of interrogations under its authority to \"make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\" U.S. Const art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 14. The question whether Congress could use this power to regulate military commissions was identified and reserved by the Supreme Court. ExParte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1,29 (1942). Our Office has determined that Congress cannot exercise its ,authority to make rules for the Armed Forces to regulate military commissions. Memorandum for Daniel J. Bryant, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legislative Affairs, from Patrick F. Philbin, Deputy Assistant Attorney General,Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Swift Justice Authorization Act at 7 (Apr. 8,2002). If military commissions are considered an integral part of the conduct ofmilitary operations\" then the conduct of interrogations of enemy combata.I!.ts during wartime must be as much a core element of the President's power to successfully prosecute war. Any effort by Congress to use its power to make rules for the armed forces would thus be just as unconstitutional as suchrules would be with regard to military commissions. UNCLASSIFIED 14 2. Application of Laws of General Applicability to the Conduct of the Military During'Var Not only do we construe statutes to avoid intruding upon\u00b7 the President's power as Commander in Chief, but we also apply a more specific and related canon to the conduct ofwar. As this Office has previously opined, unless \"Congress by a clear and unequivocal statement declares otherwise\" a criminal statute should not be construed to apply to the properly authorized acts of the military during armed conflict. Shoot Down Opinion, 18 Op. O.L.C. at 164. See Memorandum for Alan Kreczko, Legal Adviser to the National Security Council, from Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General, Office ofLegal Counsel, Re: Applicability of47 U.S.C: \u00a7 502 to Certain Broadcast Activities at 3 (Oct 15, 1993) (\"In the absence of a clear statement of [the] intent [to apply the statute to militarY personnel acting under the President as Commander in Chief], we do\u00b7not believe that a statutory provision of this generality should be interpreted so to restrict the President's constitutional powers.\"); Application of the Neutrality Act to Official Government Activities, 8 Gp. O.L.C. 58, 81 (1984) ,(concluding that in absence of a express statement, the Neutrality Act does not apply to U.S.' \"Government officials acting within the course and scope oftheir official duties,\" in light ofthe legislative history and histqrical practice that demonstrated a contrary intent). For many years, our Office has also applied this canon in . several highly classified contexts that cannot be discussed in this memorandum. This canon ofconstruction is rooted in the absurdities that the application of such laws to theconduct\u00b7 ofthe.military during' a war would create. Ifthose laws were construed to apply to the properly-authorized conduct of military personnel, the most essential tasks necessary to the . conduct of war would become subject to prosecution. A soldier who shot an enemy combatant on the battlefield could become liable under the criminal laws for assault or murder; a pilot who bombed a military target in a city could be prosecuted for murder or destruction of property; a sailor who detained a suspected terrorist on the high seas might be subject to prosecution for\u00b7 kidnapping. As we noted in the Shoot Down Opinion, the application of such laws to the military during wartime \"could [also] mean in some circumstances that military personnel would not be able to engage in reasonable self-defense without subjecting themselves to the risk of criminal prosecution.\" Id. at 164. The mere potential for prosecution could impair themilitaryjs .completion ofits duties during a war as military officials became concerned about their liability under the criminal laws .. Such results are so ridiculous as to be untenable and must be rejected to allow the President and the Armed Forces to successfully conduct a war. This canon of construction, of course, establishes only a presumption. While the federal criminal statutes of general applicability reviewed below do not overcome that presumption, in some cases it has been dOI1e. For example, it is clear that the War Crimes Statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2441, which we address below, is intended to apply to the conduct of the U.S. military. It expressly provides that the statute applies where theperpetrator ofthe crime \"is a member ofthe . Armed Forces of the United States\" and the conduct it prohibits is conduct that occurs during . war. Id. \u00a7 2441 (b). That presumption has not, however, been overcome with respect to the assault, maiming, interstate staiking, or th~ torture statutes. We will not infer an intention by Congress to interfere with the conduct ofmilitary operations in an anned conflict without a clear statement otherwise. UNCLASSIFIED 15 .SISCll::BT~TOFO~l 3. Generally Applicable Statutes Are Not Construed to Apply to the Sovereign It is also a canon of construction that laws of general applicability are not read to apply to the sovereign. In United States v. Nardone, 302 U.S. 379 (1937), the Supreme Court explained its application: (1) where it ''would deprive the sovereign of a recognized or established prerogative title or interest,\" id. at 383; or (2) \"where a reading which would include such officers would work obvious absurdity[,]\" id. at 384. As the Court explained, \"[a] classical instance\" of the deprivation of a recognized or established prerogative title or interest \"is the . exemption of the state from the operation of general statutes oflimitation.\" Id. at 383. Here, the application of these statutes to the conduct of interrogations of unlawful combatants would deprive the sovereign of a recognized prerogative .. Historically, nations have been free to treat unlawful combatants as they wish, and in the United States this power has been vested in the President through the Commander-in-Chief Clause. As one commentator has explained, unlawful belligerents are \"more often than not treated as war or national criminals liable to be treated at will by the captor. There are almost no regulatory safeguards with respect to them and the captor owes no obligation towards them.\" RC. Hingorani, Prisoners of War 18 (1982) (emphasis added).\u00b7 See Ingrid Detter, The Law of War 148 (2d ed. 2000) (''Unlawful combatants ~ .. enjoy no protection under international law); William Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 784 (2d ed. 1920) (unlawful belligerents are \"[n]ot ... within the protection of the laws of war\"); A. Berriedale Keith, 2 Wheaton's Elements ofInternational Law 716 (6th ed. 1929) (\"irregular bands ofmarauders are ... not entitled to the protection ofthe mitigated usages ofwar as practised by civilized nations\"); 1. Oppenheim, 2 International Law, \u00a7 254, at 454 (6th ed. 1944) (''Private individuals who take up arms and commit hostilities against the enemy do not enjoy the privileges of anned forces, and the enemy has, according to a customary rule of International Law, the right to treat such individuals as war criminals.,,).14 The United States Supreme Court has recognized the important distinction between lawful and unlawful combatants.\u00b7 As the Supreme Court unanimously stated 60 years ago, \"[b]y universal agreement and practice the law of war draws a distinction between the armed forces and the peaceful populations of belligerent nations and also between those who are lawful. and unlawful combatants.\" Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1,30-31 (1942) (emphasis added). . 14 See also Alberico Gentili, De lure Tres 22 (1612) (Johne. Rolfe translation 1933) (\"malefact9rs do not enjoy the privileges of a law to which they are foes\"); E. de Vattel, 3 The Law ojNations or the Principles oj Natural Law 318 (1758) (Charles G. Fenwick translation 1916) (\"The troops alone carry on the war and the rest of the people remain at peace....

Sherston Baker, 1 Halleck's InternatiorialLaw 614-17 (4th ed. 1908) (noting distinction between lawful and unlawful belligerency and concluding unlawful combatants are \"not entitled to the mitigated rules ofmodem warfare\"); Pasquale Law Codified, \u00a7 1459, at 548 (1918) (\"Any act of hostility, any armed violence against the person or I=roperty ofthe hostile . sovereign or state and of its citizens, even though legitimate under the laws of war, shall be deemed unlawful and punishable according to 'common' law, if committed by one who is not properly a belligerent.\"); id. \u00a7 1475, at 552 (\"Armed bands committing hostile acts in time of war by engaging in operations on their own account and without authorization of the Govemmenfand, when necessary, concealing their identity as combatants, cannot invoke the application ofthe laws ofwarnorbe recognized asbelligerents. \"). SI3CRETRiOPORN UNCLASSIFIED 16 SECRB'fIN6F6RP't Under traditional practice as expressed in the customary laws of war, the treatment of unlawful belligerents is left to the sovereign's discretion. As one commentator has stated, the treatment of \"unprivileged belligerents ... [is] left to the discretion of the belligerent threatened by their activities.\" Julius Stone, Legal Controls ofInternational Conflict 549 (1954). Under our Constitution, the sovereign right of the United States on the treatment of enemy combatants is reserved to the President as Commander-in-Chief. In light of the long history of discretion given to each nation to determine its treatment of unlawful combatants, to construe these statutes to ,regulate the conduct of the United States toward such combatants would interfere with a well\u00ad established prerogative of the sovereign. While the Geneva Convention (TIl) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12,1949, 6 U.S.T. ofwarstatus to those who are unlawful combatants. See Treaties (Ind Laws Memorandum at '8-9. Those restrictions therefore would not apply to the interrogations of unlawful belligerents such as ai Qaeda or Taliban members. The second exception recognized by the Supreme Court arises where the application of general laws toa government official would create absurd results, such as effectively preventing the official from carrying out his duties. In Nardone,the Supreme Court pointed to \"the application ora speed law to a policeman pursuing a criminal or the driver of a fire engine responding to an alarm\" as examples of such absurd results. Nardone, 302 U.S. at 384. See also United Statesv. Kirby, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 482, 486-,-87 (1868) (holding that statute punishing obstruction of mail did not apply to an officer's temporary detention of mail caused by his arrest of the carrier for murder).. In those situations and others, such as undercover investigations of. narcotics trafficking, the government officer's conduct would constitute a literal violation of the . law. And while \"[g]ovemment law enforcement efforts frequently require the literal violation of facially applicable statutes[,] ... courts have construed prohibitory laws as inapplicable when a public official is engaged in the performance of a necessary public duty.\" 'Memorandum for Maurice C. Inman, Jr., General Counsel, Immigration and Naturalization Service, from Larry L. Simms, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of' Legal Counsel, Re:. Visa Fraud Investigation at 2 (Nov: 20, 1984). Indeed, to construe such statutes otherwise would undermine almost all undercover investigative efforts: See also id.For the reasons we explain above, the application of these general laws to the conduct of the military during the course of a war would create untenable results. . Like the\u00b7 canon of construction against the .application of general criminal statutes to the conduct ofthe military during war, this canon ofconstruction is not absolute. The rule excluding the sovereign is only one of construction. It may be overcome where the legislative history or obvious policies of the statue demonstrate that the sovereign and its officers should be included. With respect to assault, maiming; or interstate stalking, no such history or obvious legislative policy indicates an intention to regulate lawful military 'activities in an armed conflict. Although the torture statute, as. we explain below, applies to persons acting under color of law, the legishitive history indicates no intent to apply this to the conduct of military personnel. Indeed, as we\u00b7 explained in discussing the prerogative of the sovereign, it is well established that the sovereign retains the discretion to treat unlawful combatants as it sees fit. . = UNCLASSIFIED SECRE'f',!f,6 FORf, 17 ,SECe'f,,(opoftft 4. Specific Governs the General The canon of construction that specific statutes govern general statutes also counsels that generally applicable criminal statutes should not apply to the military's conduct of interrogations in the prosecution of a war. Where a specific statute or statutory scheme has been enacted, it and not a more general enactment will govern. See, e.g., Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437, 445 (1987). Here, the UCMJ provides a detailed regulatory regime for the . conduct of military personnel apart from the federal criminal code. Congress enacted the UCMJ pursuant to its constitutional authority \"[t]o make Rules for the government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\" U.S. Const. art. I, sec. 8, cl. 14. As the specific code of conduct, the DCMJ governs the conduct ofthe militaryduring awar, notthe generalfederalcriminal laws. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act makes clear that it is the UCMJ-not the criminal code-that governs the conduct of the members of the Armed Forces. As' explained above, 18 D,S.C. \u00a7326l(d) ensures that the military punishes and disciplines its members. To be sure; section 3261(a)(1) provides that members of the Armed Forces may be punished for conduct that would constitute a felony if committed in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. But section 3261(d) precludes the prosecution of such persons in an Article ill court; with only two exceptions: (l) where an individual is' ho longer a member of the Armed Forces, though he was a member at the time of the offense the individual; and (2) where the membercommitted the offense with someone who was'not amember ofthe Armed Forces. It could be argued that Congress specifically enacted section 3261 to extend special maritime and territorial jurisdiction crimes to the members of the Armed Forces and those accompanying or employed by them. Such a contention would, however, be incorrect. Nothing in that provision, or its legislative history suggests an intention to impose general criminal liability on the military for properly-authorized acts undertaken ,in the prosecution of a war. .Rather, the legislative history reveals a desire to ensure that when persons accompanying or employed by the Anned Forces, acting solely in their personal capacity, commits a felony, they . can be punished for those crimes. IS We thereforebe1ieve that this canon of construction, as with the others outlined above, supports our conclusion that the statutes outlined in this opinion, with the exception of the war crimes statute, do not govern the properly authorized interrogation of enemy combatants during an armed conflict. 5. Application of the Canons ofConstruction The assault, maiming; interstate stalking, and torture statutes discussed below are generally applicable criminal prohibitions, applying on their faces to ''whoever'' engages in the IS Congress enacted the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 to fill a jurisdictional gap. In a series of cases, .the Supreme Court held that the Constitution barred the nillitary from trying civilians accompanying the military in military courts during peacetime. See, e.g., Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957). Because of these decisions, ,and the frequent failure of other nations. to prosecute such individuals, persons employed by or\u00b7 accompanying the Armed Forces outside the United States often escaped prosecution for crimes committed on bases or against other U.S. nationals. See Military Extraterritorial lurisdictionAct of2000, H. Rep. No. 106-778(1), at lO\u00ad II (July 20,2000). See also H. R. Rep. No. 106-1048, at120 (2001); United States v. Gatlin, 216 F.3d 207, 209 (2d Cir. 2000). Though this gap was long recognized, see Gatlin, 216 F.3d at 208-09, it was not until 2000 that Congress closed it. UNCLASSIFIED SEC~T~lOJ?O~l 18 Conduct they proscribe. Each of the canons outlined above counsels against the application of these statutes to the conduct of the military during war. As we explained above, the application of these statutes to the President's conduct of the war would potentially infringe upon his power as Commander in Chief. Furthennore, the conduct at issue here--interrogations-is a core element of the military's ability to prosecute a war. As a general matter, we do not construe generally applicable criminal statutes to reach the conduct of the military during a war. Moreover, the application of these statutes to the conduct of the military during war would touch upon a prerogative of the sovereign, namely its discretion regarding the treatment ofunlawful belligerents.16 Congress has not provided a clear statement with respect to any of these statutes that would suggest that these canons of construction do not apply. Additionally, as we explained above, the UCMJ provides a specific statutory scheme that governs the conduct of the military. and as the more specific enactment it governs here. To be sure, section 2340 applies to individuals who are acting ''under color of law.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2340(1). As such, it applies to governmental actors and it could be argued that Congress enacted it with the intention of restricting the ability of the Anned Forces to interrogate enemy combatants during an armed conflict. We believe that these canons of construction . nevertheless counsel against the application of this statute to the conduct of the military during . the prosecution of a war. As we explained above; applying this statute to the President's conduct of the war would raise grave separation of powers concerns. Such a construction is unnecessary to give effect to the criminal prohibition .. Though we believe that the statute would not apply to the conduct of the military during the prosecution of a war,. it would reach the conduct of other .' governmental actors in peacetime ..We further note that where Congress intends to apply statutes to the conduct of our military it has done so far more clearly than by requiring the individuals act \"under color of law.\" For example, the War Crimes Statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2441 applies to the conduct \"any member of the Anned Forces of the United States.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2441 (b). Moreover, here, it is the UCMJ, a specific statutory scheme, that governs the conduct of the AnnedForces rather than this general statute. 6. Commander-in-Chief Authority Even if these statutes were misconstrued to apply to persons acting at the direction of the President during the conduct of war, the Departinent ofJustice could not enforce this law or aJ;1y of the othercrirninal statutes applicable to the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction against federal officials acting pursuant to the President's constitutional authority to direct a war. Even if an interrogation method arguably were to violate a criminal statute, the Justice Department . could not bring a prosecution because the statute w6uld be unconstitutional as applied in this context. This approach is consistent with previous decisions of our Office involving the . application. of federal criminal. law. For example, we have previously construed the congressional .contempt statute not to apply to executive branch officials who refuse to comply with' congressional subpoenas because of an assertion of executive privilege. In a published 1984 opinion,we concluded: 16 We emphasize that this opinion concerns the application of these statutes solely to the President's conduct of a war. We express no opinion as to their applicability outside ofthis context. UNCLASSIFIED 19 [l1f executive officials were subject to prosecution for criminal contempt whenever they carried out the President's claim of executive privilege, it would significantly burden and immeasurably impair the President's ability to fulfill his constitutional duties. Therefore, the separation of powers principles that underlie the doctrine of executive privilege also would preclude an application of the contempt of Congress statute to punish officials for aiding the President in asserting his constitutional privilege. Prosecution for Contempt of Congress of an Executive Branch Offical' Who Has Asserted A Claim ofExecutive Privilege, 8 Op. a.L.c. 101, 134(1984). Cf Shoot Down Memorandum at 163-64. And should the statute not be construed in this manner, our Office concluded that the Department of Justice could not enforce the statute against federal officials who properly execute the President's constitutional authority. \"The President, through a United States Attorney, need not, indeed may not, prosecute criminally a subordinate for. asserting on his behalf a claim of executive privilege. Nor could the Legislative Branch or the courts require or implement the prosecution of such an individual.\" 8 Gp. O.L.C. at 141: We opined that \"courts ... would surely conclude that a criminal prosecution for the' exercise of a presumptively valid, constitutionally based privilege is not consistent with the Constitution.\" Id. . We have even greater concerns with respect to prosecutions arising out of the exercise of the \u00b7President's express authority as Commander in Chief than we do with prosecutions arising out ofthe assertion of executive privilege. Any effort py Congress to regulate the interrogation of enemy combatants would violate the Constitution's sole vesting of the Commander-in-Chief authority in the President. There can be little doubt that intelligence operations, such as the detention and interrogation of enemy combatants and leaders, are both necessary and proper for the effective conduct of a military campaign. fudeed, such operations may be' of more importance in a war with an international terrorist organization than one with the conventional armed forces of a nation-state, due to the fonner's emphasis on covert operations and surprise attacks against civilians. It may be the case that only successful interrogations can provide the' infonnation necessary to prevent future attacks upon the United States and its citizens. Congress canno more interfere with thePresident's conduct oftheinterrogation ofenemy combatants than it can dictate strategic or tactical decisions on the battlefield. Just as statutes that order the President to conduct warfare in a certain manner or for specific goals would be unconstitutional, so' too are laws' that would prevent the President from gaining the intelligence he believes necessary to prevent attacks upon the United States. B. Special Maritime and Territorial Jurisdiction of the United States .1. Jurisdiction Before turning to the specific federal criminal statutes that may be relevant to the conduct of interrogations, we must. examine whether these statutes apply. Federal criminal statutes generally do not apply within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United states. See United States v. Bowman, 260 U.S. 94, 98 (1922). As noted above, this opinion '. addresses solely those alien enemy combatants held outside the United States. The application of federal criminal laws to the conduct of interrogations overseas is determined by the complex UNCLASSIFIED 20 interaction of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7 (2000 & West Supp. 2002) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3261 (2000), which is part ofthe Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000, Pub. L. No.1 06-523, 114 Stat. 2488 (2001). Section 7 defines the term \"special maritime and territorial jurisdiction,\" which we conclude includes permanent U.S. military bases outside the United States, like the U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay (\"GTMO\"). Section 3261\u00b7 defines military extraterritorial jurisdiction. We conclude that all persons who are neither members of the Armed Forces nor persons accompanying or employed by the Armed Forces are subject to the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States when they are in locations that Section 7 defmes as .part ofthatjurisdiction. Members oftheArmed Forces andpersons accompanying oremployed by them, however, are subject to a slightly different rule. Members of the Armed Forces are subject to military discipline under the DeMJ anyplace outside the United States for conduct that would constitute a felony if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Those accompanying or employed by the Armed Forces can be prosecuted in an Article ill court for their conduct outside the United States that would constitute a felony offense if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Finally, members of the Armed Forces and those accompanying or employed by the military are punishable for misdemeanor offenses in an Article ill court when they commit such offenses within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ofthe United States. As a general matter, GTMO and other U.S. military bases outside the United States fall within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.17 Section 7(9) of Title 18 of the U.S. Code provides, in relevant part, that the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ofthe United States includes: offenses committed by or against a national of the United States .., on the premises of United States ... military ... missions or entities in foreign States, including the buildings, parts of buildings, and land appurtenant or ancillary thereto or used for purposes of' those missions or entities, irrespective of ownership. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7(9)(A). 18 By its terms, this section applies to GTMO and other U.S. military bases in foreign states, although no court has interpreted the scope ofsection 7(9)'s reach. 19 . 17 The United States occupiesGTMO under a lease entered into with the Cuban Government in 1903 ..AgTeement Between the United States and Cuba for the Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval Stations, Feb. 16-23, 1903, U.S.\u00ad Cuba, alt. III, T.S. No. 418, 6 Bevans 1113. In 1934, the United States and Cuba entered into a new treaty that explicitly reaffirmed the continuing validity of the 1903 Lease of Lands Agreement. See Relations With Cuba, May 29,1934, U.S.-Cuba, T.S. No. 866, 6 Bevans 1161. 18 The USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No.107-56,g804, 115 Stat. 272, 377 (2001) amended the special maritime jurisdiction statute to include subsection 9. CongTess added this section to resolve a circuit split on the reach of section 7(3), which provides that the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States includes \"[aJny lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof, oranyplace purcbasedot otherwise acquired bytheUnited States byconsent ofthe legislature oftheState in which the same sh2.11 be, for the erection ofa fort, magazine, arsenal, other needful building.\" . U.S.C. was asto whether section 7(3) reached lands outside ofUnited States territory. Compare United Stntes v.Gatlin, 216 F.3d 207(2d Cir. 2000) (section 7(3) applies only to land acquired within U.S. territorial borders) with United States v. Erdos, 474 F.2d 157 (4th Cir. 1973) (section 7(3} covers American Embassy in Equatorial Guinea). See ProvidfAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (pATRIOn Act of2001, H.R. Rep. No. 107-236, pt. 1; at 74 (2001) (noting the circuit split and that \"[t]his [sub]section would UNCLASSIFIED 8BCRBT,e'f8FQ~T 21 ( Section 7(9) further provides that it \"does not apply with respect to an offense committed by a person described in\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3261(a). Persons described in section 3261(a) are those \u00abemployed by or accompanying the Armed Forces outside the United States\" or \"member[s] of the Armed Forces subject to chapter 47 oftitle 10 (the Unifonn Code of Military Justice),\" who engage in \"conduct outside the United States that would constitute an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year if the conduct had been engaged in within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States[.r Id. The interaction of section 7(9) and section 3261(a) in effect differentiates between three classes ofpersons: (1) all persons who are neither members of the Anned Forces nor persons accompanying or employed by the Armed Forces; (2) members of the Anned Forces subject to the UCMJ; (3) those persons employed by or accompanying the Armed Forces. First, those persons who are neither members of the Anned Forces nor are employed by or accompanying the Armed Forces are subject to prosecution for violations of federal criminal law when they are at a location that is included within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. Conversely, when the acts in question are committed outside of the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, these individuals are not subject to those federal criminal laws. So, for example,\u00b7 a federal, non-military officer who is conducting interrogations in a . foreign location, one that is not on a pennanent U.S. military base or diplomatic establishment, would not be subject to the federal crirninallaws applicable in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. . . The rules that apply to the second and third classes of persons are more complicated. Section 7(9), in conjunction with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3261, provides that members of the Armed Forces subject to the UCMJ are not within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction when they, wllileoutside the United States, engage in conduct that would constitute a felony if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. Section 3261(a) exempts such persons, however, only if their conduct constitutes a felony. If they were to commit a misdemeanor offense while stationed at GTMO, they would fall outside section 3261(a)'s exception and would be subject to the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. See 18 U.S.c. \u00a7 3261(a).2o. Section 7(9), in conjunction with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3261, likewise provides that those persons employed by or. accompanying members of the Armed Forces subject to the UeMJ are not within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States when they, while outside the United States, engage in conduct that would constitute a felony if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction.21 And, like members of the Anned Forces, if make it clear that embassies and embassy housing of the United States in foreign states are included in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ofthe United States.\"). 19 We express no opinion as to the full scope ofthe meaning of subsection (9)'.s phrase \"military. .. IllISS10ns or .entities.in foreign states.\" We simply note that it is clear that permanent U.S. military bases such as the one at GTMO fall within subsection (9). .. 20 Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a), any offense for which the maximum sentence is more than one year is defined as a felony. Offenses for which the maximum sentence is one year or less areclaSsified as misdemeanors. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a) (2000). . 21 The term \"accompanying the Armed Forces outside the United States\" is further defined by statute. Section 3267 defmes '~accompanying the Armed Forces outside the U~ted States\" as: . UNCLASSIFIED 22 such persons commit a misdemeanor offense while in an area that falls within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, they are within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. Although these two classes of persons are not within the special maritime and territorial .jurisdiction when they engage in conduct that would constitute a felony if engaged in within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, they are in fact punishable for such conduct when they are outside the United States-\u00b7 whether they are in an area that is otherwise part of the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction or elsewhere outside the United States, such as in a foreign state. Section 3261 (a) provides that when such persons are outside the United States and they engage in conduct thatwould be afelony ifcommitted inthe special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, those persons \"shall be punished as provided for that offense.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3261(a). Section 3261(a) therefore gives extraterritorial effect to the criminal prohibitions applicable to the speclal maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Thus, with respect to interrogations, memberS of the Armed Forces and those employed by or accompanying the . Anned Forces will be subject to the felony criminal prohibitions that apply in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction irrespective of whether the interrogations occur at, for example, a U.S. military base or at the military facilities ofa foreign state . .. Although members of the Armed Forces are to be punished for\u00b7 conduct that would constitute a felony if committed in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, they can only be prosecuted under the UCMJ for that conduct. Section 3261 prohibits the prosecution of members of the Armed Forces under the laws applicable to the special maritime and territorial . I . jurisdiction. For persons who are members of the Armed Forces subject to the UCMJ, section 3261 (d) provides that \"no prosecution may be commenced against\" them ''under section (A) A dependent of\u00ad (i) a member of the Armed Forces; (ii) a civilian employee of the Department Of Defense (includiIiga nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the Department); or\u00b7 . (iii) a Department of Defense contractor (including a subcontractor at any tier) or an employee ofa DepamnentofDefense contractor (including a subcontractor at any tier); (B) reSiding with such member, civilian employee, contractor,or contractor employee outside the United States; and . (C) not a national of or ordinarily resident in the host nation. 18 U.S.c. \u00a7 3267 (2000) . . Likewise, the statute also defines \"employed by the Armed forces.\" Section 3267(1) provides that this term includes those persons: . (A) employed as a civilian employee of the Department of Defense (including a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the Department), as a Department of Defense contractor (including a subcontractor at any tier), or as an employee of a Department of Defense contractor (including a subcontractor at any tier); (B) present or residing outside the United States in connection with such employment; and (C) not a national ofor ocdinarily resident in the host nation. /d. UNCLASSIFIED SECRiETRlOFOffii 3261(a).\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3261(d).22 Section 3261(d) is subject to two exceptions. First, the bar ( on prosecutions applies onJy so long as the member continues to be subject to the UCMJ. See 18 U.S.c. \u00a7 3261 (d)(1). Second, if \"an indictment or infOlmation charges that the member committed the offense with one or more other defendants, at least one of whom is not subject\" to the UCMJ, the bar does not apply. 18 U.S.c. \u00a7 3261(d)(2). In limited circumstances, namely in time of war, persons employed by or accompanying the Armed Forces are subject to the UCMJ . . See 10 U.S.c. \u00a7 802 (a)(II) (2000) (providing that \"persons serving with, employed by, or accompanying the armed forces outside the United States\" are subject to the UCMJ); Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957).23 Ifthe indictment charged that such persons committed the offense in wartime with members of the Anned Forces subject to the UCMJ, this bar on prosecution would not be removed for the member. The indictment would, for example, have to charge that .the member of the Armed Forces committed the offense with, for example, a government official not subject to the UCMJ (and not physicallyaccompanying the Armed Forces in the field) to survive. 2. Criminal Statutes Applicable in the Special Maritime and T~rritorial Jurisdiction of the United States Because the interaction of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7 and 18 U.s.C. \u00a7 3261(a) renders the criminal statutes that apply in special maritime and territorial jurisdiction applicable to the conduct of members of the Anned Forces, and those accompanying or employed by the Anned Forces, we have examined below the criminal statutes that could conceivably cover interrogation conduct. Specifically, we have addressed: assault, 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 113; maiming, U.S.c. \u00a7 2261A. Of course, as we explained above, various canons of construction preclude the application of these laws to authorized military interrogations of alien enemy combatants during wartime. . 22 Section 3261 ensures that the military can prosecute its members under the UCMJ. Section 3261 (c) makes clear that neither section 3261 (d)'s bar nor any other portion ofthe statute precludes proceeding against persons covered by section 3261(a) in a military commission. It provides that \"[nJothing in this chapter may be construed to deprive a court-martial, military commission, provost court, or other military tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by a court-martial, military conunission, ~rovost court, or other military 802(a)(I0), which provides that persons subject to the UCMJ includes \"[iJn time of war, persons serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field,\" we opined that \"in time of war\" meant both declared and undeclared wars, we found that due to ambiguity in the case law we could not predict whether the Court. of Military Appeals or the Supreme Court would agree with our reading \u00b7of the phrase. See Memorandum for William J. Haynes, TI, General Counsel, Department of Defense, from John C. Yoo, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Re: Possible Criminal Charges Against American Citizen Who Was a Member ojthe Al Qaeda Terrorist Organization or the TaIiban Militia at 18 (Dec. 21, 2001). . Additionally, we note that with respect to meaning of the term \"employed by. or accompanying the Armed Forces,\" we have construed those terms to have essentially the same meaning as that which 18U.S.C. \u00a7 3267 provides. Specifically, we have opined that . \"the phrase 'employed by or accompanying' is a well understood reference to civilian employees \u00b7of the military establishment and to the dependents of military personneL\" Memorandum for Fred M. Vinson, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division from Frank M. Wozencraft, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: H.R. //244, A Bill To Amend Title /8 ojthe United States Code to Give UnitedStates District Courts Jurisdiction ojCertain Offenses Committed by Americans Outside The United States. andfor Other PUfposes (Aug. 23,1967). It is, however, unclear whether the meaning of \"employed by the armed forces\" for purposes ofthe UCMJ extends to I;>epartment of Defense contractors as does section 3267. UNCLASSIFIED 24 a. Assault Section 113 of Title 18 ~roscribes assault within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. 4 Although section 113 does not define assault, courts have construed the tenn \"assault\" in accordance with its common law meaning. See, e.g., United States v. Estrada-Fernandez, 150 F.3d 491, 494 n.1 (5th Cir. 1998); v. Juvenile\u00ad Male, 930 F.2d 727, 728 (9thCif; 1991). At common law, an assault is an attempted battery or an act that puts another person in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm. See, e.g., United States v. Bayes, 210 F.3d 64, 68 (lst Cir. 2000). Section 113, as we explain below, sweeps more broadly than the. common law definition of simple assault and sweeps within its ambit acts that would at common law constitute battery. We analyze below each form of assault section 113 proscribes. First, we begin with the least serious forID. of assault: simple assault, which section \u00b7\u00b71l3(a)(5) proscribes.25 This form of assault includes attempted battery. See, e.g., United States . v. Dupree, 544 F.2d 1050 (9th Cir. 1976).26 Courts have employed various formulations of what constitutes an attempted battery. By the far most common fonnulation is that attempted battery .is \"a willful attempt to inflict injury upon the person of another.\" United States v. Fallen, 256 24 18 U.S.c.\u00a7 113 provides in full: . (a) Whoever, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, is guilty of an assault shall be punished as follows: (1) Assault with intent to commit murder, by imprisonment for not more than twenty years. / (2) Assault with intent to commit any felony, except murder or a felony under chapter 109A, by a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both. (3) Assault with a dangerous weapon, with intent to do bodily harm, and without just cause or excuse, by a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both. (4) Assault by striking, beating, or wounding, by a fme under this title Or hnprisonment for not more than six months, or both. . (5) Simple assault, by a fme under this title or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both, or ifthe victim of the assault is an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years, by fme under this title or imprisonment for not more than I year, or both. (6) Assault result:ing in serious bodily injury, by a fme under this title or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both. . (7) Assault resulting in substantial bodily injury to an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years, by fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both. (b) As used in this subsection\u00ad (1) the term \"substantial bodily injury\" means bodily injury which involves\u00ad . (A) a temporary but substantial disfigurement; or (B) a temporary but substantial loss. or impairment oftbe function ofany bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; and . (2) the term \"serious bodily injury\" has the meaning given that term in section 13(i5 ofthis title. 25 Simple assault carries a penalty of not more than six months' imprisonment, a fine, or both. If, however, the victim under age 16, the defendant faces a penalty of up to one year's imprisonment, a fine, or both. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(5). . . 26 As the Seventh Circuit has exJ5lained, this latter type of assault is drawn from tort law. See United States v. Bell, 505 F.2d 539,540-41 (7th Cir. 1974). See also laFave at 746 (same). SECREM10FO:Rl>1 UNCLASSIFIED 25 F.3d 1082, 1088 (11 th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1170 (2002). See United States v. McCulligan, 256 F.3d 97, 102-03 (3d Cir. 2001) (same); Juvenile Male, 930 at 728 (same). An assault at common law does not require actual physical contact. Ifthe defendant does make such contact, it does not preclude a charge of simple assault. See Dupree, 544 F.2d at 1052 (\"[A]n assault is an attempted battery and proof of a battery will support conviction of assault\"); Cf Bayes, 210 F.3d at 69 (\"in a prosecution for simple assault ... , it is sufficient to show that the defendant deliberately touched another in a patently offensive manner without justification or excuse\"). The attempted battery form of assault is, like all other forms of attempt, a specific intent crime. See Wayne R. Lafave and Austin W. Scott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 7.16, at 312 (1986) (\"Lafave & Scott\"). Thus, the defendant must have specifically intended to commit a battery-i.e., he must have specifically intended to \"to cause physical injury to the victim.\" See id: Some courts construe that physical injury to extend to offensive touchings. An offensive touching can be anything from attempting to spit on someone to trying to touch someone's buttocks. See Bayes, 210 Frizzi,491 F.2d 1231, 1232 (1st Cir. 1974). See also United States v. Whitefeather, 275 F.3d 741, 743 (8th Cir. 2002) (urinating on victim was an offensive touching). And as one ofthe leading commentators explains, \"[a]n attempt to commit any crime requires that the attempting party come pretty dose to committing it.\" Wayne R. Lafave, Criminal Law, \u00a7 7.16, at 745 (3d ed. 2000) (\"Lafave\"). In the context of interrogations, if, for example, an interrogator attempted to slap the detainee, such an act would constitute simple assault. On the other hand, changing the detainee's environment such as by alteling the lighting or temperature would not constitute simple assault. Simple assault also includes the placement of another in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm. To convict a defendant of this type of assault, the prosecution must establish that: (1) the defendant intended to cause apprehension of immediate bodily harm; (2) the victim actually experienced such apprehension; and (3) the defendant engaged in some conduct that reasonably arouses such apprehension. See, e.g.,\u00b7 United States v. Skeet, 665 F.2d 983, 986-87 (9th Cir. 1982) (defendant's actions must actually cause victim apprehension); United States v. Sampson, No. 00-50689, 2002 WL 1478552, at *2 (9th Cir. July 10, 2002) (where defendant's firing ofa gun failed to frighten police officer because he had not heard the gun fire or seen the defendant fire the gun the defendant had not committed simple assault); Lafave, \u00a7 7.16, at 747.27 In interrogating a detainee, if interrogators were to, for example, show a detainee a device for electrically shocking him and to threaten to use it should he refuse to . diVUlge information, such an action would constitute this type of assault. In so doing, the . interrogator would haveintended to cause apprehension of immediate bodily harm, it would have been reasonable for the detainee to exp~rience such apprehension, and more than likely he would have experienced such apprehension. Second, section 113(a)(4) proscribes assault by \"striking, beating, or wounding.,,28 This crime requires only general intent. . See, e.g., United States V. Felix, 996 F.2d 203, 207 (8th Cir. 27. Some courts have labeled this requirement of reasonable apprehension as the requirement that the defendant had the \"present apparent ability\" to inflict harm. See Fallen, 256 F.3d at 1088 (defendant's \"repeated assertion that he had a gun and was willing to use it\" sufficed to establish that the defendant bad the \"present apparent ability\" to harm victim). Under either formulation, the inquiry is still one that looks to whether the circumstances would have caused a reasonable person to thirilc that the defendant would harm her. 28 This form of assault carries a penalty of up to six months' irnprisonment,a fine, or both. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(4). UNCLASSIFIED SBeRBTRfOPO~l gI5CIlE'f~JQFORf'J 26 1993) (general intent crime). Courts have construed this section to preclude essentially what at common law would have been simple battery. See, e.g., United States v. Chavez, 204 F.3d 1305, 1317 (lIth Cir. 2000); United States v. Duran, 127 F.3d911, 915 (lOth Cir. 1997). By contrast to the simple assault section 113(a)(5) proscribes, this subsection requires that a defendant make physical contact with the victim. See Estrada-Fernandez, 150 F.3d at 494; United States v. Johnson, 637 F.2d 1224; 1242 n.26 (9th Cir. 1980). Notably, however, assault by striking, beating, or wounding \"requires no particular degree of severity in the injury\" to the victim. Felix 996 F.2d at 207. See Chavez, 204 F.3d at 1317 (same). Because this section requires '. . physical contact, interrogation methods that do not involve physical contact will not run afoul of this section. Before turning to the remaining types of assault that section 113 proscribes, it bears noting that both simple assault and assault by striking, beating or wounding are punishable by a maximum sentence of six months' imprisonment, a fine, or both. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(5); id. \u00a7 113(a)(4)?9 Because the maximum sentence for each of these crimes is less than a year, .charges brought against a member ofthe Armed Forces subject to the UCMJ or tho.se employed by or accompanying the Anned Forces for either of these crimes would not bring that member within the scope of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3261(a). As a reSUlt, a member of the Anned Forces engaging in such conduct at a military base, such as GTMO, would be within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States and could be prosecuted for this offense.in an Article ill court, subject, of co~se, to any defenses or any protections stemming from the exercise of the President's constitutional authority. If, however, members of the Armed Forces were engaging in such conduct on a foreign state's military base, they would not be covered by 3261(a) nor would they be within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction.\u00b7 The remaining types of assault prohibited under section 113(a) addressed below would, however, bring a member of the Armed Forces or someone employed by or accompanying the Armed Forces squarely within section 3261(a).. . Section 113 proscribes assault resulting in \"serious bodily injury\" and assault resulting in \"substantial bodily injury to an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(6);id. \u00a7 I 13(a)(7). These crimes are general intent crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Belgard, 894 F.2d 1092, 1095 n.l (9th Cir. 1990); Felix, 996 F.2d at 207. To establish assault resuItingin serious bodily injury, the prosecution must prove that the defendant \"assault[ed] the victim and that the assault happen[ed] to result\" in the necessary level of injury. United States v. Davis, 237 F.3d 942, 944 (8th Cir. 2001). \"Serious bodily injury\" is defined as ''bodily injury which involves ... a substantial risk of death; ... extreme physical pain; ... protracted and obvious disfigurement; or : .. protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental given that term in section 1365 of thistitle.\").3o By contrast, section 113(b)(l) defines \"substantial bodily injury\" as ''bodily injury which involves .. 29 If, however, an individual were charged with the simple assault of a person \"who\u00b7 has not attained the age of 16 years,\" thafindividual would face a maximum sentence of up to one year in prison. This charge still would riot bring a member of the Armed Forces or those accompanying or employed by the Armed Forces within section 3261(a)'s coverage because the conduct must constitute an offense punishable by moreJhan a year in prison. 30 18 U.S.C. (2) \"physical pain\"; (3) \"illness\"; (4) \"impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or. mental faculty\"; (5) \"or any other injury to the body no matter how temporary.\" UNCLASSIFIED 27 S:E\u20acRiET~TQFOIl:JT . a temporary or substantial disfigurement; or ... a temporary but substantial loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.\" Id. \u00a7 113(b)(1). Thus, an assauH resulting in serious bodily injury requires a more severe injury, that in some instances may have a more lasting impact on the victim than that which might be considered \"substantial bodily injury.\" No court has definitively addressed the minimum thresholds of injury necessary to rise to the level of \"substantial bodily injury\" or \"serious bodily injury,\" respectively. Nonetheless, reported opinions regarding these crimes offer some idea as to the severitY and type of injuries that would be sufficient to establish violations of these subsections. With respect to substantial bodily injury, for example, a defendant was convicted of assault resulting in substantial bodily injury for injuries to the victim that included: fracturing the victim's skull, burning his face, and biting him, which left a human bite mark on the victim's leg. See United States v. Brown, 287 F.Jd 684, 687 (8th Cir. 2002). And in In re Murphy, No. 98-M-168, 1998 WL 1179109 (W.D.N.Y. June 30, 1998), the magistrate concluded that \"a loss of cC,msciousness and a two-day stay in the sick room could qualify as allegations of substantial bodily injury.\" Id. at *6. With . respect\"to serious bodily injury, evidence establishing that the victim's cheekbone and eye socket were fractured, and a large laceration created, requiring. the victim to undergo\u00b7 reconstructive surgery and leaving her suffering from a permanent disfigurement, established that she had suffered serious bodily injury. See United States v. Waloke, 962 F.2d 824, 827 (8th Cir. 1992). . With respect to \"serious bodily injury,\" in United States v. Dennison, 937 F.2d 559 (lOth Cir. 1991), the Tenth Circuit concluded that the infliction of seven lacerations over the victim's neck and chest that required extensive suturing'andhad produced scarring \"involve[ing) a 's~bstantial risk of ... protracted and obvious disfigurement. '\" Id. at 562. And in United States v. Brown, 276 F.3d 930 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 126 (2002), the Seventh Circuit concluded that the tearing of a muscle in the victim's calf and leg that required hospitalization and crutches did not constitute protracted loss or impainnent of the function of the leg nor did it cause disfigurement within the meaning of section 1365(g). See id. at 931-32. Nonetheless, the) court . c,oncluded that because the victim had suffered from extreme pain for eight days due to the injuries sustained to his leg, he had suffered serious bodily injury. See id. It bears emphasizing that for the purposes of sections 113(a)(6) and 113(a)(7)the concepts of serious bodily injury and substantial bodily injury include injury to an individual's mental faculties. See, e.g., United States v. Lowe, 145 F;3d 45, 53 (1st Cir. 1998); 18 U.S.c. \u00a7 113(b)(l)(B); id. \u00a7 1365(g)(3).We havenot, however, found any reported cases in which a mental hann absent physical contact constituted assault. For example, in Lowe, the only reported\u00b7 case in which mental harm fulfilled the serious bodily injury requirement for the purposes of assault under this section, the defendant kidnapped and raped the victim and this physical brutality caused her mental hann. See id. at 48.\u00b7 W~ note that with the exception of the undefined reference to \"mental faculties,\" all of the injuries described in the statute connote some (and more likely extensive) physical contact with the victim. In defining substantial bodily\u00b7 injury, for example, the statute speaks in terms of disfigurement, or loss of the function of some bodily member or organ. In the case of serious bodily injury, the statute reaches more serious injuries to include those injuries that bear a substantial risk of death, result in extreme physical pain, as well as protracted disfigurement or the impairment of a bodily member or organ. The \"impairment\" of one's \"mental faculty\" might be construed in light of the obvious physical UNCLASSIFIED 28 SECRliJTA>TOPOR!>T contact required for all other injuries listed in the statute. Moreover, these crimes must be construed consistently with the common law definitions of assault and battery. Simple assault, as we explained above, is a specific intent crime and requires no physical contact. By contrast, battery is a general intent crime and requires physical contact. Courts have construed assault resulting in serious bodily harm to require only general intent, rendering it akin to battery in that regard and thereby suggesting that it too requires actual physical contact. Indeed, the only other general intent crime under section 113 is assault by striking, beating, or wounding. Courts have construed that form of assault to be the equivalent of simple battery, requiring actual physical contact as an element. Thus, given the requisite intent and remainder of the other injuries that constitute serious bodily injury or substantial bodily injury, we believe the better view of these fonns of assault is that they require actual physical contact. Indeed, no court has found mental . harm in the absence of physical contact sufficient to satisfy the requisite injury. Nonetheless, we cannot conclude with certainty that no court would make such a finding. In the context of interrogations, we believe that interrogation methods that do not involve physical contact will not support a charge of assault resulting in substantial injury or assault resulting in serious bodily injury or substantial bodily injury. Moreover, even minimal physical contact, such as poking, slapping, or shoving the detainee, is unlikely. to produce the injury necessary to establish either one of these types of assault. . Section 113(a)(3) prohibits \"assault with a dangerous weapon, with intent to do bodily harm, and without just cause or excuse.\" To establish this type of assault, the prosecution must prove that the defendant \"(1) assaulted the victim (2) with a dangerous weapon (3) with the intent to do bodily harm.\" Estrada-Femandez, 150 F.3d at 494. -See also United States v. Gibson, 896 F.2d 206, 209 (6th Cir. 1990) (to establish assault with a dangerous weapon, the prosecution must establish that the defendant acted with the specific intent to commit bodily. harm). It does not, however, require the defendant to make physical contact with the victim. See Estrada-Fernandez, 150 F.3d at 494; United States v. Duran, 127 F.3d 911 (10th Cir. 1997). It is also therefore not necessary for the victirri to have suffered actual bodily injury. See United States v: Phelps, 168 F.3d 1048, 1056 (8th Cir.1999) (\"The government is required to present sufficient evidence only that the appellant\u00b7 assaulted the victim with an object capable of inflicting bodily injury, and not that the victim actually suffered bodily injury as a result of the assault.\") (emphasis added).. Although the statutory text provides that this type of assault must be committed ''without just cause or excuse,\" courts have held that the prosecution is not required to establish the absence ofjust cause or excuse. Instead; these are affinnative defenses for which the defendant bears the burden. See United States v. Guilbert, 692 F.2d 1340, 1343 (11 655 F.2d \u00b7792, 793 (7th Cir. 1981); Hockenberry v. United States, 422 F.2d 171, 173 (9th Cir. 1970); United States v. Peters, 476 F. Supp. 259, 262 (B.D. Wis. 1979). See . also United States v. Jackson, No. 99-4388, 2000WL 194284, at *2 (4th Cir. Feb. 18, 2000) (unpublished opinion) (following Guilbert).)) .. . 31 Although it could be argued that this subsection's express mention of \"just cause or excuse\" indicate that such defenses are not available with respect to the other types of assault WIder section 113, we believe that the better view is that these aff1l111ative defensesY-emain available. As we explain infra Part IV, absent a clear statement eliminating such defenses, they remain available. UNCLASSIFIED 29 An item need not fall within the classic examples of dangerous weapons-e.g., a knife or a gun-to constitute a \"dangerous weapon\" for the purposes of section 113(a)(3). Instead, the touchstone for whether an object is\u00b7 a \"dangerous weapon\" is whether it has been used in a manner likely to cause serious injury. See Guilbert, 692 F.2d at 1343; United States v. LeCompte, 108 F.3d 948 (8th Cir. 1997); United States v. Bey, 667 F.2d 7, 11 (5th Cir. 1982) (\"[W]hat constitutes a dangerous weapon depends not on the nature of the obj ect itself but on its capacity, given the manner of its use to endanger life or inflict great bodily harm.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). See also United States v. Riggins, 40 F.3d 1055, 1057 (9th Cit. 1994) (quoting Guilbert with approval). For example, courts have found that a telephone receiver and\u00b7 a broom handle can be, under certain circumstances, \"dangerous weapons.\" F.3d . 491 (broom or mop handle). For that matter, a speeding car could constitute a dangerous weapon. See United States v. Gibson, 896 F.2d 206, 209 nJ (6th Cir. 1990). At a minimum, however, it requires that a defendant employ some object as a dangerous weapon. Ultimately, whether or not an item constitutes a dangerous weapon is a question of fact for a jury. See Riggins, 40 F.3d at 1057; Phelps, 168 F.3d at 1055; As the Fourth Circuit has explained, \"[t]he test of whether a particular object was used as a dangerous weapon is not so mechanical that it .can be readily reduced to a question of law. Rather, it must be left to the jury to\u00b7 detennine whether, under the circumstances of each case, the defendant used some instrumentality, [or] object, ... to cause death or serious injury.\" United States v. Sturgis, 48F.3d 784, 788 (4th Cir. 1995).32 Here, so long as the interrogation method does not involve a dangerous weapon, this type of assault has not been committed. Physical contact would be insufficient to demonstrate this type of assault. Methods of interrogation that involve alterations to the detainee's cell environment would not be problematic under this section, not only because no dangerous weapon would have been used, but also because such alterations are unlikely to involve the necessary intent to inflict bodily injury. Finally, section 113 prohibits assault with intent to commit murder and assault with the .intent to commit any other felony except murder or sexual abuse crimes?3 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(1)-(2). Both of these crimes are specific intent crimes-the former requiring that the individual specifically intend to commit murder and the latter requiring the intent to commit a felony, such as maiming or torture. See, e.g., United States v. Perez, 43 F.3d 1131, 1137-38 (7th Cir. 1994). See also 18\u00b7 U.S.C. \u00a7. 114 (prohibiting maiming within the special maritime jurisdiction); id. \u00a7 2340A (prohibiting torture outside the United States). Although neither of these crimes requires actual physical contact with the victim, demonstrating the requisite intent may be more difficult to establish absent such contact. Here, as long as the interrogators do not intend to murder the detainee, they will not have run afoul of section 113(a)(l). Moreover, as to\u00b7 32 We note that one court has construed \"dangerous weapon\" to include the use ofone's body parts. In Sturgis, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the defendant's teeth .and mouth constituted a dangerous weapon where ail mv positive inmate bit the officer man effort to infect the officer with HIV and the bites inflicted wounds that bled \"profusely.\" 48 F.3d at 788. 33 Assault with intent to commit murder carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(1). Assault with the intent to commit any other felony may be punished by up to 10 years' imprisonment, a fine, or both. See id. \u00a7 113(a)(2). UNCLASSIFIED 6~CRST/i>lOFO~f 30 section 113(a)(2), the intent to torture appears to be the most relevant. As we will explain infra Part II.C.2, to satisfy this intent element, the interrogator would have to intend to cause other severe physical pain or suffering or to cause prolonged mental harm. Absent such intent, the interrogator would not have committed assault with intent to torture. We caution, however, that specific intent, as will be discussed in more detail in Part II.C.2., can be inferred from the factual circumstances. See also United States v. Hinton, 31 F.3d 817, 822 (9th Cir. 1994).34 b.Maiming Another criminal statute applicable in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction is -18 U.S.C. \u00a7 114. Section 114 makes it a crime for an individual (1) ''with the intent to torture (as defined in section 2340), maim, or disfigure\" to (2) \"cut[], bite[], or slit[] the nose, ear, or lip, or cut[] out or disable[] the tongue, or put[] out or destroy[] an eye, -orcut[] offor disable[] a limb or any member of another person.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 -114. It further prohibits individuals from \"throw[ing]or pour[ing] upon another person-any scalding water, corrosive acid, or caustic substance\" with like intent. Id.35 - _ - \u00ad The offense requires the specific intent to torture, maim or disfigure. See United States v. Chee, No. 98-2038, -1999 WL 261017 at *3 (lOth Cir. May 3, 1999) (maiming is a specific intent crime) (unpublished opinion); see also United States v. Salamanca, 990 F.2d 629, 635 (D.c. Cir. 1993) (where defendant inflicted \"enough forceful blows to split open [the victim's] skUll, shatter his eye socket, knock out three of his teeth, and break his jaw\" requisite specific intent had been established;). Moreover, the defendant's method of maiming must be one of the types the statute specifies-i.e., cutting, biting, slitting, cutting out, disabling, or putting out-and the injury must be to a body part the statute specifies-i.e., the nose, ear, lip, tongue, eye, or limb. See United States v. Stone, 472 F.2d 909, 915 (5th Cir. 1973). Similarly, the second set of acts applies to a very narrow band of conduct. It applies only to the throwing or pouring of some sort of scalding, corrosive, or caustic substance. See id. 34 Although section 113 appears to encompass a wide range of conduct, particularly simple assault and assault by striking, beating or wounding, we note that there are no reported cases in which section II3 charges haVt; been brought against a federal officer-FBI, DEA,correctional officer or any other federal officer. Certainly, in the course of completing their duties, federal officers will invariably at some point touch or attempt to touch individuals in a way that they would view as offensive, such as during the course of an arrest or in restraining an unruly inmate. Nonetheless, charges are not brought against officers for such conduct. For reasons explained in Part n.A., such actions by officers are not acts that we view as criminal. -35 Section 114 provides in full: Whoever, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ofthe United States, and with intent to torture (as defined in section 2340), maim, or disfigure, cuts,bites, or slits the nose, ear, or lip, or cuts out or disables the tongue, or puts out or destroys an eye, or cuts offor disables a limb or any member of another person; or Whoever, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ofthe United States, and with like intent, throws or pours upon another person, any scalding water, corrosive acid, or caustic substance---' = Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both. UNCLASSIFIED --31 Here, so long as the interrogation methods under contemplation do not involve the acts enumerated in section 114, the conduct of those interrogations will not fall within the purview of this statute. Because the statute requires specific intent, i.e., the intent to maim, disfigure or torture, the absence ofsuch intent is a complete defense to a charge ofmaiming. c. Interstate Stalking Section 2261A of Title 18 prohibits \"[w]hoever ... travels in interstate or foreign commerce or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ofthe United States ... with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person, and in the course of, or asa result of, such travel places that person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to that person.,,36 Thus, there are three elements to a violation ofsection 2261A: (1) the defendant traveled in interstate or foreign commerce or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction; (2) he did so with the intent to injure, haraSs, intimidate another person; (3) the person he intended to harass or injure was reasonably placed in fear of death or serious bodily injury, as a result of that travel. See United States v. AI-Zubaidy, 283 F.3d 804, 808 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 2638(2002). To establish the first element, the prosecution need only show that the defendant engaged in interstate .travel. Section 2261A also applies to \"travel[] ... within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\" .18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(l) (emphasis added). See also' National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, H. Conf. Rep. No. 104-724, at 793 (1996) (the statute was intended to apply to \"any incident of stalking involving interstate 36 Section 2261A provides in full: Whoever\u00ad (1) travels in interstate or foreign commerce or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ofthe United States, or enters or leaves Indian country, with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person, and in the course of, or as a result of, such travel places that person in reasonable fear ofthe death of, orsenous bodily injury to, that person, a member of the immediate family (as defined in section 115) of that person, or the spouse.or intimate partner ofthat person; or (2) with the intent\u00ad (A) to kill or injure a person in another State or tribal jurisdiction or within the special maritime and'territorial jurisdiction ofthe United States; or (B) to place a person in another State or tribal jurisdiction, or within the special maritime and territorial juri.!;diction ofthe United States, in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to\u00ad (i) that person; (ii) a member ofthe immediate family (as defmed in section 115) of that person; or (iii) a spouse or intimate partner of that person, uses the mail or any facility ofinterstate orforeign commerce to engage in a course of conduct that places that person in reasonable fear .of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, any ofthe persons described in clauses (i) through (iii), shall be punished as provided in section 226l(b).\u00b7 SECMT;~JOFORi>J UNCLASSIFIED 32 movement or which occurs on federal property\"). Thus, travel simply within the special ( maritime and territorial jurisdiction satisfies this element. As a result, proof that an individual traveled within a military base in a foreign state would be sufficient to establish this element. To establish the requisite intent, the prosecution must demonstrate that the defendant undertook the travel with the specific intent to harass, or intimidate another. See Al-Zubaidy, 283 F.3d at 809 (the defendant \"must have intended to harass or injure [the victim] at the time he crossed the state line\"). Thus, for example, a member of the Armed Forces who traveled to a base solely pursuant to his orders to be stationed there, and subsequently came to be involved in . the interrogation of operatives, would hick the requisite intent. He would have traveled for the purpose of complying with his orders but not for the purpose of harassment. Nevertheless, because travel within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction is also covered, the intent to travel within that base for the purpose ofintimidating or harassing another person would satisfy the intent element. In detennining whether the third element has been demonstrated, a court will look to the defendant's entire course of conduct. See id. This third element is not fulfilled by the mere act of travel itself. See United States v. Crawford, No. OO...;CR...;59-B-S, 2001 WL 185140, at *2 (D. Me. Jan. 26, 2001) (\"A plain reading ofthe statute makes clear that the statute requires the actor to place the victim in reasonable fear, rather than, as Defendant would have it, that his travel place the victim in reasonable fear.\"). Additionally,serious bodily injury has the same meaning as it does for assault resulting in serious bodily injury. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2266(6} (for the purposes of section 2261A U[t]he term 'serious bodily injury' has id. \u00a7 113 (section 1365 defines \"serious bodily injury\" for the purposes of \"assault resulting in serious bodily injury\"). Thus, an individual must have a reasonable fear of death or a reasonable fear of \"bodily injury which involves ... a substantial risk of death; ... extreme physical pain ... protracted and obvious disfigurement; or ... protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.\" Id. \u00a7 1365(g).37 C. Criminal Prohibitions Applicable to Conduct Occurring Outside the Jurisdiction Qf th e United States There are two criminal prohibitions !bat apply to the conduct of U.S. persons outside the United States: the War Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2441, and the prohibition against torture, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 234D-2340A. . We conclude that the War Crimes Act does not apply to the interrogation of al Qaeda and Taliban detainees because, as illegal belligerents, they do not qualify for the legal protections under the Geneva or Hague Conventions that section 2441 enforces. In regard to section 2340, we conclude that the statute, by its terms, does not apply to .interrogations conducted within the territorial United States or on permanent military bases outside the territory of the United States. Nonetheless, we identify the relevant substantive 37 The use ofsuch interrogation techniques as alterations in the lighting, e.g., around the clock lighting of the cell, or changes in the detainee's diet, e.g., using something akin to the Nutraloaf used in prisons, could not be said to reasonably cause a detainee'to fear for his life or to fear that he will suffer serious bodily injury. It is\u00b7 important, however, to bear in mind that the entire course of the interrogations must be examined to detennine whether the person has been reasonably placed in fear of death or serious bodily injury . .UNCLASSIFIED SEC~Ml0'FORM 33 standards regarding the prohibition on torture should interrogations occur outside that jurisdictional limit. 1. War Crimes Section 2441 of Title 18 criminalizes the commission of war crimes by U.S. nationals and members of the U.S. Anned Forces.38 It criminalizes such conduct whether it occurs inside or outside the United States, including conduct within the. special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. See id. \u00a72441(a). Subsection (c) of section 2441 defines \"war crimes\" as (1) grave breaches of any of the Geneva Conventions; (2) conduct prohibited by certain provisions of the Hague Convention N, Hague Convention N Resp~cting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Oct.18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277;39 or (3) conduct that constitutes a violation of conunOn Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. We have previously concluded that this statute does not apply to conduct toward the members of al Qaeda and the Taliban. See Treaties and Laws Memorandum at 8-9. We reached this conclusion because we found al Qaeda to be a non\u00ad governmental terrorist organization whose members are not legally entitled to the protections of 38 Section 2441 providesin full: (a) Offense.~Whoever, whether inside or outside the United States, commits a war crime, in any of the circumstances described in subsection (b), shall be fmed under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years, or both, and if death results to the victim, shall also be subject to the penalty of death. (b) Circumstances.-The circumstances referred to in subsection (a) are that the person committing such war crime or the victim of such war crime is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a national ofthe United States (as defmed in section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act). (c) Defmition.-As used in this section the term 'war crime' means any conduct\u00ad (1) defined as a grave breach in any ofthe.intemational conventions signed at Geneva 12 August 1949, or any protocol to such convention to which the United States is a party; (2) prohibited by Article 23, 25, 27, or 28 ofthe Annex to the Hague Convention IV, Respecting the Laws and Customs ofWar on Land. signed 18 October 1907; (3) which constitutes a violation ofcommon Article 3 ofthe international conventions signed at . Geneva, 12 August 1949, or any protocol to such convention to which the United States is a party and which deals with non\u00b7 international armed conflict; or (4)ofaperson who, inrelation toanarmed conflict and contrary totheprovisions oftheProtocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices as amended at Geneva on 3 May 1996 (protocol II as amended on 3 May 1996), when the United States isa party to such Protocol, willfully kills or causes serious injury to civilians. w\u00b7lth respect to the Hague Convention IV, section 244 I(c)(2) criminalizes conduct barred by artiCles 23, 25,27, 28, ofthe Annex to the Hague Convention IV, Under the Hague Convention, the conduct in these articles, like all of the regulations the Annex contains, is prohibited solely as between parties to the Convention. Hague Convention IV, art. 2 (\"The provisions contained in the Regulations referred to in Article 1,as well as in the present Convention, do Dot apply except between Contracting Powers, and then only if all the belligerents are parties to the Convention.\"). Since Afghanistan is nota party to the Hague Convention IV, no argument could be made that the Convention covers the Taliban. As a non-state, al Qaeda is likewise not a party to the Hague Convention IV. Moreover, Hague Convention IV requires that belligerents meet the same requirements that they must meet in order to receive the protections of GPW, which al Qaeda,and the Taliban do not meet. Thus, conduct toward enemy combatants in the current war would not fall within the conduct proscribed by these articles. UNCLASSIFIED 8ECR:ETf1l10FO~1 39 34 GPW. Since its members cannot be considered to be paws under the Convention, conduct toward members of al Qaeda could not constitute a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2441(c)(I). We further found that common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions covers either traditional wars between state parties to the convention or non-international civil wars, but not an international conflict with a non~govemmental terrorist organization. As a result, conduct toward members of al Qaeda could not constitute a violation of common Article 3, see Treaties and Law Memorandum at 9, and thus could not violate Section 2441 (c)(3). We also concluded that the President had reasonable grounds to find that the Talibanhad failed to meet the requirements for POW status under GPW. See Memorandum for Alberto R. Gonzales, Counsel to the President, from Jay S. Bybee, Assistant Attorney General, Re: Status of Taliban Forces Under Article 4 ofthe Third Geneva Convention of1949 at 3 (Feb. 7, 2002). On February 7, 2002, the President determined that these treaties did not protect either the Taliban or al Qaeda.\u00b7 See Statement by White House Press\u00b7 Secretary Ari Fleischer, available at http://www.us-mission.chlpress2002/0802fleischerdetainees.htm (Feb. 7, 2002).40 Thus, section 2441 isinapplicable toconduct toward members ofthe Talib~ or al Qaeda. We further note that the Treaties and Law Memorandum is the Justice Department's binding interpretation of the War Crimes Act, and it will preclude any prosecution under it for conduct toward members of the Taliban and al Qaeda. See Letter for William H. Taft, N, Legal Adviser, Department of State, from John C. Yoo, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and Robert J. Delahunty, Special Counsel, Office of Legal Counsel (Jan. 14,2002). 2. 18 U.S.c. \u00a7\u00a7 234G-2340A Section 2340A of Title 18 makes it a criminal.offense for any person \"outside the United States [to] comrni t[] or attempt[] to commit torture ..,.41 The statute defines ''the United States\" as \"all areas under the jurisdiction of the United States including any of the places described in\" 18 U.S.C. Therefore, to the that . 40 See also Fact Sheet: Status ofDetainees at Guantana~o available at http://www .whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020207 -13.html. 41 If convicted of torture, a defendant faces a fine or up to twenty years' imprisonment or both. If, however, the act resulted in the victim's death, adefendant may be sentenced to life imprisonment or to death. See 18 U.S.CA. \u00a7 2340A(a). Whether death results from the act also affects the applicable statute of limitations. Where death does . not result, the statute of limitations is eight years; ifdeath results, there is no statute of limitations. See U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3286(b) (West 2002). Section 2340A as originally enacted did not provide for the death penalty asa pWlishment. See Omnibus Crime Bill, Pub. L. No.103-322, Title VI, Section 60020, 108 Stat. 1979 (1994) (amending section 2340Ato provide for the death penalty); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103\u00ad 711, at 388 (1994) (noting that the act added the death penalty asa penalty for torture). Most recently, the USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (2001), amended section 2340A to expressly codify the \u00b7offense of conspiracy to commit torture. Congress enacted this amendment as part of a broader effort to ensure that individuals engaged in the planning of terrorist activities could be prosecuted irrespective of where the activities took place. See H. R. Re:J. No.1 07-236, at 70 (2001) (discussing the addition of \"conspiracy\" as a separate offense for a variety of\"Federal terrorism offense[s]\"). . 42 \"The term 'United States\" as used in this title in a territorial sense, includes all places and waters, continental or insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, except the Canal Zone.\" As we understand it, the persons discussed in this memorandum are not within United States as it is defined in section 5. UNCLASSIFIED . S~eRi5'i'}'f,OFOR:P, 35 S:BellE'f\"'10F'O~T .interrogations take place within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, such as ata U.S. military base in a foreign state, the interrogations are not subject to sections 2340-2340A. If, however, the interrogations take place outside the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction and are otherwise outside the United States, the tortUre statute applies. Thus, for example, interrogations conducted at GTMO would not be subject to this prohibition, but interrogations conducted at a non-U.S. base in Afgh~stan would be subject to section 2340A.45 Moreover, we note\u00b7 that because the statute criminalizes conduct only when it is cOl1)Il1itted outside the United States-which under section 2340(3) means it must be committed outside the special maritime jurisdiction-the proviso contained in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7(9) excluding those persons covered by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3261 (a) does not apply. As discussed above, this proviso excluding members of the Armed Forces, those employed by the Armed Forces or the Department of Defense, and those persons accompanying members of the Anned Forces or their employees applies only when their conduct is a felony if committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction ofthe United States. See id. Here, the conduct under section.2340A is a felony only when committed outside the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. Thus, so long as members of the Armed Forces and those accompanying or employed by the Armed Forces are in an area that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7 defines as part of the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, they too are within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction for the purposes 43 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7, as discussed supra Part II.B., defines the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United ~~. . 44 The statute further includes those places described in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46501(1) (2000), which sets forth the special aircraft jurisdiction. Under section 46501(2), the special aircraft jurisdiction includes \"any of the following aircraft in flight\": (A) a civil aircraft of the United States. (B) an aircraft ofthe anned forces ofthe United States. (C) another aircraft in the United States. (D) another aircraft outside the United States\u00ad (i) that bas its next scheduled destination or last place ofdeparture in the United States, if the aircraft next lands in the United States; (ii) on which an individual conunits an offense (as defmed in the Convention for the Suppression ofUnlawful Seizure ofAircraft) if the aircraft lands in the United States with the individual still on the aircraft; or . (iii) against which an individual commits an offense (as defined in subsection (d) or (e) of articleI, . Safety ofCivil Aviation) ifthe aircraft lands in the United States with the individual still .. on the aircraft. (E) any other aircraft leased without crew to a lessee whose principal place ofbusiness is in the United States or, ifthe lessee does not have a principal place ofbusiness, whose pennanent residence is in the United States. (Emphasis added). 4S We also note that there are several statutes that would pennit the prosecution of individuals who, while not conducting the i.nterrogations themselves, were otherwise jnvolved in the interrogations. Section 2340A(c) expressly criminalizes conspiracy to commit torture. 18 U.S.C. \u00a72339Amakes it an offense to \"provideD material support or resources or conceal[] or disguise[] .the nature, location, source, or ownership of material support or resources, knowing or intending that they are to be used in preparation for, or canying out, a violation ofsection ... 2340A.\" Id. \u00a7 2339A(a). As a general matter, the federal criminal code also provides for accessory liability. See 18 U.S.C\u00a7 2 (accessory punishable as principal); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 (accessory after the fact). UNCLASSIFIED 36 .of the conduct section 2340A criminalizes. Accordingly, they are considered to be within the United States for purposes of that statute. The criminal prohibition against torture therefore would not apply to their conduct of interrogations at U.S. military bases located in a foreign state. If, however, such persons are involved in interrogations outside the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction and outside the United States, they are subject to the prohibition against torture as well as those criminal statutes applicable to the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. Section 2340 defines the act oftortureas an: act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2340(1); see id. \u00a7 2340A. Thus, to establish the offense of torture, the prosecution must show that: (1) the torture occurred outside the United\u00b7 States; (2) the defendant acted under the color of law; (3) the victim was within the defendant's custody or physical control; (4) the defendant specifically intended to cause severe physical or mental pain or suffering; and (5) that the act inflicted severe physical or mental pain or suffering. See also S. Exec. Rep. No. 101-30, at6 (1990) (\"For an act to be 'torture: it must ... cause severe pain and suffering, and be intended to cause severe pain and suffering.,,).46 . . At the outset we note that no\u00b7 prosecutions have been brought under section 2340A. There is therefore no case law interpreting sections 234Q-2340A. In light of this paucity of case law, we have disctissedat length below the text of the statute, its legislative history, and the judicial interpretation of a closely related statUte-the Torture Victims Protection Act-in order to provide guidance as to the meaning ofthe elements oftorttire. a. \"Specifically Intended\" . To violate section 2340A, the statute requires that severe pain and suffering be inflicted with specific intent. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2340(1). For a defendant to act with specific intent, he must expressly intend to achieve the forbidden act. See United States v. Carter, 530 U.S .. 255, 269 (2000); Black's Law Dictionary at 814 (7th ed. 1999) (defining specific intent as \"[t]he intent to accomplish the precise criminal act that one is later charged with\"). For example, in RatzlaJv. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 141 (1994), the statUte at issue was construed to require that the defendant act with the \"specific intent to commit the crime.\" (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As a result, the defendant had to act with the express ''purpose to disobey the law\" for the mens rea element to be satisfied. Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) Here, because section 2340 requires that a defendant act with the specific intent to inflict severe pain, the infliction of such pain must be the defendant's precise objective. lithe statUte 46 For the pm-poses of our analy\u00a7,is, we have assumed that interrogators would be acting under color of law and that the person interrogated would be within the custody or control of those interrogators. UNCLASSIFIED SECRETl1>10FOJ\u00bbT 37 S:SC~'f~18:F8JN>;1 had required only general intent, it would be sufficient to establish guilt by showing that the defendant \"possessed knowledge with respect to the actus reus of the crime.\" Carter, 530 U.S. at 268. If the defendant acted knowing that severe pain or suffering was reasonably likely to result from his actions, but no more, he would have acted only with general intent. See id. at 269; Black's Law Dictionary 813 (7th ed. 1999) (explaining that general intent ''usu[allyJ takes the form of recklessness (involving actual awareness of a risk and the culpable taking of that risk) or negligence (involving blameworthy inadvertence)\"). The Supreme Court has used the following example to illustrate the difference between these two mental states: [A] person entered a bank and took money from a teller at gunpoint, but deliberately failed to make a quick getaway from the bank in the hope of being . arrested so that he would be returned to prison and treated for alcoholism. Though this defendant knowingly engaged in the acts of using force and taking money (satisfying \"general intent\"), he did not intend permanently to deprive the bank ofits possession ofthe money (failing to satisf)r\"specific intent\"). Carter, 530 U.S. at 268 (citing I W. Lafave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 3.5, at 315 (1986\u00bb. As a theoretical matter, therefore, knowledge alone that a particular result is certain to occur does not constitute specific intent. As the Supreme Court explained in the context of murder; \"the ... common law of homicide distinguishes ... between a person who knows that another person will be killed as a result of his conduct and a person who acts with the specific purpose of taking another's life[.]\" United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 405 (1980). ''Put differently, the law distinguishes actions taken 'because of a given end from actions taken 'in spite' \u00b7of their unintended but foreseen consequences.\" Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 802-03 (1997). Thus, even if the defendant lrnows that severe pain will result from his actions, if causing such harm is not his objective, he lacks the requisite intent. While as a theoretical matter such knowledge does not constitute specific intent, juries are permitted to infer from the factual . circumstances that such intent is present. See, e.g., .United States v. Godwin, 272 F.3d 659, 666 (4th Cir. 2001); United States v. Karro, 257 F.3d 112, 118 (2d 2001); United Wood, 207 F.3d 1222, 1232 (10th Cir. 2000); Henderson v. United States, 202 F.2d 400, 403 (6th Cir.1953). Therefore, when a defendant knows that his \u00b7actions will produce the prohibited result, a jury will in all likelihood conclude that the defendant acted with specific intent. Further, an individual who acts with a good faith belief that his conduct would not produce the result that the law prohibits would not have the requisite intent. See, e.g., South At/. Lmtd. Ptrshp. of Tenn. v. Reise, 218 F.3d 518,531 (4th Cir. 2002). Where a defendant acts in good faith, he acts with an honest belief that he has not engaged in the proscribed conduct. See Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 202 (1991); United States v. Mancuso, 42 F.3d 836, 837 (4th Cir. 1994). A good faith beliefneed not be a reasonable one. See Cheek, 498 U.S. at202. Although a defendant theoretically could hold an unreasonable belief that his acts would not constitute the actions the statute prohibits, even though they would as a certainty produce the prohibited effects, as a matter of practice it is highly unlikely that a jury would acquit in such a situation. Where a defencrant holds an unreasonable belief, he will confront the problem of UNCLASSIFIED gECDET/~10:FO~1 38 proving to the jury that he actually held that belief. As the Supreme Court noted in Cheek, \"the more unreasonable the asserted beliefs or misunderstandings are, the more likely the jury ... will find that the Government has carried its burden of proving\" intent. Id. at 203-04. As we explained above, a jury will be permitted to infer that the defendant held the requisite specific intent. As a matter of proof, therefore, a good faith defense will prove more compelling when a reasonable basis exists for the defendant's belief. b. \"Severe Pain or Suffering\" The key statutory phrase in the definition oftorture is the statement that acts amount' to torture if they cause \"severe physical or mental pain or suffering.\" In examining the meaning of a statute, its text must be the starting point. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 189 (1984). Section 2340 makes plain that the infliction of pain or suffering per se, whether it is physical or mental, is insufficient to amount to torture. Instead, the pain or suffering must be \"severe.\" The statute does not, however, define the tenn \"severe.\" \"In the absence of such a definition, we construe a statutory term in accordance with its ordinary'or natural meaning.\" FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 476 (1994). The dictionarydefmes \"severe\" as \"[u]nsparing in exaction, punishment, or censure\" endure; extreme; International Dictionary 2295 (2d ed. 1935); see American Heritage Dictionary ofthe English Language 1653 (3d ed. 1992) (\"extremely violent or grievous: severe pain\") (emphasis in original); IX The Oxford English Dictionary 572(1978) (\"Of pain, suffering, loss, or the like: Grievous, extreme\" and \"ofcircumstances ...: hard to sustain or endure\"). Thus, the adjective \"severe\" conveys that the pain or suffering must be of such a high level of intensity that the pain is difficult for the subject to endure. Congress's use of the phrase \"severe pain\" elsewhere in the U. S. Code can shed more light on its meaning. 'See, e.g., West Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83, 100 (1991) (\"[W]e construe [a statutory term] to contain that permissible meaning which fits most logically and, comfortably into the body of both previously and subsequently enacted law:) , Significantly, the phrase \"severe pain\", appears in statutes defining an emergency medical condition for the purpose of providing health benefits. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. 1396u-2 These statutes define an emergency condition as one \"manifesting itself by ,'acute symptoms ofsufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent lay person, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of 'immediate medical attention to result in-placing the health of the individual ... (i) in serious jeopardy, (ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (iii) serious dysfunction ofany bodily organ or part.\" Id. \u00a7 1395w-22(d)(3)(B) (emphasis added). Although these statutes address a substantially different subject from section 2340, they are nonetheless helpful for understanding what constitutes severe physical pain. They treat severe pain as an indicator of ailments that are , likely to result in permanent and serious physical damage in the absence of immediate medical treatment. Such damage must rise to the level of death, organ failure, or the permanent, impairment of a significant body function. These statutes suggest that to constitute torture \"severe pain\" must rise to a similarly high level-the level that would ordinarily be associated UNCLASSIFIED SECRETR'fOFO~f 39 SE\u20ac~~10FOIlP'T with a physical condition or injury sufficiently serious that it would result in death, organ failure, or selious impainnent of body functions. 47 c. \"Severe mental pain or suffering\" Section 2340 gives more express guidance as to the meaning of \"severe mental pain or suffering.\" The statute defines \"severe mental pain or suffering\" as: the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from\u00ad (A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering; (B) the administration or application, orthreatened administration or application, .. of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality; (C) the threat ofimminent death; or (D) the threat that another person will immiliently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality. 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 2340(2). To prove \"severe mental pain or suffering,\" the statute requires proof of \"prolonged mental harm\" that was caused by or resulted from one of four enumerated acts. We cons-ider each of these elements. i. \"Prolonged Mental Harm\" As an initial matter, section 2340(2) requires that the severe mental pain must be evidenced by \"prolonged mental harm.\" To prolong is to \"lengthen in time\" or to \"extend the duration of, to draw out.\" Webster's Third New Internationa/Dictionary 1815 (1988); Webster's New International Dictionary 1980 (2d ed. 1935). Accordingly, \"prolong\" adds a temporal dimension to the harm to the individual, namely, that the harm must be one that is endured over sonie period of time. Put another way, the acts giving rise to the harm must cause some .lasting, though not necessarily permanent, damage. For example, the mental strain experienced by an 47 One might argue that because the statute uses \"or\" rather than \"and\" in the phrase ''pain or suffering\" that \"severe physical suffering\" is a concept distinct from \"severe physical pain.\" We believe the better view ofthe statutory text. is, however, that they are not distinct concepts. The statute does not defme \"severe mental pain\" and \"severe mental suffering\" separately. Instead, it gives the phrase \"severe mental pain or suffering\" asingle definition. Because ''pain or suffering\" is a single concept for the purposes of \"severe mental pain or suffering,\". it should likewise be read as a single concept for the purposes of \"severe physical pain or suffering.\" Moreover, dictionaries defme the words \"pain'~ and '~suffering\" in terms of each other. Compare. e;g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2284 (1993) (detining suffering endurance of ... pain\" \"a New international Dictionary 2284 (1986) (same); XVII The Oxford English Dictionary 125 (2d ed. 1989) (defining suffering as \"the bearing or undergoing ofpain\"); with, e.g., Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary 1394 (2d ed. 1999) (defining \"pain\" as ''physical suffering\"); The American Heritage Dictionary ofthe English Language 942 (College ed. 1976) (defining pain as \"suffering or distress\"). Further, even if we were to read the infliction of severe physical suffering as dis~ct from severe physical pain, it is difficult to conceive of such suffering that would not involve severe physical pain. Accordingly, we conclude that \"pain or suffering\" is a single concept "}
