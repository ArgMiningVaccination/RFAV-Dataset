Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Third-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum gram-negative activity; has lower efficacy against gram-positive organisms but higher efficacy against resistant organisms; highly stable in presence of beta-lactamases (penicillinase and cephalosporinase) of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria; bactericidal activity results from inhibiting cell-wall synthesis by binding to 1 or more penicillin-binding proteins; exerts antimicrobial effect by interfering with synthesis of peptidoglycan (major structural component of bacterial cell wall); bacteria eventually lyse because activity of cell-wall autolytic enzymes continues while cell-wall assembly is arrested Absorption IM preparation well absorbed Peak plasma time: 2-3 hr (IM) Distribution Distributed throughout body, including gallbladder, lungs, bone, bile, and CSF (higher concentrations achieved when meninges are inflamed); crosses placenta; enters amniotic fluid and breast milk Protein bound: 85-95% Vd: 6-14 L Metabolism Metabolized in liver hr (normal hepatic and renal function); 12-16 hr (mild-to-severe renal impairment) Excretion: Urine (33-67% as unchanged drug), feces Administration IV Incompatibilities Solution: LR (at drug Dilutions are stable for 24 hours at room temperature IV - Reconstitute to ~100 mg/mL, then dilute further to 10-40 mg/mL - 10 g bulk package: not for direct IV infusion; reconstitute in 95 mL, then use appropriate portions for further dilution - 10-g bulk package not for direct IV injection; reconstitute in 95 mL, then use appropriate portions for further dilution IM - Dilute with compatible fluid intermittently over 30 minutes IM: Inject deep into large muscle mass Images Copyright 2010 First DataBank, Inc. Patient Handout ceftriaxone injection CEFTRIAXONE - INJECTION (SEF-trye-AX-one) COMMON BRAND NAME(S): Rocephin USES: Ceftriaxone is used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.This drug is not recommended for use in newborns with high blood bilirubin levels and premature infants due to increased risk of side effects. Ask the doctor or pharmacist for details. HOW TO USE: This medication is given by injection into a muscle or vein as directed by your doctor, usually once or twice daily. The dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. Drink plenty of fluids while using this medication unless your doctor directs you otherwise.If you are using this medication at home, learn all preparation and usage instructions from your health care professional. Avoid mixing ceftriaxone with IV fluids that have calcium in them (such as Ringer's solution, Hartmann's solution, parenteral nutrition-TPN/PPN). Consult your pharmacist for details about the safe use of IV calcium products in infants, children, and adults (see Precautions section). Before using, check this product visually for particles or discoloration. If either is present, do not use the liquid. Learn how to store and discard medical supplies safely.If you are using the frozen pre-mixed solution, thaw the bag at room temperature or in the refrigerator. If the bag is thawed in the refrigerator, let it sit at room temperature at least 1 hour before using. Do not thaw by putting in a water bath or microwaving. After thawing, shake well and squeeze the bag to check for leaks. Discard solution if the bag leaks. Do not re-freeze the solution after thawing.For the best effect, use this antibiotic at evenly spaced times. To help you remember, use this medication at the same time(s) every day.Continue to use this medication for the full time prescribed, even if symptoms disappear after a few days. Stopping the medication too early may result in a return of the infection.Tell your doctor if your condition lasts or gets worse. SIDE EFFECTS: Swelling, redness, or pain at the injection site may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: easy bruising/bleeding, unusual tiredness, symptoms of gallbladder disease (such as stomach/abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting), signs of kidney problems (such as change in the amount of urine), pink/bloody/dark urine, painful/frequent urination, back/side pain, yellowing eyes/skin, uncontrollable movements, confusion, seizures.This medication may rarely cause a severe intestinal condition due to a bacteria called C. difficile. This condition may occur during treatment or weeks to months after treatment has stopped. Tell your doctor right away if you develop: diarrhea that doesn't stop, abdominal or stomach pain/cramping, blood/mucus in your stool.If you have these symptoms, do not use anti-diarrhea or opioid products because they may make symptoms worse.Use of this medication for prolonged or repeated periods may result in oral thrush or a new yeast infection. Contact your doctor if you notice white patches in your mouth, a change in vaginal discharge, or other new symptoms.If ceftriaxone is mixed with a numbing medication (such as lidocaine) before injection into a muscle, it may rarely cause a serious blood problem (methemoglobinemia). Get medical help right away if you have any very serious side effects, including: pale/gray/blue skin, fast heartbeat, shortness of breath.A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.In the US -Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or at www.fda.gov/medwatch.In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to Health Canada at 1-866-234-2345. PRECAUTIONS: Before using ceftriaxone, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to it; or to other antibiotics (such as penicillins, other cephalosporins); or if you have any other allergies. This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: gallbladder disease, kidney disease, liver disease, stomach/intestinal diseases (such as colitis).Do not give any products by vein that contain calcium (including IV solutions such as Ringer's solution, Hartmann's solution, parenteral nutrition-TPN/PPN) to a newborn less than 1 month old who is receiving this medication. Doing so can cause serious problems in the vital organs.Ceftriaxone may cause live bacterial vaccines (such as typhoid vaccine) to not work well. Tell your health care professional that you are using ceftriaxone before having any immunizations/vaccinations.Before having surgery, tell your doctor or dentist about all the products you use (including prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, and herbal products).Tell your doctor if you are pregnant before using this medication.This medication passes into breast milk in small amounts and is unlikely to harm a nursing infant. Consult your doctor before breast-feeding. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. This document does not contain all possible drug interactions. Keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist. Do not start, stop, or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval.Some products that may interact with this drug include: calcium-containing IV fluids.This medication may interfere with certain lab tests (such as certain urine glucose tests), possibly causing false test results. Make sure lab personnel and all your doctors know you use this drug. OVERDOSE: If someone has overdosed and has serious symptoms such as passing out or trouble breathing, call 911.
