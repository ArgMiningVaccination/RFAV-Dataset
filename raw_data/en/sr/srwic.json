Bless your body with one of the 10 best prickly yet pain-relieving acupuncture mats of 2023. However, if you still can't decide which one to pick or are wondering how to use an acupuncture mat, we have some great tips for you in our buying guide below. How To Choose The Best Acupuncture Mat? - Size: While choosing an acupuncture mat, check if the size is ideal for your height before buying. For example\u2014 if you need therapy in the neck-to-lower back regions, it's best to choose a mat that is slightly longer than other regular mats to avoid uncomfortable adjustments in between. - Support: Optimal support is an essential feature to check, especially if choosing a mat and pillow set. Although most acupuncture mats have cotton foam for optimal support, the same cannot be said about the pillows. Pick an option that will contour your neckline to avoid cramps later. - Intensity: Acupuncture mats can be discomforting on the first use. The body takes at least 2-3 trials (this may vary from person to person) to get accustomed to the intensity of the pressure points. However, if you are a novice, check the intensity before buying the mat. You would want to start with spikes that are not very sharp. For example, The Shakti Mat offers 3 intensity levels for the users. You can also lower the intensity by placing a sheet on the mat or wearing a t-shirt. - Maintenance: Acupuncture mats need maintenance too. They are not machine washable as that could damage the spikes. However, the mats can be hand washed or cleaned regularly with a damp cloth. How To Use An Acupuncture Mat If you are a novice to acupuncture therapy, these mats may be slightly uncomfortable at first. However, once your body gets used to it (give it 2-3 trials), the experience is ultra-relaxing and rejuvenating. Beginners should avoid laying down bare skin initially. Wear a t-shirt or place a sheet on the mat or both until your body gets accustomed to the spikes, post which you can enjoy bare skin acupuncture therapy. You must also avoid hard floor acupuncture initially and start by placing the mat on the bed or couch. How long should you indulge daily? 20-30 minutes is ideal for the best experience.

These mats are built with the right pressure points to help you get relief from body aches and pain from the comfort of your home. Frequently Asked Questions Do acupressure mats work? Absolutely! Once your body gets accustomed to the pressure points these mats can help improve blood circulation and sleep, and reduce headaches, muscle tension, fatigue, stress, and so much more. How long should you lay on an acupressure mat? It depends on how well your body is accustomed to the pressure points. If you are a novice, you should not extend your acupuncture mat therapy for more than 20-30 minutes. However, you can increase the minutes as your body starts getting used to the spikes. Is an acupressure mat safe during pregnancy? No, avoid using an acupuncture mat during pregnancy or labor. If you still want to, you must consult your doctor or use a mat only under the supervision of a medical practitioner. Can you sleep on an acupressure mat? No, avoid using an acupuncture mat while sleeping. You should use it only once during the day and only for 20-30 minutes. Using the mat for prolonged hours can worsen the aches rather than reducing them. Does an acupressure mat help lose weight? No, an acupuncture mat may not help if you are planning to lose weight. However, it may help in cutting down toxins and cellulite in the long run. Practice deep breathing and drink a lot of water after using an acupuncture mat for the best experience. Who should not use an acupressure mat? Do not use an acupressure mat if you have thin and sensitive skin, as the needles can cause soreness and bleeding. In addition, if you are suffering from diabetes and hypertension, avoid using the mat to prevent disrupting and lowering the blood pressure level. Do you wear clothes on an acupressure mat? Yes. Wear clothes on an acupressure mat to get slowly accustomed to the piercing process of the mat. Clothes also lessen the intensity of the spikes and reduce the pressure you feel on your body. What is the science behind acupressure? Acupressure is a process of putting gentle pressure on the specific points, also known as acupoints, of your body to control the flow of psychological energy throughout the body. The process is highly effective in reducing the tendency of nausea, insomnia, and constipation and reduces body pains and migraine.
