They test new medical care procedures or drugs by asking for volunteers to help with the study. If you participate in a Medicare -approved study, Original Medicare pays the doctors and other providers for the covered services you receive as part of the study. Although not required, we ask that you notify us if you participate in a Medicare -approved research study. After Original Medicare has paid its share of the Medicare -approved study, this plan will pay the difference between what Medicare has paid and this plan's cost- sharing for like services. Any remaining plan cost -sharing you are responsible for will accrue toward this plan's out- of-pocket maximum. Annual out -of-pocket maximum All copays, coinsurance, and deductibles listed in this benefits chart are accrued toward the medical plan out -of-pocket maximum with the exception of the routine hearing services , routine vision services, and the foreign travel emergency and urgently needed care copay or coinsurance amounts.

In the network portion of a PPO, some in- network medical services are covered only if your doctor or other in- network provider gets prior authorization from our plan. In a PPO, you do not need prior authorization to obtain out -of-network services.

To keep plans affordable, every year we may also remove drugs or change the cost you pay for them the following year. But don't worry; we'll notify you first and send you a new drug list when we make these changes. Important: Check to see if your drug is on the drug list before you go to the pharmacy. If the drug you take is not on our drug list, you will have to pay the full price of the drug. If that's the case, or if your drug comes with additional requirements or limits, you may be able to receive a temporary supply. We will notify you once the temporary supply is dispensed.
