The mechanism that decrees that we cannot evade the consequences of our own actions. In reality, karma has nothing to do with reward and punishment. Karma simply means action: your action, your responsibility. It is not some external system of crime and punishment, but an internal cycle generated by you. Accumulation of karma is determined only by your intention and the way you respond to what is happening to you. Over time, it is possible to become ensnared by your own unconscious patterns of behavior. A new perspective on the commonly used and misinterpreted concept of \"karma\" that offers the key to happiness and enlightenment, from the New York Times bestselling author and world-renowned yogi and mystic, Sadhguru.
