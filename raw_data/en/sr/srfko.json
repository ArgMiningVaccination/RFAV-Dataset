We performed a test-negative case-control study, utilizing Ontario administrative and laboratory data. We used crude and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) comparing the odds of cases being vaccinated against that of controls. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1-OR)x100. There were 5,867 individuals available for analysis (486 test-positive cases and 5,381 years, 4-7 years, and 8 years since last immunization, respectively. The odds of developing pertussis increased 27% (95%CI, 20%-34%) per year from last immunization. Acellular, compared to whole cell, vaccine priming was associated with a two-fold increased risk of pertussis. These results have important policy implications for optimizing pertussis control and to spur vaccine development. iii Acknowledgments I would like to thank all of the co-authors of this study, including the thesis committee members for their invaluable contributions.

The first written description of whooping cough was by DeBaillou in 1578. He wrote, \"The lung is so irritated that, in its attempt by every effort to cast forth the cause of the trouble, it can neither admit breath nor easily give it forth again. The sick person seems to swell up, and, as if about to strangle, holds his breath clinging in the midst of his jaws. ...\"1 This description of the illness holds true for today for those unfortunate enough to experience it. An audio of the pertussis cough, with its characteristic \"whoop\" can be heard here: http://www.pkids.org/diseases/pertussis.html. 1.1.1!Microbiology! B.pertussis, is a gram-negative coccobacillus bacterium that is one of 10 known Bordetella species. B.pertussis is only pathogenic to humans, however other Bordetella species that commonly infect animals, such as B.bronchiseptica (kennel cough in dogs) and B.parapertussis (pigs), can also infect humans. B.holmesii can cause a variety of clinical diseases, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Bordetella species are fastidious and slow growing, explaining the low sensitivity of culture for diagnosis and the transition to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. B.pertussis has pertactin, adenylate cyclase toxin, and pertussis toxin, which are responsible for the clinical manifestations of disease. These virulence factors have been the basis of acellular vaccine development, most of which contain pertactin. Since the introduction of the acellular vaccine, mutations in the pertactin-gene have been identified, potentially providing the bacterium with a selective advantage in avoiding the immunological response from the vaccine. An increase in 2 2 pertactin-negative strains has been observed in multiple jurisdictions; however the relationship between this mutation and increasing incidence of disease is at present unclear.2 1.1.2!Epidemiology) Pertussis is a global infection representing an important cause of infant mortality. An estimated 16 million cases of pertussis occur annually,3 with 95% of cases in developing countries. Pertussis is estimated to cause 200,000 deaths per year. Virtually all of the morbidity and mortality is experienced by infants younger than one year of age.4 Pertussis is cyclical with peaks occurring every 3-5 years. Compared to other vaccine preventable diseases, pertussis has not been well controlled. Before 1943, the incidence of pertussis in Canada was 156 cases per 100,000 population, representing approximately 20,000 cases per year. The introduction of pertussis immunization decreased the number of cases by 90%. There was a resurgence of cases in the 1990s, likely related to poor effectiveness of the whole cell (Connaught) vaccine used during that time in Canada, as well as increased recognition of the disease by physicians, and improved diagnostic testing.5-7 The change from the Connaught whole cell to acellular vaccine in 1997 facilitated improved disease control with a decline in incidence to 5 cases per 100,000. However there was a subsequent unexplained increase to 14 cases per 100,000 in 2012, despite no observed change in population vaccine coverage (Figure 1).4 Similar increases in incidence were observed in other developed countries with high pertussis immunization coverage, including the United States8 and England.9 Ontario, Canada's most populous province (population 13.5 million in 2013), similarly experienced a large outbreak in 2012. This outbreak affected 7 public health units in southwest Ontario. The outbreak started in a largely unvaccinated religious community, but spread to the general population. Approximately 40% of the cases were from the isolated religious communities, and 60% from the general population, where 87% and 32% of cases were unimmunized in the two communities, respectively. The age distribution from the two communities were also quite different, with mostly children under 5 years of age affected in the unimmunized community, and mostly adolescents afflicted in the largely immunized general 3 3 population (Figure 2).10 Consequently, the outbreak raised questions about product-specific vaccine effectiveness in Ontario as well as the possibility of waning immunity. 1.1.3!Vaccine!efficacy! Pertussis vaccines have been available in Ontario for over 70 years. Due to concerns about safety and effectiveness of the whole cell vaccine being used in Ontario, an acellular pertussis vaccine was introduced in 1997.5, 6 In 2003, a publicly funded adolescent dose at 14-16 years of age was initiated. In 2011, a single-dose adult pertussis immunization program was introduced in response to ongoing disease transmission.11 Global concerns about the safety and effectiveness of whole cell vaccines in use in the 1990s led to the development of multiple acellular products and a number of comparative efficacy studies. Multiple studies in Europe and the United States demonstrated comparable efficacy between multicomponent acellular and whole cell pertussis vaccines.12-14 A randomized trial evaluating two different acellular vaccines to the Connaught whole cell vaccine (which was used in Canada in the 1990s) demonstrated an acellular vaccine efficacy of 84%, whereas the whole cell vaccine efficacy was only 36%.7 This study demonstrated the variability between whole cell products, as well as the lower effectiveness observed in Canada during the 1990s. A systematic review of six trials, evaluating 46,000 participants, identified a vaccine efficacy of 85% for the multicomponent (3 components) acellular vaccines.15 Vaccine efficacy for one- or two-component vaccines was considerably lower. These studies used end points of clinical pertussis illness, combined with microbiological diagnosis (typically culture), which is a highly specific outcome. However, these trials lasted <2 years and do not answer the questions surrounding waning immunity and vaccine effectiveness when vaccines from scaled-up production facilities are used in the general population in a mass program. 4 4 1.1.4!Vaccine!effectiveness! Studies from the United States have raised concerns of relatively lower protection from the acellular vaccine as well as significant waning of immunity.16-20 A study from Kaiser Permanente in California demonstrated a significant protective effect from whole cell vaccine priming, with an increased odds of 5.6 of developing pertussis for those only primed with the acellular vaccine.21 This group also showed significant waning of immunity with a 42% increased odds of developing pertussis per year from last immunization following the school age DTaP booster.17 Similarly, other studies from California have demonstrated high early vaccine effectiveness in younger children, with a significant drop in adolescents.16,18 These data provided strong evidence for significant waning of immunity of the acellular pertussis vaccine. A meta-analysis of eight studies evaluating waning immunity in children following the DTaP booster identified a 33% increased odds of developing pertussis per year that elapsed from that dose.22 Given the variation in vaccines and programs between jurisdictions, estimates of effectiveness are not generalizable. Ontario has used a single type of pertussis vaccine at any given time, with an estimated pertussis vaccine coverage rate of 70%,23 providing a unique opportunity to evaluate pertussis vaccine effectiveness. !Objectives! 2.1!Primary! To determine pertussis vaccine effectiveness on a population level. 5 5 2.2!Secondary! To evaluate the waning immunity over time from the acellular pertussis vaccine. To compare the protective effect of whole cell vaccine priming, compared to acellular vaccine priming !METHODS! 3.1!Study!Population,!Setting,!and!Design! We linked Health Ontario (PHO) B.pertussis PCR test results to population-based provincial health administrative data. 3.1.1!TestUnegative!design! We used the test-negative design (TND) to assess pertussis vaccine effectiveness. The TND is a type of nested case-control study where cases are those testing positive, and controls those testing negative, for the disease of interest. The TND is often used to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness because it minimizes bias in healthcare seeking behavior and thus outcome misclassification.24,25 This is particularly important for pertussis since most cases are not tested and microbiologically confirmed. The convenience and relative simplicity of the design have raised concerns regarding its validity.26 This design was first described in Canada to study influenza vaccine effectiveness in 200527 and has been subsequently used for yearly influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates in Canada,28 the United States,29 Europe,30 and Australia.31 6 6 Mathematical modeling studies have attempted to address some of the validity concerns regarding the TND. A published model compared a TND, case-control, and cohort designs to 'true vaccine effectiveness'\u0001for influenza vaccine. 32 All three observational designs performed similarly, but tended to underestimate vaccine effectiveness. An important observation from this model was that the degree of variation was related to the outcome test characteristics. All three designs performed poorly if the diagnostic test in question had poor specificity. However, if the specificity was high, the sensitivity of the diagnostic test had little impact. This suggests that the specificity, rather than the sensitivity, of the diagnostic test is the more important test characteristic for TND studies.32 This is an important observation for extrapolating this design for use in evaluating pertussis vaccine effectiveness. False negative pertussis PCR results are possible depending on the proximity of testing to symptom onset, however false positive pertussis PCR results are uncommon because the specificity of the PCR assay used at Public Health Ontario is high.33 Jackson et al described the rationale for use, and underlying assumptions, of the TND in influenza vaccine effectiveness studies.25 An important, but difficult-to-test, assumption is that the incidence of non-pertussis respiratory infections is similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the general population. This is a reasonable assumption, given that one would not expect there to be significant differences in non-pertussis coughing illnesses between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, which may be caused by asthma or viral infections (e.g., rhinovirus) unrelated to pertussis immunization. However, the reason for pertussis testing may be more diverse than infections such as influenza. For instance, it is common to test contacts of confirmed cases who may have remote or minimal symptoms, changing the likelihood of a positive result. Furthermore, social determinants of health may be an important confounder in predicting the relationship between immunization status and test-positive cases.34 Therefore it is imperative to adjust for comorbidities and measures of social determinants of health to account for some potential underlying differences between test-positive cases and test-negative controls. In a traditional case-control design there may be significant bias related to healthcare seeking behaviour. Cases of 'disease'\u0001may be misclassified as 'controls'\u0001due to an individual's refusal or inability to seek care and receive a diagnosis. The advantage of the TND, beyond convenience, is 7 7 a reduction in misclassification of infection, as well as reducing confounding from healthcare seeking behaviour.25 The TND has been used in other jurisdications to evaluate pertussis vaccines.16, 17, 35 De Serres et al sought to validate the TND compared to randomized controlled trial (RCT) data for several influenza vaccine products as well as Palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis.26 They concluded that a properly designed TND would perform similarly to an RCT for vaccine effectiveness studies. While TND has predominately been used for influenza, this work suggests it may be valid for other vaccine preventable diseases.26 3.1.2!Study!population! The population comprised Ontario residents born between 1 April 1992 and 1 January 2013. We excluded children younger than three months, allowing for up to one month delay in receiving the first pertussis vaccine recommended at two months of age. We also excluded subjects who were not registered for coverage in Ontario's universal healthcare system until after 6 months of age to account for those who may have received their primary immunization series elsewhere, so their information would therefore not be captured in this dataset. We excluded immunizations given within 14 days of testing due to insufficient time to mount an adequate immunologic response. 3.1.3!Ethics!approval! We received approval from the research ethics boards at Public Health Ontario, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, and the University of Toronto. Privacy was safeguarded through strict ICES protocols. 8 8 3.2!Data!Sources!and!Definitions! 3.2.1!Laboratory!data! The PHOL database contains laboratory results for >95% of Ontario's laboratory diagnostic testing for pertussis. PHO's PCR methodology has been previously described.33, 36, 37 Briefly, until 28 May 2012, primers targeting the insertion sequence IS481 were used to detect B.pertussis. Following this date, primers targeting a 50bp segment of the recA gene were also included to distinguish B.pertussis from B.holmesii. Data were available from 7 December 2009 to 31 March 2013. The database consisted of test-specific laboratory test results, which were aggregated to the individual level using a unique healthcare identification number. We defined cases as individuals who tested positive for B.pertussis and controls as those who tested negative. Indeterminate PCR results were excluded from the primary analysis. Patients who received multiple tests within a 90-day period were considered positive if they had at least one PCR positive test result, indeterminate if they received at least one PCR indeterminate result and no PCR positive test result, and negative if they received only negative test results. Tests conducted more than 90 days apart were to be considered as separate potential cases, but no cases occurred in this category. 3.2.2!Pertussis!immunization! The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) database contains physician billing information on virtually all of Ontario's 13.5 million residents starting 1 January 1992, except for new Canadian residents within their first 3 months.38 OHIP introduced vaccine-specific immunization billing claims in 2011, replacing the previously used general immunization codes. We extracted general (immunization with [G538] and without [G539] a consultation) and pertussis vaccines from general immunization codes, we developed an algorithm based on the timing and number of immunizations received and validated the algorithm against electronic medical records. We classified immunization status as up-to-date for age, partially immunized, or unvaccinated. In Ontario, pertussis immunization is recommended at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months with boosters at 4-6 years and 14-16 years.39 Therefore, the number of age-appropriate doses at 3 months is 1, at 5 months is 2, at 7 months is 3, at 19 months is 4, at 7 years is 5, and at 17 years is 6. Individuals with age-appropriate doses were up-to-date, those with no immunizations were unvaccinated, and the rest were considered partially immunized. We defined a priming series as the first 3 vaccine doses received. Vaccines in Ontario are purchased centrally for the entire province. Only whole cell vaccine was available between 1992 and 1996, and only acellular vaccine in 1998 and later. Vaccines administered in 1997 were used in a sensitivity analysis, due to uncertainty regarding the overlapping products used that year. 3.2.2.1!Development!of!pertussis!immunization!algorithm!! We extracted the immunization billing codes G538, G539, G840, G841, and G847 for all individuals in the Public Health Ontario laboratory database of pertussis tests. This resulted in 29,300 entries from 7,560 subjects, including 2,073 unvaccinated individuals. Since 95% were general immunization codes (G538/G539), we felt it was necessary to 'clean'\u0001the dataset to extract immunizations likely to represent a pertussis-containing vaccine, and remove other vaccines (e.g., pneumococcal, meningococcal, measles-mumps-rubella, varicella). We developed an algorithm based on the 2013 Ontario immunization schedule.39 The schedule for pertussis immunizations did not change during the course of the study. In summary, the rules were: 1.!The first pertussis vaccine cannot be administered earlier than 6 weeks of age. 2.!The second and third doses cannot be administered sooner than 28 days following the previous dose. 3.!A child cannot receive more than 3 pertussis vaccines during the first 12 months of life. 10 10 4.!The fourth dose cannot be administered earlier than 17 months of age. 5.!A child cannot receive more than 1 pertussis booster between 17 months and 4 years of age. 6.!The fifth dose cannot be administered before 4 years of age. 7.!A child cannot receive their sixth dose until 13.5 years of age. 8.!A child cannot receive more than 1 booster beyond 13.5 years of age. 9.!Catch-up doses were permitted up to the maximum number of doses expected for the age of the child. 3.2.2.2!Validation!of!pertussis!immunization!algorithm! We validated the above algorithm against the reference standard of documentation in a primary care electronic medical record (EMR) system. The methodology was similar to our recently published study validating OHIP billing claims for infant immunizations.40 We included birth cohorts of Ontario children under the care of family physicians who share their practices'\u0001EMR data with the Electronic Medical Record Administrative data Linked Database (EMRALD), a centralized repository of EMR data used for research and evaluation.41 EMRALD currently comprises EMR data from over 350 Ontario family physicians who use Practice Solutions Suite\u00ae\u0001software, the most widely used EMR in Ontario.42 Individual-level data from EMRALD are collected semi-annually and linked to other administrative databases at the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences (ICES). All clinically relevant information is collected in EMRALD, including clinical encounters, the cumulative patient profile, family history, allergies, immunizations, diagnostic tests, prescriptions, discharge summaries, and consultation notes. Participating physicians contribute to EMRALD on a voluntary basis. EMRALD has been previously used for administrative data validation studies to identify patients with a variety of disease conditions, including ischemic heart disease, stroke, and epilepsy.43-45 Children born between 1 January 2002 and 31 August 2004, and followed continuously for 7 years in EMRALD, were included for analysis. We excluded children who had duplicate identification numbers (preventing 1:1 linkage between EMRALD and the OHIP database) and 11 11 those who died during the observation period. We also excluded children with no billed primary care assessments and those with fewer than 4 visits to their family physician during the first year of life. These children were likely to have resided in Ontario intermittently or received their primary care from a salaried physician who did not submit billing claims to OHIP. We conducted text searches for each vaccine of interest in the prescriptions and immunizations fields in EMRALD using a series of keywords (e.g., DTaP, Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular pertussis, pentacel, quadracel, adacel, etc.). We also searched EMRALD for records of immunization billing claims submitted through the EMR software. We then extracted OHIP immunization billing claims G538, G539, G840, G841, G847 the algorithm described in section 2.2.2.1. Using EMRALD immunization status as the reference standard, we calculated performance measures (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive value [NPV]) with 95% confidence intervals for the above algorithm at 5 intervals based on the age expected to have received the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth doses (i.e., 3 months, 5 months, 7 months, 19 months, and 7 years, respectively). 3.2.3!Covariates! We anticipated significant effect modification by time from last immunization due to previous data demonstrating waning of immunity.22 In addition, a number of covariates were evaluated as potential confounders. We used the Ontario Registered Persons Database (RPDB), which is housed at ICES and contains demographic information on all individuals with a valid Ontario health card,46 to obtain age, sex, socioeconomic status (approximated by neighbourhood income quintile)47, and rural residence (community size<10,000). Age is important for both the response to immunizations as well the risk of being diagnosed with pertussis. Similarly, social determinants of health, including socioeconomic status, are associated with both immunization coverage and the risk of acquiring infectious diseases.48, 49 The Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI-DAD) was used to identify chronic conditions 12 12 based on the algorithm published by Feudtner et al.50 Healthcare utilization within the previous year (including physician visits, emergency department use, and hospitalizations) was enumerated using the OHIP, CIHI National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, and CIHI-DAD databases, respectively. Comorbidities and healthcare utilization have important implications for bias within administrative data, including modifying the underlying risk of disease and access to services. Therefore, these variables were incorporated into the multivariable models as potential confounders. As the reason for pertussis testing was not known, we examined other variables including maternal age at first childbirth (from the MOMBABY Database), and physician characteristics of specialty, type of practice, and year of graduation (from the ICES Physician Database). These datasets were linked using unique encoded identifiers and analyzed at ICES. 3.3!Statistical!Analysis!!3.3.1!Primary!analysis! The binary outcome of interest was pertussis test-positive compared to test-negative. The exposure of interest was immunization status categorized into up-to-date, partial, and unvaccinated which served as the reference group for all models. We used binomial logistic regression models to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR). We stratified the data by time from last dose: 1) 15-364 days; 2) 1-3 years; 3) 4-7 years; and 4) 8 years, to adjust for effect modification. The variables included as covariates in the models were age in years (continuous), sex (male or female), any comorbidity (yes or no),50 income quintile (1 through 5 with 1 as the reference group), rural residence (yes or no), emergency department visits in the past 12 months (2 or <2), hospitalizations in the past 12 months (1 or 0), and ambulatory physician office visits (8 or <8); they were selected a priori for inclusion in the multivariable models to adjust for potential confounding. Observations with missing values were deleted. We calculated vaccine effectiveness using the formula (1-OR) x 100 as has been previously described.51 13 13 3.3.2!Secondary!analyses! 3.3.2.1!Waning!immunity! Waning immunity from acellular vaccine over time was further assessed by estimating the odds of pertussis for each year following the last vaccine dose received among three sub-populations: 1) those up-to-date; 2) those who were either up-to-date or partially immunized; and 3) those who had received 5 previous doses of the vaccine (i.e., older individuals who should have received the DTaP or dTap booster). This analysis was restricted to subjects born in 1997 or later. The outcome was pertussis test-positive versus test-negative. The exposure of interest was years from last immunization.\u0004 The above covariates were included in the multivariable models. 3.3.2.2!Vaccine!priming! We evaluated the relative impact of acellular vaccine priming, compared to whole cell vaccine priming, in a sub-population of subjects aged 10 years who had received 5 pertussis immunizations. The outcome was again pertussis test-positive versus test-negative with the exposure of interest being acellular versus whole cell priming. We constructed multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the odds of pertussis if the priming series used the acellular product only compared to the whole cell product only, as well as 1 dose of whole cell vaccine. The same covariates were incorporated into the models. We used SAS software 9.3 (Cary, NC), PROC LOGISTIC procedure, for all analyses and we chose a risk of Type 1 error of 5% (p-value<0.05) with no correction for multiple hypothesis testing. Variables were evaluated for multicollinearity through variance inflation factors. All logistic regression models were evaluated for model fit using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The models were visually inspected for influential outliers. 14 14 3.4!Sensitivity!analysis! We specified a number of sensitivity analyses a priori related to (1) interpretation of PCR test results, (2)time period of testing, (3) a pertussis outbreak during the study period, (4) impact of an incomplete primary series, and (5) incorporating an exposure misclassification bias analysis.

A great deal of attention gets paid to random error in epidemiological research.53, 54 It is accepted standard of practice to quantitatively report random error through 95% confidence intervals and 15 15 p-values. However, it is much less common to quantitatively report systematic errors. This is particularly important when authors make claims regarding effect sizes or the results have policy implications.52 One source of information bias leading to systematic error is misclassification bias, which is present to some degree in most observational studies.55 It is expected that non-differential misclassification will bias associations towards the null hypothesis, however this may not always be true.56, 57 We used the OHIP database to assess immunization status. This has been used previously to assess influenza vaccines58 and vaccine coverage in children.59 Using Ontario administrative data to ascertain immunization status has limitations resulting in some degree of misclassification bias.40 To support the validity of our findings, we sought to validate the use of this data specifically for pertussis immunization and incorporate the performance measures ascertained from the validation analysis (Table 1) into a multidimensional sensitivity analysis. Fox et al designed a SAS macro that provides a probabilistic method of conducting a sensitivity analysis to correct for misclassification bias of a dichotomous variable.52 The method involves reconstructing the data that would have been observed had the misclassified variable of immunization status been correctly classified, given the sensitivity and specificity of the classification.52 By inputting ranges for sensitivity and specificity, the macro incorporates both systematic and random error. This macro has been described in more detail elsewhere and is available online.52, 60 Knowing exact values of sensitivity and specificity is typically unrealistic. Even in our context, the population contains a variety of ages and we demonstrated how these values change with age in the above validation analysis (Section 2.2.2.2). The macro requires inputs of a minimum and maximum sensitivity and specificity. Outside of this range the probability is equal to zero. It also allows up to two modes of sensitivity and specificity. The modes represent the zone of indifference (i.e., the range of values between which the probability is equal). We used the results of our pertussis immunization validation analysis to calculate vaccine effectiveness adjusted for immunization misclassification. 16 16 !RESULTS! 4.1!Pertussis!immunization!algorithm!validation! Using the methodology described in section 2.2.2.2, we identified 1,511 children followed in EMRALD from birth for a minimum of 7 years and linked to the OHIP database. The performance of the algorithm was quite good in infants younger than 12 months of age as sensitivity was 88%, 83%, and 79% at 3, 5, and 7 months respectively (Table 1). However, sensitivity decreased with age to 66% at 19 months, and 57% at 7 years. Specificity was 95% or higher from 3 to 19 months, and 83% at 7 years. PPV was very high at 95% or higher at all ages, and NPV was generally low, ranging from 25% to 65%. OHIP had a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of near 100% to identify completely unvaccinated children at 7 years of age. However, the confidence intervals were wide due to the small number of unvaccinated children. 4.2!Demographics! Non-pertussis-containing immunizations were removed by applying the algorithm detailed in section 2.2.2.1. In total, 8,663 (32%) of the general immunization codes were removed, leaving 18,554 immunizations given to 5,487 individuals (totaling 7,560 including the 2,073 unvaccinated individuals, many of whom were infants <3 months of age; Figure 3). We linked 7,560 individuals born after 1 April 1992 with a pertussis PCR assay result between 9 December 2009 and 31 March 2013. Deterministic linkage success rate was 94% (using Ontario health card numbers). Probabilistic linkage increased the overall success rate to 96% (using patient demographic variables of name, date of birth, sex, and postal code). We excluded 1,112 infants aged <3 months, 361 persons who registered for OHIP at 6 months of age, and 220 individuals with indeterminate PCR results. The final dataset had 5,867 individuals (486 pertussis-positive cases and 5,381 pertussis-negative controls). 17 17 Cases were older than controls by an average of 2.7 years (Table 2). Cases were more likely to reside in rural areas and to have been tested in 2012. Controls had higher rates of comorbidities and accessed more healthcare in the previous 12 months. 4.3!Immunization!status! Overall 61% of the cohort was up-to-date for age according to our definition, 23% partially immunized, and 16% unimmunized. Infants <1 year had the highest rates of being unimmunized at 27% and decreased to 17%, years, 4-6 and 14-21 years of age, respectively. 58% of 3-11 month olds, 63% of 1-3 year olds, 76% of 4-6 year olds, 46% of 7-13 year olds, and 61% of 14-21 year olds were up-to-date. Of the 486 cases, 193 (40%) had up-to-date pertussis immunization, 134 (28%) were partially immunized, and 159 (33%) were There were 120 (25%) cases, and 1,121 (21%) controls who had received 5 doses. 4.4!Vaccine!effectiveness! Compared to unvaccinated individuals, the adjusted vaccine effectiveness estimates for those who were up-to-date, stratified by time from last immunization, were days, 1-3 years, 4-7 years, and 8 years, respectively. For those partially immunized, the adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 75% days, 1-3 years, 4-7 years, and 8 years, respectively (Table 3). 18 18 4.4.1!Sensitivity!analyses! The sensitivity analyses overall support the vaccine effectiveness findings. Excluding infants aged younger than 7 months from the analysis resulted in a 7% increase in vaccine effectiveness within one year since last immunization (87%; 95%CI, 79% to 92%), however the results for the remaining strata did not significantly change with vaccine effectiveness of 84% 1-3 years, 4 to 7 years, and 8 years from last immunization, respectively. When indeterminate results were treated as pertussis-positive, there was a 9% decrease in vaccine effectiveness within one year since last immunization, however the remaining strata, as well as the results from treating indeterminate results as negative, were similar to the primary analysis. Restricting the analysis to the years 2009-2011, and then to 2012-2013 revealed a change in vaccine effectiveness at 8 years from last immunization; 79% 51%) in 2012-2013. Finally, excluding those subjects part of the large southwest Ontario outbreak resulted in a mild improvement in vaccine effectiveness at 8 years from last immunization (55%; 95%CI, 13% to 77%). The remaining strata were not significantly changed (Table 3). 4.4.1.1!Misclassification!bias!sensitivity!analysis! The inputs used for this analysis were derived from the sensitivity and specificity from the validation analysis described in section 2.2.2.2 (Table 4). For the first 3 strata, we used a trapezoidal probability density function for the plausible ranges of sensitivity and specificity. This implies a minimum, a maximum, and 2 modes based on the overlap in age categories from the validation analysis. The modes represent the zone of indifference where the probability between the two values is equal. In the last strata there were no children younger than 8 years of age, therefore a triangular probability density function was assumed and only one mode was used. 19 19 The adjusted vaccine effectiveness in this sensitivity analysis was 95% days, 1-3 years, 4-7 years, and 8 years, respectively. This equated to a change from the primary analysis of +15%, +14%, +1%, and -19% for each strata respectively (Table 4). The results of this sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the non-differential misclassification bias tended to skew the results towards the null hypothesis and therefore underestimate vaccine effectiveness within four years from last immunization. However, the trend of waning immunity was more pronounced as vaccine effectiveness did not significantly change at 4-7 years and 8 years. The model predicted that beyond 7 years vaccine effectiveness was 19% lower than the primary analysis, however neither were significantly different from zero and random error may explain this apparent difference. 4.5!Waning!immunity! Vaccine effectiveness decreased in a linear fashion over time by approximately 10% per year from last immunization in those up-to-date or partially immunized (Figure 4). Correspondingly, the proportion of pertussis-positive cases increased significantly over time from last immunization by approximately 2% each year (p=<0.001). This trend was similar when the cohort was restricted to those receiving 5 vaccine doses (Figure 5). In the waning immunity analysis, the odds of pertussis was 1.27 (95%CI, 1.20 to 1.34) per year since the last immunization in those up-to-date for age. This analysis was repeated using two other cohorts; including all individuals up-to-date or partially immunized, and restricting to those who had received the DTaP booster (Table 5). The results were similar in these sensitivity analyses with adjusted OR of 1.21 (95%CI, 1.17-1.26) and 1.21 (95%CI, 1.12-1.30), respectively. The differences in waning immunity between cohorts can likely be explained by the variation in the range of years from last immunization between groups. These results support the findings of significant waning of immunity using different inclusion criteria for immunization status. 20 20 4.6!Acellular!compared!to!whole!cell!priming! Priming with whole cell vaccine conferred greater protection than acellular vaccine. The proportion of pertussis-positive individuals solely primed with acellular vaccine was 16.6%, compared to 10.5% (p=0.011) and 9.1% (p=0.005) in those who received 1 whole cell priming dose and 3 whole cell priming doses, respectively (Figure 6). Compared to individuals who received 3 doses of whole cell vaccine, those who received an acellular product for their priming series had an adjusted OR of acquiring pertussis of OR=2.15 (95%CI, 1.30 to 3.57) (Table 6). The findings remained significant when compared to children receiving \u0002 priming doses with whole cell vaccine with an OR of 1.82 (95%CI, 1.18 to 2.82). The results from the sensitivity analysis evaluating those receiving a dose in 1997 as either whole cell or acellular were similar (data not shown). !DISCUSSION! 5.1!Summary!of!findings! We observed high pertussis vaccine effectiveness within three years of immunization, but with clear evidence of waning of immunity. Vaccine effectiveness of 80-85% within the first few years of immunization was consistent with clinical trials of acellular pertussis vaccines.61, 62 However, our data demonstrated a substantial decline in vaccine effectiveness after four years from last immunization, and by 8 years vaccine effectiveness was not significantly different from being unvaccinated. This trend persisted after adjusting for several potential confounders. Similarly, the odds of developing pertussis increased by 27% each year that passed after receiving an acellular pertussis vaccine. 21 21 5.2!Comparison!to!the!literature! Recent observational studies from the United States have shown similar results.16-20 In general, vaccine effectiveness in preschool-aged children is high, but drops to approximately 50% in adolescents and young adults.16, 20 Our analysis, which is stratified by time from last immunization and adjusted for age, suggests that the low distal estimates of vaccine effectiveness are attributable to waning immunity. A recent meta-analysis identified an increased odds of developing pertussis of 33% for each year that passed following the DTaP dose.22 This meta-analysis supports our findings that beyond seven years since last immunization there is minimal protective effect of the vaccine, despite some evidence demonstrating persistent humoral immunity.63 Ontario transitioned to acellular vaccines due to safety and effectiveness concerns of the particular whole cell vaccine used in Canada.5, 6 In some RCTs, whole cell vaccines demonstrated similar, or slightly improved, protection compared to various acellular products, however the follow-up period was typically less than two years.12, 13 In a study using the Connaught whole cell vaccine, efficacy was significantly lower,7 demonstrating the variability between whole cell products. Observational data from Canada and the United States have shown greater protection with whole cell infant priming.21, 64 Klein et al. identified that older children and adolescents who received their priming series with acellular vaccine, compared to complete or partial whole cell priming, had an OR of pertussis of 5.6 and 3.8, respectively.21 In our study, individuals primed with acellular vaccine had an OR of 2.2 and 1.8 compared to those with complete, or partial, whole cell priming, respectively. We were surprised to see a protective effect from the whole cell vaccine given the low effectiveness of the Canadian/Connaught vaccine observed in the 1990s,5, 6 The lower effectiveness may however explain the lower effect size compared to the California experience where a different, more effective, whole cell vaccine had been used in the past. However, receiving 1 dose of any whole cell vaccine as an infant provided significant protection from pertussis over a decade later. 22 22 The body of evidence supporting a significant protective effect with whole cell vaccine priming raises important questions pertaining to immunization policy and vaccine development. Whole cell vaccines continue to be used in most developing countries, which begs the question of whether developed nations should return to a whole cell formulation for part of the pertussis immunization schedule. Future areas of research should focus on modeling the risk/benefit comparison of improved protection versus increased adverse effects. It is important to recognize that while injection site reactions and fever were more common with whole cell vaccines, a number of the cases of severe encephalopathy initially attributed to whole cell vaccines were subsequently proved to be caused by an underlying genetic disorder.65 It is likely that one or two priming doses of whole cell vaccine would prove beneficial on a population level, however public acceptance of this strategy may present challenges to implementation. Evaluation of public sentiment along with education programs would be critical components of any proposed policy changes. Understanding the immunological differences between whole cell and acellular vaccines will be critical for developing a new and improved pertussis vaccine. Comparative studies from the 1990s demonstrated long-lasting B cell memory from both vaccine products. However, the T cell responses to whole cell vaccines were predominantly Th1, compared to a mixed Th1/Th2 response from acellular products.66 Subsequent to the original immunologic studies, Th17 was recognized as an important component of cell-mediated immunity. Pertussis studies in baboon models have demonstrated Th17 and Th1 as the predominant T cell response to both natural infection and whole cell immunization, whereas a mixed Th1/Th2 memory response predominated following acellular immunization. These immunological findings correlated with responses to recurrent exposure. Baboons re-exposed to B.pertussis following acellular immunization had no symptoms but were colonized for 4-5 weeks and were infectious to susceptible contacts. Those re-exposed after natural infection had no symptoms and were not colonized. Baboons re-exposed after whole cell immunization were asymptomatic and colonized for 2-3 weeks.66 The existing immunological data provides the framework needed for investigation and evaluation of novel pertussis vaccines. The objective should be to design a new vaccine that can produce a Th1/Th17 memory response to provide more durable immunity. The optimal strategy is currently unclear; however, this could potentially be achieved by adding additional acellular components, combining existing vaccines with novel adjuvants, or perhaps 23 23 through development of a live-attenuated vaccine. It is increasingly apparent that a new and improved pertussis vaccine is sorely needed to achieve our goal of sustained disease control. Mutations in the pertactin-producing genes of B.pertussis may also be contributing to lower vaccine effectiveness. In Canada, two acellular pertussis vaccines are available, a trivalent and a pentavalent vaccine, both of which contain pertactin; however only the pentavalent vaccine has been used in Ontario.4 In the United States, pertactin-negative strains have been associated with lower vaccine effectiveness.67 In Ontario, 60% of strains analyzed since 2012 were pertactin-negative, compared to <1% pre-2012.2 It was interesting to observe in our sensitivity analysis that vaccine effectiveness was relatively maintained at 8 years from last immunization in those tested for pertussis in 2009-2011. Waning immunity from acellular pertussis vaccine might be more pronounced towards pertactin-negative strains. However, only a small number of samples were tested for pertactin in Ontario, thereby limiting our ability to draw conclusions about pertactin-negative strains. It is expected that vaccine effectiveness would be lower in times of increased incidence as there is increased awareness and testing of atypical cases.68 This change in disease pattern between these time periods may partially explain this discrepancy in waning immunity. Further studies evaluating the genetic heterogeneity in B.pertussis as well as the distribution of pertactin-negative strains would be of interest. The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends a Tdap booster for adolescents aged 11-18 years and for adults every 10 years. However, uptake of these recommendations has been only 56% among adolescents and <6% among adults.69 Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunizations recommends an adolescent booster at 14-16 years and one dose 10 years later as an adult.70 The uptake of these recommendations is unknown. The U.K. has no recommendation for routine pertussis boosters after 4 years of age aside from a recent recommendation for immunization in pregnancy.71 Given our data, combined with reports from others,16, 17 it is not surprising that we are witnessing a resurgence of pertussis in adolescents and adults.10, 16 The presence of a large susceptible population puts young infants at risk of acquiring infection, in whom virtually all of the morbidity and mortality is observed.4 24 24 5.3!Policy!implications! This study demonstrates gaps in our existing immunization recommendations. In Ontario, individuals currently aged 17 years have only received the acellular vaccines. Earlier adolescent boosters may mitigate the rising incidence seen in this age group. More frequent immunization boosters may be warranted, particularly in regions of high disease burden or among individuals in contact with young infants. However, the U.S. experience demonstrates that the uptake for boosters every 10 years in adults may be very low and would not result in significantly improved disease control. Pertussis-containing vaccines are very well tolerated, with local reactions being the most common adverse event. Careful monitoring for increase in local adverse reaction with more frequent boosters would be necessary, but the risk with lower-antigen acellular pertussis vaccines appears to be quite low.72 We recommend that decisions to strengthen control of pertussis be informed by dynamic modeling to compare relative costs and benefits of different strategies, including vaccination in pregnancy and regular adult boosters, taking into account the likelihood that coverage achieved in adult immunization programs is usually much lower than in childhood programs. The ultimate objective needs to be an improved pertussis vaccine with sustained, durable immunity. Research should focus on cost-effective methods of improving control while collaborating with industry to develop new vaccines. 5.4!Strengths!and!weaknesses! Our study has some limitations. Although administrative data may incompletely ascertain immunization status, we have carefully validated this dataset and defined precise values for sensitivity and specificity for identifying pertussis-containing immunizations. The pertussis immunization algorithm had high specificity for identifying true pertussis immunizations in children younger than 7 years of age. The sensitivity in infants was also high but decreased with age. The reasons for this decline are not entirely clear. Physician remuneration for providing 25 25 vaccines is small and ranges from $0.68 to $4.50 depending on the payment structure of the practice. It is possible that nurses or other non-billing providers may have administered vaccines more commonly in older children, resulting in under-billing. A separate validation study using similar methods to evaluate vaccine-specific and general immunization codes in infants found similar results in this population.40 There are some limitations of using an EMR as the reference standard for immunizations. EMR records are dependent on documenting administration of the vaccine. There are multiple areas of free text within the EMR, and while we attempted to capture all relevant text entries, missed recordings are possible. The data available through EMRALD are a voluntary sample of Ontarian physicians who all use one type of EMR system and practice under some type of primary care reform model of care, and therefore may not be entirely representative of all physicians in the province. We have demonstrated that patients captured by EMRALD are more likely to live in rural areas and be cared for by younger physicians who have adopted EMR systems.40 We identified that our algorithm utilizing administrative data has good sensitivity and excellent specificity to accurately characterize pertussis immunization status in infants. However, the sensitivity and specificity declined with age. Pertussis immunization coverage assessed using our algorithm was 61% overall, and 84% had received at least one immunization. The best population estimates were published by PHO in 2012, estimating pertussis coverage to be 73% in 7-year-olds, and 70% in 17-year-olds.23 The discrepancy between the datasets highlights some of the bias inherent in administrative data. However, the results from the validation analysis were utilized to adjust for exposure misclassification bias in the sensitivity analysis. This misclassification bias is almost certainly non-differential (i.e., not related to the outcome), and therefore one expects a bias towards the null hypothesis, and thus underestimation of vaccine effectiveness.73 We performed a quantitative sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of exposure non-differential misclassification bias. This sensitivity analysis achieved a number of important objectives. First, we confirmed that it tended to bias our results towards the null hypothesis and underestimated vaccine effectiveness, particularly within four years from last immunization. This assumption is often made, but is not necessarily accurate.56, 57 In addition, we were able to quantify the level of uncertainty in our estimates based on the known degree of 26 26 systematic bias present in our exposure variable while simultaneously accounting for random error.52 This analysis supports the robustness of our findings surrounding waning immunity over time, and suggests that our estimate of waning immunity is likely conservative. We acknowledge the need for caution in interpreting results using data with an unknown amount of systematic error. By validating this data source, and quantifying the change in our estimates, we can confidently conclude that the observed findings are not a result of underlying bias in the dataset. This work provides justification for utilizing administrative data for future studies of vaccine effectiveness, assuming the data source can be appropriately validated, thereby providing adjustments for the degree of systematic bias. Our outcome was B.pertussis detection by PCR, which is highly sensitive and specific with a low risk of misclassification. We were unable to characterize patient-specific reasons for testing, and they may have resulted in some outcome misclassification. The TND has not been specifically validated for pertussis, but it has been used in other jurisdictions,16, 17, 35 and we feel it was the optimal design given the data available. We found differences in underlying comorbidities and healthcare utilization. It is not entirely clear why controls were more likely to access healthcare. These individuals had more comorbidities with increased physician access, which may have led to greater likelihood of testing and may have affected the likelihood of vaccination, but are unlikely to have directly and differentially changed the risk of pertussis. These variables were used in the multivariable models to adjust for potential confounding. It is possible there were additional unmeasured confounders not captured by the administrative data. 5.5!Conclusion! In conclusion, our study identified good early vaccine effectiveness from the acellular pertussis vaccine with significant decline in immunity by 4-7 years and minimal to no protection beyond seven years since last immunization. In the era of acellular pertussis immunization, a shorter duration between boosters may be warranted for improved pertussis control, however development of a new vaccine with durable immunity should be a priority. 27 27 !References!!1.

Four separate models were constructed to evaluate vaccine effectiveness (1-OR x 100). Due to effect modification from time from last immunization, which was collinear with age, the cohort was stratified into 15 to 364 days, 1 to 3 years, 4 to 7 years, and 8 years from last immunization. The binary outcome was pertussis-positive case (outcome=1) compared to pertussis-negative control (outcome=0). The exposure of interest was up-to-date, and partial, immunization status, which were compared to unimmunized individuals as the reference group. The remaining variables were included for adjustment in the model as potential confounders. All four models satisfied convergence criterion and had non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow values suggesting an appropriate model fit. The omnibus likelihood ratios were significant for all four models. The most significant confounding variables were 'emergency department visits' in model 'hospitalizations' and 'physician office visits' in both models 3 and 4.
