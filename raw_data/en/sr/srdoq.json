Therefore, its's imperative to learn and study them. The purpose of the lab was to put into action the methods that have been learned in the laboratory to determine our unknown bacteria. The purpose of this lab was to use chemical and physical tests to identify indicators of disease in synthetic urine samples. This lab tested samples for protein levels, glucose levels, and pH levels. In a normally functioning individual, proteins cannot pass through the glomerulus; therefore proteins should not be found in urine. However, in the nephrons of individuals with Bright's Disease, the glomerulus no longer stops all proteins from entering the urine (Giuseppe et al., 2002, pp. 357-358). Bright's Disease is characterized by a change in the permeability of the glomerulus, which allows proteins to pass through and since the nephron has no way of reabsorbing proteins they are passed into the urine (Giuseppe et al., 2002, Being able to identify unknown microbes from systematic testing is what makes the field of microbiology so important, especially in infectious disease control. Using the testing procedure laid out by the microbiology field we are able to identify unknown bacteria present in our everyday lives, and along the way learn a lot about their characteristics that separate them from other types of bacteria. Being able to do this is vital in order for us to understand why microbes are present in certain places, how they are able to grow and what restricts their growth, that way they can be combatted if necessary. These techniques for determining unknowns are also important for isolating and testing infectious disease microbes in order to prevent spreading. Another important aspect of being able to identify unknown microbes is the Infectious diseases are the invasion of host organisms, (microbes) which can be invisible to the eyes. The microbes are also known as pathogens. A microbe infects an organism (which is known as the host of the microbe). In a human host, the microorganism causes a disease by either disrupting an important body process or by stimulating the immune system to mount a defensive reaction. The pathogen, interferes with the normal functioning of the host and can lead to chronic wounds, gangrene, loss of an infected limb, and even death. The host's response to infection is inflammation. An interaction between parasite and host, whereby the relationship is beneficial for the former but detrimental to the latter, is characterized as parasitism. In the article \"The Ultimate Social Network,\" the author, Jennifer Ackerman, writes about the human microbiome. She explains the research on this and on two specific bacteria, Bacteroides Thetaiotaomicron and Helicobacter Pylori. She also talks about how these microorganisms survive in the human body. Work with your lab group to compile a list of what you know about each specimen. 2. A blood sample taken from a patient who has an infection can be expected to show which of the following? A milk-based, litmus broth tube is incubated and observed after 48 hours. Observations include lactose fermentation without gas as well as with gas, the reduction of litmus, casein protein coagulation and casein and protein hydrolysis. These characteristics were all determined based on the color of the solution and the production of a curd, the curds density and the production of a gas. To determine the density of the curd, the tube was slightly turned to see rather or not it was mobile or concentrated towards the bottom. As each year passed, I realized how much my family members have deteriorated. Whether it was through mental health or physical health, it seemed as though someone was constantly at war with their personal health. For this reason, I want to educate myself on what causes people to get sick and how it affects them internally. As a result, I chose Microbiology as my major. The knowledge I gain about microbes and their effects on human beings will allow me to undergo the research needed to help defend the population against them. As of now I want to dedicate my life to research and finding cures. Although this is my goal I am also interested in a more personalized career such as nutrition. These two fields will allow me to help others in ways I have not been able to help my own family members. In this experiment I was testing for antimicrobial sensitivity of Staphylococcus epidermidis by using the Kirby-Bauer Diffusion test. The three antibiotics utilized in this lab were: gentamicin, novobiocin, and penicillin. I determined the effectiveness of the antibiotic by observing and measuring the zone of inhibition for each antibiotic. I used the measurements and compared them again with the Antibiotic Susceptibility zone chart. I was able to determine whether the My inclination to study biology comes to me since I was little boy. I always found amazing the capabilities of living beings and mechanisms that allow life, development and evolution of organisms. Particularly interesting were my first approaches to microbiology in early classes in high school. My fascination by biological sciences was such that it led me to win the National Biology Contest held in Cuba, my native country in 2004. This was one of my first academic achievements in my short career and allowed me to directly enter the best pre-university school in my country. Since then, the way forward seemed pretty obvious and interesting. Biochemical tests are the tests used for the identification of bacterial species based on the differences in the biochemical activities of different bacteria. Bacterial physiology differs from one species to the other. These differences in carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, fat metabolism, production of certain enzymes and ability to utilize a particular compound help them to be identified by the biochemical tests. Gram's stain was originally devised by histologist Hans Christian Gram in 1884. Gram-positive bacteria stain purple, while Gram-negative bacteria stain pink when subjected to Gram staining. Approximately 60-90% of the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall is made up of peptidoglycan and interwoven teichoic acid, while only Three test were conducted based on the result of the gram staining procedure. Blood agar with a Novobiocin disk was chosen as well as DNase (DNA) and Mannitol Salts (MSA) agar. The Blood agar is a bright red, opaque plate and the streaking or the inoculation technique was a modified streaking for isolation with a heavy quadrant one. This is where the antibacterial disc bacitracin was used to determine the bacteria's susceptibility. The majority of cells making up the human body are diploid cells carrying identical DNA, with the exception of haploid gametes and red blood cells. Several types of biological evidence such as blood and hair are commonly used in forensic science, which is the scientific study of evidence for crime scene investigations and other legal matters. Forensic science is used for the purpose of DNA analysis, this is the analysis of DNA samples to determine if it came from a particular individual. DNA analysis is done by obtaining DNA samples from an individual; next, a large sample of DNA is produced from amplified selected sequences from the DNA collected. Finally, the amplified DNA regions are compare using a gel. DNA Profiling This paper scrutinises on the importance of agglutination reactions in clinical testing and diagnosis of various diseases. The ability of various antigens and antibodies to agglutinate when mixed in desired environment has been used as the basis to detect the presence of respective antigens in body. It focuses on importance of this method as it gives the results faster than various other methods and provides visible results. Diagnosis of various diseases can be done by this method provided the antibodies are present in blood, urine, plasma or fluid of bone marrow. The following paper discusses the clinical application of agglutination reaction in testing the ABO, Rh blood "}
