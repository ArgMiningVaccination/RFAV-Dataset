For example, the claim that the body has a 'natural healing potential' or that 'natural' is always better. This may lead people to believe that suffering a 'natural' disease in order to achieve subsequent immunity is preferable to being vaccinated, which is the exact opposite of the actual risks. Many adherents of 'alternative medicine' hold unwarranted beliefs and are sceptical of vaccinations. Research has shown that these unwarranted beliefs are particularly shaped by 'cognitive variables', a psychological term which describes the ways in which people process information.

The appeal of alternative and traditional medicine often lies in its use of natural remedies, but unfortunately natural remedies do not provide a substitute for vaccines which have a longstanding record of effectiveness in boosting the body's natural immune response. Vaccines are required to combat dangerous diseases that our immune systems struggle with. Boosting our natural immune system is key to preventing severe illness and death. For example, COVID-19 vaccinations have saved nearly half a million lives in less than a year through generating natural immune protection without suffering the full, and potentially very severe, symptoms of the disease. Vaccinations are thus our first line of defence for these diseases. Or to put it another way: vaccinations are nature at its "}
