Types A and B are responsible forepidemic disease in humans. InfluenzaA viruses are categorized further basedon surface antigens known as hemag-glutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).Current subtypes of A humans are H1N1 and H3N2.Frequent antigenic change, orantigenicdrift, caused by point mutations duringviral replication, results in new influ-enza virus variants, causing seasonalepidemics that generally occur in win-ter months in temperate zones. Occa-sionally, influenza A viruses undergoformation of an entirely new subtypethroughantigenic shift, resulting in anew hemagglutinin or neuraminidaseprotein, which creates the possibility ofa pandemic.Rates of influenza infection arehighest in school-age children duringcommunity outbreaks, which usuallylast 4 to 8 weeks. Overall, approxi-mately 1% of infected children arehospitalized, but the rate is substan-tially higher in children younger thanage 2 years. Although influenza-associated death is uncommon, the riskis highest among young children. Of the83 deaths reported by the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention duringthe 2007-2008 season, 50% were inchildren younger than 5 years. Childrenafflicted with chronic illnesses are mostvulnerable, but about 50% of childrenwho die from influenza have no under-lying medical conditions.Influenza viruses are spread primar-ily via large-particle respiratory droplettransmission between individuals or bycontact with contaminated surfaces.The typical incubation period is 1 to4 days. Young children may shed virusseveral days prior to developing symp-toms and can remain infectious formore than 10 days. Immunocompro-mised patients can shed influenza virusfor weeks to months.Clinical symptoms of uncomplicatedinfluenza disease include fever, malaise,myalgia, headache, nonproductive cough,sore throat, and rhinitis. Children alsomay develop or may have sei-zures or sepsislike symptoms. Uncom-plicated influenza disease typically re-solves within 3 to 7 days.Complications of influenza infectioninclude primary viral pneumonia andsecondary bacterial infections such aspneumonia, sinusitis, otitis media.Among hospitalized children who havelaboratory-conrmed influenza, to11% require admission to the intensivecare unit and 3% require mechanicalventilation. Higher rates of hospitaliza-tion and influenza-associated morbidityare seen among children who haveunderlying medical conditions such asasthma or congenital heart disease.Influenza can be detected by a num-ber of methods, including rapid antigen-detection tests, immunofluorescence,viral culture, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Rapid antigen-detection testing for in-fluenza A and B is used commonly inhospitals and has a reported sensitivityof 50% to 70% and specicity of 90%to 95%. RT-PCR becoming and offers the highestsensitivity and specicity in detectinginfluenza virus. In general, testingshould be performed when the resultsare expected to affect patient care.in brief 326Pediatrics in ReviewVol.30 No.8 August 2009Immunization is the primary methodof preventing influenza infection. Cur-rent American Academy of Pediatricsguidelines recommend annual vaccina-tion of all children ages 6 monthsthrough 18 years before the start ofinfluenza season, with special attentionpaid to those at high risk for complica-tions and their close contacts. Twotypes of influenza vaccine are availablein the United States: trivalent inacti-vated influenza vaccine (TIV) and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).TIV is administered intramuscularlyand has been approved for children 6months of age and older, includingthose who have chronic medical condi-tions (age range may vary by manufac-turer). LAIV is a nasal spray that isapproved for healthy children after thesecond birthday. The safety of LAIV inpregnant women and people who haveunderlying medical conditions, includ-ing wheezing, has not been established.Adverse effects of both TIV and LAIVgenerally are mild. Because both vac-cines are produced in hen eggs, patientswho are hypersensitive to eggs or othervaccine components should not be im-munized. In addition, influenza vaccineshould not be given to anyone who hasa moderate-to-severe febrile illness ora history of Guillain-Barre\u00b4 syndrome.Antiviral medication may be usefulas an adjunct to immunization and canbe used for treatment or prophylaxis.Treatment should be provided to chil-dren who have influenza and are athigh risk for complications, regardlessof the severity of their illness. Treat-ment also should be considered forotherwise healthy children who havemoderate-to-severe illness. When ther-apy is initiated within 48 hours, theduration of symptoms may be de-creased by 1 day. The initiation oftreatment beyond 48 hours has notbeen evaluated well. Prophylaxis is in-dicated for high-risk children through-out the 2 weeks following immuniza-tion during periods in which influenzais active in the community. Prophylaxisalso is indicated for high-risk childrenwho have not been or cannot be im-munized and for their unimmunizedclose contacts. In addition, prophylaxismay be useful in circumstances inwhich vaccination is not expected to beeffective.Two classes of antiviral medicationsare licensed for use influenzaA only: amantadine for treatment ofpatients after the rst birthday andrimantadine only for treating adoles-cents and adults. Both agents are ap-proved for prophylaxis for children 1year of age and older. Adverse effectsof adamantanes typically are mild.However, central nervous system (CNS)symptoms, such as anxiety, have beenobserved in some children, especiallywith the use of amantadine. More se-vere CNS effects, including deliriumand seizures, also have been observed.The neuraminidase inhibitors are ap-proved for treatment and prophylaxis ofboth influenza A and B. Oseltamivir isadministered orally and is approved foruse in children 1 year of age and older.Its most common adverse effects arenausea and vomiting, although neuro-psychiatric events have been reported.Zanamivir, administered as an inhaledpowder, is approved for treatment inchildren older than age 7 years andprophylaxis in children older than age 5years. The safety of using zanamivir inchildren who have underlying medicalconditions, including reactive airwaydisease, has not been established.Drug-resistant strains of influenzahave emerged in recent years. Atpresent, most strains of influenzaA (H3N2) are resistant to the adaman-tanes, and most strains of influenzaA (H1N1) are resistant to oseltamivir. Inlight of these ndings, guide-lines recommend treatment of influ-enza A (H1N1) with and influenza A a neuraminidase inhibitor. Be-cause most rapid diagnostic tests areunable to distinguish viral subtypes,clinicians should remain informedabout local influenza patterns. If sub-type information is not available, influ-enza A should be treated with zanami-vir or a combination of oseltamivirand rimantadine; influenza B should betreated with a neuraminidase inhibitor.As susceptibility patterns evolve, clini-cians should remain alert for updatedrecommendations.Parainfluenza viruses, which areparamyxoviruses distinct from the in-fluenza family, may cause a clinicalsyndrome similar to that of influenza,but are most recognized as the majorcause of laryngotracheobronchitis(croup) in children. They also can causepneumonia and bronchiolitis. Althoughmost parainfluenza infections are self-limited, children who have chronic pul-monary disease or immunodeciencymay be at increased risk for complica-tions. No specic treatment or prophy-laxis is available for parainfluenza.Comment:The rst human cases ofa new H1N1 influenza A originating inswine were identied in Mexico, and inApril, spread by person-to-person con-tact, the virus arrived in the UnitedStates. By June, all 50 states, as well asseveral other countries, had reportedcases. Although it still is not clear howserious a threat this virus poses, theconcern (if not panic) swelling in thepublic merits our response. Readers areadvised to consult their local healthdepartments and to visit www.aap.orgfor the latest recommendations regard-ing both H1N1 influenza and seasonalinfluenza.Henry M. Adam, "}
