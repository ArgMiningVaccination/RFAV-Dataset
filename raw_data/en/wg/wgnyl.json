Martin RJ Kolb MD PhD Director, Division of Respirology Firesto ne Institute for Respiratory Health, McMaster University 50 Charlton Avenue East, Room T2120, Hamilton, ON L8N 4A6 Canada is a complex disease of unknown etiolo gy which makes drug development challenging. Single administ ration of bleomycin directly to the lungs of mice is a widely used experimental model for studying pulmonary fibrogenesis and to evaluate the effect of therapeutic anti -fibrotic strategies . The model works by inducing an early inflammatory phase which transitions into fibrosis after 5 -7 days . This initial inflammation makes therapeutic timing crucia l. To accurately assess anti -fibrotic efficacy, the intervention should inhibit fibrosis without impa cting early inflammat ion. Studies published between 2008 and 201 9 using the bleomycin model to investigate pulmonary fibrosis were retrieved from PubMed , and s tudy characteristic s were analyzed . Intervention based studies were classified as either preventa tive (starting <7 days after bleomycin installation) or therapeutic (>7 days) . Studies were also cross -referenced with current major clinical trials to assess the availab ility of preclinical rational . A total of 976 publications were evaluated . 726 investi gated potential therapies , of wh ich 443 (61.0%) were preventative alone , 166 (22.9%) therapeutic alone, and 105 (14.5%) were both. Of the 443 preventative studies, only 70 (15.8%) characterized inflammation during the model's early inflammatory phase . Of t he reported 145 IPF clinical trials investigating 93 compounds/combinations, only 2 5 (26.9.0%) had any PubMed -available preclinical data in bleomycin . Since 2008 , we observed a shift (from <5% to 3 7.4%) in the number of studies evaluating drugs in the ther apeutic setting in the bleomycin model. While this shift is encouraging, more characterization of early inflammation and appropriate preclinical therapeutic testing are still needed. This will facilitate fruitful drug development in IPF , and more therapeut ic strategies for patient with this devastating disease . INTRODUCTION Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating lung disease in which abnormal wound healing causes a scarring of the pulmonary interstitium and distortion of the lung architectur e [1]. This causes impaired gas exchange as well as increased lung stiffness ; which eventually leads to respiratory failure . The prognosis of IPF is poor and comparable to aggressive cancers , with a median mortality of 3-4 years post -diagnosis [2]. The epidemiology of IPF has been studied in different regions and cou ntries around the world . Recent Canadian data suggest s an incidence rate of 18.7 and a prevalence of 41.8 per 100,000 individuals [3]. In popula tions over 70 years of age , the prevalence can be as high as 200 cases per 100,000 individuals [4]. While recently two anti-fibrotic medications have been a pproved for clinical use in treating IPF, neither treatment is curative and efficacy varies across patients. In order to improve patient outcomes and enhance long-term quality of life, additional therapies are needed [5]. In the life sciences, animals are used to understand the normal biology of health and disease, and to develop therapeutic interventions [6]. Animal models are valuable, provided that experiments are carefully designed, analy zed and reported. Inadequate experimental design and reporting can result in un -interpretable and un -reproducible studies, and also lead to failures in preclinical drug development [7]. Over the past few decades, several animal models have been used to study the biology of IPF [8]. These models serve as tools to test and understand biological the mechanisms of fibrogenesis , and also to test the efficacy of therapeutic interventions . Due to the idiopathic nature of IPF and the highly complex underlying pathobiology , no single model is able to provide a completely robust analysis . Instead, results must be considered across various pre - clinical platforms . Most IPF animal models involve injury to the lung , which activates wound healing pathways and eventual ly excessive scar formation. Common methods to induce fibrosis include systemic or intratracheal instillation of bleomycin, radiation, intratracheal administration of silica or asbestos, and transgenic mice or gene transfer employing fibrogenic mediators , amongst others . In addition to the commonly used method of intratracheal instillation of bleomycin, there are also multiple other possibilities to administer this agent, including intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intravenous, and through osmotic pumps. All o f these methods are sufficient to induce lung injury and subsequent repair. Of these approaches , intratracheal instillation of bleomycin is the most widely used and best studied [9]. It is a relatively inexpensive system which induces a robust fibrotic response that display s several hi stological hallmarks seen fibroblast proliferat and differentiation, excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins , and destruction of the alveolar architecture . Histological staining and morphometric analysis of lung tissue , quantification of hydroxyproline , and measurements of lung functio n are typical metrics to quantify fibrosis in animals . Overall, t he bleomycin model has proven invaluable in understanding many of the cellular and molecular pathways in fibrogenesis that are central to the current understanding of IPF pathogenesis. Despit e this , the bleomycin model does have limitations. One important limitation is a profound initial inflammatory phase, characterized by up-regulation of acute inflammat ory cytokines such as interleukin -1, -6, and tumor necrosis factor -, together with an i nflux of neutrophils [12, 13] . This inflammation lasts for approximately 7 days before subsid ing into a fibrotic phase which more appropriately mimics the manifestation of IPF in human patients (Figure 1) [14]. Spontaneous reversal of fibrosis , particularly in mice , typically occurs 3 -4 weeks post intratracheal bleomycin administration [15- 18], although several have intratracheal instillations of bleomycin [19, 20] . It is important to note that in the bleomycin model there is overlap between the inflammatory and fibrotic phases, with the initial strong inflammatory response taking up to 10 days post -injury to completely clear. In the study in chapter 4, the 7 -day time point is used as a separation between the inflammatory and fibrotic phases [21]. Since there is no clear distinction between the two phases, using the 7 -day time point to differentiate between pr eventative and therapeutic studies is a limitation that needs to be considered. It is also important to include the phase of inflammation and injury, in addition to the fibrotic phase, in investigational studies, as this phase is required to initiate fibro genesis. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these stages concertedly. These two key features of bleomycin must be critically evaluated when using it to model IPF and assess the efficacy of therapeutic compounds. The fibrotic phase in the bleomycin model is self limited and eventually reversible, but it mimics important elements of the progressive fibrogenesis seen in IPF patients . This fibrotic phase is typically no longer than two weeks, starting one week after the initial injury when the acute inflammat ion subsides , and ending after three weeks when the resolution phase of fibrosis begin s [14]. The \"window\" during which fibrogenic mechanisms can be studied and anti -fibrotic drugs should be tested , is therefore relatively short. When experimental methodologies fail to take this limitation of the bleomycin model into account , the results can be misleading . For example, studies may claim that an intervention has anti -fibrotic effects when in reality it may only interfere with the initial inflammation. This was highlighted in a paper published in 2008 by our gr oup, which described that the vast majority of studies between 1980 and 2006 using the bleomycin model to test antifibrotic efficacy of drugs did not consider the element of appropriate therapeutic timing [21]. Out of 221 studies published during that period , only 10 were designed using a therapeutic treatment regime : starting the administration of an experimental therapy >7 days after bleomycin instillation . This inappropriate use of the experimental fibrosis models may have played a role in the slow pace of drug development in the context of IPF. Here , we performed a systematic review to examine whether the use of the bleomycin model to study antifibrotic effects of compounds has changed since our initial publication in 2008. By advocating for more effective use of this preclinical model , we hope to improve drug development in IPF . METHODS A systematic PubMed search was conducted to capture the relevant literature. The search terms \"Bleomycin AND Pulmonary Fibrosis\" was used to compile a list of publication s between January 1st, 2008 and March 10th, 2019. This search yielded 1816 papers to investigate. Papers were included if they used an in vivo bleomycin model to study the effect of a particular intervention or transgenic animal on fibrosis . Exclude d studies were method papers, review articles, ex vivo , or studies aimed to understand changes in gene and protein expression in bleomycin treated animals without intervention or genetic modification s. Non -English papers were not considered. After applying this inclusion and e xclusion criteria , a total of 976 papers were explored in detail (Figure 2) (Supplemental Table 1) . Number of publications per year was determined by downloading the comma -separated values (CSV) files from PubMed (Figure 3a). All studies using mice in pulmonary fibrosis (silver) were identified by the search term \"Mice and Pulmonary fibrosis\". All bleomycin studies in pulmonary fibrosis were identified by the search term \"Bleomycin and Pulmonary fibrosis\", and publications per year were plotted before (gray) and after (green ) the above mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. We systematically analyzed these papers and pertinent information was extracted. First, the studies were defined by study type - each paper was describ ed as either exploring fibrogenesis in the context of an intervention, a transgenic animal, or both. In studies used an intervention, the timing of intervention was characterized with respect to bleomycin administration as outlined in Moeller 2008 [21]. Intervention beginning <7 days post bleomycin were termed preventative . While i nterventions beginning 7 days post -bleomycin were classified as therapeutic . To adequately understand disease prevention and progression, preventative and t ransgen ic animal studies need to assess inflammatory pathways during the early inflammatory phase in the bleomycin model. Therefore , the characterization of inflammation <7 days post bleomycin was evaluated . Typically, this involved an analysis of the bronchoalve olar lavage fluid through differential cell count s, or an examination of the inflammatory cytokine profile by ELISA or gene expression analysis. Clinical trials conducted in patients suffering from IPF were also searched to allow comparisons with the available basic science data from preclinical -bleomycin trials. Clinical trial data was obtained from clinicaltrials.gov and the definition of associated publicly available data was defined as searchable and retrievable information available on PubMed. RESUL TS Overall Study Characterization. Of the 976 studies published since 2008 that used the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, 74.4% (726 publications) investigated the potential of an intervention on fibrogenesis (i.e., small molecule, antibodies, tradi tional medicine etc.) (Figure 3b). 20.5% (200 publications) of the studies focused on the effect of bleomycin in transgenic animals investigating if certain gene manipulations would increase or decrease suscepti bility to fibrosis. The remaining 5.1% (50 publications) investigated transgenic animals or the combination of transgenic animals and interventions. Intervention Characterization. Of the 726 intervention studies investigated , 61.0% (443 publications) were classified as preventative, while 22.9% (1 66 publications) were therapeutic, with intervention begun not earlier than 7 days after bleomycin administration (Figure 3c). 14.5% (105 publications) of the studies investigated both the preventative and therapeutic ability, comprising a complete assessmen t of intervention efficacy . Bleomycin Results and the Relationship with Clinical Trials . When evaluating the human clinical trials for IPF, it is interesting to note that of the 145 trials investigating 93 compounds/combinations, only 2 5 (26.9%) interven tions had any available preclinical -bleomycin data on PubMed (Figure 3d) (Supplemental Table 2). Of these 25 interventions , 19 had explored drug efficacy in therapeutic models. The remaining 6 8 (73.1%) compounds had no supporting data available. These resu lts are mirrored in the majo r late-phase clinical trials for IPF therapies o utlined by Ahluwalia et al [22]. Of sixteen major trials, only two have provided the standard of evidence to become approved clinical therapi es for IPF : Nintedanib and Pirfenidone . Interestingly, these two therapies , along with Imatinib and Bosentan are the only interventions tested in major Clinical Trials for IPF which have bleomycin model data published on PubMed ( Table 1). Overall, a limita tion with this table is reagents utilized in murine models are sometimes different than the ones utilized in clinical trials, especially with biologic therapies, where subtle changes in protein structure require species -specific reagents. Inflammation Char acterization. 15.8% (7 0 publications ) of the investigated 443 preventative studies assessed inflammation (ie., inflammatory cytokines profile or cell counts) prior to day 7 following bleomycin administration ( Figure 3e). A similar proportion was seen in the transgenic animal studies, where of the 250 publications investigated, 22.8% (57 publications ) assessed inflammation in the inflammatory phase (at or before day 7) in the bleomycin model. DISCUSSION The administration of bleomycin into the airways of small rodents is the most commonly used experimental system to study the IPF pathology and serves as a widely used pre-clinical model to test potential therapeutic compounds [9]. In order to get the best possible information from experimental models , it is imperative to apply appropri ate research methodology that reflects what is seen clinically in IPF patients . In this study , we used the same definition s for preventative and therapeutic interventions as in our previous work and evaluate d how experimental practice has changed in the l ast decade [21]. In contrast to the extremely low 5% of studies that were therapeutically timed prior to 2007 , in the past decade about 37.4% (271 publications) of intervention studies in the bleomycin model adequately assessed therapeutic ef ficacy (Figure 3c). This marked shift in how the bleomycin model is being used in work published between 2008 and 2019 compared to the two decades prior to 2007, highlights how researchers are receptive to change and are now more effectively using the bleomycin model to study IPF . The use of animals for medical research has become an important point of discussion from an ethical and political perspective [23]. The recent ERS Task Force \"Optimizing Experimental Research in Respiratory Diseases\" has addressed this impo rtant issue [6]. It concluded that s ubstantial efforts have been undertaken by the scientific community , including the developme nt and application of the 3Rs principles (Refinement, Reduction, Replacement) that were introduced 60 years ago to establish the highest standards for humane experimentation on animals [24]. The refined use of the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis as described here is a reflection and proof that scientist s are willing to learn and apply the best experimental practice to comply with the 3R principles and animal research ethics . Further success in this context can be achieved by continuing to promote this message. One of the key questions to experimental scientists is whether their models are useful to predict the success or failure of novel drugs in clinical studies. In theory, pr e-clinical models do exactly this, but in reality , this is not so easily quantifiable . With regard to pulmonary fibrosis, the last deca de has been filled with debates regarding the most appropriate \"end -point\" for both clinical trials and experimental stud ies. From the pre -clinical perspective, it is crucial to use the models as appropriately as possible , and interpret the findings within the limitations of the modeling. Whether data from the bleomycin model is a prerequisite for the progression of a drug candidate into the clinical trial landscape is obviously driven by the institution or company that develops the product. However, it is important for everyone in the field to understand how potential anti -fibrotic therapies work in the biological system . We asked in our analysis , how novel compounds considered for the treatment of IPF were used in the bleomycin model and how their preclinical \"success\" compared to their clinical \"success\". A review by Ahluwalia et al. summarized how recent clinical trials re late to the pathogenesis of IPF and was used as a baseline for our analysis [22]. Ahluwalia et al. highlighted 16 compounds that were tested in clinical phase II and III trials in the last decade. Of these molecules , two have been approved for clinical use in IPF (nintedanib and pirfenidone) . Pirfenidone has by now been approved for the treatment of IPF in most countries [25- 27]. The exact mode of action for this small molecule remains elusive , however, evidence from several clinical trials has convincingly shown that this drug reduces FVC decline in patients with progressive IPF [26]. Pre-clinica l data for pirfenidone in the bleomycin model is available in both preventative and therapeutic settings , which show this molecule reduces TGF - levels, fibrocyte migration , and the accumulation of pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts [28-30]. Pirfenidone is also able to reduce the accumulation of hydroxyproline and levels of procollagen I and III in these models [31]. Nintedanib is also approved in many countries and demonstrates a similar potential for slowing FVC decline in patients with IPF [32, 33] . [34, 35] . small molecule attenuates processes that are essential for fibrosis such as TGF --induced deposition of collagen and histological fibrosis in the bleomycin model. The literature provides many examples of Ninteda nib's efficacy in both preventative and therapeutically designed bleomycin animal trials. The success of these drugs in the therapeutically timed bleomycin models followed by clinical trials and FDA approva l, suggests that there are overlaps in the underl ying mechanisms of fibrosis in IPF and in the mouse model of bleomycin exposure. Therefore, while we may not have great insight into the mechanisms of IPF or bleomycin -induced fibrosis, this overlap provides considerable impetus for continued efforts to fi nd new efficacious therapeutic applications in the bleomycin model. Sildenafil is another drug that showed efficacy in both therapeutic and preventative version s of the bleomycin model. Although the STEP -IPF trial that tested sildenafil in patients with ad vanced IPF was labeled as a \"negative\" trial [36], sildenafil was recently tested in combination with Nintedanib in the INSTAGE trial in patients with advanced IPF [37]. While this trial did not meet its primary endpoint of changing quality of life, it nevertheless showed that patients treated with the combination of nintedanib plus sildenafil had a reduced decline in FVC than patients treated with Nintedanib alone, suggesting additive antifibrotic effects of the combination in this patient population. Another similar trial testing the combination of pirfenidone plus sildenafil for severe IPF is still ongoing (NCT02951429). Of the 16 recent phase II and III clinical trials outlined by Ahluwalia et al. six have available data on PubMed regarding their efficacy in the bleomycin model (Table 1 )[22]. Pirfenidone, Nintedanib as well as Bosentan are only three of the sixteen trials with available therapeutic timing results. This data provides support for the notion that potential therapies have a better chance at clinical trial success if they are effective in a therapeutic model of bleomycin. For example, and in contrast to both Pirfen idone and Nintedanib, t he small molecule dual endothelin receptor inhibitor , Bosentan wa s unsuccessful in two separate phase III clinical trials [38, 39] . In this case , most of the publicly available data for this molecule was preventative, and only recently in 2017 a therapeutic study was published [40-42]. The preventative studies showed an overall decrea se in collagen proteins and mRNA, as well as a reduction of -SMA positive cells in the lung tissue . Several studies have also revealed that preventative bosentan treatment attenuate s total and differential inflammatory cell counts [41, 43] . Therefore, bosentan may interfere with the -induced inflammation , which subsequently prevents pro-fibrotic pathways from being activated . Furthermore, the recent therapeutic stud y noted that bosentan was effective at inhibiting bleomycin -induced collagen fibers and lung fibrosis only when admi nistered in the preventative, and not the therapeutic phase [42]. Together , these findings illustrate the importan ce of proper experimental timing in the bleomycin model . Of course, this conclusion is based on interpretation of publicly available data alone , and it may well be that unpublished data on therapeutic bleomycin studies exist . This issue of unavailable dat a can be further illustrated by assessing the preclinical literature available for the 145 clinical trials that have te sted or are currently testing 93 unique compounds or combinations to treat IPF . Out of these 93 interventions , no associated animal data was found for 6 8 on public databases (Figure 3d) (Supplemental Table 2) . Of the 2 5 interventions with available preclinical data, 20 were assessed therapeutically . Without comprehensive information available to the scientific community , it is impossible to ascertain why certain compounds may have failed in clinical trials and whether this can be attributed to inappropriate use of pre-clinical models . Better transparency and publication of experimental data, positive and negative has recently been proposed b y the ERS Task Force called \"Optimizing experim ental models of lung diseases\" [6]. The importance of therapeutic timing in the bleomycin model for drug development in IPF is obvious, but this does not discard the value of interventions during the initial inflammatory phase . Analyzing the impact of interventions during the initiation of fibrosis allows for investigation into fibrot ic pathways that may be linked to certain pro -fibrotic aspects of inflammation. This type of understanding is particularly important when considering pro - fibrotic macrophages, fibrocytes, and other bone marrow -derived cells which are not typical of the classical acute inflammatory pathways , and contribute to fibrosis in a major way . For these preventative interventional studies , it is key that inflammation in the early phase is characterized thoroughly by cell differential s and quantification of inflammator y cytokines . It is also clear that preventative treatment regimens may impact both the inflammatory landscape and the level of cellular damage, affecting both inflammation and lung fibrosis. We found that of 443 preventative studies, only 70 (15.8%) provid ed such information (Figure 3e). Many of these studies reported a decrease in global inflammation following the intervention but still claim ed to show anti-fibrotic effects . Similar data is seen in studies using transgenic animals , where therapeutic timing is often not a viable option except for inducible genetic knockout s. Between 2008 and 2019, of the 250 reported bleomycin studies in transgenic animals , only 57 (22.8%) characterized inflammation prior to day 7 post bleomycin administration (Figure 3e). The remaining 77 .2% of studies d id not investigate or at least not report any inflammation details. This information is critical to understand how a particular gene or pathway may contribute to fibrogenesis and potential ly serve as novel therapeutic target s. Therefore, t he scientific community needs to more rigorous ly assess these basic features in the early inflammatory phase to capitalize on its utility in pre -clinical experimental research. While the bleomycin model has been widely employed, it is also i mportant to consider its limitations and the various other models that exist, and suitability for the evaluation of the target and therapy being investigated. Subjective to the target of interest and/or method of therapeutic intervention, it is critical to select a suitable system for testing from the toolbox of animal pulmonary fibrosis models. The expression of the selected mechanism of action may vary between models, and awareness of this prior to investigation, as well as critical timepoints of expressi on of these mechanisms in the model, is of substantial worth. Depending on the pathobiological processes studied, clear characterization of the kinetics of the process studied and appropriate timing of intervention is key. A clinically relevant model is wh ere a molecular or cellular process have been shown to be present in the pathological human setting, and characterized in the corresponding animal model. This is applicable to all models of disease. This model is also not without limitations. In the bleomy cin model, the injury phase precedes the fibrogenic phase (although it must be remembered that there is no clear -cut distinction in timing between these phases) and that treatments administered early which reduce the injury/inflammation aspects of the mode l, will also impact the fibrotic part of the model. A reduction in injury will also result in a reduced need for repair mechanisms. Therefore, treatment may not have a real antifibrotic effect, but rather \"anti -bleomycin -induced injury\" effects. In order t o claim that treatment prevents extracellular matrix deposition, it needs to be tested in a system and at a time when extracellular matrix deposition is occurring. Additionally, concerns also exist about translatability to the patient setting. In patients, although drug -induced lung fibrosis, such as by bleomycin, has been described as reversible if the drug is discontinued , as explained by The Drug -Induced Respiratory Disease Website (www.pneumotox.com), sometimes reversal does not occur. Although resolvin g IPF has not yet been described, there is growing belief in the research community that resolution and cure are potentially attainable, through the reprogramming of phagocytic cells. In conclusion, the bleomycin model of lung fibrosis is still , by far , the most common and fastest growing experimental tool in this field (Figure 3a). In 2018, bleomycin studies comprised 60.6% of all publications that used mice to investigate pulmonary fibrosis , and the number of publications per year using bleomycin to study pulmonary fibrosis has more than doubled since 2008. Bleomycin is widely used for preclinical mechanistic research , and for preclinical studies to test drug efficacy. The basic science methodology of timing drug administration in the bleomycin model has s een a significant shift over the past 11 years compared to the period before . Both currently approved IPF drugs, pirfenidone , and nintedanib have convincing therapeutic efficacy in the bleomycin model . For the majority of compounds that were clinically tested in the past 15 years for the treatment of IPF, only 26.9% had published bleomycin -tested data. While a more thoughtful use of the model throughout the literature is evident , there is still a substantial lack of data sharing in this field. We do, howeve r, acknowledge that utilizing other search engines, in addition to PubMed could potentially allow for the identification of additional studies not included in this analysis. Despite improvements over the last decade, scientists from both private and academ ic sectors should strive to optimize this experimental model of lung fibrosis , as it will prove imperative to facilitat e cutting edge drug development for IPF. FIGURE LEGEND Figure 1: Illustration of the appropriate times to begin intervention within t he bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis. The upper (earlier) checkered line represents the time of bleomycin exposure and the beginning of a week -long period dominated by inflammation. The second checkered line represents the beginning of a two -week perio d dominated by fibrotic events. The central panel, with no treatment, features both the inflammatory and fibrotic aspects of the model. With preventative treatment (applied at the time of bleomycin exposure in the left panel), fibrosis is absent as a resul t of preventing inflammation. With therapeutic treatment (applied after the resolution of inflammation in the right pane) prevention of fibrosis can be attributed to events independent of inflammation.
