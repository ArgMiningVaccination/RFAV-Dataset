It is consistent with the twelve-step recovery. - Acupuncture detoxification can be successfully incorporated with a wide range of other addiction treatment methods. - It can treat the whole person - body, mind, emotions, and spirit, not just symptoms. - The treatment provides immediate and long-lasting effects. - Acupuncture detoxification itself is non-addictive. - It improves the body's ability to heal itself. - Increased sense of vitality immediately after treatment. - You will experience calmness and relaxation. - It helps you cope with the past and prepare for better reception of therapeutic counseling, groups, and other challenges.
