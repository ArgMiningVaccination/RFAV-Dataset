L.-111brievp,56r\\ EDUCATIONAL AttitudeBy Chris Joosen, WEMT\"Extreme' avalanche danger?Ah! Its all a matter of opinion!\"The avalanche bulletin hadbeenpostedwithits\"Extreme\" warning fromthe day before when wearrived at Hermit Lake at7:20 am.It was a clearmorning with light windsblowing from the west at20-30mph. The snowcattracks squeaked to a haltasMarianneusedthebinoculars to get a betterview of what looked like a800 - 1000ft fracture line. Liz, the AMC Tuckerman Ravinecaretaker, walked out of her cabin to greet us. \"Can youbelieve those guys!\" belted from her lungs while she pointedtoward the Sluice. Marianne passed the binoculars across thecab.I could see two guys walking around in mini circles ona stamped-out tent ledge 20feet above the 5 foot deep crownline.Liz continued \"I spoke to one of those guys last nightand he assured me he was not illegally camped and was not inavalanche terrain including runout zones!\"As we headed into the ravine, the severity of what these twohikers had done ran through my mind. It is difficult to believethat even someone with no avalanche awareness at all wouldhikeintoTuckermanRavineduringa snowstorm,acknowledge the \"Extreme\" avalanche bulletin, travel throughnumerous terrain traps, head up 38-44degree slopes, punchthrough between the knee- and mid-thigh \"OK, Chris,\" I said tomyself, \"forget about the illegal camping issue just this once.Make them understand how lucky they are to be alive!Education, Education, Education!\" Marianne and I stood at thebottom of the ravine atop a debris pile the size of two football2fields watching the two descend toward us. They weredescending with ropes while down climbing using a systemnever before seen by humans. It was painful to watch theirexcruciatingly slow progress on a 40degree slope.I figuredthey were either extremely shook up by the slide or very newto snow travel.The fracture line was impressive, zigzagging across the bowl,up towards the Lip, down around the Sluice, and into Rightgully, totaling about one thousand feet across. The crownvaried from2to 6 feet. Over the last 3.6 hours the summit ofMt. Washington had received over 18inches of fresh snowwith winds peaking the night before at 123mph from the west.I was looking forward to doing a fracture-line profile toexamine the weak layer which caused the slope failure whenthecampers finallyarrived.We greeted eachother,commenting on the beautiful day as I segued into an avalancheawareness discussion.Using the utmost in diplomacy, Iattempted to make them realize the extent of the errors theyhad madein essence breaking every rule in the book.Although French-Canadian, they spoke English well, solanguage was not a barrier. But for some reason we were notcommunicating. Marianne and I began switching in and out ofthe discussion allowing the other to regroup and gatherthoughts in an attempt to get the point across in a differentway.I explained the mistakes a group of four French-Canadians had made six weeks before causing them to becomeavalanched, which killed one and injured another, just twothousand feet from where we stood. Over the fifteen minutediscussionit was apparent that they had no avalancheawareness and had no interest in learning or listening to whatwe had to say.I pulled out all I had in my bag of tricks,reiterating most of what I had said the night before at anavalanche awareness talkI had given at SOLO.I wasstumped. The more vocal of the two finally looked at me andsaid, \"Ah!, Its all a matter of opinion.\" With that the twoturned away and headed across the massive debris field theymay or may not have caused I dropped to my butt inBEST COPY AVAILABLE disbelief, sitting among the piles of debris the avalanchedemons sent down in the night. I had failed. This is what Ido, my life, my passion. I'm a professional ... right...? It wasthe winter of '96, with six fatalities three by avalancheburials in the Mt. Washington area and 2 more fatal burials ineastern Canada, that finally turned the tide in my head.Education, Education, Education. I need to get to them beforethey arrive at my doorstep! More slide shows, more avalanchetalks, more awareness courses. Assist interested groups indeveloping teaching curriculum.., the list never ends.The Bigger Picture:The Eastern Avalanche ForecasterThrough the past eight winters working in Tuckerman andHuntington Ravines, I have seen the above scenario occur overand over. This ignorance (or arrogance) has been somethingI have come to expect from day-to-day, but something I willnever get accustomed to or accept. Over time, recognition ofthese attitudes sit like a pain in my stomach eagerly desiringa cure.Being a Snow Ranger for the United States Forest Service hasbeen an incredibly rewarding job. It truly allows me to makea positive difference in peoples lives while they are doing thethings they love. The direct contact with individuals in thefield while in uniform is something that can't be replaced.Visitors know they can always come to us and receive adviceabout avalanche conditions on their intended route. We arehere for one reason public service, helping those visiting thearea any way we can. The Forest Service employs four SnowRangers whose responsibility is public safety. Our twopriorities are putting out a daily avalanche forecast in a timelymanner for eight gullies in Huntington Ravine and eight gulliesand snowfields in Tuckerman Ravine and acting as lead agencyfor search and rescue (SAR) events in the area.Assessing avalanche hazard is an art that involves neverturning off the senses.Our minds begin collecting data assoon as we wake.Listening to the winds howl outside, theway the snow brushes off our cars, how snow swirls over theguardrails on the way to work, and the way snow crunchesunderfoot as we approach the Forest Service garage are all tinybits of information that we begin to assimilate beforedetermining the danger rating for the day. The \"on the clock\"day starts at seven a.m. in our garage which houses a snowcatand two snowmobiles. These three machines are critical to ourtask of timely forecasts and SAR response. On the way intothe ravines we talk with as many folks as we can about whatis happening in the snowpack, the ravines, particular gullies,andtheweather forecast fromtheMt.WashingtonObservatory. In mid-winter these contacts often number in thehundreds. When March, April, and May arrive, the numbersbecome daunting as up to 3500 people may head intoTuckerman on a sunny weekend day for spring skiing. Whenwe think we have seen it all, each spring skiing season bringsa whole new set of unbelievable situations. The ignorance ofsome is often staggering. \"Why is that party of six tied intoone rope marching up Left Gully, through waist deep snow, 2when it is posted at \"High\" avalanche danger?\" \"Why is thatguy getting into an inflatable boat on top of the Duchess, a1500' long, 50 degree gully?!!\" And then there's the ultimatenightmare which seems to happen at least once a season...It's late April/early May on a Saturday morning at seven am.The 6\" snowfall overnight and westerly 40 mph winds hasloaded all lee slopes with 2-4 feet of new wind slab causingHIGH avalanche danger. Pinkham Notch Visitor Center callsus over the radio.There are already 1,000 people in theparking lot or heading up the trail the first wave should behere in 30 minutes! Some stories you can chuckle over, butthis scenario is terrifying. What can we do? We manage thearea without any explosives or control measures, so these arenot options. We also do not close the ravine. Ok, how aboutthe avalanche bulletin? What can we write to impress uponpeople the severity of the situation? We think back uponsimilar instances from the past and grimace. No matter whatwe post for the hazard, a few decide that they are mightierthan the all-powerful avalanche and trudge up their intendedrun. Once the crowds see someone anyone in the \"High\"area, they seem to immediately determine \"well, that area mustbe fine.\" The \"Human Factor\" pulls the once apprehensiveinto a false sense of security. The problem is unbelievable.How can we effectively relay avalanche awareness upon sucha diverse user group? Families, college outing clubs, churchgroups, extreme skiers, recreational snowboarders, casualhikers, and inner tubers are just some of the categories of the3,000 people that will be either watching or participating inhigh-angle snow sports by 1:00 pm. How can we effectivelyhelp the average Mt. Washington visitor to understand thehazards they are encountering when using Tuckerman andHuntington Ravines? How can these visitors make educateddecisions and mitigate the hazards they face? Why is the mixof eastern terrain, arctic-maritime weather, and the humanfactor of the diverse Easterner a problem in avalanche terrain?Ultimately, who are these people and what drives them to behere?The Problem:The \"Human Factor\" of theEasterner, theObjective Snowpack ina Climate ofUneducated Users, Arctic Weather Conditions,, and Easy Access to Avalanche TerrainEasterners are unique individuals in the avalanche world. Theylove and pursue their snow related sports as much as in theWest.However, they do so mostly out of the avalancheenvironment. They don't contend with road closures, ski areasclosings to complete control work, avalanche zoning forhousing construction, wearing a transceiver while driving overa pass, driving through snow sheds, etc. the constantreminders that many Westerners go through winter to winterliving in snow country.The east coast commercial ski area is 99% avalanche freewith the exception of a few unique alpine snowfields or onrare occasions, manmade snow avalanches. Both of theserarely cause a hazard for the skier. Most eastern ice climbing,JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1998 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER but not all, usually occur in areas free from avalanche hazard.So the Easterner is brought up in an environment free fromavalanche hazard. This has allowed him or her to master theirparticular sport before avalanche awareness has even enteredthe picture.Thisisnot a uniquely eastern phenomenon; however,throughout North America, avalanche professionalsareconfronted with users whose skills in skiing, snowboarding, iceclimbing, or snow machining far surpasses their avalancheskills. In the East some avalanche hazard exists throughout theentire area. However, this hazard is relatively rare until youreach Northern New England. The mountains from theAdirondacks through Vermont, New Hampshire, and intoMaine hold over 95% of the avalanche terrain in the easternUnited States.Avalanche terrain continues into Quebec,including the Chic-Chocs of Gaspe and La Monte Valainesoutside the city of Chicoutium. The two areas with significantavalanche terrain within the eastern United States includeKatandin in central northern Maine and the Presidential Rangein northern New Hampshire within the White Mountains. Dueto Katandin's remote location and the Maine State Park'srigorous screening process, the area sees relatively few peoplethrough the course of a winter. In addition, the state parkrangers close the mountain if they perceive there is avalanchedanger with a red light/green light system. This red light/greenlight system restricts access to major avalanche terrain and isanother factor limiting exposure to terrain in the Katandin area.Then there is the Presidential Range. This mountain rangeincludes 12 major ravines or gulfs, 10 of which havesignificant avalanche hazard. In the midst of these stands isMt. Washington whose eastern flanks include Tuckerman andHuntington Ravines. This area has been \"the\" area to go to fora winter mountain experience. Since the 1920's, TuckennanRavine has been actively used as one of the earliest ski areasin the country. Before the days of cut ski trails TuckermanRavine offered excellent access to large open snow fields.Neighboring Huntington Ravine known as the birthplace ofAmerican ice climbing has also been very popular since thefirst routes were established in the 20's. Until the late 1960's,with the ice revolution and radical equipment innovations,Huntington Ravine was considered one of the most technicallydifficult ice climbing areas in the country. Today Huntingtonis not seen as a technically challenging area, but it is seen asone of the most committing areas in the country due to Mt.Washington's horrendous arctic weather.The Mt. Washington area is notorious for a number of reasons.First, it is a convergence of 3 major storm tracks. Stormscome across the country, down from Canada (often seen inthe Alberta Clipper track) bringing arctic temperatures, andup the coast bringing heavy precipitation called a Northeaster.Mt. Washington can see these storms hitting back-to-back. Acommon scenario may involve midwinterprecipitationdropping an inch of rain at 32 degrees F. Overnight, as anarctic front barrels in from the NW with winds between 100and 120 mph, the temperature may drop 40-50 degrees. Thesnow surface becomes a sheet of ice. Twenty-four hours latera Northeaster drops a foot of new snow on the ice layercausing widespread avalanche activity. Clearly, the mix ofarctic and maritime climates work together to develop a uniqueavalanche situation in the United States. The symbioticrelationship is an ideal environment for \"direct action\" activity(avalanching that occurs during or immediately after a storm).Mt. Washington has been considered an excellent place to trainfor the big mountains such as the Alaska range or theHimalaya. However, a misunderstanding exists. True, it is anexcellent place totrainfor the big mountains becauseconditions can equal any big mountain in the world reservingsusceptibility to altitude problems. But, overwhelmingly, it isa great training locationfor one reason:access.Mt.Washington is one of the most dangerous mountains in NorthAmerica due to its easy access to the urban centers of the East.Seventy million people live within a day's drive of the WhiteMountains. This proximity, along with a state that maintainsits highways very well, equals quick access. Once anindividual arrives at Pinkham Notch and parks at the visitorcenter he or she can be in either Tuckerman or HuntingtonRavine in about one hour.It is this easy access that causesdiverse individuals to visit the mountain. On any one day wesee both the world-class mountaineer training for a Himalayantrip and the family of four in jeans and sneakers with soakingwet feet who are \"just going up to watch.\" Because of thisphenomenon Washington is referred to as the LI= BigMountain.Although not unique to New England the ultimate problemcomes down to the objectivity of the unstable snowpack. Thechute, the snowpack, and the weak layer don't care what yourexperience level is whether it happens to be 30 years ofavalanche forecasting experience or the first day your eyes seesnow. It is objective.It has no concern that this is your onlyweekend to ski the backcountry, that you drove 6 hours, or thatyou've skied 2 hours to get first tracks. Your weight transferthrough the snow pack is all that matters the relationshipbetween stress and strength. Basically, weight that overcomesthe strength of the weakest layer in the snowpack precipitatesthe danger.When the four factors are mixed: the \"human factor\" of theEasterner, Arctic conditions, easy access, and the objectivesnowpack in a world of uneducated users, an environment isgenerated that is conducive to tragedy.The Solution:Education and Informationin All FormsEducation in avalanche awareness, as in all subjects, is amatter of following an orderly progression to get to the root ofthe issue or problem.In the avalanche environment it iscritical that we get to the visitor before he or she arrives at theroot of the matteravalanche terrain. If a visitor's firstavalanche exposure is at a backcountry hut reading a warningdescribing moderate avalanche danger for the day, it is, inmany ways already too late. The individual asks, \"What is4JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1998 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER Moderate?\" \"Well, it says here in the bulletin that avalanchesare'possible.\"' To many thisdoesn't sound toobad.Moderate conjures up images similar to middle-of-the-road,medium, average, mild, and even to some, reasonable.Without education and the understanding of what \"Moderate\"can mean, many let their guard down. \"It is only Moderate...right\" But the fact is that nationwide more people are killed orinjured under \"Moderate\" hazard than any other type ofavalanche conditions.It is critical to give this individual an opportunity to educatehim or herself. Ultimately, the responsibility is on the visitorto avalanche country to seek out the information available tothem.However, by actively offering numerous levels ofavalancheeducation,we createanatmosphere whichencourages participation.The tragedies of 1996 in the end have had some positiveimpacts on the participation in avalanche education. Easternerswere slapped in the face.\"How could this happen here?\"Unfortunately, in the realm of the avalanche demonsignorance is not bliss.All at once backcountry users wantedto go to a slide show or take an avalanche course. We haverecognized the insatiable appetite for avalanche awareness fromthe public and responded.Approximately two dozen slide shows are scheduled annuallyaround the Mount Washington area to spread the gospel aboutavalanches,self-rescue, and awareness about the USFSprogram and our role on Mt. Washington. Our generalavalanche information also continues to increase. Our homepage, TUCKERMAN.ORG, containing safety informationabout the Ravines and the daily avalanche forecast began lastyear. A double-sided six-panel Tuckerman brochure is alsoavailable. Within a month a 2.55 x 4.5\" avalanche card willbe available that will include some avalanche basics, the 5-scale warning system, and phone numbers to access the 24-hour avalanche information recording.In addition to the NSP \"Basic Avalanche Course,\" and the\"Advanced Avalanche Course,\" that we have offered for years,we have started the process of considerably expanding ouravalanche education and information programs. On theeducation front the greatest goal is the elimination of anavalanche course \"waiting list.\" We are currently in a situationwhere more individuals want to take a course than we haveslots to accommodate. We must overcome this, and we are onthe road to succeeding.In addition to the above courses wenow hold two avalanche rescue courses and are in the processof developing curriculums for several other courses withdifferent groups.We are working with Chauvin GuidesInternational, International Mountain Climbing School(IMCS),and SOLO to develop and hold avalanche awareness andhigher level courses on a yearly basis. Each program discussesattitude in avalanche country, the avalanche triad (snowpack,weather, terrain), safe travel and route finding in avalancheterrain, self-rescue including the all important beacon, probe,and shovel, and understanding the avalanche danger ratingsystem.This last category should not be underestimated inimportance. Although it is up to each person to evaluate in thefield whether they are going to cross an avalanche-prone slopeor not, the current avalanche posting can be a valuable tool inmaking a decision. In the East a majority of those traveling inavalanche terrain do so where an avalanche bulletin is issueddaily.They do so without any avalanche awareness orunderstanding of what the danger for the day Low,Moderate, Moderate/High, High, or Extreme means. Forexample, \"Low\" to mean no danger.Or asstatedearlier,\"Moderate\" generatesfeelings ofcomplacency or ambivalence. It is for this reason that thedanger scale rating should be discussed and explained in anyeastern avalanche awareness program. By offering thesevarious levels of educational programs, we give individualsopportunities based on their interest and time availability. Thegoal is to provide anumber of options for conflictingschedules in our busy world. If individuals have a dozenoptions or more, there is a greater likelihood they will take acourse. More courses also allow for smaller enrollmentsenabling participants to receive more attention. Positiveexperiences in these courses will lead participants to encouragefriends to pursue the same experience. In varying degrees thisgets the participant started down the road to understanding theinfinite world of avalanche awareness.We hope that this dramatic increase in information andeducation is sought out and used to increase awareness of whatmost have seen as a mysterious topic the avalanche. Oncea basic understanding is developed, we can eliminate the feargenerated through ignorance and enjoy the beauty of themountains in a safer manner.All of us enjoy challenging ourselves in the outdoors. Beingoutside is something that drives many of our lives. Thethought of \"challenging the mountains\" conjures up images of,defeat, fulfillment, and victory. Our outdoor skills developover years which allow us to have better understanding of ourenvironment. However, there must be an understanding of thedifference between challenging the outdoors and challengingthe avalanche demons.You cannot continue challengingavalanches and not pay the price. As the saying goes, \"If youlive by the sword, you die by the sword.\" This fact must alterthe way we think about the mountains. Over time, we need tolearn how to work with the hazards of snow. Time in thefield, under competent instruction, develops skills in safe traveltechniques, the recognition of instability and weak layers in thesnow pack, and a long life in snow country. Through thisexperience we learn that it is not \"a matter of opinion.\"Different human opinions do not influence the mountain orsnowpack. Snow instability is there, it is factual, but it is upto us to seek out the information and clues the mountain isgiving us to evaluate the degree of slope stability. When wecan respect and accept the mountain on its own objective termsand leave arrogance behind, we will understand nature's powerover us.Only then are we ready to learn and educateourselves before the avalanche teaches us a hard lesson.Humility allows us to see that we can never win. We mustplay the game on the mountain's terms every time, from the 4 JANUARY/FEBRUARY 19985WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER first day for the rest of our lives. From day one we mustunderstand who is in control, who is Alpha, in charge, morepowerful, and who ultimately can take our lives. Beforelearning any of the fundamentals of avalanche awareness, safetravel, stability tests, natures warning, we must become awareof ourselves and the attitude we bring into the hills. It is onlythrough this change in attitude and mindset that we can humblylive and play in avalanche terrain.About the Author: Chris Joosen is in his fifth season as aUnited States Forest Service Snow Ranger in the Tuckerman& Huntington Ravines of Mt.

CARING FOR THEAVALANCHE VICTIMBy Buck TiltonIn two out of every three deaths by avalanche, the victimsuffocates. Most of the remaining fatalities are the result oftrauma, usually to the head and neck (cervical spine). Almostall living victims are suffering, to some extent, from shock andhypothermia, and they may have other injuries hidden insidetheir cold-weather clothing. They need to be transported out ofthe mountains. Immediate care of any avalanche victiminvolves 1) basic life support, and 2) stabilizing their cervicalspine in case it has been injured, and 3) treatment for shockand cold injury. Extended care of the victim requires acomplete check (assessment) for any other problems, treatmentof the problems, prevention of further injury, and evacuationof the victim. None of this care can be neatly outlined,memorized, and followed exactly when needed. Each situationis different, every emergency unique. Sound judgement shouldlead to reasonable acts based on knowledge and experience.BASIC LIFE SUPPORTAll haste should be made to uncover the buried victim's headfirst, being careful not to cut them up with your shovel in therush to save them. It is usually quicker to dig from slightlydownhill and angle in to a victim buried more than three orfour feet down, since it's easier to shovel the snow out of thehole you're digging. As soon as their face is uncovered, cleartheir airway by removing any clumps of snow from theirmouth and nose, and continue digging until their head, chest,and diaphragm are free. Open the victim's airway safely bystabilizing their head and neck with two hands while pushingup on the angle of their lower jaw with your index fingers (thejaw thrust), or by stabilizing the head with one hand and liftingthe chin with the other (the chin lift). Check for breathing, andstart mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, if needed. As digging 5continues, someone, ideally, should check for a carotid pulse.A great deal of effort should go into checking for a pulse. It isoften very difficult to detect pulses in a cold victim, and failureto find one does not mean all hope is lost. Certainly, the oldadage applies here: no one is dead until they are warm anddead.When should cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) be started?This is not an easy question to answer. There is a possibilitythe victim has a cold, rigid heart, beating weakly, but withenough energy to maintain life. A cold heart is fragile, andCPR will likely cause it to stop beating. And, if a victim hascooled to the point where their body has grown rigid, CPRwon't work anyway. On the other hand, if they are dead andonly semi-cold, CPR has an excellent chance of saving theirlife. Generally, if the victim has been buried less than twohours, and they are pulseless, CPR should be started, andcontinued as long as it doesn't create a risk to the rescuers.Mter two hours of burial, CPR will probably be either uselessor more dangerous than helpful. Statistically, CPR seldomworks on dead avalanche victims.Although severe bleeding is uncommon in avalanche victims,they still deserve a check for life-threatening blood loss.Bleeding may be hidden deep inside bulky clothing, and theonly way to check is to run your hands quickly underneathheavy parkas and sweaters. STABILIZING THE CERVICAL SPINEConscious or unconscious, all victims should be removed fromthe snow gently. As mentioned, rough handling may stop acold heart. Mismanagement of a damaged cervical spine carriesthe additional risk of turning a victim with an unstable neckinto someone forever paralyzed ... or dead. All avalanchevictims have a broken neck until proven otherwise. Ideally,one rescuer should hold the victim's head and neck stablewhile other rescuers take hold of the victim's body and moveit as a unit, under direction of the head-holder, out of thesnow. With a shortage of rescuers, do the best you can. Gentledragging of the victim may be the safest option. Unfortunately,even in conscious victims, only X-rays can ultimately detectthe presence or absence of spinal injury. The safest procedureis to improvise a cervical collar to hold their neck reasonablystable during the transport out. And, on the transport out, thevictim should be secured to a rigid litter or toboggan toprevent further spinal damage.HEAD INJURYSometimes head injuries are obvious, but the avalanche victimtendsto demonstrate more subtle signs and symptomsindicating their brain is swelling inside of a very enclosedspace, their cranium. If conscious, they become increasinglydisoriented, irritable, and combative ...and, later, deeplyunconscious. They may complain of a headache, and they liketo vomit. Their heart rates will slow down and increase instrength, and their breathing often becomes erratic. They may6JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1998 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER start to show unusual bruising around their eyes (if a slab hitthem in the front of their head), or behind and below their ears(if the slab hit them from behind). Treat them as if they hada cervical spine injury, and try to keep their head slightlyhigher than their feet. If they're having difficulty breathing,start mouth-to-mouth breathing for them, ventilating them eachtime they try to take a breath on their own. If a rescue teamhas arrived with supplemental oxygen, start a high-flow rateimmediately. Rapid evacuation iscritical.Unfortunately,patients with serious head injuries seldom do well when ahospital is far away.SHOCKExpect all avalanche victims to demonstrate, to some extent,signs and symptoms of shock: rapid and weak heart rate, rapidand shallow respiratory rate, pale and cold skin (which is due,at least partially, to the snow), and an altered level ofconsciousness. Shock describes the condition of an inadequateflow of well-oxygenated blood. Injuries, pain, fear, and coldare all a part of the problem. Shock can kill, even long afterthe victim has been recovered from beneath the snow.Field treatment for shock should include maintaining an openairway, getting the patient warm and dry, and lying down withtheir feet slightly higher than their head. Avalanche victims areoften dehydrated, which adds to the problems of shock andcold. If they are fully conscious, they may be given fluids,preferably warm fluids. All treatment should be given in acalm and reassuring manner. Supplemental oxygen, once again,would be very beneficial. As you treat for shock, you are alsotreating for hypothermia.HYPOTHERMIAYou may also expect all avalanche victims to be sufferingfrom hypothermia, a loss of body core temperature. Anyonewho stays too cold for too long will have serious disturbancesin the normal functioning of their body. Mild hypothermiacauses loss of mental acuity, incoordination, and, as thevictim'score temperature dropsto around 95 degreesFahrenheit,uncontrollableshivering.Moreprofoundhypothermia may result in a comatose patient with barelydetectable, sometimes undetectable, pulse and respirations, andrigid muscles. They often look dead. Profound hypothermia isnot common in avalanche victims, however, since they moreoften die of suffocation or trauma before they cool off thatmuch.For all hypothermics, treatment includes getting them out ofthe wet and cold and into the warm and dry. First, get themout of the snow, preferably into some form of shelter and ontoan insulating layer. Remove their clothing, gently, and bundlethem up in thick insulation: dry clothing, sleeping pads, otherpeople. A radiation barrier, such as a sheet of plastic, spaceblanket, or a tent's fly, as a final wrap, will insure the patientretains as much body heat as possible. The total product issometimes referred to as a \"hypothermia wrap.\" Chemical heatpacks or warm water bottles, placed inside the \"wrap\" atstrategic areas of their body (neck, armpits, groin, palms of thehands, soles of the feet), will do much to help them rewarm.If they are conscious, fix them something warm to drink.Unconscious hypothermics, especially those that seem dead,require very gentle handling. Remember, they are fragile fromthe cold. They should be treated with the same hypothermiawrap. But don't try to force warm drinks down their throats.Of great benefit would be a high-flow of warmed, humidifiedoxygen, but you won't have that unless a rescue team hasarrived. If the severely hypothermic patient seems breathless,start mouth-to-mouth breathing for them. Your personallow-flow of warmed, humidified oxygen will help.FROSTBITEFrostbite is frozen tissue in a localized part of the body. It canbe very superficial,involving only skin,or very deep,involving bone. Frostbitten tissue is cold, pale or white or gray,and stiff. As freezing goes deeper, the tissue becomes stifferand stiffer until, finally, it is rock hard. Superficial frostbite,where the skin moves easily when gently pressed, should berewarmed immediately with skin-to-skin contact. Deep, hardfrostbite should be rewarmed in a stable environment throughimmersion in warm water. Patients with hard frostbite almostalways do better if the injury is wrapped with dry insulationand left for a physician to manage in a controlled environment.For any frostbite injury, do not rub it and do not put it nearan open flame or any other high heat source. For any frostbitethat has thawed, protect it carefully from being injured orrefrozen.ASSESSMENTA breathing, pulsing victim needs to be checked over for otherinjuries. When this takes place depends on unpredictablefactors including the basic life support requirements (you maynever get to do a full assessment), the severity of the weather,and the number of rescuers. Assessments should go from headto foot. Squeeze bones, move joints gently, look for cuts andbruises, check for anything that hurts or feels abnormal. Yoursurvey should not unnecessarily expose the victim to the cold.In some cases, you may choose to identify injuries only andpostpone treating them until the victim has been warmed.A check should be made of their vital signs, especially level ofconsciousness, heart rate, respiratory rate, and their skin. Anormal person will be able to answer questions reasonably,particularly questions in reference to who, what, when, andwhere. Normal heart rates range from 60 to 80 strong beats perminute, and normal respiratory rates from 12 to 20 unlaboredbreaths per minute. Skin, in the non-pigmented areas (i.e.mucus linings of the lips and eyes), should be pink and moist.Changes in vitals don't tell you what's wrong, but they doindicate changes in the condition of the victim. Changestoward normal are healthy, and changes away from normal areunhealthy. 6 JANUARY/FEBRUARY 19987 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER TREATMENT OF INJURIESUnstable and painful bones and joints should be well-paddedand splinted. Open wounds should be cleaned, dressed, andbandaged. Secure splints and apply bandages snugly, but looseenough to allow healthy circulation.PREVENTION OF FURTHER INJURYOnce stabilized, victims should be monitored carefully for anychanges in their condition. The less alert they are, the morecarefully they need watching. Not only their injuries needmonitoring, but also their body temperature, fluid needs, andfood needs. They may require help in attending to their bodilyfunctions.Do not underestimate your patient's need for psychologicalsupport. Often the greatest good can be achieved with thewarmth of human understanding . .. not acheerleader and nota detached observer, but someone in-between, someone whoquietly and confidently lifts the spirits of the avalanche victim.EVACUATIONTransport of the avalanche victim is the final stage of care.Transport begins with the determination of what type ofevacuation will be required. Can the victim walk or ski out?Can you carry the victim on your back? Is your party largeenough and strong enough to do a safe carry? Can youimprovise a litter or a sled to move the victim in? Do you haveenough equipment and food to support the group during theevacuation? Would it be wiser to send for more help insteadof trying to self-evacuate? Who will you ask for help? Arehelicopters or snowmobiles available in your area? Theanswers to these questions will determine how you get yourvictim out.SAFETY SUMMARYOnce located and removed from the snow, avalanche victimsrequire immediate attention to their basic life support systems:airway, breathing, circulation. Priority attention should begiven to their cervical spines, and to the possibility of beadinjury, shock, and hypothermia. As assessment should be madeof their condition, and treatment given for all noted andsuspected injuries. They should be monitored in order toprevent, if possible, a worsening of their condition. Pay specialattention to their need for an adequate airway, for mathtenanceof body heat, for food and fluid needs, and for psychologicalsupport. Evacuate the victim as soon as it is safely possible. 8WANT MORE INFORMATION?Avalanche EducationAmerican Avalanche Institute, Inc.PO Box 308, Wilson, Wyoming 83014; 307-733-3315American Association of Avalanche Professionals (AAAP)PO Box Drawer 2757, Truckee, California 96160Canadian Avalanche Association Training SchoolPO Box 2579, Revelstoke, British Columbia, VOE 2S0 Canada;604-837-2435National Avalanche SchoolNational Ski Patrol System, Inc., 133 South Van GordonStreet, Suite 100, Lakewood, Colorado 80288-1706Appalachian Mountain ClubPO Box 298, Gorham, New Hampshire 03581;603-356-2727International Mountain Climbing School (1MCS)PO Box 1666, North Conway, New Hampshire 03860; 603-356-6316Chauvin Guides Internationalmarc@chauvinguides.com; 603-356-8919PublicationsThe Avalanche Book by B.

Whenall was said and done the term \"Moderate-to-High\" waschanged to \"Considerable\" for a number of reasons. KarlBirkelandsummarizedthesereasonsintheAAAP's\"Avalanche Review\" newsletter as People found to be confusing. Manyusers didn'trealize \"moderate-to-high\" was its owncategory, instead believing that the forecasters \"couldn'tmake up their minds between moderate and high, so theyjust called it 'moderate-to-high.\"'2. When people in avalanche classes were informally polledon whether they preferred \"considerable\" or \"moderate-to-high\" they chose \"considerable\" by a 2 to 1 margin.3. Several forecasters felt that using the term \"moderate-to-high\" increased the awkwardness of the advisories andmade putting out effective advisories more difficult.4.Salt Lake is gearing up for the 2002 Olympics and theywanted to be on the same page as the rest of the English-speaking world and use the word \"considerable.\"Most avalanche centers will be adopting the term this year.An updated summary of the 5-tiered chart follows.AVALANCHE SAFETY BASICSRemember that avalanche danger rating levels are only generalguidelines.Most avalanche accidents are caused by slabavalanches which are triggered by the victim or a member ofthe victim's party.

With the success ofprograms teaching the curriculumof \"Wilderness First Responder\"(WFR)and\"WildernessEmergency Medical Technician\"(WEMT), many who see theparallels with other aspects ofEMS' have begun to ask about theuse of EMT-Intermecliate and Paramedic training in thewilderness environment.However, there are manyconcerns surrounding the issue of how one could applyALS in the wilderness. In general the debate centersaround two issues: 1) How can we create a safe systemfor the use of wilderness ALS? and 2) Which ALS skillsmight be most useful in the backcountry environment?Even though there are obvious aspects of advancedEMS training that can be applied directly, the approachtoinjuriesandillnessesisnotappropriately transferable betweenthestreet and wildernessenvironments.While a direct translation of ALS isneither desirable nor appropriate, there is room for thedevelopmentofacomparablesystemforthebackcountry.This article describes such a system andhow, through it, there may be a role for ALS techniquesin the wilderness. To begin this discussion, one mustfirst start with a clear understanding of the terms anddefinitions in the debate.This can be best achievedwith an understanding of the history of ALS.The Background of Advanced Life SupportALS in the streets generally refers to the use of invasive12or \"advanced\" procedures and medications. These skillsare taught to advanced providers2 and are used inconjunction with the techniques of Basic Life Support(BLS). It is BLS that comprises the core of pre-hospitalmedicine and is the level to which all EMTs aretrained. As pre-hospital medicine evolved, the conceptof ALS became entirely centered on the administrationof critical interventions for people in cardiac arrest.Thisresultedfromtheurgencyofproviding defibrillation within minutes to those in ventricularfibrillation(Vfib).Alongwithdefibrillation,pre-hospital personnel were also trained to deliver drugtherapy in cardiac arrests. This required the initiationof \"invasive\" techniques such as the placement ofintravenous (IV) lines and endotracheal intubation. Astime went on, the argument was made that since thesepersonnel were already trained to start IV's and givemedications, there might be other areas in which theseskills could be utilized. Thus ensued the expansion ofALS care to other illnesses and injuries. Even today,however, the major emphasis of ALS is the criticalcardiac patient.The focus street ALS places on the treatment of cardiacpatients is clearly not appropriate for the wildernessenvironment.It makes no senseto emphasize therapies that are designed to save minutes when thetime span for wilderness patient care is measured inhours and days.However, theskillsof ALS (intubation,IVtherapy,andmedication administration) can readily be translated to thewilderness patient. This is in part because the timefactor in wilderness emergencies is so large that thebenefits of initiating therapy can outweigh the risk ofdelay. An extra five minutes taken during a multi-hourrescue is relatively inconsequential. In fact, argumentsadvocating additional treatments beyond the standardALS repertoire are commonplace, and are referencedrepeatedly in most wilderness medicine texts3. Where to begin?The application of ALS techniques in the backcountryrequires a strong contextual approach. First, it must be determined which injury or illness patterns arelikely to be encountered. As mentioned earlier, streetALS focuses on the cardiac patient -- backcountry ALSshould not have that same emphasis. Instead, a wilderness ALS system must focus on treating theinjuries commonly seen in the backcountry. These include trauma, heat and cold injuries, and a morelimited spectrum of medical conditions.Due to both the differences ih the length of patientcontact and the nature of the injuries treated, the typesof medications and interventions needed are oftensubstantially different from those utilized in the street.Although it might seem absurd to consider startingantibiotic therapy during a ten-minute ambulance ride,it may be appropriate during a ten-hour evacuation. Infact, in the wilderness situation where transport timescan range from several hours to several days, thetherapeutic importance of delivering advanced care ismost likely increased.Wildernessmedicinediffersfromconventionalmedicine in several ways: environmental exposure,time delays to definitive care, and limitation ofresources.However, the resources are not alwayslimited in the same way. In many areas, the potentialfor an organized response to a wilderness emergencyexist -- in fact, in many areas it is already a reality.The concept of an organized response applies not onlyto SAR teams, but is also extendible to other situations:expedition medicine, professional guiding groups,organized trips, etc.In every case, the key differenceis a prepkinned response to a wilderness emergency.This sort of thinking and application basicallydescribes a Wilderness EMS System. \"Recreational\" and \"Professional\" Care ProvidersOne thing about ALS in the backcountry is that it hasserious limitations. No one is advocating that theaverage hiker start carrying IV fluids and medicationsin his daypack, even a hiker trained in their properuse.It will never be the case that wilderness careproviders trained in ALS will always be immediatelyavailable in case of an injury -- that, after all, is part ofthe definition of wilderness care. For that reason, basiclevel wilderness care will (and should!) remain themainstay of approaches for most backcountry injuries.Having said that, ALS therapy can provide animportant supplement in caring for the wildernesspatient.One can start by distinguishing between two typesof wilderness care provider -- the \"recreational\" WEMT 2and the \"professional\" WEMT. The recreationalWEMT is one who happens to be present, nearby, or isotherwise available by sheer fortune at the scene of awilderness emergency. For example, a WEMT out fora hike stumbles across a hiker who has fractured anankle and stops to help. This can be held in contrastto the professional WEMT who is part of an organizedresponse to a wilderness emergency called to help withthe evacuation of a hiker with a fractured ankle.Why make such a distinction? The difference lies inpreparation and the availability of resources. Arecreational WEMT will have available only whathappens to be around, while a professional WEMT hasthe potential to bring a more extensive set ofemergency resources into a situation. By this I meanthat while no one would rationally advocate that everyrecreational WEMT carry IV solutions or painmedications around in a daypack, one does not have tosay the same thing about a professional WEMT who isresponding with the express purpose of going out totreat a patient in the wilderness. In this regard theprofessional WEMT benefits most from the applicationof ALS in the backcountry. Setting up a Wilderness EMS SystemIt could be argued that having some sort of WildernessEMS System (that is, an organized approach plannedinadvance)isa prerequisitefor ALS inthebackcountry. Furthermore, it is equally necessary foran additional step to be taken -- the development of\"medical command\" for the backcountry. The currentpractice of ALS in the streets relies on a sophisticatedrelationship between personnel trained in advancedcare and physicians.ALS is practiced only aftermedical approval by a physician (\"medical command\"),either by direct communication or though the use ofestablished protocols. This system is in place for manyreasons, but most importantly to serve as a safeguardfor the use and application of ALS techniques that maypose serious risks. The correct use of medical skillsrelies not only on the technical proficiency of theprovider, but more importantly, on the provider'sjudgment in determining when and on whom anintervention should be applied.The subsequent need to build a good relationshipbetween an EMT and a medical command physiciancreates a particular problem for wilderness medicineproviders.Many people trained and certified asWilderness First Responders or EMTs are primarilyoutdoorspeople who, after completing their course,return to their activities without ever participating inan organized EMS system. Several consequences result:Upon completion of a course, the participant no MARCH/APRIL 19981 3WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER longer receives regular practice or exposure tothinking as a WEMT. Without practice, skillsdecline.It leaves the recreational WEMT without thebenefit of clinical experience performing realassessments, on which all treatment decisions arebased.(There is a saying, \"Good judgment comesfrom experience, and experience comes from badjudgment.\")Deprived of the benefit of operating within anorganized EMS system, the WEMT is left without asufficient understanding of how to operate in anoften intricate system for providing advanced care.Specifically, the relationship of working with amedical command physician is absent. Withoutpractice working with a command physician thereisnomechanismtohoneclinicalandcommunications skills. These skills can be criticalas they can allow the WEMT to draw on theexperience and judgment of a more highly trainedperson at a distant location.Keeping this in mind, it is important to understand thatthe teaching of wilderness ALS care must be aimed atthe professional WEMTs who are part of an organizedWilderness EMS System that includes a commandphysician4.Ideally, for the Wilderness EMS System,the command physician should be familiar with thediscipline of wilderness medicine. Such physiciansshall hereafter be referred to as Wilderness CommandPhysicians (WCP). 5The development and use of ALS techniques in thebackcountry should only occur in conjunction with thecontinued development of organized Wilderness EMSSystems. Such systems can range in nature and designby location and are not limited to organized SAR teams.For example, professional outdoor organizations can,and often do, work with a physician to design a systemof providing emergent backcountry care. A number oforganizedexpeditionsoftenpre-planforthemanagement of emergencies. Again, the key elementsto address are: 1) the additional training sessions, 2)the exposure to working within an organized system, 3)the development of a relationship with a medicalcommand source, and 4) an explicit and systematicapproach to the provision of ALS care for a givenenvironment.Obviously, these conditions place a large limitation onALS in the backcountry, but such Wilderness EMSSystems already do exist in many areas. For example,areas of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia andother regions organized under the Appalachian Searchand Rescue Council employ such systems. Most placeswhere wilderness emergencies tend to occur with some 3frequency have already developed a method to addressthem. The people within these systems often seektraining in pre-hospital patient care. As a result, thereis tremendous potential to further organize andinclude advanced skills. Advanced Life Support in the BackcountryOnce a wilderness EMS system that can manage ALSis established, one can then focus on the care that canbe provided. This section describes a number of ALSapplicationsinthewilderness,andmentionsadditional modifications of technique or practice thatmay be required in the wilderness environment.Again, it must be stressed that the proper context forthe use of these interventions is part of an organizedEMS response. This makes sense as it is unlikely (andactively discouraged) that the average recreationaladventurer would consider carrying the sort of heavyand specialized equipment required on a routine basis. Airway ManagementAirway management techniques arethemost important skills emergency medical personnel canutilize.Multiple adjuncts, including oropharyngeal,nasopharyngeal, and esophogeal obturator airwaysexist as tools to assist in the airway management.However,onlytheendotracheal(ET)tubeisconsidered definitive treatment\u00b0.While in the wilderness setting the use of anendotracheal tube is likely to be both rare andcomplicated, it may be lifesaving. It should be noted that many patients whose conditions are severeenough to require intubation are likely to be deceasedbefore the arrival of any wilderness EMS personnel'.The most likely scenarios for use of the endotrachealtube are for management of head-injured patients whoare normothermic and unresponsive, submersionincidents, and in cases of severe hypothermia. In anycase, the wilderness airway management of anunresponsive patientisextraordinarilydifficult.Without an ET tube in place, patients must be placedon their sides to allow gravity to assist with theclearance of substances that might otherwise beaspirated8.It is important to note the complicated nature ofmanaging the wilderness patient who has beenintubated. Transport of such patients is exceedinglydifficult (if available, helicopter evacuation is clearlymerited).The tube placement must be monitoredcarefully and continuously as correctly placed ETtubes can be easily dislodged by any movement.During the logistic nightmare of a litter evacuationthey are at a particularly high risk for displacement.While rarely required as the only tool for proper riCHIAPRIL 1998 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER management of these critical airways, endotrachealintubation can be an important intervention for use inthe wilderness environment.While technically not in the category of airwaymanagement, a brief discussion of needle chestdecompression is warranted here. Needle thoracotomyisa simple and potentially life-saving advancedprocedure in the face of a tension pneumothorax9.Pneumothoracies are a common consequence of injuryto the chest, and can progress over time to becometension pneumothoracies.All patients who havesuspected chest trauma should be monitored closelyand continuously for pneumothorax.Intravenous Fluid AdministrationThe use of IV fluids is the greatest asset an ALSprovider can bring to the wilderness. In fact, while therole of IV fluids in street EMS is currently undergoingconsiderable debate, their role in the wildernessenvironment is far more certain\". While time andlogistics will still prevent adequate resuscitation in theface of extreme trauma'',almost every wildernesspatient can benefit from fluid replenishment. In theinstance where oral rehydration can be adequatelyaccomplished, use of the IV fluids may not benecessary. However, almost all wilderness patients aredehydrated on initial presentation, and a number offactors may limit intake. Nausea, either pre-existing orinduced by litter travel, pain, disposition, and absolutecontraindications\" are common occurrences that limitoral fluid use. Many conditions that can present in thewilderness environment (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis\",crush syndrome with consequent rhabdomyolysis\",and adult respiratory distress syndrome') can only beaddressed with the use of aggressive IV fluids. Eventhe simple use of maintenance fluid replacementcarries a significant role in the long-term care thatwildernessprovidersencounter.Properfluid managementisabasic and absolutelycritical component of wilderness care at all levels. By including the use of intravenous fluids however, ALSproviders can initiate defmitive care and managementand have the greatest impact on patient care.In addition to the benefits of fluid resuscitation alone,the use of IV therapy also expands the opportunity forroutes of medication administration. There are a number of situations in the wilderness environmentwhere IV medications can have a significant role. Forexample, antibiotics are especially useful in the case ofopen fractures by reducing the likelihood of potentiallylimb and life-threatening bone infections. Delay in theinitiation of antibiotic therapy dramatically increasesthe risks of such infections\". Pain medications, minimal nutrition'', and other drugs can also bedelivered. 4As in the case of endotracheal intubation, the use ofintravenous fluids and medications in the wildernesscarriesadditionalconsiderationsbeyondthosecommonly addressed in the street. First, the types andquantities of fluids that are carried and available aregoing to be limited, so careful pre-incident planning ismandatory\". Second, careful consideration must bemade to protect the fluids and medications from theenvironment both during rescue and transport. Inparticular, it should be noted that many medicationscannotbeusedafterexposuretocertain temperatures\".Additionally,thedeliveryofmedications can be complicated. There are various systems that exist for protecting IV fluids fromlow-temperatures for delivery in cold environments,and pressurized administration\" is often necessary.Finally, the use of IV solutions creates a potential forexposure to blood borne pathogens. Clearly the use ofbarrier protection is indicated; in addition, thought andpre-planning for the careful disposal and removal ofused needles is an absolute must.MedicationsWhile the street ALS systems have providers carryingmedicationssuchasIVlidocaineandotheranti-arrhythmics, such medications are unlikely to be ofany use for the backcountry patient. The medicationsmost likely to benefit the \"ordinary\" wilderness patientdo include a number of medications used in the streets.Several additional medications that are not routinelyused by ambulance personnel, such as antibiotics andsteroids, should be added.AnaphylaxisThe use of epinephrine for anaphylaxis by EMTs isalready the established standard of care for wildernessemergencies.For many years, wilderness EMTprograms have been advocating the use of epinephrineby WEMTs for anaphylaxis. This is because, whencorrectly used, the medication can be life-saving. As a result, the current revision of the national EMT-Basiccurriculum now contains a section on administeringepinephrine as a basic level ski112'.It is important to note several things about thewilderness use of epinephrine. First, the epinephrinemust be protected from light, heat, and freezing.Second, many people choose the Epi-pene22 as a delivery vehicle for the medication due to theirtrepidation for needles.While the spring-loadedsyringe can be useful in these cases, there are multiplereports of the spring mechanism failing. Additionally,the device only delivers a single 0.3 mg dose. For thesereasons, the traditional syringe model Anakit\u00ae, whichcan deliver two doses, is preferable.MARCH/APRIL 1998 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER15 In addition to epinephrine, antihistamines23 are alsoindicated in anaphylaxis. They help limit symptoms,and can work to prevent a delayed second anaphylacticepisode. They should be used in conjunction with theepinephrine when possible, and can be administeredintravenously(IV),intramuscularly(IM),orbymouth(P0).Finally, it should be noted that in an emergency,epinephrine can also be used for severe asthma. It is not the ideal choice\" as it effects the cardiac andvascular systems as well as the respiratory system, andshould not replace other therapies if they are available.AsthmaAsthma exacerbations are common and the medicationsfor their treatment in the wilderness can be criticallyimportant. Triggers include temperature variations,exercise,grass,tree,andpollenallergens.Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDI's) are the mainstay ofboth preventive and exacerbation management. Thereare numerous asthma medications available and anasthmatic may use several simultaneously. It isimportant to understand their benefits and limitations,as certain medications work very well as long-termpreventive therapy but have no role in the treatment ofacute episodes. For treatment of acute attacks, quickacting \"Beta-2 agonists\" such as Albuterol\u00ae provide themainstay of care.When using the patient's owninhaler, always verify that it is a proper medication foracute management.In any case, correct use of theinhaler itself is critical.Several studies have shownthat patients often don't know how to use an inhalerproperly25. The use of a spacer is highly recommendedas it facilitates medicine delivery and proper technique.Learning the proper use and instruction for an MDIcan be a critical skill.As mentioned earlier, in severe cases when othermedications are not available, epinephrine can also beused at the 0.3 mg subcutaneous dose.InfectionAntibiotics have multiple applications in the wildernessenvironment but are most likely to be used in an ALSsystem for open fractures. Trauma is the leacling causeof wilderness emergencies. Note that open fracturesare not always obvious with bone protruding onexamination. Any presumed fracture with an openwound nearby should be considered an open fracturefor treatment purposes.In addition, wounds thatexpose bone, but do not fracture it are also significant.The concern in either of these cases where bone isexposed to the environment is the chance for a boneinfection to occur.The development of such aninfection can be limb and/or life-threatening. The two 5most common bacteria involved are staph. aureus andstaph. epidermis. Therefore antibiotics used for openfractures must be active against these organisms.There are many antibiotics that will work in thissituation, but, since the goal is to get the antibioticsworking as quickly as possible, IV or IM agents arepreferred. Anyone with an open fracture will probablyrequire atriptothe operating room, so POmedications are contraindicated for at least six hoursprior to anesthesia. The particular choices used willdepend on what is available locally per medicalcontrol.Altitude IllnessesWhen high altitudes (>8000ft) are an issue, it isprudent to include medications for illnesses such asHigh Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) and channel blockers potentially helpful. It iscritical,however,to recognize that the propermanagement ofaltitudedisordersisdescent; pharmaceutical interventions may only assist byhelping to buy time to allow the descent.HypothermiaIn cases of severe hypothermia (<90oF) there is anincreased risk of cardiac arrhythmias includingventricular fibrillation.Precipitation of arrhythmiasmay be provoked by simple movements, complicatingwilderness evacuation procedures. Agents that mightguard against arrhythmias could be useful. Due tothe altered physiology of hypothermic tissues and apoor understanding of pharmacology in hypothermicpatients, most sources recommend avoiding standardACLS cardiac medications. There is some evidence,although limited and conflicting, that suggests that inseverely hypothermic patients Bretylium\u00ae may increasethe \"Vfib threshold,\" making it less likely for thearrhythmia to occur. However, at this stage its use inprophylaxis against Vfib is still under investigation.The current preferred method to protect against Vfibinthewilderness environmentisoxygenation,preferably by endotracheal tube26.Pain ControlWhen available, pain medications can play animportant role in the management of wildernessemergencies.Most minor musculoskeletal injuriescan be managed with the use of over-the-counternon-steroidalanti-inflammatorymedications(NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen.It is important to note,however, that these agents can cause severe damageto the kidneys. There are several reports of kidneyMARCH/APRIL 1998 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER16 failure occurring in previously healthy individualsafter (significant) NSMD ingestion. An importantfactor in the safe use of NSAIDs is hydration. This isyet another reason for careful fluid management.For moderate to severe pain management additionalagents are required.Narcotics pharmacological painmanagement of potency are available, and choicescan be tailored to local availability. Most may beadministered IV, IM, or PO. For mild to moderatepain, oral Tylenol #30 (acetaminophen with codeine)works well.For more severe pain, however, astronger narcotic that can be administered IV or IM ispreferable. Be aware, too, that side effects such asnausea and sedation may occur. The simultaneoususe of antihistamines can potentiate the effect ofnarcotics, and can also mediate some of the sideeffects.Be aware that narcotics can also depressrespiratoryfunction;therefore,thepatient'sbreathing should be monitored carefully. Of courseall narcotics can depress mental status. The concernover narcotic addiction is unwarranted when usedproperly for pain relief.When narcotics are carried, a narcotic antagonist thatcan reverse their actions should also be available.Naloxolone (Narcane) can reverse the effects ofnarcotics and can be used for accidental overdosing, orin cases where analgesia needs to be reversed to allowreexamination.Clearly the development of aWilderness EMS System and physician cooperation isa mandatory prerequisite for the use of narcotics.Sedatives and anxiolytics such as benzodiazepinesmay also be useful.They can help relieve patientanxiety and thereby facilitate rescue efforts. Lowdoses are recommended and care must be exercised toavoid an overdose.AntiemeticsAlong with narcotics, antiemetics can go a long way toincrease the patient's comfort by reducing nausea.andvomiting. They can be useful even when nausea andvomiting aren't part of the initial presentation. Infact, many patients develop motion sickness during anextrication.In cases of motion sickness-inducedillnesses,antihistamines27workwellifPOmedications are tolerated.In more severe cases ofnausea and suppositories ofPhenergan\u00ae or Compazine\u00ae work well.Other AgentsThe medications carried should be tailored to the localconditions and the illnesses and injuries most likely to 6be encountered.Relatively benign over-the-countermedications such as antacids, decongestants, andantidiarrheal agents28 greatly increase patientcomfort levels and are appropriate. These medications,while not included during normal EMT-Basic training,should be part of WEMT training. ConclusionItis clear that there is a role for ALS in thebackcountry. The therapeutic advantages it can bringto the patient can be significant. Many severe complications and discomforts for the patient canpotentially be reduced, or even eliminated, with the useof ALS techniques. The role is limited, however, and itwill remain as a supplement to, and never replace, theBLS care every patient should receive. In addition, itrequires a fairly sophisticated framework in which tofunction.This framework is the development of asophisticated Wilderness EMS System. These systemsrequire forethought, communication, and cooperationamong the various people involved in organizedrescues.While only a few systems currently existwhere ALS techniques are routinely involved inwilderness rescues, a large number of areas alreadyhave the foundation for such a system to evolve.

It is the only field-portable device I've seen that actuallydelivers enough heat to rewarm someone in the field. This babydelivers 100 watts of power for 8 hours, has an overhead-camV-81/4 oops, sorry, got carried avilay there. But it really does putout more heat than anything else I've carried in the field. Fig. 1: The Heat-PacTM Charcoal VestIt's officially called a HeatPacTM (HeatPacPersonalHeater HPU 33400tobeprecise), generic term that'scommonly used is \"charcoal vest.\" Thedevice has tubes that wrap around thechest, and it burns a charcoal briquet tomake heat. The current design doesn'tlook much like a vest, but the earlier oneshad wide flat \"straps\" that wrapped around the chest, so it usedto look a bit more vest-like (a good imagination also helps).Actually, if you take a look at Figure 1, you may agree with methat it looks more like a cross between a cyber-punk militaryelephant and an olive-drab Portuguese man-of-war.The device was developed by ITT for the Norwegian army, ismarketed in Scandinavia by Alcatel STK, and is imported intothe U.S.as well(see end of article foravailability).Unfortunately, the civilian version of the device is distributedwith a single-page instruction sheet that is quite skimpy, whichisthe main reason I'm writing this article. A goodunderstanding of the device, itscharacteristics and itslimitations will, I hope, make it more widely used in searchand rescue operations.My first exposure to the device was many years ago in theWhite Mountains of New Hampshire. An ice climber hadfallen in Huntington Ravine, and was being carried out in aStokes litter. The temperature was around zero Fahrenheit, andhe had been thoroughly chilled if not actually hypothermic. But 22by the time he reached the road at, Pinkham Notch, he'ddemanded that the sleeping bag be opened because he was toohot from the charcoal vest!The major theoretical problem with field-portable rewarmingdevices is the heat-to-weight ratio. Most devices heat packs,inhalation rewarming devices, and the like only produce asmall amount of heat for their weight. Energy can be carried inthe form of electricity in batteries but even lightweight,high-energy lithium cells don't provide much heat per ounce.Energy can also be carried in the form of chemicals thatdissolve in water and release heat (one type of heat pack), or inthe form of a saturated salt solution that crystallizes andreleases heat (another type of heat pack). Both of these types ofheat packs deliver a lot of heat, but only for a short time, andthey're pretty heavy. A third type of heat pack has powderediron that oxidizes (burns) slowly, and is a lot lighter than thefirst two types of heat pack, but still doesn't produce a lot ofheat for its weight.Barring a portable cold-fusion device, the most effective deviceis going to be something that burns; oxidation provides a lot ofheat from relatively light fuel. The iron-oxidation heat packsare good. But, when the iron powder \"burns\" the product isrust -- and iron and rust are relatively heavy \"fuel\" and \"ash.\"It would be nice to have something lighter to burn.The problem, of course, is that when most other materialsburn, they produce not only heat but carbon dioxide andsometimes carbon monoxide. One way to get around thecarbon monoxide problem is to use a catalyst to convert all thecarbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. There are several types ofcharcoal-burning and gas-burning heaters on the market thatuse such catalystsbut none of them except the charcoal vestare suitable for rewarming a patient in a litter.A Hot DesignThe design of the charcoal vest is simple but elegant. Thedevice contains, within its sturdy outer plastic shell, a roughlyBESTCOPYAVAILABLE 2\"x4\"x6\" block of charcoal, encased in a metal shell, whichburns at a rate controlled by the amount of air supplied to it. Afan blows air past the metal shell and out several tubes, whichcan be wrapped around the patient (these are the olive-drab\"tentacles\"in Figure 1). The fan also blows air into the burningcharcoal inside the shell, and then out the exhaust tube (theblack elephant-snout in Figure 1).Over the TopThe top opens to allow access to thebatteryandcharcoal-boxcompartments (Figure 2). The hingeis sturdy, and the clasp that holds itclosedislikewise of heavy-dutyFig. 2: Top viewconstruction. From my cave rescueexperience, I hesitate to say that anypiece of engineering is cave-proof, but this design certainlylooks highly cave-resistant. If you take out the charcoal box,and look deep within the compartment in which it sits, you'llsee the catalyst grid there (Figure 3). The one-page instructionsheet notes that you can snag it out with a piece of hooked wire,and replace it as needed. However, it doesn't really tell you howto determine when it needs replacement.Air FlowThe fan is driven by a single D-size alkaline cell. I suppose youcould use a \"regular\" carbon-zinc cell, as it will be kept warmby the device, but the alkaline will last longer than acarbon-zinc even when kept warm. The battery has to be put inthe correct way, or the air will blow through the unitbackwards -- and the exhaust won't go through the catalyst,thus risking possible carbon monoxide production. A simplecrossover diode circuit would preventthis problem and allow the battery tobe inserted either way without risk of; carbon monoxide production -- whichwould be a simple but importantimprovement to the device. Indeed,this was the one major reason why theHeatPac was given an unfavorablerating in one article in the medicalliterature. I think I may put the circuitinto mine if can figure out one that works in really hot andreally cold environments. There is a diagram on the outside ofthe compartment that indicates which way to insert the battery,but I feel that training users about the importance of batterypolarity will be critical.Fig. 3: Catalyst Grid atBottom of CharcoalCompartment The airflow within the device is fascinating. I took it down tomy workbench and took it apart (a simple matter of removinga few screws) to see how it works. If you look at Figure 1, youcan see the slits next to the charcoal box where air enters thedevice. Now look at Figure 5, where the device is opened uplike a clamshell. The air is warmed as it passes along the sidesof the charcoal box (A), before being drawn through a smallslit into the fan itself. The next is a bit harder to imagine, butlook careftilly at the grey line I've drawn at the top left ofFigure 5 (marked B). The warm air that is sucked past the 2Fig. 4: Battery Compartmentcharcoal box and into the fancomes out and is channeled intwo directions. This top-leftgrey line indicates where the airexits into the \"tentacles\" towarm your patient. The secondgrey line \u00a9 shows where someof the air is directed into thecharcoal box, then through it,then through a metal spiralaround the fan, and finally outthe \"snout\" (the black exhausttube). You may have to use alittle imagination for this tomake sense -- when the clamshell is folded back together, alittle hole in the charcoal box fits (D) snugly up against a blackrubber grommet (F) on the fan outflow box. If you also look at(F), you'll see a little piece of black plastic, which has a tinyblack nubbin that sticks out through a curved hole in the case(G) and allows you to adjust the heat (see Figure 7 for anoutside view of it).As you can see, some of the fan'sair is directed out the tentacles,and some through the charcoalbox to make heat. How does itknow how much air to blowwhich way? I took the cover offthe fan outflow box to see. Lookat Figure 6, where I've exposedthe \"artificial intelligence\" unitof this device. It consists bimetallic stripand some cleverly-designed airchannels. (A bimetallic strip ismade of two different types ofmetal - when warmed, one expands more than the other,causing the strip to bend.) First, note the small slit where theair is drawn into the fan (H). Next, note the bimetallic strip (I);when cold, it's tightly curled up against the fan, directing allthe air into the channel (J) leading to the charcoal box. Whenthe device starts up, all the air goes through the charcoal boxto get it burning -- which means rescuers should expect no heatout the \"tentacles\" for the first few minutes. Rescuers shouldalso expect a fair bit of warmth and a bit of smoke coming outof the elephant-proboscis-exhaust for those first few minutes,though once the heater is running, little if any smoke and onlya little warmth come out through its nose. After warming up,this strip uncurls and starts directing some warm air into thechannels (K) leading to the \"tentacles.\"Fig. 5: HeatPac Air Flow Pretty slick design, huh?But now look carefully where my finger is pointing. There's alittle metal strip here, too, that partially blocks the air goingthrough the rubber grommet (L) into the charcoal box. I'm notentirely sure, but I suspect this is also a bimetallic strip -- itmay serve as a \"thermostat,\" cutting down the amount of air MAY/JUNE 1993 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER23 Fig. 6: The Airflow Box \"ArtificialIntelligence\"entering the charcoal boxwhen it gets very hot.To make things even morecomplicated, there's thislittle black plastic pieceright at my fingertip (M).Thisconnectstotheoutside of the box (Figure7) where itserves as ahigh-lowlever--byadjusting this up or down,youcanincreaseordecrease the air going intothecharcoalbox,andincrease or decrease theheat. Of course if you turnit up full blast, it won't runas long on a charcoal charge, but then, even at full blast (200watts) it lasts for 6 hours (20 hours at 50 watts on low), and thecharcoal charges are light, so you can easily carry a few extras.A final interesting piece in this box -- you can't see it very wellin Figure 6, but it's at (F) -- is something that turns off the fanwhen it gets too hot, a reasonable safety feature.Practical ThingsI said above that this device is reasonably cave-resistant (whichmeans it's fine for almost any above-ground rescue), and itreally doesn't need much if any protection -- it can just bestuffed into a cave pack. However, I've found that this isn't trueof the charcoal elements -- though they are sealed inwaterproof foil, this foil can easily be punctured, letting thecharcoal get wet. And, the metal case around the charcoal canget so dented that you can't fit it into the charcoal vest.There are two types of charcoalrefills.The more expensiverefills are prepackaged in anouter aluminum case, and havea fuse at one end, so thatFig. 7: Heat Adjustment Leverlighting them iseasy. Thecheaper kind is basically a brickof charcoal that you have to set on fire before inserting in ametal case, which can then be inserted in the charcoal vestproper. The cheaper version may be applicable for ice fishingor other leisurely pursuits, but for search and rescue teams thefused refills are worth the cost.Each of the fused charcoal refills comes prepackaged with twomatches and a small piece of match-striking paper at one end.Figure 8 shows the condition of one of these after being carriedthrough a cave for a few hours. It's obviously best to put sparecharcoal elements in a Pelican case or ammo box if you'retaking them into a cave.The prices in April 1997 when I ordered one were:()4Fig. 8 Charcoal Refill After aFew Hours in a April1998, I found that a lot of peoplein cold places in tents and the like were ordering HeatPacswithout the \"tentacles\" just to use as a no-electricity spaceheater, so that they're selling the distribution were:HeatPac alone: $278.00Split Fuel:Nonfused Fuel:Cover for above:$99 for a case of 7$86 for a case of 10$21.65Charcoal vests are available in the U.S. from:Attn: Bill TashjianHawill's, Ltd., P.O. Box 685, Westborough, MA 01581(508) 366-7496(508) 366-0211 (FAX)Using the charcoal vest in a tent or cave presents certain risks-- if the battery is in the wrong way around, you could getdangerous carbon monoxide levels. And, even if you have thebattery in the right way around, it still uses oxygen andproduces carbon dioxide. So, I think I'd only use it in a cave ortent that has good air circulation.I can remember two problems that cropped up when using thisdevice on a mock cave rescue -- problems that prevented itsuse, but that can be easily overcome. First, rescuers started itup properly, but when after a minute there was a bit of smokecoming out the \"nose\" and no heat coming from the tentacles,they decided that it didn't work and quit using it. Secondly,when they lit it up and put it on the patient with the smoke stillcoming out the \"nose,\" the patient started panicking and thrustit away. Starting the unit in a large passage with good airflow,and lettingit warm up for about five minutes beforeintroducing it to the patient, should prevent both theseproblems. Once it warms up, there's a slight burning smell, butvirtually no visible smoke. The warmth of the device shouldmake anyone who's cold snuggle right up to it. As with anywarming device, though, you should not put the unit itself upagainst bare skin -- it might get a bit too warm and causeburns. Having the device itself strapped to the outside of thepackaging over the patient' s chest, with the exhaust \"nose\"directed away from the patient's face, but the \"tentacles\" insidethe packaging, seems to work quite well. 3 MAY/JUNE 1998 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER Training PointsIf your SAR team is thinking about using one of these devices,please take the time to train your members in its use. Note thecopyright: it's OK to print off a copy of this document and giveto each member. But it is also important to fire it up in ameeting and let everyone play with it during the meeting. Ifteam members are comfortable with it, they will be happy tofire it up and use it when needed -- and can avoid the twoproblems noted above. During the training, emphasize thefollowing critical points: 1.Make sure the battery is in the right way! Or you mayget carbon monoxide. Just like we recommend thatriggers have a second member check critical rigging,always have a second team member check to see that theD cell \"button\" is sticking up as shown in Figure 2before operating the device. 2.Expect a small amount of smoke and hot exhaust fromthe \"nose\" and no heat out the \"tentacles\" for the first5-10 minutes. 3.Adjust the lever to produce the desired amount of heat.ConclusionBased on both warmth per unit weight and ease of use, andconsidering expense, dangers, and limitations, it is my opinionthat the HeatPac is the best hypothermia rewarming device thata search and rescue team can get. I'd love to see a version withcircuitry to allow battery insertion both ways, but I'mreasonably pleased with it the way it is. Until we have acold-fusion-poweredfield-portablehottub,or have afield-portable wrap-around radio wave rewarmer vest and cansimply push the button for three minutes on high, this is thebest we've got.Reference1.SterbaJA.Efficacy andSafetyof article permission fromDr. Conover's website, www.pitt.edu/--kconover, where hewelcomes visitors and feedback.

MAY/JUNE 1998THEY'RE BACK...TICKING US OFF AS USUAL!By Buck TiltonBob politely interrupted the class I was teaching on tick-borneillnesses, \"Could this be what you're talking about?\" he asked.Standing, he pulled up the leg of his shorts to reveal awell-defined reddish spot on his upper thigh, about threeinches at its widest, and darker toward the outer edge.\"I've got a couple more,\" he said, and proceeded to exposethose to the group of 30 Lander, Wyoming, students. \"They'vebeen getting bigger,\" he added.Bob denied any knowledge of being tick bitten, but it lookedlikeerythema migransto me, the characteristic rash that firstannounces Lyme disease in somewhere between 60 and 80percent of patients. The rash may develop where the tick bit, oranywhere else on the body, with a tendency to show up mostoften on thighs, groins, armpits, and sometimes behind theknee. After it first appears, the rash grows or \"migrates.\" Iferythema migransemerges in the first week of the disease, itrarely grows to more than 2.5 inches across. Rashes appearinglater-- two to four weeks later-- may reach eight inches across.The red \"spot\" typically feels warm, and perhaps causes a mildburning sensation to the patient, but seldom produces pain oritching.Any more indications of illness, I wondered. \"Something likethe flu,\" Bob said, describing more of the early symptoms ofLyme disease: low-grade fever, headaches, unusual fatigue,and muscle aches. Untreated in the early stages, the diseasemay resolve spontaneously in about a month. Approximatelyone-half the patients, however, progress to serious problemsincluding neurologic or cardiologic involvement, and, morecommonly, Lyme arthritis which attacks large joints,especially the knee. Lyme disease has established itself as theleading vector-borne disease in the United States with almost60,000 cases reported in the five years from 1990 to 1995. Thewarmer weather brought by El Nifto promises to provide theU.S. in the next two years, especially the northeastern U.S.,with the biggest and most voracious \"crop\" of Lyme-bearingticks we have yet seen.I voiced my concerns to Bob, and suggested a timely (in otherwords, immediate) visit to a physician. The physician took abloodsampleandtestedforthespirochetes,thecorkscrew-shapedBorrelia burgdorferi,the bacteria thatcauses the most common tick-borne disease in the world. Bobwas diagnosed: Lyme disease. The treatment was an antibiotic,amoxicillin, for four weeks. The cure was complete.Unfortunately, more and more people are missing an earlydiagnosis, and presenting months, or even years, after the tickbite with the more severe symptoms of the disease: debilitatingheadaches,arthritis,neurologicalorcardiologicalabnormalities. Why the missed diagnosis? For one reason, says 25WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER 5David L. Weld, executive director of the American LymeDisease Foundation, \"many of the worst cases of Lyme diseasewere contracted a decade ago when people were not as awareof the illness.\" Other reasons: the early symptoms aresometimes mild enough to be ignored, the rash doesn't alwaysappear, and the ticks often go unnoticed, typically attachingthemselves during the nymph stage (late May, June, July)when they take up no more room on your skin than a poppyseed.THE LIFE AND TIMES OF IXODESTo date the only confirmed species to pass the disease tohumans are the Ixodes ticks: deer ticks the Northeast), black-legged ticks in the West (Ixodespacificus). As they feed on blood, infected ticks transmit thebacteria that produce the fever, headaches, fatigue, muscleaches, and, more often than not, the characteristic rash ofLyme disease.After hatching from an egg in the spring of the year, these ticksprogress through complex stages on their two-year journey toadulthood. The hatchlings become larvae that feed once insummer on the first red blood source that passes by (mammal,bird, or reptile), thereby picking up the spirochete if their mealis an infected deer mouse or other small mammal. Goingdormant in fall and winter, the larvae molt into nymphs duringtheir second spring, feeding several times their secondsummer, and transmitting the bacteria to humans-- if humanshappen along. Later in the summer, the nymphs molt into adultticks who mate in the fall after which the female lays her fertileeggs. Adult ticks can pass the Lyme disease bacteria but do sofar less often. Being primarily active in early spring and latefall when people are less active outdoors, and being relativelylarge and easy to spot and remove, adult ticks have less chanceto transmit B. burgdorferi to humans.Lyme disease, first isolated and named in Lyme, Connecticut,in 1977, has grown most rapidly in the Northeast, upperMidwest, and northern California, with substantial growth inthe South. So, you can relax on your intended trip to Europe orAsia, right? Wrong, says Weld. \"You're at risk,\" he continued,\"from a tick bite in all countries of the Northern Hemisphere!\"A similar syndrome occurs in Australia. Although expertsagree the disease has been with us since long before 1977, itwas the evidence from the Connecticut outbreak that provedticks as the vector.\"The strains of bacteria differ,\" added Weld, \"but the signs andsymptoms of the disease are essentially the same around theworld. If you think you've got Lyme disease, see a physician assoon as possible.\" Early antibiotic treatment, according toWeld, prevents advanced problems in \"98 percent of those whoget Lyme disease.\" 26WHAT ELSE IS THERE?Ticks come in two basic sizes--tiny and hard to find, and bigand easy to find. A relative of the spider, the tick crawlsaround on its unsuspecting host on eight tiny legs, looking forthe right spot to settle down for a few days. It may search forhours. With specialized pincer like organs, it digs a smallwound in his host. Into the wound goes a feeding apparatuscalled a hypostome, and its relatively powerful suckingmechanism allows the tick to feed on the blood of the host.Anchored firmly in the wound, it feeds for an average of twoto five days, sometimes longer, depending on the species, anddrops off weighing hundreds of times more than when it firstarrived. In the host it often leaves a reminder of its visit,disease-causingmicroorganisms.Worldwide,onlythemosquito spreads more illness than the tick.Rocky Mountain Spotted FeverMontana'sBitterrootMountainsfirstrecorded RockyMountain spotted fever, caused by the parasite Rickettsiarickettsii, but it spread from coast to coast. After feeding forapproximately three hours, infected ticks may pass the disease.Three to twelve days later, the patient develops a spotty rash,usually beginning on the hands, feet, wrists, and ankles. Thespots migrate over the arms, legs, face, and abdomen. Severeheadaches are common, with stiff neck and back, and generalmuscle aches. The characteristic fever rises during the firstdays, and remains high. If untreated, approximately 20 percentof the victims will die. Almost everyone will recover withantibiotic treatment.Colorado Tick FeverAll the Rocky Mountain states have recorded patients withColorado tick fever, as well as western Canada and SouthDakota. A virus produces the sudden fever with muscle achesand headache that develops three to six days after the bite ofthe tick. Diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach aches are commonsigns and symptoms. The patient often recovers and relapsesseveral times in the course of the illness. It is very rarely fatal,although sufferers report feeling so crummy they wish theycould .die.Tula rem iaAnother bacteria, often borne by ticks of the South andSouthwest, causes the high fever and flu-like symptoms oftularemia. A decaying wound at the site of the bite is common.Antibiotics will defeat the bacteria.Tick ParalysisAt least 43 species of ticks, worldwide, have been known tocause tick paralysis, with more cases showing up in NorthAmerica than anywhere else. A venom in tick saliva causes theproblem, which appears to be a block to nerve messages, andchildren are affected more often than adults. The patient mayfirst be restless and irritable with complaints of numbness ortingling in hands and feet. Ascending paralysis develops overthe next 24 to 48 hours. Once the tick is removed, the patient MAY/JUNE 1998 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER recovers, almost always without complications. Any patientwith an ascending paralysis and without a known cause shouldbe inspected carefully for an imbedded tick. WHAT ABOUT PREVENTION?If you spend time in woody, brushy, grassy areas during tickseason (May - early September), especially if the areas aremoist and shady, you run the risk of picking up one of theeight-legged hitchhikers. They habitually crawl around for awhile, perhaps hours, \"looking\" for a tasty place to feed.Blind, or almost blind, all ticks spend the mobile parts of theirlives going up. They crawl until bumping into a blade of grass,a bush, anything that provides access to a higher place. They'llwait at the tip of the grass or bush for a meal to pass by. Onceon your body, ticks may not stop their meandering until theyreach your scalp. Those who dig in along the way demonstratea preference for dark, moist body areas such as behind theknee, the groin, around the waistline, under breasts, in armpits,and behind the ears. Once they settle down to eat, they burytheir mouth parts in your skin and begin to drink your blood, aprocess they'll continue for days until they can hold no more,after which they drop off. In order to assimilate blood, tickshave to periodically \"water down\" the blood by salivating priorto swallowing.It's the ticks' saliva that contains most of thegerms picked up by the \"host.\" Since the salivation processpasses more and more germs the longer the tick is attached,early removal often prevents the transmission of enoughbacteria to cause illness.Tick checks, several times a day, if you're active outdoors, areextremely important. If you wear light-colored clothing andtuck your pants into your socks, you stand a great chance ofrecognizing and removing the dark-colored tick before itreaches your skin. Once indoors, shower (which should removeloose ticks) and give yourself a close examination. Obviously,considering a tick's inclination to tuck itself into hard to seeareas, a partner will add much to an adequate check. Freeroaming ticks on your skin, if any remain, can be easily liftedoff. Imbedded ticks should be immediately un-imbedded.Quick tick removal is necessary to reduce the chance of diseasetransmission. Do not, the experts emphatically state, apply oil,petroleum jelly, heat, or anything else to remove the imbeddedtick. With a pair of sharp-tipped tweezers, grasp the tick asclose to your skin as possible. Slowly pull it straight out. A tinypiece of your skin may lift off with the tick. No problem. Avoidsqueezing the tick which, says Weld, \"is like squeezing aballoon full of water. The germ-laden contents of the tick areforced into your skin.\" After the tick is out, scrub the areagently with alcohol or an antibiotic ointment. Consider savingthe tick in a small bottle or plastic bag with a blade of grass orleaf to provide moisture so the tiny body doesn't dry out. If youdevelop an illness, the tick can be turned into a lab in order tobe tested for disease.Researchers reporting in The New England Journal ofMedicine, December 17, 1992,wrote: \"When ticks were 6attached for less transmittedonly rarely by infected nymphal-stage ticks and never byinfected adult female ticks.\" On the other tick-infested hand,83percent of test animals were infected after a tick wasattached for72hours, and 100 percent after a tick was allowedto feed to repletion (more than 120 hours).What if your removal technique leaves tick mouth parts in yourskin? If your pull is straight and slow, the mouth parts veryrarely detach from the tick. And, even if they do, according toWeld, the chance of getting Lyme disease from just the mouthparts seems to be nonexistent.Two repellents have proven effective in keeping ticks off:DEET (diethyltoluamide), the. active ingredient in mostrepellents, may be applied to skin. The Wilderness MedicalSociety, a physician-oriented group, state \"A concentration ofDEET no greater than 35 percent is recommended.\" (See Dr.Baughan's article \"Bug Dope Revisited\" in this issue.)Permethrin, a spray repellent sold by Sawyer Products(800-940-4464),contains the active ingredient permethrin andmay be applied to clothing. Although tests indicate permethrindoes not harm skin, it doesn't work on skin. On clothing,however, it dries and actually kills ticks (and mosquitoes) oncontact for up to two weeks. The long lasting effect ofpermethrin will allow you to treat your clothes prior to manytrips and leave the spray can behind.Editor's Note: There has been much publicity recently abouta Lyme Disease vaccine from SmithKline Beecham which theFDA recommended for approval in .late May. Even with anapproval, it won 't be a quick fix-- the immunization serieswhich consists of three shots must be administered over a one-year period. The efficacy is claimed at 80% based on a poolof 10,936 volunteers between the ages of 15 to 70. The Frenchare also seeking approval for a vaccine through PasteurMeriex Connaugt. The data from the SmithKline study shouldbe released soon-- stay tuned. Furthermore, there has beenmuch hype about an increased concentration of ticks thissummer.Rather than attribute this to El Nino, the CDCsuggests these heightened numbers are due to the fact that thetick life-cycle is two years and even-numbered years (hence1998) have historically seen more ticks.

Box 3150, Conway, NH 03818. Editor-in-Chief: Holly A. Weber, Contributing Editors: Frank R. Hubbell, DO, RebeccaS. Newton, Buck Tilton, Bryan Yeaton; Production Editor: Maury E.Rosenbaum,Mercury NEWSLETTER BUG DOPE REVISITEDBy David Baughan, MDFor anyone in the North Country who has spent five minutesoutside in the past week, it is painfully evident that \"They AreHere.\"I am referring to black flies, not tourists or aliens.Even though much has been written about insect repellents,some new information has come to light that I wanted to sharesince this will be a peak time for people to be buying and usingvarious chemicals on their bodies.This information concerns DEET (diethyltoluamide), the mostcommon ingredient in commercial insect repellents. DEEThas been around in public use since the 1950s. Themanufacturer's claim to safety is that it has been used bymillions of people annually for decades without apparentepidemics of diseases or death. Scattered reports appearperiodically concerning seizures in children. The more welearn about the physical and chemical properties of DEET,though, the more cause for concern I find.A little chemistry: a ring of six carbon atoms joined by double-bonds is called a benzene ring. Benzenes are very carcinogenicto animals and humans. Toluene is a variation on the benzenering that is also toxic. DEET (diethyltoluamide) is a variationon a toluene ring. Now a variation on a variation does notequal a smoking gun for cancer, but it warrants carefulattention. What happens when this is sprayed or rubbed onpeople? Sixty-percent is absorbed through the skin. It then isspread throughout the body by the circulatory system. It isreadily stored in the body's fat stores, where it may be stored orslowly metabolized for a long period. It also can easily passthrough what is called the \"blood-brain barrier,\" meaning itgets into and can be stored in the brain. So, in addition toimmediate reactions, there is concern for long-term effects thatbecome harder to study.I hate to raise alarms withoutconclusive evidence, but if you wanted to find a frequently usedchemical with potentially nasty properties, DEET would fit thebill. The Food and Drug Administration has recently taken thestep of limiting the percent of DEET that can be in productsmarketed for use in children to 10%, which is getting lowenough that black flies might consider it a seasoning ratherthan a repellent.Another feature of DEET that makes me uncomfortable: sprayit on plastic, spandex, or polyester sometime. Then watch thematerial deform or melt. I don't think I want that in my brainor liver!What other choices do we have? Permethrins will be the majoralternative, and some manufactures of repellents have alreadyor will soon be offering permethrin products along with orinstead of DEET. So read labels. Permethrins are derivedfrom chrysanthemums, so there are no benzene rings to worryabout. They do not penetrate the skin. In fact, one of theirdrawbacks is that they do not stick to skin well. But they stickto hair and clothes well. They also act as an insecticide, notjust a repellent (they work great on ticks). The vapor from 7clothes or hair has an envelope of protection around the otherparts of the body, although the effect may be insufficient at thebeach or whenever a person is in a bathing suit. For campers,hikers, cyclists and other athletes who aren't naked, though,permethrins can have a prolonged effect. Permethrin powderscan be added to the rinse cycle of clothes and last through upto six washings. Sprays can last on clothes or tents or sleepingbags for days. And they won't dissolve the tent.Avon's Skin-So-Soft and citronella oils do have someeffectiveness, but keep them handy. They need to be re-appliedalmost hourly to give protection.So please enjoy the beautiful outdoors but consider the safetyof the chemicals you use.

Itspans a very broad area covering practical medical problemsof mountain rescue, diagnosis and management of highaltitude illnesses and injuries, as well as research in all theseareas.Today we have 500 members-- practitioners andresearchers- from all over the world. As the society wasstarted by physicians involved in rescue in the Alps, today wehave 67% of our members in Western Europe, 21% in NorthAmerica, 7% in Japan, and the remaining 5% from variouscountries around the world. At present much emphasis is puton increasing membership outside of Europe.The major goal of ISMM is to provide information on practicaland scientific issues related to mountain medicine, toencourage scientific discussion, and to promote research co-operations.These goals are achieved through publishing aquarterlynewsletter and organizingor co-sponsoringinternational scientific meetings.The newsletter of our society has developed to a most valuableand well-received source of information as it contains regularreviews of relevant topics on mountain medicine andphysiology written by leading scientists and case discussionsinvolving experts around the world. It also provides themembers with a list ofrelevant new publications, book reviews,and valuable information about forthcoming meetings,research projects, and other matters of interest to our members---who are encouraged to participate actively by presenting_cases, or posing questions or stating opinions in letters to theeditor.In this issue of the Wilderness Medicine Newsletter, you willfind an example of a case discussion on \"Altitude Exposure3 0with Chronic Renal Failure\" which was published in Volume8, Number 3, July, 1998. Other topics of recent discussionswere: \"Traveling with an Infant to La Paz,\" \"Participation High Altitude.\" Recent Ventilation A45 year old hypertensive (treated) manwith stable chronic renal failure (CRF) and well-controlledepilepsy wishes to travel on a 4-week remote trek in theKangchenjunga region of Nepal. He has not told thetrekking company about his medical history. There is adoctor accompanying the trek who has no previousexperience of wilderness/high altitude medicine. Thepatient's general physician contacts you for advice whatwould you say?Brownie Schoene, USACancel the trip and go to Hawaii instead.Stephen Bezrushka, USAAs I always answer, it depends on the motivation of this man,how important it is for him to do this, and whether he acceptsthe unknown but increased risk of altitude, and difficultiesgetting help.John Severinghaus, USAI would like to know more: the trekkers will go.2)Is he have edema? 4)Is he acidoticor allcalotic? 5)Has he been at high altitude before and if sohow did he fare?The epilepsy probably is unimportant. Even if he seizes it isself limited and the doctor can presumably attend the minoreffects, tongue biting, incontinence, etc.That he hasn't told the trekking company doesn't say whetherhe chose not to or simply hadn't yet done so. If the former, he should be advised not to go on these grounds alone. If he plansto tell them and ask their permission and counsel, then thereferring physician will have the choice. If his renal failurecreates edema, or alkalosis from CI loss I would say don't go.If he has no edema and is normal or acidotic he can probablytolerate it. But if he has not tried altitude before, he should tryit on Pikes Peak or some other place overnight first. A problemis if he gets into HAPE diuretics may not work well.Buddha Basnyat, NepalI do not know if telling the trekking company will make a bigdifference.They will at the most say get an OK from hisphysician. Were his seizures brought on by CRF? If so then ifhis CRF is under control he can probably go on to high altitudeas well controlled hypertension is not a contraindication forgoing to high altitude. However if his seizure was idiopathic Iwould like to know how long he has been seizure free. Ifseizure free for more than 2 years he is probably OK to go buthe should be told that some people with a past history ofseizure have seized in the mountains even after a long seizurefree interval.I would tell him to stay away from seizurethreshold lowering drugs like ciprofloxacin (commonly usedfor diarrhea in the mountains). I would make sure the treatingphysician knows about seizure management. If he has hadmore recent seizures like within a year or so I guess I wouldcaution him about going although the data is not there tosupport me. If I were the patient I would also make sure andbuy helicopter insurance for evacuation if necessary andregister my name in my embassy in Nepal.Eric Swenson, USAI would advise against this man taking the trek. Without thedetails of his medical history or severity of his renalinsufficiency, I lean to being very conservative. What concernsme is the potential for trouble if he becomes dehydrated, whichis not a trivial problem (gastroenteritis, insufficient cleanwater, insufficient intake relative to normal losses (respiratoryand cutaneous).Both dehydration and poor control of hisblood pressure (the latter as a consequence of hypoxemia)could put his renal function at some risk. I haven't any idea ofthe,consequences of hypoxemia on metabolism of his epilepticmedication, but if it is a drug with a narrow therapeutic index,this may alter his otherwise well treated epilepsy. Fits andrenal failure won't make for a pleasant sojourn in the hills.James Milledge, UKThis 45 year old man has more than his fair share of problemsbut they are apparently all under drug control. Would altitudebe expected to make any of his problems worse? Although theBP sometimes rises in healthy subjects, Halhuber et al. (1985)found that hypertension does not get worse at 3000m and therewere no cases of heart failure or CVAs in almost a thousandpatients.There may be arisein pressure earlyinacclimatization with increase sympathetic drive and Hultgrenadvises that the pressure be checked and an increase in anti-hypertensive drugs given if indicated. I would be cautious inthis, however, as postural hypotension is also common onarrival at altitude. As regards chronic stable renal failure I 2know of no evidence that altitude makes matters worse.Obviously dehydration must be avoided. Epilepsy, as far as weknow, is also not made worse by altitude and Clarke found thatwell controlled patients are not at particular risk of seizures ataltitude. So theoretically it should be all right for this patientto go on a trek assuming he is otherwise fit and can manage agood hill walking day at low altitude without trouble. Howeverthe combination of these three problems in one indiVidualshould make one pause.He should certainly discuss theproblem with the trek doctor and trek leader and only go if theyare happy with the responsibility. He should take a generoussupply of medication with spare drugs and rescue drugs forepilepsy being carried by the doctor. Halhuber, MJ, et al. (1995) Does altitude cause exhaustion of the heart andcirculatory system?...in High Altitude Deterioration, Eds Rivolier, RJ et 192-202.Peter Barry, UKWhat is the general physician asking? There are many waysof looking at this question.Is the patient at risk of anexacerbation of one or more of his many problems if he goeson this trek? Quite clearly, he could develop an intercurrentgastrointestinaldisturbanceandbecomedehydrated,compromising his renal function and precipitating acutechronic renal failure. He could stop absorbing or be unable totake his anti-convulsants and have a seizure. Presumablyhypoxia would lower his seizure threshold? Is there anyevidence for this? Is there an effect per se of raised intercranialpressure and pre-existing epilepsy?Should the patient tell the trekking company? Yes. Thepatient potentially endangers himself and his fellow travelers.These risks may be acceptable, but the participants should beable to make some sort of informed decision as to whether theytake part.Should the physician tell the trekking company ifthe patient won't? This is more difficult. Can I just pose thequestion and then duck it? Should the doctor accompanyingthe trek have some previous experience or at least training inwilderness/high altitude medicine? Yes, and should the ISM1v1be laying down standards for medical cover for such treks?{Personally I think not, but what do others think? There, morequestions that answers, I am afraid, but as Brownie said,Hawaii looks like a much more attractive option, both from thepatient's point of view and that of the trekking company (atleast he can drive down to sea level!). Charles Houston, USAThe man with hypertension and chronic renal failure andepilepsy has three strikes against him and should not go to aremote place anywhere, least of all the Himalayas. Epilepsy isprobably not affected by altitude, but the other problems posetoo great a risk. No one should go on (or be accepted for) atrek to a remote altitude area without full disclosure of medicalhistory. And in general a doctor for such a trip should havesome understanding about high altitude. JULY/AUGUST 199831WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER David Murdoch, New ZealandIn many ways this is an issue of risk perception. Is theperceived risk associated with the proposed journey acceptableor not?The person in question clearly perceives the risk to himself asacceptable, otherwise he would not be planning the journey.None of the medical conditions mentioned are absolutecontraindications to remote high altitude travel (assuming heis not dialysis-dependent). Therefore, on an individual level, Iwould find it difficult to tell him to cancel his trip outright. Iwould, however, be very up-front with any concerns regardingmaintenance of adequate hydration, the added risks ofintercurrent illnesses on renal function and epilepsy control,the potential hazards to himself and others if he does becomeunwell, and the difficulties managing such problems in awilderness setting.This scenario is complicated by his intention to travel with anorganized group. He now has some unwilling partners in hisrisk-taking. Consequently, the decision whether the perceivedrisk of traveling with this person is tolerable or not needs to bemade at a group level (probably through the trekking companyor expedition doctor).There is no doubt that he shoulddisclose his medical history to the accompanying doctor andhis general physician should encourage this. Many trekkingcompanies would be very reluctant to take on this persondespite the fact that many people with similar medical historieshave safely undertaken such treks. However, it is well withintheir rights to do so.This issue is complex and has few (if any) absolutes. If thisman is determined to undertake the journey, perhaps the bestwe can do is to suggest he organize a trek with some willingacquaintances and a flexible itinerary, provide him with thebest available information on the risks, and encourage him toget good medical insurance! Do we know the cause of the 45year old's renal failure?Tom Hornbein, USAWouldn't touch him with a 10 foot pole. That he hasn't toldthe trek company is an early warning that he's bad news,putting the whole trek at risk. If he wants to hire a guide onhis own, that's his business, and risks are obviously greater forhim than others, but risk is what the game's all about anyway.Simon Gibbs, UKThe patient is irresponsible if he has misled the tour company.The fluid shifts encountered on the trek may lead to loss ofcontrol of his hypertension and epilepsy and destabilization ofhis renal failure.I would like more clinical details before Istrongly advised against the trek but his medical conditions donot bode well.I am sure he is a good example of why themorbidity of trekking with a tour company has becomesignificant. 3 32Gustavo Zubieta (Sr.), BoliviaWith this kind of disease, I do not recommend that he goestrekking. I would not recommend that anyone go to the top ofMount Everest, unless he wants to demonstrate how a humanbeing can tolerate an enviromnent. If such is the case then Iwould say, go ahead at your own risk.Gustavo Zubieta (Jr.), BoliviaDefinitely not reconunended. One thing is a pleasure trip (thatoften has complications, even for healthy people) and anotheran absolute necessity. Here in La Paz (3100-4100 m) we havepeople coming or living with all kinds of disease, but they haveno other choice (work, family ties, home, etc.). Furthermore,this is also a city with all kinds of medical knowledge andfacilities, if necessary.This question, brings to my mind astory of a man that went trekking and fell into deep coma. Hewas evacuated by helicopter, and ambulance-plane and whenhe recovered at his home hospital asked: \"Why did you bringme back? It was die there.\"Gerald Dubowitz, Pheriche, NepalEasy, don't go.Worsening of renal associated problems are a problem in thisenvironment which may upset his \"stable\" position. Theepilepsy is not a contraindication to mountain travel per seespecially if well controlled.The remoteness is perhaps more of a worry than the highaltitude trekking.I would suggest a less remote trek, a goodinsurance police, and a suggestion to consider alternativevenues/pursuits (skydiving?).Andy Pollard, UKEven with the limited medical information we have here, it isclear that this individual is at risk of serious complications ofhis chronic illness during a remote trek. If he is fully informedabout the potential dangers and the difficulties in managingcomplications (because of the absence of immediate medicalfacilities) he should be free to make his own decisions abouttaking such risks. The real problem here is the effect that thisman's chronic illnesses are likely to have on his companionswho may be inconvenienced and even put in danger should herequire evacuation on medical grounds. Should he developproblems during the trek, there could be legal implications forhis own physician, the trek doctor, of even the trekkingcompany if he is not carefully advised. If he remains adamantthat he wants to go he should be persuaded not to go with acommercial trek but to make private arrangements and toensure that he has adequate insurance for evacuation. The other major activity of the ISMM is to participate inorganizing meetings such as the.Biannual World Congress inHigh Altitude Medicine. Recent congresses were held in LaPaz, Bolivia; Cuzco, Peru: and Matsumoto, Japan.

Newton, W-EMT During the summer of 1995, headlines across the United Statesspoke of doomed Midwesterners in Illinois, Missouri, andWisconsin; in July of that year, the death toll due to the heatwave broke 700 in Chicago alone. In 1996, when the OlympicGames came to Atlanta, event medical teams were ready toimplement the efforts of many months of planning to cope withthe health problems that athletes were expected to encounterduring the scorching southern summer. In 1997, record-hightemperatures in Orange County, California, began in Marchand didn't abate until well into August. This spring, thetemperature hit 100 in Dallas on May 31st, and the extremeweather was implicated in the death of a 23-year-old bicyclista few days later. At the time of this article, Texas continues tobreak the records on high temperatures and correspondingdeath tolls.Humans function best within a narrow temperature range.Although media attention has been heaped upon the past fewyears' hot-weather maladies - and although every naturaloccurrence in 1998 seems to be the fault of El Nino, if youbelieve recent reports - heat illness is nothing new. 4One of the body's most delicate balances is that between thewater it takes in from the environment and the water it producesas waste. This balance makes crucial contributions to thethermoregulatory system. The body relies upon its circulatorysystem to transport materials internally, cooling fluids as theytravel away from the core and through the extremities. Thebody also relies upon sweating's evaporative cooling to keep itfunctioning when ambient temperatures rise. The defensesoffered by the sweating mechanism may be lost, however, as aresult of external factors, such as the heat and humidity of theenvironment, or as a result of internal factors, such as apredisposing medical problem.Effective sweating relies upon a difference between thehumidity level just above the skin and that of the surroundingair, and upon convection of the air to carry away moistureremoved from the skin. A reproduction of this mechanism iswhat you create when you splash water from your water bottleon yourself while coasting down a hill on a bicycle or whilestanding on a breezy mountaintop. Sweating loses efficiency inhumid weather; water is not transferred from the body to thesurrounding air when the environment surrounding the body isalready saturated with water, especially if the air is calm andconvective effects are decreased.Even heat without humidity makes thermoregulation achallenge.In accordance with basic thermodynamics, heattransfer occurs between an object and its environment when thetwo are at different temperatures; heat always moves from hotterto cooler. The human body maintains itself at approximately98.6 F (37 C). When the ambient temperature creeps into the90s, approaching the body's own thermal set-point, the body hasan increasingly difficult time ridding itself of excess heat.When the body is overwhelmed either by heat produced by itsown activity or by heat absorbed from the surroundingenvironment, its cooling mechanisms can fail even underconditions of moderate heat and humidity. The very old, thevery young, and anyone without good general health are mostsusceptible to heat illness.Those too poor to afford effectiveair-conditioning and cooling systems, particularly in urbanenvironments, also tend to be hard-hit by hot weather. Medicalconditions that put a person at risk include diabetes, high bloodpressure, hyperthyroidism, heart disease, anorexia nervosa,bulimia, parkisonism, scleroderma, burn scarring, obesity, andfever.Certaindrugs-includinganticholinergics,antidepressants,antihistamines,amphetamines,diuretics,phenothiazines, psychotropics, and even alcohol - can alsoincrease vulnerability to heat illnesses. However, such simplefactors as fatigue, lack of acclimatization to heat, a history ofheat illness, or a recent bout of vomiting or diarrhea (causingsignificantfluidloss)maypredisposeevenhealthyoutdoors-people to problems.Indeed, heat illnessisa common backcountry ailment.Drinking-quality water is hard to come by in the woods, andwater sources can be unreliable, especially in hot summermonths when they're needed most. Carrying enough water, even JULY/AUGUST 1998 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER23 for a short dayhike, makes a heavier pack than some wanderersare willing to tolerate.Backcountry travellers may be all the more vulnerable sincethey tend to be in good shape and are often under the mistakenimpression that this will protect them from heat illness. To thecontrary, a tendency to challenge boundaries and to push limitsof physical comfort-part of the appeal of backcountry travelitself - is what gets so many outdoorspeople into trouble.Although acclimatizing oneself with gradual exposure toincreasing exertion in hot weather does help prevent heatillness, acclimatization is not immunity. Anyone travellingunder his or her own power stands to lose large volumes ofbody fluid to sweat.An excessive loss of fluid withoutreplacement will endanger even the best-conditioned athlete.In fact, an individual who is acclimatized generally beginssweating more easily than an unacclimatized individual, andmay generate more than twice as much perspiration during thesame activity.This quick and effective response indicatesincreased fitness of the acclimatized person's cooling system.But when the water is difficult to replace, such an adaptation isa mixed blessing.Furthermore, thirst is not a reliable gauge of how much waterone should take in. By the time thirst is noticed, chances arethe body has already fallen at least one liter short of adequatehydration; and the thirst mechanism may shut off when as littleas two percent of the needed fluid has been replaced. A loss ofthree to four liters can cause serious impairment, including afilly percent decrease in endurance and a twenty-five percentreduction of maximum oxygen uptake. The real danger zonefor imminent heat illness hovers around a ten percent loss ofbody weight, which for the average 70-kg person representsabout seven liters of fluid.But the body faces danger well before seven liters' loss. As heatstress begins to overload protective cooling mechanisms, evenmild dehydration can predispose an active person to heatcramps, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke.Heat CrampsHeat cramps are pains in fatigued muscles - often in theabdomen or extremities - that begin during or even severalhours after exercise in hot weather. Caused by a loss of fluidsandelectrolytes(primarilysodium,potassium,andmagnesium), they can be prevented by keeping well-hydrated,acclimatizing gradually to strenuous exercise in hot weather,avoiding overdressing against the cold, stretching well beforeexertion, and eating foods rich in potassium (such as bananas)and other essential ions. Treatment entails replacing what waslost and restoring comfort to the patient. Replace lost fluid andsalt with a mixture of 1 teaspoon salt per 1 quart water. (Sugaror drink mix helps to cut the salty taste of the water.) Tosoothe cramped Muscles, rest with legs elevated and stretchwell.Avoid massage, which is likely to contribute to latersoreness. Heat cramps only require medical attention when 5they occur in people who have heart problems or who follow alow-sodium diet.Heat ExhaustionHeat exhaustion often begins with thirst and a headache. Thesigns and symptoms of heat exhaustion are similar to thosethat indicate shock:lethargy, fatigue, slight tachycardia,tachypnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, pale skin, diaphoresis,confusion. Like shock, heat exhaustion can be precipitated bya loss in the body's fluid volume (in this case, due todehydration) or by vasodilation (again, as a physiologicresponse to dehydration or as an attempt to cool the body), or,more commonly, by a combination of both these factors.Although heat exhaustion is not life-threatening in itself, itshould betreatedquickly and aggressively toavoidcomplications, including possible progression to heat stroke.Get to a cool place.Seek shade if available. Remove anyexcess clothing and apply cool cloths to the body, such as adamp bandanna on the forehead. Monitor body temperature.Again, replace lost fluids and electrolytes as much as possible.If fluid loss is severe, if vomiting occurs, or if the patient doesnot improve markedly with treatment, seek medical attention.Never give alcohol, cigarettes, caffeinated drinks, or otherstimulants to any patient with even the mildest heat illness.After about 24 hours, most victims of heat exhaustion shouldrecover, and can then resume activity cautiously.Heat StrokeHeat stroke, also known as sunstroke, is a truly life-threateningemergency.It can cause permanent disability and organdamage, and will progress to coma and death withoutimmediate care.Its cause is \"oversweating\" - the body'ssweating mechanism fails under stress, and body temperaturerises rapidly. Heat exhaustion may progress to heat stroke, orheat stroke may arise independently. Its early signs andsymptoms may mimic heat exhaustion. The differencebetween the two problems, however, is that heat stroke patientsexhibit notably altered brain function. Remember that achange in level of consciousness means that patients with heatstroke are not self-aware enough to help themselves, oftenbecause they will not realize what is happening. If you observehallucinations, combativeness, agitation, seizures, or any othersignof severelyalteredlevel of consciousnessin aheat-affected patient, think of heat stroke and act quickly.The classical picture of heat stroke is often seen in elderlypatients whose residences are inadequately cooled during hoturban summers; it typically has a slow onset and the patientpresents with skin that is red, hot, and dry. More common inpeople of all ages working and playing outdoors is exertionalheat stroke, which is typically quick-onset with skin that is red,hot, and sweaty.Treatment for either case is the same, and must be initiatedinunediately. Remove the patient from heat and sun. Cool by JULY/AUGUST 1998 WILDEWNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER3 4 soaking with water and fanning to accelerate evaporation.However, be cautious not to cool so aggressively that thepatient begins to shiver, because shivering will produce heatthat will counteract your treatment. Never apply ice directly tothe body, for risk of causing localized frostbite. If musclespasms begin or the patient starts to convulse, do not placeanything in the mouth. If vomiting occurs, keep the patient onhis side to avoid aspiration. Vigorously massage limbs to helpmove the extremities' cooler blood to the body's core and tobring the core's warmer blood out for cooling. Get the patientto a hospital as soon as possible.Prevention is Still the Best TreatmentThe key to every one of these problems is to treat it before itarises-- or, as a second-best, to halt it before it progresses.Common sense and self-awareness go a long way towardpreventing heat illness. Acclimatize yourself to warm weatherby building up your exertion level slowly; admit your limits,and respect them. Wear lightweight, light-colored clothes andkeep your head shaded from direct sunlight with alight-colored cap. Use extra caution if you exercise outdoorswhen the temperature is above 90 F or the humidity is above 70percent.Staying healthy, well-rested, and well-hydrated is the bestdefense against heat illnesses. Despite the recent flood ofbrightly-colored and enthusiastically-endorsed products on tothe sports-drink market, water remains the best \"fluidreplacement\" alternative. Concentrated sports drinks can evensabotage their own aims by drawing water into the stomach--and, hence, away from the rest of the body - in an effort todilute themselves. (At the very least, if you do choose thesedrinks, dilute them with water to save your body the work.)Try to drink at least two liters of water per day even whenyou're not especially active. Keep in mind that the body canlose upwards of one liter each hour during strenuous exercise.It's hard to replace fluids at that rate, especially when you'rehiking or biking or boating far from home. When weather ishot, stop often to rest and snack.If you're a backcountry trip leader, whether you're a hired guideor just the most experienced among a group of friends, youhave added responsibility to prevent heat illness. You mustkeep yourself in good condition to make sound decisions forthe group; your fellow travellers are trusting your ability tohelp guide them safely. Watch for lapses in judgement that cansignal the onset of a problem. As a leader, you can set a goodexample by breaking early and often for quick snack and waterbreaks. By doing so, you will help remove any stigma thatnovices travelling with you may feel about holding up thegroup.No matter how, when, or with whom you're travelling, set thetone early in the trip: keeping fed and hydrated is not adistraction or a luxury, but a necessity for safe and enjoyablebackcountry travel. 6REFERENCES: *Auerbach,PaulS.,ed.WildernessMedicine:Management of Wilderness and Environmental Emergencies,3rd Edition.

Finding none, you shouldmove to the focused assessment, which may shed light on whythe patient is breathing fast. A cause discovered and treatedshould reduce the hyperventilatory response.HYPERVENTILATION SYNDROME, here defined as breathing rapidly without another cause, occurs relativelyoften in otherwise healthy patients as a result of psychologicalstress. The patient, like most hyperventilating patients, will JULY/AUGUST 1998 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER have a high level of anxiety or panic. Rapid breathing blowsoff carbon dioxide, altering the pH of blood (raising it) acondition called respiratory alkalosis. Alkalosis may producenumbness and tingling in the mouth, fingers, and toes.Alkalosis may also induce carpopedal spasms, muscularspasms in the hands and feet. Rapid breathing may cause theslow onset of chest pain from overtaxed chest muscles.Lightheadedness and dizziness are not uncommon. Skin colormay vary from pale to flushed. These physiological responsesto hyperventilation do nothing to calm the psychologicallystressed patient.Prolonged hyperventilation will causeconstriction of the blood vessels in the brain, which may leadto fainting.Consciousness will return when the patient'scarbon dioxide level returns to normal.As soon as you know the patient's life is not threatened, youshould begin to help the patient regain control of breathing.Simple tips for you to follow include:Stay calm.Clear the immediate area of other people.State clearly to the patient that he or she feels terriblebecause of fast breathing.Ask the patient to breathe slower.Ask the patient to hold his/her breath for three seconds orlonger if possible, while you do the counting.Ask the patient to breathe through the nose.Ask the patient to breathe along with you in a slow, calmmanner.Be supportive in your attitudes and words.Do not ask the patient to breathe into a bag. It does notwork faster than calming the patient down. It may causemore anxiety for the patient.When the patient returns to normal breathing, and the signsand symptoms go away, recovery is complete. 061>ft-ikprosralliS ALEUTIAN SEA KAYAK PROGRAMBy Ted WalshWhen some members of the SOLO staff started to build seakayaks for their own use five years ago, a number of SOLOstudents had ati opportunity to see these unique boats indifferent stages of construction. The result was an oftenrepeated question, \"Do you think you would ever offer a sea 7kayak-building course?\" Out of this interest came the SOLOA.S.K. program.What we build and share with our students is a design thatmarries traditional construction with the best modern boat-building techniques. As with the originals, the frames of theboats are constructed of wood using classic techniques such aslashed and mortise joinery and bone ball joints. The skin,however, though hand-stitched, is nylon treated with hypalon.Based on the IQYAX-type, the boats are of the BAIDARKAfamily and measure approximately 18' long and 22\"-23\" wide.During the course each student builds his or her own boat; asa result each boat is customized to each paddler.Like all courses at SOLO, the emphasis is on \"open learningopportunities.\" While clearly the core of the curriculum iskayak construction and design, there are a number ofopportunities throughout the course to explore other aspectsrelating to kayaks, ranging from studying kayak safety tocreating Aleutian bent-wood hats. Due to past students' inputand interests, topics like weather, small craft navigation,coastal habitats, and paddle, clothing, and gearbag design andconstruction have been included in the course.Each student is encouraged to work at his or her own pace.Avoiding inflexible formulas, we teach skills based on generalprinciples of craft that can be modified to fit specific situations.Our goal is for students to leave with the skills and confidencenot only to build other kayaks on their own but also try anumber of other projects.Course length can be tailored to time constraints of students.In general, there are two programs. The month-long courseenables participants to build and complete the basic kayak,leaving final coats of paint and some minor finishing details tobe done by the student on his or her own after the course. Thesix-week course allows for complete finishing of individualboats and includes more time for customizing and developingindividual gear.The cost for the month-long program is $2800; cost for thesix-week course is $3200. The cost includes: room and board(minus meals on weekends), instructional fees, and allmaterials for your boat. Tuition does not cover kayak-relatedgear such as storage bags, life jackets, paddles, and pumps.Course dates are determined every six months. The nextprogram is slated for September 7 - October 17, 1998.

Newton, Buck Tilton, Bryan stay.Who heard aboutor even met overduehikerscallinginlatefordinner,ornovicebushwhackers toting Global Positioning System(GPS) units they don't know how to use? I'd ratherleave technology in the office, but, I realized recently,if I was to remain useful in my field of wildernessmedicine and leadership, I would need to rise abovemy techno-bigotry.GPS Makes Friends and Foeby Jeanne Twehous, WEMT I must admit, I was excited when the box markedMagellan arrived at the post. I unwrapped the shinyXL4000 loaner with haste; I couldn't wait to getstarted.But wait I did, and I learned rather quickly that aGPS unit is not a \"take-it out-of-the-box-and-I'll-read-the-instructions-later\" kind of tool. The best Icould do after 20 minutes of fiddling was determine,definitely, that my unit wasn't locking onto asatellite's signals.GPS might initially sound like a hiker's dream cometrue, but the technology is not a quick fix and is onlyas good as its user. If your map-and-compass andnavigation skills are lacking, GPS will not only nothelp you, it may get you into trouble by giving youthe false confidence to head into uncharted territory.GPS is (and always has been) meant to be usedalongside the fail-proof ability to read maps, use a38compassandgridsystem(latitude/longitude or UniversalTransverse Mercator [UTMI]),and observe your surroundings.GPS technology got its start in 1973 as a space-basednavigation system operated by the U.S. Departmentof Defense (DOD). GPS is able to determine a hiker'sposition on the earth's surface by calculating thedistance between you and signals from the 24satellites that orbit the earth. To receive a two-dimensional map position fix (lat/long or UTM), youneed to get a read from three satellites (four willdetermine elevation). From there, you need to be ableto apply these coordinates to a map, use yourcompass to set and follow a bearing, and use yourhead to determine the most sensible route. GPS offersinformation in a straight line, which, if you're on, say,Mount Washington, could send you right over theedge of the Tuckerman Ravine headwall.You also should know that the DOD has built inwhat's called Selective Availability, a process thatvariessignals.(You can get around SelectiveAvailability, but it's not cheap, or always practical.)For horizontal readings, count on variations ofroughly 50 to 300 feet. For elevation, GPS is evenless accurate, which is not reassuring if you're sockedin on a winter ridgeline.But I was simply tramping the low-lands of the SOLOcampus where I work, so why was I having such adifficult time? I puzzled a while longer. Seemed I wasstanding too near too many buildings or under toomany trees--or both--to get my \"position fix.\" I meandered around trying to find holes to the sky.Eventually,Ihadmanagedseveralsetsofcoordinates. I punched in coordinates to get me from\"DECK\" to \"ORCHARD,\" and I got my bearing. Itwas time for my compass.But I had run out of time. Seemed I should've spentthe big bucks. You see, a unit that would've seen methrough those pesky trees and other obstructionsright now costs roughly $1,000. Of course, thetechnology is changing almost daily; it shouldn't takelong for prices to fall. But if, like me, you're using oneof the less expensive models (handhelds begin at justunder $200; the model I used retails for $250), densecanopy, ridges, and valleys (read: Northeast), deepcanyons, or tall buildings can keep you from beingable to lock onto satellites or keep a position fix. Itsometimes took me 20 minutes or more to lock on tothe requisite three satellites while testing in NewHampshire's White Mountain National Forest, wherevegetation is lush and dense. A map and compasswere looking more and more like all I needed-- untilItalked with Lieutenant Rick Estes, head ofspecialized search and rescue for New HampshireFish and Game. Estes swears by the $920 BruntonXLI000 he uses in his search-and-rescue missions.When Estes sends out his rangers, they carry thesehigh-end GPS units. By using them, says Estes, hisrescuers know, almost beyond a shadow of a doubt,that they have searched every corner of an area. \"It'snice to be able to tell the family with confidence thatwe have most assuredly covered that territory,\" hesaid. Learned well, GPS allows you to find your exactposition on a map, can set and keep a bearing, tell youthe distance you've traveled, how much farther youhave to go, if you've lost your course, and how to getback on track.Now I was getting somewhere, I was beginning tcunderstand the public's enthusiastic embrace of GPSAccording to the U.S. GPS Industry Council, globaconsumer sales could exceed 8 billion by the yea2000 and $16 billion by 2003. \"I'd like to see thtechnology take off,\" Estes words echoed. At thAppalachian Trail Conference's recent annual meetiniin western Maine, a GPS workshop I was intereste,in had sold out--80 people! The next best seller ha,only 20 participants. \"I'd like to see the technologtake off,\" Estes words echoed. \"Once you know hal 2BEST COPYAVAILABLEto use GPS, you can turn it on, and within two orthree minutes, know exactly where you are. It's goodstuff \"Still, I can't help but feel a little nostalgic for the dayswhen heading into the backcountry meant gettingaway from phones and computers and relying on suchsimple things as our smarts, a map, and a $15compass. And Estes says he hasn't changed his mindabout one thing: \"GPS is not a magic wand. Thiskind of technology does give people a false sense ofsecurity. We've got to keep getting that message out.\"U.S. Forest Service ranger Chris Joosen says hethinks that within the next few years GPS will beconsideredindustrystandardforoutdoorprofessionals and guides, rangers, and search-and-rescue personnel. I guess my, and probably your,techno-phobe days are numbered. Editor's Note: This article first appeared in AMC Outdoors inOctober of 1997 and is reprinted by permission.

SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 199839WILDERNESS MEDICINE MAINTAININGTHE TRAINING...Keeping Knowledge,Skills, and Certifications CurrentBy Holly A. Weber, (W)EMT-UCn the outdoor industry, emergency medicaltraining has come a long way in just over twodecades. Given that expeditions are routinelystaffed with Wilderness EMTs, that tripleaders and guides are required to have WildernessFirst Responder certification to lead programs ofextended durations, and that even camps and outingclubs are investing in Wilderness First Aid courses, itis no surprise that backcountry medicine continues tobe a hot topic of conversation. Nowadays, with thewidespread availability of courses and the maturity ofthe \"big three\" wilderness training schools, thequestions have changed from \"Where do I find thetraining?\" to \"How do I keep my certificationcurrent?\"So before you catch yourself in one ofthose, \"oops, I forgot\" situations, you might want totake a few notes.Retaining Vs. Maintaining the TrainingAs with any certification, the challenge is two-fold:first, how to provide for the best retention ofskills and knowledge, and second, how to keep thecertification current. While the two challenges gohand-in-hand, it is often very easy to tip the balanceby not having access to sick or injured parties or bydisregarding the expiration date on the card. Well,here are a few tips to help the wilderness-trained andemergency medicine-minded folks survive outside ofthe wilderness zone.Retaining: Skills & Knowledge RetentionThe maxim \"What I hear, I forget. What I see, Iremember. What I do, I know\" has been a mantra inthe experientially-oriented outdoor industry fordecades. When it comes to wilderness medicine, thechant is the same; although, unlike climbing ropes andhiking boots, there is not a plethora of sick andwounded folks just hanging out waiting for someaction.Even in peak backcountry season, riskmanagement programs have helped to reduce thenumber of casualties in the great outdoors. It is nosurprise that schools like Stonehearth Open Learning 3Opportunities (SOLO) in Conway, New Hampshire;the Wilderness Medicine Institute (WMI) in Pitkin,Colorado; and the Wilderness Medical Associates(WMA) of Bryant Pond, Maine, field hundreds ofquestionson\"stayingsharp,\"\"keepingtheinformation fresh,\" and \"how to use what I know sothat I don't lose it.\"First, keep in mind that wilderness medicine ismedicine, which means there is a certain level ofacademic retention that is required. In order to keepup with the changes in medicine, you need to haveaccess to them. SOLO and WMI encourage theirstudents to subscribe to journals that provide sourcesof current information.The Wilderness MedicineNewsletter was designed to fulfill that very purpose.Beyondthat,countlessothermagazinesandpublications provide sources of updated informationand techniques such as the Journal of EmergencyMedical Services and Emergency Medical ServicesMagazine. Both of these monthly magazines havecontinuing education review sections with quizzesthat can be scored for credit. An outdoor magazinesuch as Backpacker has a regular column onbackcountry medical concerns and treatments called\"Body Language,\" and Outside postsregulardispatches of wilderness medical tips.Manymembership organizations such as the National SkiPatrol and the Appalachian Mountain Club alsofeaturegreatreviewarticlesforbackcountrypractitioners. Furthermore, most libraries subscribeto the true medical journals like The New EnglandJournal of Medicine and JAMA. Periodicals aredefinitely a great place to start.If the post office just won't deliver magazines andjournals to the environs of your license plate, perhapsit, is time to pick up a few good wilderness medicalbooks for your personal library.Globe PequotPublishers has recently unveiled The Wilderness FirstResponder by Buck Tilton and Frank Hubbell, DO.This book is a tremendous compilation of informationfrom two of the guys who have made pre-hospitalwilderness medicine what it is today. The NationalOutdoor Leadership School has also released a thirdedition of their popular NOLS Wilderness First Aidby Linda Lindsey and Tod Schimelpfenig. You canfindpocket-sizedfirstaidreference books incommercially-packaged first aid kits such as Tilton's SEPTEMBERA1ER1998WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER Backcountry First Aid and Extended Care in AtwaterCarey's kits or Dr. Eric Weiss' Wilderness andTravel Medicine in his Adventure Medical Kits.These handy references can be carried just aboutanywhere for a quick review. The WildernessMedical Associates have also published a pocketreferenceguidecalledWildernessMedicalAssociates'Field GuideauthoredbyJamesMorrissey. Of course, if you prefer a light and easyapproach to wilderness medicine, my personalfavorite isstill Medicine for the Backcountry byTilton and Hubbell.For the adventure traveler who is always on the go,carrying around a library of reference books may notseem too appealing.Take heart-- there are otherresources out there, many of which are moreparticipative. Wilderness medicine conferences havebeen cropping up allover the country.TheWilderness Medical Society of Indianapolis, Indianahosts at least three different wilderness medicineconferences and scientific assemblies each year.Locatedinchoicerecreationalareas,theseconferences generally provide a mix of hands-onworkshops, lectures, and seminars. Other nationalconferencessuchastheWildernessRiskManagement Conference and the Association forExperientialEducation'sregionalandnationalconferences offer wilderness medical workshops andpre-conference seminars.The more traditionalrescue, disaster, and EMS conferences are alsobeginning to include a mix of urban and wildernessworkshops.If you can't afford the travel andexpense of these conferences, inquire about thepossibility of bartering services. Many nationalconferences scramble for assistance with set-up andtake-down activities...if there's a will, there's a way!Locked into an urban environment with no way outfor part of the year? Worry not-- check out theevents calendars at your local outdoor shops. It isnot uncommon for stores like Eastern MountainSports or REI to host lectures on backcountry firstaid. And if they don't, why not organize such anevent yourself? Chances are, if there is one WFR orWEMT getting rusty, there's probably another nottoo far away. Other avenues to explore are the in-services held at local hospitals, community centers,skipatrols,searchandrescueteams,fire 4departments, and rescue squads. And while you'rethere, why not explore the possibility of volunteeringor observing?The more Americans head outdoors, the moreopportunities there are for volunteering. Events arebeing hosted across the country for just about everysport out there.Where there are people andcompetitions, there are, unfortunately, accidents andinjuries.Whether it is the Climb to the Clouds onMount Washington, the Boston Marathon, or a localwalk-a-thon, most events need volunteers to staff firstaid tents or comfort centers. Check with areaChambers of Commerce to get an idea of what'sgoing on around you and take the opportunity to getinvolved.Each experience will provide hands-ontraining of a unique kind.Volunteerism can be a very gratifying way to keepwilderness medical skills sharp. Many non-traditionalhealth care groups seek willing individuals to travel todeveloping countries and help provide services.Groups like GeoMed and Doctors Without Bordersare just a couple. Sometimes, though, you don't haveto go too far from home. Urban free clinics and cityshelters often could use the extra hand as well.If you can't get your hands on live patients, there isalways the option of taking more classes and beingexposed to more simulations and scenarios. Each ofthe schools mentioned earlier hosts a variety ofprograms, workshops, and seminars throughout theyear and across the country. A formalized reviewsession often does wonders in boosting confidencelevels.If all else fails, get a group of your hiking orpaddling cronies together and set up your own firstaid scenarios-- a little imagination goes a long way!Maintaining: Keeping Certifications CurrentWhile many of us find exercising our minds veryeasy, getting off our duffs to file paperwork isn't aseffortless.Although it may seem complicated,keeping a certification current is generally an easierroute than dealing with a lapsed certification.However, that may require a bit of discipline. In mostcases certifications are granted for two years, butregardless of the time frame, the date of expiration isthe date of expiration. Most employers can't turn incopies of expired cards to their insurance companies SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 19984 1WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER or their accreditation boards. If the card is about torun out, contact the issuer right away. In many casesissuing organizations can grant an extension to getyou through to the next recertification class. (Butremember Visa can't increase the limit of yourAmerican Express card, so start at your trainingsource.) Keep in mind that at the Wilderness FirstResponder and Wilderness EMT levels, the de factostandardcertificationsrequireacurrent CPRHealthcare Provider (American Heart Association-- atwo-year card) or CPR for the Professional Rescuer(American Red Cross-- a one-year card) card to beconsidered valid.Generally, the two certificationsexpire on the same date. ALERT: some states stillhave not approved the two-year CPR certification, sopay close attention.While Wilderness First Aid card holders have themoststraight-forwardrecertificationprocess--retaking the course, WEMT card holders have a morecomplicated process. WEMTs must hold currentstate or national EMT certification, which means twoseparate sets of recertification challenges (one for theEMT and one for the \"W\") and are generally requiredto track their continuing education hours. WildernessFirstRespondersusually have tosuccessfullycomplete a two-day review program but are notrequired to show verification of their continuingeducation hours.Individuals holding specialtycertifications like the National Ski Patrol's OutdoorEmergency Care card have yet another set ofrequirements.Regardless of the certification, itmakes sense to be proactive: Call for program listingsand ask questions before the cards expire. Stash ajournal of activities in a safe place with yourcertification cards (keep laminated photocopies inyour wallet when you travel to work or expedition toKatmandu.) File for extension in advance if travelingout of the country for long periods or if illness and/orinjurywillprevent you from completing therecertification process before the date of expiration.Proper Prior Planning...Regardless of the path you travel, keepingcurrent with information, skills, and certifications,comes down to advance planning. By keeping awareof the resources around you and abreast of thepolicies governing your standard of care, you will bebetter able to prevent those \"uh-oh\" situations.

This listof course topics is not intended to be used as a course curriculum or outline, but rather, the recommendedcontent for a WFR course as determined by the Wilderness Medical Society.Early this spring the Wilderness Curriculum Committee, consisting of Bill Aughton, Nancy Doherty, Melissa Gray,Frank Hubbell, Dennis Kerrigan, Paul Marcolini, and myself, met and hammered out a first draft. At the beginningof October, after a series of revisions and comments by the committee, a final draft was put forth to the WMS Boardof Directors along with many providers and consumers of wilderness medical education for an assessment of thesupport for the document. The final document will be available through the WMS at the end of November.

Yourfirst impression is positive: The youngwoman appears strong and healthy. But inresponse to your questions she says, \"It'ssore and it itches, and it burns when I pee.I'm getting scared.\"common in men. An inguinal hernia occurs when ofthe intestine protrudes into or scrotum. Weakabdominal muscles due to congenital malformations,trauma, aging, or any activity that in-creasesintra-abdominal pressure suchas coughing, straining, lifting, or vigor-ous exertion may cause a hernia. Injuries or illnesses involving the geni-talia of your clients can be embarrassing, you bet, andfrightening and, from time to time, even life-threatening.These emergencies range from simple urinary tract infec-tions that can be treated in the field to testicular torsionthat results in the loss of a testicle to ruptured ectopicpregnancies with fatal internal blood loss. These problemshave occurred on outdoor trips. You, the trip leader,should be able to assess, treat, and decide when to evacu-ate a client with injured or ill genitalia. Both you and the client will appreciate a privateplace to talk. The client will benefit if you can maintaineye contact while being straightforward, respectful, andnon-judgmental. Use proper medical terminology and/orterms that you both understand. Avoid jokes or slang. Amember of the client's sex should be present before andduring any physical exam--especially where minors areinvolved--unless it is impossible.MALE-SPECIFIC EMERGENCIESInguinal HerniaInguinal hernias are possible in women but far more 4 6The client will complain of a lump orswelling in the groin and a sharp, steadypain.If the hernia becomes incar-ceratedstuck in the wrong place--theintestine may become blocked. The portion may thenbecome strangulated, the blood supply cut off, with deathof the bowel resulting. If the intestine is blocked, the lumpin the groin will become more swollen and more tender.The client may vomit and complain of wave-like abdomi-nal cramps. The abdomen will become swollen, and theclient will not have any stools. If you monitor bowelsounds by periodically placing your ear on the abdomen,you will hear an increase in bowel sounds, then a decrease,and fmally an absence of bowel sounds.Attempt to reduce the hernia by lying the client on hisback with the head and chest lower than the abdomen.Apply moderate, steady, upward pressure on the hernia toreduce it. It may take 10 minutes or longer to reduce thehernia. Monitor the client for the next 24 hours for signs ofintestinal obstruction.If you are unable to reduce the hernia or if the herniareappears after reduction, the client will need to be evacu-ated. If signs and symptoms of intestinal blockage orstrangulation are present, evacuate the client immediately.Do not give the client anything to eat or drink unlessdehydration becomes a problem during a long evacuation,in which case small amounts of water at regular intervalsmay be given. Torsion of the TestisTorsion of the testis is a twisting of the testis withinthe scrotum. Mechanisms for testicular torsion could be asdramatic as violent physical activity or as simple as rollingover in a sleeping bag. Blood vessels become twisted,decreasing the blood supply to the testis. If the bloodsupply is totally cut off, the testis dies. After 24 hourswithout blood supply, little hope of saving the testicleremains.With many clients, the scrotum is suddenly andintensely full of pain, sometimes rendering the personunable to move. The scrotum grows red and swollen, andthe testis may appear slightly elevated on the affected side.The pain, however, can come on slowly, and the other\"classic\" signs and symptoms may be absent.Cool compresses and pain medication will providesome relief. An improvised \"jock strap,\" made, forexample, from a triangular bandage, will elevate thescrotum and may increase blood flow to the testis. Theclient who is unable to walk must be evacuated fortreatment immediately.If evacuation will be delayed, you may choose toattempt to rotate the affected testicle back into position.Since most testicles rotate \"inward,\" a gentle rotation\"outward\" may give immediate and blessed relief. Theclient may wish to make the rotation himself. If it doesn'twork, perhaps the testicle rotated in the opposite direction,so rotate the testicle two turns in the opposite direction. Ifyou fail, the client is no worse off than before the attemptwas made. In either case, the client suspected of sufferingtorsion of the testis should be evacuated as soon aspossible.EpididymitisEpididymitis is an inflammation of the epididymis, aproblem that can be caused by prostatitis (inflammation of the urethra). Epididymitis isnot caused by traumatic injury to the scrotum.The client suffers from pain in the scrotum, possiblyaccompanied by fever. The scrotum may be red andswollen. Epididymitis tends to come on slowly, perhapsover several days, unlike torsion of the testis which some-times comes on rapidly (see below).The treatment is bedrest--or bagrest--and support ofthe scrotum with a jock strap or whatever can be 2improvised to create support for the testicles. Anon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such asibuprofen may decrease the fever and pain. It is verydifficult to differentiate epididymitis from torsion of thetestis. Antibiotics are necessary, so the client must beevacuated when epididymitis is a possibility. FEMALE-SPECIFIC EMERGENCIESMittelschmerzSome women experience cramping in the lower ab-domen on the right or left side or in the back during themiddle of the menstrual cycle when the ovary releases anegg. The pain is sometimes accompanied by bloodyvaginal discharge. This is called mittelschmerz from theGerman mittel for \"middle\" and schmerz for \"pain.\"The pain may be sudden, sharp, and severe enough tobe confused with appendicitis or ectopic pregnancy. Askthe client where she is in her menstrual cycle. Has she everhad this pain before? Typically, a woman will have hadsimilar cramping in the past. Any light bleeding or painshould cease within 36 hours. The patient exam will revealthat her abdomen is soft. Women taking birth control pillsdo not ovulate, so they cannot have mittelschmerz.Managing the symptoms with over-the-counter painmedications and general support of the client is all that isusually required unless there is reason to suspect ectopicpregnancy. Monitor the client closely for signs of anotherserious abdominal emergency.DysmenorrheaDysmenorrh eaispaininassociationwithmenstruation. Possible causes include prostaglandins,which cause the uterus to endometritis, inflamma-tion of the endometrium; pelvic inflammatory disease; oranatomic anomalies such as a displaced uterus.Drugs such as ibuprofen reduce the pain as well as thevolume of flow and the length of the period. Relaxation exercisessuch as yoga and massaging the lower back or abdomen helpreduce the pain. Applying heat to the abdomen or lower backmay also help lessai the pain. A change in diet may help.Decreasing the amount of salt, caffeine, and alcohol in the dietwhile increasing the B vitaminsespecially B6, fotmd in brewersyeast, peanuts, rice, sunflower seeds, and whole grainscan offersome relief during the acute phase of the cramps. Becauseexercise causes endornhins (natural opiates) to be released by thebrain, many womat find that cramps diminish when they partici-pate in stramous exercise. NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 19984 7WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER Secondary AmenorrheaSecondary amenorrhea is the absence of menstrualperiods after a woman has had at least one period. Causesof secondary amenorrhea include pregnancy, ovarian tu-mors,intenseathletic training,altitude, and stress(physical and emotional). In the past itexcessive weight loss in female .athletes, resulting in low body fat,was the cause of amenorrhea. It isnow believed that stress (physicaland emotional) may cause hor-monal changes resulting in amen-orrhea. Changes in the menstrualcycle are common on outdoor ex-peditions and may be normal ad-justments to unfamiliar stresses.Vaginal InfectionsThe normal pH of the vaginais slightly acidic.

There may also be aburning sensation' during urination.Treatment should restore the acidity of the vagina.One approach is for the client to douche with plaindisinfected water or a solution of one to two tablespoonsof vinegar in a liter of warm disinfected water.

To help prevent vaginal infections, women shouldtake care 1) to clean the perineal area with plain water ora mild soap daily and to 2) wear cotton underpants andloose outer pants. Unlike cotton, nylon doesn't allow air tocirculate, thus giving bacteria a moist place to grow.Women prone to vaginal infections should avoid coffee,alcohol, and sugar, which can change the pH of thevagina.Urinary Tract InfectionUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are relatively rare inmen but common in women due to the relatively shortlength of the urethra through which problem-causinggerms are introduced. The infection can affect the urethra,bladder, ureters, even the kidneys.Urinary tract infections cause increased frequency orurgency of urination with decreased urine output and/or aburning sensation during urination. The client usuallycomplains of pain above the pubic bone and a heavy urineodor with the morning urination. Blood and/or pus may bepresent in the urine. Urinary tract infections can progress NOVEMBERIDECEMBER19984 8WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER to kidney infections. If the kidneys are infected, the clientusually complains of pain in the small of the back wherethe ribs join the backbone, and tenderness when that areais palpated. The client may have a fever.The best treatment for a UTI is antibiotics. Have theclient drink lots of water every day and empty the bladderoften. A client with a UTI should get as much rest aspossible. The perineal area should be cleaned with wateror mild soap daily. Eating cranberries, plums, and prunesmakes the urine slightly acidic, which improves the effec-tiveness of antibiotic therapy.On extended expeditions, consider carrying antibi-otics, such as Bactrim\u00ae or Keflex\u00ae to treat urinary tractinfections. Consult your physician for antibiotic specifics.Pyridium\u00ae, available over the counter, will help relievethe pain of urination, and should also be considered forfirst aid kits on extended outdoor trips. UTIs can bemanagedintheoutdoors,butnotkidneyinfections--therefore, if an infection persists for more than48 hours despite the use of antibiotics, the client should beevacuated. More Serious ConditionsOther more serious conditions can occur on outdoorexpeditions including pelvic inflammatory disease, toxicshock syndrome, and a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. All ofthese conditions require relatively rapid evacuation todefmitive medical care.While specific diagnosis in thefield is challenging, the outdoor care provider shouldrecognize serious signs and symptoms. It is recommendedthat you evacuate any woman who demonstrates: a highfever (>102 F), abdominal pain that persists for greaterthan 24 hours or that had a sudden onset and is sharp orlocalized, signs and symptoms of shock, vaginal bleedingnot associated with a regular menstrual period, and anywoman who has abdominal pain and who might possiblybe pregnant.

Newton, W-EMTFeatured in this Issue:BA CKCOUNTR Y SKIINGBackcountry skiing is one of the gifts of winter.Those who dread the season's snow may never understandthe lure of this powerful and graceful sport, but itsfollowers are passionate and continually growing in num-ber. While skiers suffer many injuries on the slopes eachyear, skiing causes few fatalities.Many of the problems suffered by skiers are fairlymild and fall into two general categories. The first is agroup of problems that tend to be caused by environmentalconditions, particularly by danger factors heightened bywinter weather, and include hypothermia, localized coldand moisture injuries (frostbite, blisters, and trenchfoot),and avalanche.These problems have warning signs orrelatively gradual onset and can be addressed with issuesof whole-body care and awareness of one's surroundings.The second group includes more severe ailments,such as sprains and dislocations at the joints and fracturesof the long bones.These problems are generally acuteinjuries caused by isolated traumatic incidents. The riskof such an injury can be decreased by awareness andcaution, but these are accidents that are often unpre-dictable and sometimes a simple matter of bad luck. It iscrucial that anyone who spends a good deal of time in thewinter backcountry understand the risks of and treatmentsfor these various problems. Just as necessary is the abilityto deal with these problems with competence and soundjudgement and to know when to seek outside help.ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMSHYPOTHERMIAOne of the most common of all backcountry mal-adies, particularly in winter, is hypothermia.As abackcountry skier, you are likely to spend your days goingthrough mixed periods of strenuous exertion, climbingwith skins or sidestepping a steep slope, and controlleddownhill maneuvers. You'll often take up the trail in themorning, as the air is warming and you're still powered bya hearty breakfast. As you ski throughout the day, yourenergy levels dwindle. By afternoon, your clothes may bedamp from the day's perspiration. The air chills quicklyonce the sun gets below the horizon--and sunset comesearlier than expected deep in mountain valleys. NOVEMBERIDECEMBER19984 9WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER To prevent hypothermia from becoming a problem onyour trips, be self-aware. Stay well-hydrated, as dehydra-tion is the root of so many backcountry troubles. If you'reon an extended trip (or if you're headed into isolated terrainwhere an accident could extend your trip unexpectedly),have a means of melting snow to make more water.Prevent your bottles from freezing shut; dry the threadsafter drinking, use wide-mouthed bottles, and make surethe bottles are sturdy enough not to crack in the coldweather.Keep one bottle insulated inside your pack toprevent freezing and another readily accessible so that youdon't need to take off your pack each time you'd like adrink. You'll be more inclined to stay hydrated if getting adrink is less of a hassle.The same general rule goes for food: snack often, andkeep it simple.It's easy to cool off quickly when taking along break, so try to bring along high-energy foods thatcan be carried in your pockets and consumed whilestanding--chocolate, dried fruit, energy bars, bagels. Ifyou do need to make a longer stop (to prepare a biggermeal or to tend to an injury or an equipment problem), besure to put on more layers as soon as you stop--before youbegin to cool off.Be sure that all of your backcountrygear--but particularly any that will be in direct contactwith your skin--is made of quick-drying synthetics, andalways carry a spare dry layer (e.g., an extra thermal topand bottom, pair of mittens, and set of socks) for emergen-cies and for late-afternoon chills. LOCALIZED COLD INJURIESFrostbite is a related problem often encountered onbackcountry winter trips.Though affecting localizedtissue in exposed body parts, it can be addressed, to somedegree, as a whole-body problem. Prevention of frostbite,like that of hypothermia, necessitates awareness of yourenvironment and your comfort level and attention to suchfactors as being rested, well-hydrated, and well-nourished.Since peripheral vasoconstriction caused by hypothermiacan precipitate frostbite, minor problems can usually beprevented by taking care of these needs and by beingcareful to keep extremities protected from the cold. Keep-ing the head warm with a good hat goes a long way towardkeeping the whole body warm.Fingers and toes are among the body parts mostcommonly threatened by frostbite. Mittens and gloves areessential to keep hands warm, as are waterproof overmittsif you expect to be handling snow (to build night-timeshelter, for example).Mittens keep hands warmer thangloves, since the fingers can pass warmth to each other.Gloves, however, allow much more dexterity. The sacri- 5fice in warmth is often worth the usefulness gained by thewearer in the ability to pitch a tent, to rig a binding, tounzip a backpack. In sum, mittens are generally warmer,but it's better to wear gloves if choosing mittens meansthat you'll be removing them frequently to tend to sometask.Areas of the head and face are also at high risk.Particularly common sites for frostbite injury include thenose, cheeks, chin, and ears. Protection with scarves, hats,neck gaiters, and face masks can help to spare them. Atextremely low temperatures, flesh can freeze almost in-stantly upon exposure to air and wind. At less severetemperatures, however, frostbite's onset. may be moregradual and less obvious.Minor frostbite can be treated in the field. If theinjury is still soft--and is numb, cold, and pale but notwhite--it is safe to field-rewarm using skin-to-skin contact.Never massage the area, rub with snow, or use an externalsource of heat.If a blister or bleb forms, protect it andevacuate the patient. This signals a more serious conditionand an injury that may be painful when thawed. Neverattempt to field-warm a body part that is white andhardened. Once thawed, this area will be excruciatinglypainful and utterly useless. Evacuate this patient immedi-ately.Do not thaw any frozen part, no matter how minorthe injury, that you cannot keep thawed, as each refreezingmagnifies tissue damage and the threat of possible ampu-tation.To help prevent frostbite, be sure that boots,clothing, and crampons fit well without being too tight,and avoid alcohol and tobacco, which cause vasoconstric-tion.Keeping feet dry and comfortable with well-fittingboots and wicking socks will also help to prevent blisters,that most insidious of common saboteurs, and trenchfoot,a more serious ailment. (For detailed discussion of blisterprevention and treatment, see the upcoming trail runningarticle in this column in our January/February 1999 issue.)Trenchfoot, a nonfreezing cold injury, is caused by acontinual dampness that leads to vasoconstriction and aninadequate blood supply.Untreated, it can lead to gan-grene or nerve damage. Trenchfoot can be prevented bykeeping feet dry, by changing socks regularly, and bynever sleeping in wet socks at night.AVALANCHE & FALLING SNOWAvalanche safety, though beyond the scope of thisarticle, is an important consideration to be factored into NOVEMBER/DECEMBER199850WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER backcountry plans.(For more information aboutavalanche safety, read \"Avalanche Awareness\" by ChrisJoosen in the Wilderness Medicine Newsletter January/February 1998 issue.) If you're in avalanche country, it's agood idea to carry a beacon and to know how to use it.Still, remember that a beacon can't dig you out. Asalways, your best defense is good decision-making. It'ssafer to ski with others, but companionship may provide afalse sense of security in the backcountry. Never ski a trailthat you wouldn't ski alone. Also, remember to chooseyour campsite carefully, considering potential avalanchepaths and searching overhead for dead or snow-loadedbranches in trees that could collapse and cause injury inthe night.Consult your local ski patrol, sporting-goodsstores, parks service, or wilderness medicine institution formore information on avalanche safety training and alwayscheck the conditions with local backcountry personnelbefore heading out.ACUTE TRAUMAINJURIES OF THE JOINTS & BONES It's easy to fall while skiing and to tweak an ankle ora wrist. Ankle injury is of particular concern for thosewearing flexible boots and skis that don't detach from theboot during a fall (as is true of many cross-country andtelemark models, particularly older-style ones). Forequipment that does employ a quick-detach mechanism, itis important to have the apparatus set at the appropriatelevel for one's weight and skill level. Wrists, similarly,can get tangled up in pole grips and can be twisteduncomfortably.Learning how to fall comfortably andpracticing safe falls can help prevent such injuries.For minor sprains, use your judgement as you wouldin any backcountry injury situation. Rest, ice, compres-sion, and elevation (RICE) is still the treatment sequenceof choice. The snow itself provides an excellent coolingsource. Fill a plastic bag with snow and wrap it in cloth.Never apply ice directly to exposed skin, for fear ofcausing frostbite, and take care to avoid getting the pa-tient's clothes wet with melting snow. Compression can beachieved with an Ace bandage, first-aid gauze and tape, orother fabric wrap. A well-fitting ski boot in itself servesas a good compression device, as long as it does notsacrifice circulation. Keep in mind that if your patient isgoing to be involved in self-rescue (that is, if she's going toski out on her own) she's got to have that boot on her foot.It may be best to replace the boot quickly after yourevaluation, before swelling makes slipping it back on toopainful.Elevation and rest are more subject to judgement inthe winter backcountry.If you have the supplies, thefortunate weather, and the inclination to stop for a fewdays to allow some healing before continuing out of thewoods, you can consider that option. Most of the time,you will not be so lucky as to have enough food and othersupplies to do this--particularly if your outing was in-tended as a day-trip--and, furthermore, you may want toleave before swelling incapacitates your patient. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs such asAdvil, Alleve) will decrease swelling and pain, but alwaysbe sure to check whether the patient has allergies beforeoffering medications, and do not take the risk if his pastmedical history even hints at a possible adverse reaction tothe pain killer that you have available.More severe injuries that can occur in the backcoun-try include debilitating knee sprains, long bone fractures,and dislocations at various joints. Any injury this drastic,obviously, will necessitate a rescue, and it is unlikely thatthe patient will be able to help you. Stabilize the injury tothe best of your ability and get the patient to defmitivecare.EVALUATION, RESCUE, AND REST If someone is injured on your backcountry skiing trip,the most importantevaluationthat you need toundertake--once you've made your patient as safe andcomfortable as possible--is whether the injured person willbe able to travel out of the backcountry under his ownpower.Your usual options of self-rescue and outside assis-tance apply. Keep in mind, though, in winter conditions,that the snow may be used to your advantage to sled apatient out if you have the tools to rig such a device andthe skill to control it on the trip out of the woods. On theother hand, if you decide that you can't succeed at rescueon your own, the unpredictability of winter weather mayhinder your efforts, delaying rescue for several days ifyou're deep into the backcountry. Be sure that you areprepared to keep your patient safe and warm for as long asit may take the rescue group to find you, and use thisjudgement in evaluating your best course of action. As thetrip leader, you must balance the well-being of the injuredperson with that of the rest of your party in making adecision about how and when to head out of the woods.In the winter backcountry, the tools that you have atyour disposal and the restrictions imposed on you by theweather may differ from those of more temperate times ofyear.But the underlying strategy for having a safe and 6 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER199851.WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER -enjoyable trip is the same: keep both your judgement andyour awareness of yourself and your surroundings sharp andfocused. The best way to succeed in doing this is to avoidgetting too run-down. Eat well, drink more water than youthink you need, and respect your limits. The temptation of agreat day in the backcountry is to linger in the woods for aslong as possible, even as the sky darkens and the musclestire--and every skier has felt that urge.Resist it. Think of how good the contented soreness ofa hard day's exertion feels when you stop for the night.Come in from the cold before you get hurt. Whether thatmeans escaping to a luxurious lodge with down comfortersand a cappuccino bar or snuggling into a cramped tent witha cozy sleeping bag and hot chocolate from a camp stove,you can relive the highlights of the day while you warm yourfeet and plan your next adventure.New Dosage for Potable AquaWater Purification TabsAn Update from Wisconsin PharmacalJackson, WI -Potable Aqua emergency drinking watergermicidal tablets have been the easiest and most inex-pensive means to treating questionable drinking water.With the introduction of new instructions, Potable Aquahas become even easier and more convenient to its users.Wisconsin Pharmacal, the makers of the mosttrusted brand of water purification tablets, has changedthe dosage for their water purification products from 1tablet to 2 tablets, thus making the product usage moreconsumer friendly.No longer will consumers have to question the watertemperature or make dosage adjustments on their own,because Pharmacal has already done it.This new label, which was accepted by the EPA,gives consumers straight forward and easy-to-follow di-rections that maintains unifonnity and is consistent withU.S. Military labeling.By making all dosages the same, WPC has made thewater purification process effortless, while still bringingyou the quality that you've come to expect.
