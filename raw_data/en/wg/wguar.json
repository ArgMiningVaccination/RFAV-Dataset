After a fewdays I was still not gettingbetter and was brought to thehospital. I was given fluidsthrough an I-V because I wasdehydrated. The nursing staffdid not do an adequate job ofmonitoring the fluid, whichlead my kidneys to shut down.My kidney function did notreturn and therefore, I had tobe put on dialysis. Luck wasagain not with me; part of theequipment needed for mydialysis treatment had to beflown in from California, and itended up in Washington. Withsurgery already scheduled, thedoctors had to use an adultpiece to get the dialysis started,as my body was beginning toshut down. Several weeksafter the surgery, I was takenoff dialysis and my kidneyfunction slowly returned. Sixweeks after I had entered thehospital, I was able to returnhome. The doctors told my parents that I would be fine, butin actuality my future had beenaltered. During the seventh grade, I was ready to begin an activelife in the world of sports, butthat was not to be. The doctorwho did my sports physicalinformed me that I did not passthe physical due to a highprotein level in my urine. Iheaded back to the Mayo Clinicand found that I would need atransplant unless my kidneyfunction stopped declining.But the next few years showedcontinued deterioration. Ibegan a trial with prednisone,which did not help. Sothroughout the next few years,I was on a restricted diet, andadded routine blood pressurechecks and medicine to mydaily routine. My senior year was the most difficult, as my kidney functionwent down to about 15 percent.My energy level was also getting lower, and even simple thingslike getting to class became astruggle.

Over theyears, many patients havesuccumbed to the loss of control, feeling that it was all a part of thetransplant process. This issue of Chronicles is here to tell you that this is not so, and you need to get back in the driver 's seat. It takes time, persistence and determination, but thesearticles will be helpful in your attempt to gain backthe control and independence you had prior to yourEnd Stage Disease.

We felt very lucky, as it isdifficult to find a matching donor. June brought finals week, a graduation party, my uncle 's wedding and the transplant. Monday and Tuesday were days of testing to be sure thateverything was ready to go. Lots of blood testswere used for matching; I was surprised I had anyleft. Wednesday I checked into the hospital, andthat evening all of my friends and family came tokeep me company. Later that night I was takendown to get a pic line into my artery so that bloodcould easily be drawn. The surgery wasscheduled for the next morning. I was takendown to surgery at 7 a.m. and it began at 8:30.By 11:30, I was the lucky recipient of a new fullyfunctioning kidney. I am currently taking anti-rejection medications, including azathioprine,cyclosporine, prednisone and diltiazem. I willcontinue taking these for the rest of my life. My first year at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire was a time for adjusting to being away frommy family, studying, working and making newfriends. At this point, I thought I was donerunning competitively, until I met some girls whowere on the cross country and track team anddecided that next year I was definitely going to trycompeting again. My first year back, I was closeto the end of the pack, but still enjoyed being partof a team again. When the '96 season came along, I just wanted to improve my times from theyear before. With the help of our new coach, Imoved from the bottom third of the team to beingone of the top seven runners. Our team ended upplacing second at Regionals, which brought us toNationals, where we ended up 12th in the nation. Personally, I also had a great track season. I was one second away from qualifying forNationals in the 800 and five seconds in the 1500.I was so happy and couldn 't wait for our outdoor season. But then I ended up catching a cold andwas given medication that reacted with my anti-rejection medication. The reaction caused anintestinal infection, and I spent four weeks out oftrack. I was lucky that I could run in theconference meet. I came back as strong as Icould, but I had no chance of qualifying. I then began my summer by training, knowing Nationals would be in sight again. I wanted to bein great shape when the season began. I wasamong our top five runners. As our meets wenton everyone kept dropping their times and wekept looking ahead at the conference teams tobeat. Our coach received conference coach of theyear. This gave us the confidence we needed forRegionals. With 28 teams on the line, knowingthat we would have to place in the top threeteams to go to Nationals, we ran extremely well. At the Nationals in Boston, we strided out onto the starting line as a team and did our teamcheers. It was the greatest feeling. As we toed theline, we could feel we were going to do great! Therace started out fast and I made sure that I gotout quick. Mud was flying everywhere andeveryone was trying not to fall. During the racethere was rain, snow, sleet and hail! But beforewe knew it the race was over! A teammate and Ihad claimed All-American! She had taken 33rdand I was 35th. I couldn 't believe it. On our way out of the park, we noticed the results were posted. We took second! I think myheart stopped; we were screaming, crying andhugging each other. Our fans who came to cheerus on from Eau Claire were there to congratulateus. We then headed to the university to dress forthe awards ceremony. While we were getting ourawards, I remembered the year before when theother teams were getting their awards, and I hadthought to myself, I will be up there next year . And there I was. It was one of the greatest moments ofmy life. This dream would never have come true if I had not had the transplant. I am so thankful to mydad for giving me another chance at life andstanding by to watch me accomplish my goals.My dad tries to make all of my races, but even ifhe is not there, I know that he is thinking of meand wishing me luck! I am doing great andcontinue taking my anti-rejection medication. Iam still running and have just finished indoortrack. I had started the season running the 5K,3K, 1500 and 4x400. My events changed at theconference meet. I ran the open 600 and tookfourth, having never run the event! I also placedfourth in the 1000 and 4x400. I also ran in thedistance medley relay in which we placed second.I am now training for the outdoor season andcan't wait for the meets to begin. TCCrossing the Finish Line Continued from page 14Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2 Letter to the Editor excerpted from a letter by Joseph A. Caruso My name is Joseph A. Caruso and I 'm writing to express my feelings on the commentary\"Financial Incentives as a Means to Increase Organ Donation \" that appeared in Vol. 5, No. 3 of Transplant Chronicles . I am a heart transplant recipient. Four years ago, I received this most precious gift by the graceof God, the skilled hands of dedicated, ethical,professional doctors, and the caring of a fellowhuman being. For the family of the donor, thedecision to give must have been painful anddifficult since it had to be made during trying andemotional times. Yet, love and care for their fellowman won the day and the decision was made topass the gift of life to others without recompense. I was appalled to read that financial incentives have been and are still widely discussed as a wayto increase organ donations. This is an affront tome and to many thousands of recipients, it insultsthe families of donors and demeans the memoriesof their loved ones. It would also be detrimentalfor the undecided populace when asked to donate. Are we to set aside and re-invent our own values as the need arises on a day-to-day basis sothat we may justify unethical, immoral practiceand behavior? Are we to become a value free, morally neutral society, instilling in our children alack of standards and guidelines and teachingthem that everything in life is negotiable? No one disputes that organ transplants save lives. However, lives are not lost, as thecommentary suggests, because families have adifferent value system than ours and say no todonation. In many cases, potential donor familiesare not asked or say no to donation due to severalfactors, including ignorance about the subject,lack of education regarding donation, and thatthey are asked to decide at a difficult and stressfultime. We must therefore conquer ignorance, dispel myths and hearsay, inform and educate the publicabout organ donation and transplantation. Then,and only then, can the educated individual makea rational choice. Money or any other form of compensation introduced into the organ procurement systemwould only corrupt and devalue the system andlife itself. Anyone with some knowledge aboutorgan procurement, organ donation and organtransplantation knows that too many people dieevery day waiting for an organ to becomeavailable. But this problem may be drasticallyreduced, if not eliminated, through publicinformation and education at all levels of society. Response from the Author by Teresa Shafer Mr. Caruso has provided compelling commentary on the ills of and reasons not to pursue financial incentives for organ donation. Those of us who have attended meetings where this issue has been discussed have heardthese arguments, most of them not as eloquently put as they are by Mr. Caruso. As I stated in the article\"Financial Incentives as a Means to Increase Organ Donation, \" one of the reasons for not exploring the area of financial incentives is that money introduced into a system, especially a system where so much is at stake,corrupts. Having said this, I would like to point out, however, that many believe that helping families pay for the funeral or providing them with a death benefit is not coercive or unethical, nor does it establish organ brokerage. Frommy previous experience as an organ procurement coordinator and from anecdotal evidence of discussing thisissue with others who work in the field, I often came across disadvantaged families who were stressed by havingto pay for a funeral, or families who simply needed a little extra help with costs associated with end-of-life issues. I am not promoting financial incentives, as I have been quick to criticize others who have pursued drastic measures before considering the consequences. I would never want to do harm to our current system, which isthe envy of the world. However, I try to keep an open mind about issues such as these because there are nearly60,000 individuals waiting for an organ transplant, and only approximately one-third will receive one. Dr. TomPeters has suggested that due to the extensive discussion that has already taken place and the results of theNational Kidney Foundation poll on this issue, a pilot study may be warranted. This study would take the form ofa benefit for use in funeral expenses. In the closing sentence of the article I wrote, \"It may be that patients, donor families and members of the public who are not seen as having a conflict of interest on this issue need to partner with those in our industry such asDr. Peters, who are well-versed and passionate about the topic, to get a pilot study implemented or decide that itwill not be done at this time. \" It would appear that the issue has its first volunteer from the patient side, one who is passionate and concerned: Mr. Caruso.keeping fit Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2 5Motivation, Determination, Perspiration by Vanessa Underwood, BS, AFAA, ACE any years ago I had the opportunity to learn that life is short and I must cherish it!Determination, along with desire and acommitment to take control of my life and myfuture, have empowered me to achieve my goal ofbecoming fit in every sense of the word. Exercisehas been the pillar of my strength since the firstfew weeks after my first transplant 18 years ago. Eighteen years ago, transplantation was a bit more difficult and the drugs were certainly not assophisticated as today. Although my kidney wasdoing fine, my body was devastated. Due to thelarge amounts of prednisone I was taking (remem-ber this was 18 years ago), my body had changedso drastically that it scared me. I was aching allover, my face had taken a new look and my bodycomposition was that of a person I did not know. It was at this time that I took control over my life. I needed to focus on my strengths and not myweaknesses. This was also when my commitmentto my health began. What good was my health if Iwas a physical and psychological mess?Appearance is very important to a person 's confidence, self esteem and perspective on life. Notonly did I want to look good and feel good, but Itruly did not want people to think of me as sick.Although I had watched my diet, as I had been instructed to do, I was not losing any weight. Itwas not until I incorporated exercise into my dailyroutine that I began to see a reduction in myweight, as well as a change in my bodycomposition, increased energy, self esteem andCONTROL. Each time I would go to the clinic, thedoctors and nurses would say, \"You look great, what are you doing? \" Proudly, I would tell them of my exercise regimen. Their appreciation for thispanacea was limited. It was up to me to takecontrol and do it on my own. As the years passed, I continued my quest for total health. Exercise had become vital to myquality of life. While I was attempting to find theperson I once knew, my body was becoming strongand fit from the inside out. I was aggressivelycombating deterioration and muscle weaknesscaused from medication and disease. I waslessening, and today I believe counteracting, manyside effects of the medication. My blood pressurehad decreased, my good HDL increased, myimmune system was stronger and my bone densitywas increasing. I was decreasing joint pain, andincreasing flexibility and muscle tone. I was feelingwonderful! And, of equal importance, I improvedmy self esteem, confidence and feelings of selfworth. Little did I know that this desire to control my life would result in these magnificent benefits. Ineeded to do something and it seemed thatexercise was a means of controlling my life. No oneelse could do it for me, no one could tell me how,what, when or why. Having that little bit of controlempowered me to believe in my strength andability to overcome all the challenges that I wouldface. It gave me that extra inner strength to knowthat at the time when I was at my worst, I couldstill partake in my own care and maintain somedegree of control over the direction of my life and my health care plan. Exercise, proper nutrition and a positive attitude have proven vital to my total well-being,and it may help you, too. Sounds too simple, M Transplant recipient Vanessa Underwood (left) motivates her peers to take control of their lives through exercise. Continued on page 66Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2Keeping Fit Continued from page 5 doesn 't it? Well, in one sense it is a simple prescription, yet it takes fortitude, discipline andhard work. Begin by making a contract withyourself. \" I want to begin an exercise and fitness program. This will make me feel much betterphysically as well as emotionally. In order to dothis I must begin today. I am not sure what I amable to do today, but I will begin and then I will dothe very best I can. I will take small steps andprogress slowly. I will try to accomplish myworkout one step at a time. Although I must do thisone moment at a time, one day at a time, I mustrealize that this workout is the beginning of aprocess that will last a lifetime .\" People always ask me about motivation, which is just a nicer work for discipline. Each time youwork out, it should not be a new commitment.This is why so many people just THINK aboutexercise. They just can 't seem to find the motivation to make an ongoing commitment.Exercising regularly is a discipline. Have youdisciplined yourself to make changes because it isvital to your health? We have all had to makecritical changes in our lives. It is time to add aregularly scheduled exercise program!If you are finding it difficult to discipline yourself, you should identify what is holding youback. Is it lack of time, fear of the unknown,uncertainty about what to do? Don 't give up hope. There are ways in which you can overcomethese hurdles and make fitness a part of your life.Try the following: Stick with it . Many people start exercising, and then stop and start, always having to beginagain. How do you stay with it? Attitude shift \u2014 you need to take a strong stance and then move forward. A gift to yourself \u2014 think of exercise as a gift and not a burden. Ease into your program gradually. Modify your goals . Ask yourself if you are pretty sure you can reach your goal. Schedule exercise time , just as you would any other appointment. Think ahead . Sometimes exercising first thing in the morning prevents the day from getting inthe way. Make it a priority in your day, not an afterthought. Aim for participation, not perfection! Understanding the value of exercise is much more acceptable today than it was many yearsago. So now that you can all understand thevalue and have the motivation, you 're ready to begin. Good luck!

MARK YOUR CALENDARS AND JOIN THETransplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2 7In addition to fats and sugars, it 's also important to monitor your carbohydrate intake.Hyperinsulinemia, increased amounts of insulinin the blood, is another condition currentlybeing studied. If you eat a large amount ofstarches and carbohydrates, your pancreas hasto send out more insulin in the blood to handlethese carbohydrates. This may also increase therisk of cardiovascular disease. These facts emphasize the need to make wise food choices. We are fortunate to have a varietyof foods available to us, so why not takeadvantage of it? If you follow special diet restrictions, it may be necessary to ask a doctor or dietitian when considering new food choices in your diet. These are some key points to remember when taking control of your diet and planning good nutrition: Stay informed about sound nutrition and don't quickly jump to fad diets; consider the potential positive and negative side effects of major dietarychanges Select a variety of foods when preparing meals Get professional advice from your doctor or dietitian on nutritional supplements Make eating enjoyable! eating right Sensible Eating: Controlling Your Diet by Becky Weseman, RD, CNSW, LMNT n today 's world there is more variety and a greater number of foods to choose from than everbefore, whether you eat out or prepare foods athome. The market has also been flooded withnutritional supplements in pill form and ready-to-drink nutritious snacks. All of these food choicescombined with diet restrictions or recommen-dations can lead to a great deal of confusion. Thebottom line is that we must all be responsible forwhat we eat and drink! The age-old saying \"all food in moderation \" still applies today. Eliminat- ing any specific category of foods from our dietsor consuming excessive amounts of food fromother food groups can lead to possible negativeside effects. In the past few years, there has been a push toward very low fat diets. In anattempt to accomplish this, many peoplehave replaced higher fat foods, such aspastries, cookies, snack crackers orcandy with lower fat versions. But forprocessed foods like these, low in fatdoes not necessarily mean low in calories,because extra sugar is often added tocompensate for the loss in flavor when fat isremoved. It's important to choose foods carefullybecause you can gain weight if you do not payclose attention to the total number of calories youeat. Eating more sugars, called concentratedsweets, can lead to increased levels oftriglycerides (another kind of fat found in theblood and a possible risk factor for heart disease).I 16 oz. uncooked plain or flavored pasta (try garlic and cracked pepper) 15 oz. can diced Italian spiced tomatoes1 tablespoon olive oil or canola oil1/2 cup sliced green onions2 teaspoons sugar2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1/2 cup sliced green pepper1/2 cup sliced red pepper 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese Cook pasta as directed on the package.

Thiscan mean paying insurance premiums on time,meeting predetermined payment schedules ornotifying business office personnel if there areany changes in our employment or coveragesituation. These and other responsibilities can be looked at as a way to \"pay back \" all those who have assisted us in regaining some degree of normalcyin our lives. Many people look negatively at thesethings as duties or requirements that shouldn 't be their concern. They think the system will takecare of them forever, but this is our half of thebargain we made when we decided to have atransplant. Part of that bargain is to make surethe system will be around in the future. There areno guarantees or extended warranty periods fororgan transplants. Some of us may need toaccess the system again. We can also look at these responsibilities as opportunities for us to grow as individuals. Somerecipients accomplish things they never thoughtwere possible. Others set new goals forthemselves and are well on the way to attainingthem. Returning to work, going back to school orvolunteering are all ways of being productiveagain. This addresses the biggest responsibility ofall \u2014 the one we have to ourselves. We owe it to ourselves to make the most of our lives, becausewe were given a second chance many others willnever get. TCTaking Responsibility for Ourselves, Our Lives by Maurie Ferriter aving a chronic illness that requires an organ transplant is not something most people want toencounter on the road of life, but for many of us itis a reality. Not long into the journey, we come to apretty clear conclusion about our ability to surviveon our own and realize we need a lot of help frommany sources, including family, friends, medicalprofessionals and employers, just to name a few.We use a lot of resources in our efforts to regainsome degree of normalcy in our lives again. Inreturn, there are various levels of accountabilityand responsibility that should go along with usingthose resources. We need to be responsible to those closest to us. Families and friends who have been supportiveneed not only words of thanks and appreciation,but continuous actions to show we really meanwhat we say. Others who may have kept theirdistance or chosen to avoid our situation shouldbe given the chance to come back into our lives.They may have been coping with our situation inthe only way they could. If they choose to still stayat a distance, we should let them go withoutpassing judgment about them. For a long period oftime, we have taken much from the system and weneed to learn to become givers again. We are accountable to the medical system in many ways, including keeping follow-upappointments, openly communicating with healthcare team members about current issues, gettinglabs drawn when scheduled and participating indecisions about future plans. If schedules cannotbe kept for a good reason, timely notificationH This Issue 's Hot Topic Should there be financial incentives for donor families to increase organdonation? If so, should it only be in the form of a benefit to donor families forassistance with funeral expenses?Hot Topic Response (Issue 6:1) Following is an example of a response to the Hot Topic questions from our last issue: As arecipient, do you think age should be a factor? Issomeone too old to receive an organ, or shouldthe older patient be considered lower priority? Age should not be factor in receiving an organ transplant. The recipient should be given theoption of transplantation no matter what his/herage. But I would not accept the transplant if itmeant someone younger would not get it.Transplant News Digest Number of Americans Donating Organs and Eyes Virtually Unchanged in '97 from '96, Continuing Five-Year Trend by Jim Warren, editor and publisherFrom the editors of Transplant News For the fifth year in a row, the number of cadaveric organ donors in the U.S. remainedvirtually unchanged. The preliminary resultsfrom the United Network for Organ Sharing(UNOS) reveal there were 5,447 cadaveric donorsin 1997. There were 5,420 donors in 1996. Thenumber of living donors followed the same trend,with UNOS reporting there were 3,626 in 1997,compared to 3,607 in 1996. Final eye banking statistics for 1997 released by the Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA)mirrored the UNOS solid organ results andshowed an actual decrease in the number ofdonations and corneal transplants performed in1997 compared to 1996. There were a total of 90,465 eye donations from 45,696 donors in 1997, compared to92,162 from 46,045 donors in 1996. Theyresulted in 45,493 cornea transplants in 1997compared to 46,300 in 1996. The number of solid organ transplants resulting from the 5,447 cadaveric donorsincreased approximately 1.1 percent. UNOSreported there were approximately 17,000organs transplanted in 1997 compared to 16,807in 1996. Adding the 3,626 living donors bringsthe total number of organ transplants to 20,626. Overall, intestine transplants (64 in 1997 compared to 43 in 1996), lung transplants (904in 1997 compared to 791 in 1996) and heart-lung transplants (61 in 1997 compared to 39 in1996) experienced the biggest percentageincreases. Kidney, liver and pancreastransplants had minuscule increases. Thenumber of heart transplants actually decreasedslightly. There were 2,278 heart transplants in1997 compared to 2,342 in 1996. The number of persons on waiting lists for corneal tissue in the U.S. as of December 31,1997 was 2,603. The number of personsscheduled for corneal transplant surgery in theU.S. as of December 31, 1997 was 2,964.\"The recent leveling of donation in the U.S. appears to parallel the trend in Canada andwestern European countries performingtransplants,\" UNOS observed in a press releaseannouncing the 1997 preliminary statistics.\"While there may be no single explanation for theU.S. trend, many transplant professionals believethat the number of potential donors (those whoare medically suitable for organ donation upondeath) may be declining. Factors possiblyaffecting the number of potential donors includemore effective traffic safety laws, improvementsin trauma care and treatment of strokes, and theincreased prevalence of infectious diseases, suchas HIV, that would preclude donation.\" For additional information, contact: UNOS News Bureau - (804) 327-1432; EBAA - (202)775-4999. HHS regulation mandates OPTN board develop a liver allocation policy based onequity, not utility After more than a year of telegraphing her intentions, Secretary of Health and HumanServices (HHS) Donna Shalala sent a sharpmessage to the transplant community that organallocation policies in the U.S. in the future will bebased on equity, not utility. The new regulation, published April 2 in the Federal Register, broadly establishes that thesickest patients should have the most immediateaccess to organs and mandates uniform nationalcriteria for transplant status, rather thanevaluation by each individual transplant center,as is the case today. The country's liver allocation program is the most immediate target of the HHS regulations.They required the board of directors of the OrganProcurement and Transplantation Network(OPTN) to revise its current liver allocation policyand propose a new policy within 60 days of theApril 2 effective date. Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2 910Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2The final rule includes a new 60-day comment period, and becomes effective 90 days after April 2.The OPTN would then have another 60 days topropose new criteria for livers. That gives the OPTNboard a total 150 days to present new liverallocation criteria based on allocating the livers tothose with the highest medical urgency status,with reduced reliance on geographical differences. The board will have a year to devise similar allocation criteria for all other solid organtransplants. (On April 30, Rep. Bob Livingston (R-LA), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee,slipped an amendment into a spending bill duringa House-Senate conference. Livingston'samendment extended the public comment periodto Aug. 31 and delayed implementation of the ruleto Oct. 1. The public comment period had beenscheduled to end on June 30. The amendmentmerely delayed, not eliminated, the implementationdate.) \"Patients who need an organ transplant should not have to gamble that an organ will becomeavailable in their local area, nor should they haveto travel to transplant centers far from homesimply to improve their chances of getting anorgan,\" Secretary Shalala said, in announcing theissuance of the much-anticipated organ allocationregulations. \"Instead, patients everywhere in thecountry should have an equal chance to receive anorgan, based on their medical condition and thejudgment of their physicians.\" The issuance of the much-anticipated regulation touched off a firestorm of reaction from thetransplant community \u2014both pro and con. \"Patients have voiced their concern that the system is not fair,\" said John Fung, MD, chief oftransplantation at the University of PittsburghMedical Center, which many feel spearheaded thelobbying effort that led to the policy changemandate. \"The government has finally realized thatsomething must be done. By standing up for thepatient's interest, the Secretary has done the rightthing.\" However, Larry Hunsicker, MD, president of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), theadministrator of the Organ Procurement andTransplantation Network (OPTN), disagreed andsuggested the new regulations could backfire. \"Theregulations mean that in the long run fewer peoplewill get liver transplants and fewer lives will besaved,\" he said.\"The regulations (also) mean that many liver transplant programs would have to shut down,(and) would divert livers from many smallerprograms to a few large centers. This wouldsignificantly harm patient care by forcing sickpeople to travel far from home at the worstpossible time. Poor people who cannot afford totravel could be deprived of transplants entirely.\"Hunsicker also expressed concern that thegovernment is imposing the new regulation\"unilaterally\" without sufficient input from thetransplant community. The regulation also calls on the OPTN to develop uniform criteria for determining apatient's medical status and eligibility forplacement on a waiting list. The criteria are to bebased on medical judgment and common medicalcriteria, no matter where the patient lives or inwhich transplant center he or she is awaitingtreatment. But Hunsicker suggested that the policy was formulated too haphazardly and needed moreinput from all sides. \"I don't want to see a quickfix that doesn't fix the underlying issue,\" he said.\"It's just going to go on and on until we have a better understanding of how these policies aremade.\" Ron Ferguson, MD, president of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons (ASTS), agreed.\"Our constituency in general thinks the principlefoundation for establishing broad public policy inthis should be one that maximizes benefits for allAmericans,\" he told Transplant News . \"We have a question whether equity in waiting times andbroadening the definition of status one liverpatients accomplished that.\" \"We already have very close waiting times across the country. I don't know what the upsideof this rule is but I do know patient access is aproblem by shutting down programs and it willhave an impact on local procurement. There mustbe a dramatic upside to the rule and we haven'tseen it yet.\" Ferguson believes it is time for Congress to hold hearings on reauthorizing the National OrganTransplant Act (NOTA) and clarifying, amongother things, who has the authority to set whatpolicy. NOTA, first passed in 1984, set up the national solid organ procurement and transplant programin the U.S. Although it is supposed to bereauthorized by Congress every three years, it has not been since 1990. \"It has been eight years since NOTA expired and I think it 's time Congress expressed their intent,\" he said. \"Once more we need to clarifywhat Congress meant by passing NOTA. We allneed to take a deep breath and clarify who shoulddo what.\" Earl Fox, MD, administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA),urged people to read the entire HHS regulationbefore forming an opinion one way or the other. \"There are a lot of misperceptions about what the regulations contain,\" Fox told Transplant News . \"They do a good job of laying out and clarifying the department's overall goal. Congresscharged HHS with oversight of the oversight of theOPTN. We are not doing it in heavy-handedfashion. We look to the medical community fortheir expertise in developing the final allocationpolicies.\" The new HHS regulation calls for the OPTN board to develop three new sets of criteria fororgan allocation which will be open to a publiccomment period. The criteria, according to HHS,are: aimed at allocating organs first to those with the highest medical urgency status, withreduced reliance on geographical factors. HHSbelieves this will reduce disparities in waitingtimes for patients at different transplantcenters in different areas of the country.Today, there is a wide variation in waitingtimes, with patients in some areas waiting fivetimes longer or more for an organ thanpatients in other areas. The new criteria wouldprovide for wider sharing to assure organswere made available to patients with greatestmedical need. to be followed in deciding when to place patients on the waiting list for an organ.Today, each transplant center establishes itsown criteria, with the result that patientslisted at one center may not be as ill aspatients not yet listed at another center withmore stringent medical listing criteria. Underthe regulation, the OPTN would developmedically objective criteria to be used by alltransplant centers.for determining the status of patients who are listed. Medically objective, uniform criteriawould help ensure a 'level playing field ' in selecting among patients and determiningwhich have the greatest medical need. TheOPTN is already developing uniform criteria ofthis kind. \"We are not substituting our judgment for the judgment of medical professionals,\" Shalalaemphasized. \"We are asking them to make thesystem fairer, and we are setting clearperformance goals to guide their work.\" Other provisions in the regulation include enhanced access to center-specific data abouttransplant centers, measuring outcomes andhelping patients and physicians to choose amongtransplant centers; a broad definition of thecomposition of the OPTN membership and boardof directors; the process for HHS review of OPTNpolicies before they become mandatory for OPTNmembers; and approval over fees charged forregistration on the OPTN waiting list. Congress approves $500,000 increase in DOT budget for FY '98; President seeks $2 millionincrease for FY '99 Congress has approved a total of $2.8 million for fiscal year (FY) 1998 for organ transplant-related programs administered by the Division ofTransplantation (DOT) \u2014 an increase of $500,000 over FY 1997. The total fell far short of theClinton administration's request for $1.67 millionbut still represented a 250 percent increase overlast year. The administration has not backed off its support of organ donation, however, and isrequesting $2 million for FY 1999 to support theDepartment of Health and Human Services/VicePresident Gore organ donation initiativeannounced in December 1997. \"We are very pleased the administration has budgeted such a large figure to prime-the-pumpfor us to meet the goals of the initiative,\" JonNelson, acting director of DOT, told Transplant News . \"We plan to use the FY 1998 funds to take a good look at what works in the consent process,better assess what works and what doesn't, andensure hospitals refer donors.\" Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2 1112Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2In approving the compromised FY 1998 total of $2.8 million, two related Senate amendmentswere dropped. One would have required a studyconcerning efforts to improve organ and tissueprocurement at hospitals and a survey of at least5 percent of hospitals having an agreement withan organ procurement organization. The second was a non-binding sense of the Senate resolution urging hospitals to \"takeprompt steps to ensure that a skilled andsensitive request for organ or tissue donation isprovided to eligible families...\" In dropping both amendments from the final appropriations bill, the House-Senate confereesnevertheless encouraged the HHS Secretary toconduct the study required by the firstamendment and report to the House and SenateAppropriations Committees \"on best practices foridentifying donors and communicating withrelatives of potential donors.\" They also madeclear they concurred in the sentiment expressedby the sense of the Senate resolution. Group advocating transplanting two \"marginal\" kidneys in a patient conducting athree-year study Transplant surgeons typically reject histologically \"marginal\" organs because ofconcerns that they will fail to function adequatelyin the long term. But a team of internationalresearchers believes that transplanting twomarginal kidneys into a patient may be aseffective as a single \"optimal\" allograft and wouldbe one way around the current donor shortage.The Double Kidney Transplant Group theorizesthat transplantation of two marginal kidneysshould increase the number of functioningnephron units to an acceptable level. To test thishypothesis, the group is following 50 double-kidney recipients for up to three years andcomparing renal survival with those of controlsgiven a single transplant. Lecturing at the ItalianScience Seminar in London, Dr. GiuseppeRemuzzi of the Mario Negri Institute forPharmacological Research in Bergamo, Italy, saidthat 30 double transplants have been done so far,with no more surgical complications or acutetubular necrosis than in the control group. And hesaid the incidence of acute rejection has been verylow. Virginia first state to issue donor awareness license plate Virginia has become the first state in the U.S. to develop an organ and tissue donor awarenesslicense plate, which its citizens can purchase for$25 in addition to the regular license plate fee.The Virginia Transplant Council (VTC) developedthe idea, which was approved by the VirginiaGeneral Assembly in July 1996. The VTC says the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will produce the plate when 350 prepaidapplications are received. The DMV is alsoallowing up to six characters for personalizedplates for an additional $10 charge. Some of theearly purchases include: \"IMALIVE,\" \"NULIFE,\"\"DON-8,\" and \"NUKDNY.\" Once 1,000 plates have been sold, $15 of the annual fee will be used for donation educationprojects statewide. Australia reports 63 percent increase in organ donation following World Transplant Gameslast fall Australia experienced a 63 percent increase in organ donations last October, November andDecember just following the September WorldTransplant Games in Sidney, according to a studyby the World Transplant Games Federation. The study showed that at least 48 more people in New South Wales and Victoria had kidney,heart or liver transplants in October-December in1997 compared to the previous year. More than 1,600 telephone interviews conducted before and after the games revealedthat, out of the population of 4 million aged 16-60,nearly a quarter of a million people had theirviews positively changed or their beliefs reinforcedby the success stories that emerged from thegames, the Federation said. TCmedical beat Post-Transplant \u2014Taking Control of Your Life by R. Patrick Wood, MD hen I began performing liver transplants over 12 years ago, I had the grandiose idea thatI could turn individuals into successfultransplant recipients. Not only was this attitudeunrealistic, but it also led to incrediblefrustration and the tearing out of what little hairI had left. What I have come to realize, over time,is that the success of transplant recipients islargely dependent on their own desire to make itwork and to take control of their transplants. The transplant program 's responsibility is to provide a team that will support patients withthe necessary components for them to besuccessfully transplanted. The goal of alltransplant programs is to restore recipients to agood-to-excellent quality of life and to movethem back into the mainstream. As this occurs,patients will be seen and monitored lessfrequently by the transplant program, givingthem more opportunities to neglect their health.The unfortunate reality is that if a patientchooses to be resistant to medical follow-up aftertransplant, there is little or nothing that thetransplant center can do to prevent it. Mostcenters will attempt to counsel the patient andwill certainly be reluctant to re-transplant anegligent patient, but the reality is that there isno way to force an adult patient to cooperatewith post-transplant treatment. In many cases, those patients facing life- saving transplants often suffer a loss of controlas their disease progresses. While they awaittransplantation, they may require anincreasingly strong support system to simplymaintain an acceptable level of health to remaina potential transplant recipient. Many potentialtransplant recipients have an extremely difficulttime with the concept of giving up control totheir support system, and this can become quitea difficult issue between patients and theirfamilies. As their disease progresses, patientsmay lose their abilities to drive to work and, attimes, to even carry out their daily livingactivities. However, following a successfultransplant, patients are given an increasing rolein their own care and offered the opportunity totake control of their transplants. Focusing on the post-transplant period, one of the first aspects of taking control should be inthree areas: medications, lab tests and clinicfollow-ups. Patients in control not only carry awritten list of their medications and dosageswith them at all times, but have a workingknowledge of what these medications are, whatthey are for, and what the potential side effectsmay be. It is inappropriate, and indeed unwise,for patients to come to clinic claiming they take\"two blue pills twice a day and three red pills three times a day \" without any knowledge of what these medications are for and why they aretaking them. Physicians are entirely dependentupon feedback from the patient in determiningwhether medication doses are inadequate orexcessive based on the patient 's report of side effects or monitoring such things as bloodpressures while at home. Knowledge of the howand why of medications will lead to improvedcompliance among all patients and this is clearlyshown in those patients who take an active rolein understanding their medications. The next aspect of taking control is lab tests. It is inappropriate for patients to rely solely onthe transplant center to obtain their laboratorytests and review them. A patient in control willwork through the lab to obtain his or her owntest results and will ensure that they arereported to the appropriate transplant program.This is not to say patients can independentlymake decisions based on their own review oftheir lab tests, but certainly a patient shouldknow the rationale for the various lab tests andbe aware of the consequences of abnormalities inthese labs. By teaching patients how to obtaintheir lab results and to have at least a \"ballpark \" idea of what each lab test should reflect, thetransplant team can provide patients with a levelof control and understanding that allows them toreliably obtain their own blood tests and forwardthem to the transplant program. The next aspect of control in a patient 's life is to understand the how and why of follow-upvisits in the clinic. Patients should ensure that W Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2 13Continued on page 1414Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2their clinic visits are necessary and begin to strive to return to their own primary carephysician, internist or specialist. It is especiallyimportant that patients communicate with thetransplant center about who their referringphysicians are. It is extremely frustrating forreferring doctors not to receive information abouttheir patients from the transplant center.Oftentimes, poor communication between thepatient and the transplant center may lead torecords being sent to the wrong physician. It isimperative that patients ensure that thetransplant program is communicating with theappropriate physicians. It is also important thatpatients be comfortable with a local physicianand ensure that this physician will workcooperatively with the transplant program.Patients must have physicians who manage theirday to day medical care, as well as specialproblems such as OB/GYN or minor surgicalprocedures. In the case of pediatric patients, areliable local pediatrician is of paramountimportance if the patient is to be adequatelymonitored. All patients, with the help of thetransplant program, should locate thesephysicians prior to transplantation and establisha good rapport so that they can maintain thisrelationship following their transplants. It isfrustrating for the transplant program to havepatients return for a yearly follow-up visit, onlyto find out that they have seen no otherphysician during the year and have had all oftheir health care managed on an outpatient basisthrough the transplant program. Patients who take control of these areas of their lives following transplantation have taken ahuge step in ensuring that their transplants willbe successful. Remember that support systemsand health care providers are essential to thewell-being of transplant recipients, but takingcontrol by learning about their condition is thekey to the highest quality of care and quality oflife. TCMedical Beat ... continued from p. 13 NKF Holds Consensus Conference on Drug Substitution in Transplantation The National Kidney Foundation hosted a two-day Consensus Conference in Washington,D.C., on April 23-24, 1998. Over 40 experts inorgan transplantation, managed care andpharmacology, plus patients andrepresentatives of government agencies,gathered to explore the issues surroundingdrug substitution in medical therapy for organtransplantation. The purpose of the conference was to analyze the current practice of drugsubstitution, predict future trends andexamine the potential effects on patientoutcomes. Drug substitution may involve thesubstitution of one generation of a drug foranother, the use of a different agent within thesame class of drugs or the use of a genericformulation for a brand-name product.Possible advantages include lower cost and better compliance. Possible dangers includeoverdose, underdose and unexpected sideeffects. Conference participants discussed alternative formulations of current brandedimmunosuppressives, substitution of genericsfor branded immunosuppressives anddevelopment of a system for monitoring suchsubstitution. Recommendations from the conference will be published in a future edition of American Journal of Kidney Diseases with a summary in Transplant Chronicles .

The psychosocial, medical and pastoralcare professionals on your team are also resourcesto seek guidance from or to determine if you needmore specialized assistance. Remember, you arenot alone! 5. Speak up and be persistent. While diplomacy is important, if you are not comfortable with yourchild's care, speak up. You may need to be quite persistent, as people don 't always respond as quickly or as openly as we would like. 6. Trust your intuition. Some of the most crucial pieces of information that have saved children 's lives have come from parents who trusted theirintuition. Even if it doesn 't make sense to others, it is important to follow up until you feel comfort-able. Regret is difficult to live with over time. 7. Involve your child. One of the best ways to advocate for children is to listen to them. Theyhave a natural wisdom about their bodies andoften know when something is happening ordoesn 't feel right. Involving your child in his or her treatment and care is essential. A young child willultimately grow to be a teenager with a transplant.Teaching children to speak for themselves, tocommunicate with their medical team and to trusttheir own intuition is vital for them to be able tonegotiate the numerous transplant issues they willface over a lifetime. 8. Be flexible. When advocating for your child 's needs, don 't lose sight of the opportunities for compromise or negotiation with your care team.The families who seem to adjust well to the organtransplant process tend to be both strongadvocates and flexible problem solvers. As aparent, you need to do all that you can to advocatefor your child. But at some point you may need tolet go and trust the process of life. While theanswers may not seem clear and the path hard tofollow at times, this is part of living and part of thejourney of organ transplantation. As Ram Dasssaid, \"At some level we care with all our heart... and then we finally let go. We give it all we have...and trust the rest to God, to Nature, to the Universe.\" Editor's Note : Organizations such as the NKF's transAction Council provide recipients of a life-savingorgan and their families with life-enhancing programs ineducation, fitness and research.

But they forget theother proposition, that it must be lived forwards. \" -Kierkegard Most parents wish they could see into the future to know what lies ahead for their child so they canmake the best choices and decisions when copingwith organ transplantation and life-threateningillness. While no one can \"live life backwards, \" one of the most important things parents can do is tobe assertive and effective advocates for their child 's needs. For those just beginning the journey, it ishelpful to learn from other families ' experiences. 1. Know your child 's underlying illness and the medical features of his or her organ transplant. Knowledge is power, especially when working with your child 's health care team. To be an effective advocate for your child, you need to be aneducated consumer. This may mean asking forinformational material from your medical team,doing your own research about your child 's condition or speaking to other families who havebeen through the process. 2. Build a trusting relationship with your medical care providers .Whether you work with an individual physician or medical team, yourrelationship with them is essential to your abilityto advocate for your child 's medical, emotional and spiritual needs. You need to trust the health careproviders working with your family and need totrust the decisions they are making. It is crucialthat your medical providers see you and your childas vital members of the treatment team. It isimportant to be able to communicate openly andhonestly about your concerns, your doubts andthings that please you. If you don 't feel satisfied with your care providers, you may need to findhealth care professionals you are able to trust andwith whom you feel more comfortable. While itmay feel awkward to switch, you and your childare the ones who have to cope with a transplantover the long haul. 3. Seek support. The ups and downs associated with the adjustment to organ transplantation canfeel overwhelming at times. No one knows thisbetter than another family who has been livingthrough the ordeal. Talking with other familiesfrom your transplant center can enhance yourknowledge, coping skills and ability to advocate foryour child. If you don 't live near your center, use the telephone or the Internet to find families withsimilar circumstances. 4. Seek out resources .Transplant centers have resources for families. Use these to your advan-Advocating For Your Child by Laura Basili, PhD Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2 1516Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2t can be difficult for people with chronic illness to achieve and maintain independence. It is scary to get sick, and it often feels good when someone else is sharing the worry andresponsibility. There are a lot of things to do andto remember when you are sick, and a transplantrecipient may not have much energy, so help isoften needed. But when is it not helpful to be helpful ? When your help prevents someone else from achieving the pride and happiness whichcome with independent functioning. Sure, I 'd like him to be more independent, but he can't manage without my help . Stop and think for a minute, is the patient really unable to do itwithout your help, or is it easier for you to do itand not watch the struggles? Do you ever feelsorry the recipient is sick, or do you ever feelguilty or angry? Maybe it makes youfeel better to help. It is natural to want to help someone who ishaving a hard time, especially if it is someone youlove. When that person first became sick, you andeveryone else in the family rallied to help. Now itis second nature for you to do this. You cananticipate every need, and you take pride in yourcaretaking skills. Everyone says the person is solucky to have you, and even though you are verytired, and sometimes resentful, you feel at easeknowing you have helped keep your loved onesafe. Initially, the recovering recipient didn 't want all of you to do so much, but now the wholefamily has accommodated every need and you allfeel comfortable with your roles andresponsibilities. But what if he no longer needs your help ? Change is difficult, even good change likeimproved health. After transplant, peoplegenerally have more energy, more physicalstrength and renewed optimism, and develop anew lease on life. They are now able to doactivities that they may not have been able to dofor a long time. But what if they have become soused to having others help them that they arefrightened at the thought of going it alone. Maybeall of the helpful family members are equallyscared. It can be hard to believe that someonewho was so sick and needed so much help just ashort time ago is really able to do thingsindependently. So, what is the best way to help a transplant recipient achieve and maintain independence?The first thing is to prevent that person frombecoming too dependent on you in the first place.Since it is hard for people to change patterns ofbehavior, let the recipient do as much as his orher condition will allow from the start. If you havenot become too set in your role as helper it iseasier to give it up. But what if there were reallylots of things you had to do and wanted to do, anddependence on you was justified? Then where doyou start? 1. Get the facts . Ask the doctors and nurses in the transplant program about activity restrictionsand those \"what if \" questions. (Of course, include the recipient.) Learn about your loved one 's new capabilities and get to know others who have gonethrough similar transplants and what they can do. 2. Focus on function . It feels better to talk about what you can do than what you can 't do. Don't dwell on the past and all the old hardships. Participate in making future plans together andtaking pleasure in daily activities. 3. Develop new family routines . Stop and think, why am I still doing this? It was a challengefor you to take on all of that responsibility, and itis now equally challenging to figure out how toshare the responsibility. 4. Take care of yourself and find new interests . You have been so preoccupied with being a helper that you have forgotten how nice itis to just lie in the backyard and read, have lunchwith friends, play cards or work on your craftsprojects. The recipient will be a lot moreindependent if you are busy pursuing your owncareer and personal goals. 5. Help the recipient develop new interests and activities . When he or she is busy golfing, commuting to work or spending time with thekids, there is little time to worry. You don 't always have to be together. Your loved one can go offalone and become known as the golfer with thecheckerboard hat, rather than the golfer with thetransplant. It can be just as much of a challenge to cope with sudden health as sudden illness. But what anice problem to have to face! Evelyn Corsini is a pediatric social worker at the Children 's Hospital Medical Center in Boston. TCThanks For Your Help, But I Can Do It Myself! by Evelyn Corsini, MSW ITransplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2 17The U.S. Donor Pool \u2014Can We Do Better? by Teresa Shafer, RN, MSN, CPTC everal studies have shown there are anywhere from 9,984 to 25,958 potential organ donors inthe U.S. annually.1Additionally, it is estimated that there are 25,000 to 26,000 potential non-heart-beating donors in the U.S. annually.2 Actually, the number of heart-beating organ donors (Table 1) falls far short of the potentialdonor pool for a number of reasons: (1) deniedconsent from families for organ donation whenasked to donate and (2) no referral of thepotential donor by the hospital to the organprocurement organization (OPO). Additionally, tosome extent, trends in motor vehicle accidents,gunshot wounds and other traumatic braininjuries play a role. And finally, many areas ofthe country still needlessly lose significantnumbers of organ donors due to local medicalexaminers refusing to release the organs ofpotential donors, particularly pediatric organdonors who have died due to suspected childabuse or SIDS. This is one of the major reasonsthat the death rate of children on the waiting listfor liver transplants is higher than that of adults. Since 1987, the U.S. has shown a 37.4 percent increase in organ donation (4,000 to 5,495donors) while the recipient waiting list (Table 2)has increased 346 percent for the same timeperiod, from 13,396 to 59,760 patients waiting.What is the donor pool, realistically? Under idealconditions, including optimum hospital and OPOcooperative donation systems in place, a 75percent consent rate (which is being achieved inonly isolated areas of the country) and nomedical examiner denials, we could perhapsrecover 7,200 to 10,300 organ donors. So, whatis keeping us from doing just that? Poor Process A 100 percent referral rate and a 75 percent consent rate, on which the above numbers arebased, are perhaps a fantasy. Despite the manystudies that point to the way the donor processshould and does work, there are still manyhospitals who choose to practice in less thanoptimal ways, showing poor outcomes both interms of referral rates and consent rates. Somepatients are never recognized as potential organdonors and are not referred to the OPO; thereforetheir families are not asked to donate organs. On the other hand, some patients are recognized as potential donors but are notreferred to the OPO early in the process. Somehospitals refer a potential donor to the OPO onlyafter the family has been approached by hospitalstaff and has consented to donation. Whenhospitals handle the consent process withoutinvolving the OPO, consent rates are typically afraction of the rate achieved by OPO staff or theOPO staff in combination with hospital staff.These families have passed up their ability todonate, and therefore many potential recipientshave lost their chance for a life-saving organ. I recently heard an analogy about the manner in which hospitals handle a potential organ donorcompared to how they handle a victim of a sexualassault. This situation, like a potential organdonor situation, is tragic and emotionally laden.It is common practice to have specially trainedand educated people on call to interact with thesevictims. However, when a family loses a lovedone, there are no such protocols regarding whichstaff may approach the family about organdonation. Hospital staff make the approachwithout having the skills and time to treat it likethe time-consuming and emotionally demandingsituation it is. All hospital staff who may interact with these families (pastoral care, social workers, physiciansand nurses) need the knowledge and expertise tohandle this process, as do OPO staff. The consentand donation is a process, not a task! Everyonehas a role in this process; no one group can do italone. In order for the OPO and the hospital staffto work together, the hospital must make thereferral early on. Consent to donate is not simplya box to be checked on a release of body form. Inhospitals where the consent request continues tobe treated like a task, outcomes will not improve. Medical Examiner Denials What else can be done? Laws can be passed similar to those passed in New Jersey and inTexas, which require that medical examinersrelease all organs for transplantation unless themedical examiners are physically in the S Continued on page 1818Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 6, No. 2donation surgery, viewing the organ in question, and find that they cannot release the organ.This law resulted in more life-saving organsbeing given to patients in need in these twostates, while continuing to provide medicalexaminers with all of the forensic informationthey need to do their job: determining cause andmanner of death. Other states are currentlyconsidering such legislation and hopefully willbe successful in this arena. Organ Allocation Tunnel Vision Many leaders and patients within the industry continue to focus on organ allocation instead ofincreasing organ donation. This diverts time,energy and financial resources away from thetask at hand. The Public On average, only 50 percent of those approached say yes to donation. Publiceducation, as well as expert OPO and hospitalpractices, could raise the consent ratesignificantly. OPO Responsibility Finally, should all of the above conditions ever be resolved, then surely we will recover more ofthe donor pool. However, it is not all for thehospitals, the medical examiners, those withallocation tunnel vision or the public to fix. OPOsmust be prepared to provide an expert and user-friendly system, investing the resources neededto respond quickly, expertly, and with theappropriate type and number of staff to handlethe entire donation process. OPOs should be atthe forefront of this campaign, tirelessly workingto recover every possible organ, designing andtrouble-shooting donation systems in hospitals,removing any roadblocks in each and every caseand referral, and promoting donation in publicvenues. Therefore, the OPO and its staff mustexhibit dedication, passion and professionalism.If they exhibit such characters, OPOs shouldexpect all of the parties mentioned above to bellyup to the bar and be held accountable forimproving outcomes. It 's good medicine for our communities. Editor 's Note : The National Kidney Foundation recognizes that before people can deal with thesensitive issue of organ and tissue donation, theymust first understand and be comfortable with theirown feelings and attitudes. \"Making the Critical Difference \" was developed in collaboration with the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN)and is a continuing education program that educatesnurses about their important role in providingfamilies with the option of organ and tissuedonation. A main objective of the program is toposition offering the option of donation as part of thecare nurses offer their patients and families. Theprogram is currently being revised and updated toreflect current practices, policies and attitudestowards donation.References 1.

Dear Recipient, Almost five years ago, our lives collided and we became part of each other forever. This is truly aunique relationship since we cannot know eachother. Nevertheless this is a real relationship. Fatehas made us family. I have as much interest in yourwell-being as your own mother, though I do not evenknow your name. With a little help from our Creator,some of the cells in your body began their life insideof mine. It is so difficult for me to know what to say to you or how to say it, but I have a need to say something. Inthe early days I received a lovely letter from youexpressing your sympathy and thanks. I did notanswer it. It was very early in my grief journey. Icould not yet speak to your wishes. I could barelyspeak at all. Please understand that, though I didnot acknowledge your words, I do still cherish them.I have talked with many other donor families whoshare my quandary and many recipients who say thesame. We need to communicate but we just don 't know what to say. In the years since that day that brought us together I have done much healing. I hope you have done the same. I have built a new life, different...but fulfilling, bittersweet without my beloved child, but notwithout its new joys and rewards. It must be verydifficult for you to know whether to contact me andwhat to say since the day that gave you new lifebrought me the greatest pain. But it is a day that wewill each mark every year, you in joy and I in sorrow.I thought perhaps it is time to share with you what Itruly need from this eternal relationship of ours,especially on that particular day. Every year on our anniversary, I need to know: 1. You are alive and well.2. You do not forget.3. You are taking very good care of this precious piece, as I did of the whole. I do not need flowery words of condolence nor a detailed report of your progress. If you simply takethe time to buy a card that says \"Thinking of You \" and send it, I will know all I need to know. I willknow that I am not alone in remembering...that thisgift was as well received as it was given. Live long and prosper, Your Donor 's Mom I am writing this letter to strongly encourage transplant recipients to write to their donor family. In July 1992, I lost my brother in an automobile accident. My parents, sister, younger brother and I made thedecision to donate his organs. We received a letter that Christmas from Faith, the recipient of my brother 's one kidney and pancreas. There was so much we had in common, I had to write back of course. We had to send letters through thetransplant program who would then forward them. Faith and I communicated back and forth through the transplant program, and then we finally got to write and talk on the phone without going through the program. We finally got to meet on June 15, 1996.My parents, sister and brother were not ready at that time to make this move. Faith is such a unique individual. Eventually my parents and sister met her on January 12, 1997. This has been such an uplifting experience for my dad after Doug 's death. My father could not open up and talk about his feelings to anyone. My father and brother were very close. With Faith he talked aboutthings I never heard him talk about before. I should hope that many more donor families and recipients get to meet as we have. Faith is a part of our family and I now have a younger sister, something I have always wanted even though she is only 12 daysyounger.
