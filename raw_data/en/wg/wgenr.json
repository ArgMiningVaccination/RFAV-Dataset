At bottom, it is about the Firs t Amendment right of all religio us organizations to choose for themselves not only what to say, but \"what not to say.\" Hurley v. Irish -American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Bos- ton, 515 U.S. 557, 573 (1995) . If upheld by this Court, the Ninth Circuit's decision would allow governments of all stripes to tell such organizations \"what they must say,\" Agency for Int ernationa l Development v. Al- liance for Open Society, 570 U.S. 205 , 211 (2013 ) (cita- tion and quotation marks omitted) , on a range of controversial issues. This would be devastating to many religious organ- izations , regardless of their views on abortion or simi- lar issues. For reasons of religious belief, r eligious organizations are often \"countercultural\" vis-\u00e0-vis the various communities in which they operate : Their be- liefs usually lead them to embrace at least some values that clash with the prevailing values of the towns, cit- ies, and states in which the y are located \u2014not to men- tion the values embraced at any given time by the federal agencies with which they interact . Those clashes may turn, not only on disagreements over hu- man sexuality (including abortion), but also on a range of other issues , such as the proper treatment of undoc- umented immigrants . Such clashes in values can often lead to attempts by government s to impose their own values \u2014and desired messages \u2014on religious organiza- tions. 1 No one other than amici and their counsel authored any part of this brief or made a monetary contribution to fund i ts preparation or submission. All parties have consented to its filing in commu- nications on file with the Clerk. 2 Indeed, this Court has observed that \" government suppression of sp eech has so commonly been directed precisely at religious speech that a free -speech clause without religion would be Hamlet without the prince. \" Capitol Square Review & Advisory Bd. v. Pinette , 515 U.S. 753, 760 (1995) (first emphasis added ). That is no less true of government compulsion of speech. The Ninth Circuit's decision would invite and facil- itate such compulsion . Accordingly, as the various ex- amples discussed below show , that decision is a wrecking ball aimed at First Amendment rights en- joyed, not just by religiously -affiliated pregnancy cen- ters, but by all institutions of faith. And tha t is why amici \u2014religion -based organizations described in the Appendix \u2014urge the Court to reverse th at misguided decision. 3 STATEMENT The facts of this case illustrate its implications for all religious institutions . 1. As the Ninth Circuit noted, Petitioners \" are three religiously -affiliated non -profit corporations.\" Pet. 10a. They exist to encourage women not to seek abortion s, by \" offering information about alternatives to abortion a nd help pursuing those options.\" See McCullen v. Coakley S. Ct. 25 2527 (2014) . California's legislature disagrees with Petit ioners' goals. It has concluded that \"[m] illions of California women are in n eed of . . . abortion services[.]\" Pet. 6a. The legislature has therefore passed numerous laws making abortion available to more women.2 Indeed, among the fifty states, California 's laws probably do the most to popularize and facilitate abortion .3 But these laws expanding access to abortion were apparently not enough. In passing the Reproductive FACT Act4 the legislature concluded that Petitioners were impermissibly convincing women not to have abortions. Indeed, a s the Ninth Circuit explained, the legislat ure concluded that Petitioners' very \" existence \" hinders the ability of women to get an abortion. Pet. 7a. And the legislature attacked what , for many, is a core religious belief \u2014that one can provide a sufficient 2 See, e.g., Assembly Bill 154 ( Cal. 2013) (permitting broad cate- gory of professionals to perform certain types of abortion). 3 See Ian Lovett, California Expands Availability of Abortions , N.Y. Times (Oct. 9, 2013 ) (\"[T]he et seq . 4 range of pregnancy -related services without providing abortions \u2014as mere posturing. See Pet. 7a. Attempting to limit the effect of Petitioners' efforts, the legislature singl ed them out for special burdens . As Petitioners explain in greater detail (at 7-14), the FACT Act requires licensed health care providers that do not offer abortions but do offer pregnancy counsel- ing to display the following message: \"California has public programs that provide immediate free or low - cost access to comprehensive family planning services (includ ing all FDA -approved methods of contracep- tion), prenatal care, and abortion for eligible women. To determine whether you qualify, contact the county social services office at \" that office's telephone number. Cal. Health & Safety Code \u00a7 123472(a)(1) . The purpose of these signs could not be clearer: to conscript non-profits that oppose abortion to tell women how they may obtain one. The legislature is thus attempt ing to undercut the central purpose of these religious non -profits ' activities. 2. Petitioners sued under , among other authori- ties, the Free Speech Clause. But t he district court and Ninth Circuit both concluded that the Free Speech Clause was not violate d. While it apparently conced ed that the disclosures are speech , the Ninth Circuit held (at Pet. 28a -33a) that Petitioners' speech is profes- sional speech and that, despite being content -based, the FACT Act is viewpoint -neutral (Pet. 18a -22a) and, therefore , not subject to strict scrutiny . 5 SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT Petitioners have persuasively explained why the \"disclosures\" required by the FACT Act violate the First Amendment's Free Speech clause. Rather than restate Petitioners' points, amici offer (1) an analysis of why that question is of enormous and increasing practical importance to religious institutions gener- ally, and (2) an approach to resolving the question pre- sented that accounts for its effects on non-profit religious institutions of all stripes , yet leaves for an- other day broader questions about the proper applica- tion of the Free Speech Clause in for -profit settings . I. If affirmed, t he Ninth Circuit's resolution of the question presented would have disastrou s effects on religious organizations generally . Whether in the con- text of government -compelled \"disclosures\" like those in the FACT Act , notifications to employees, or even speech codes, religious institutions are increasingly facing ma ndates to speak. Worse, these mandates fre- quently conflict with the institutions' religious beliefs and thus forc e them to speak contrary to th ose beliefs. Affirming the Ninth Circuit's decision would give a green light to analogous speech mandates in a va riety of other settings. II. The Court could easily resolve this case on the ground that, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's conclu- sion, the FACT Act constitutes viewpoint discrimina- tion and is therefore subject to strict scrutiny, which it cannot satisfy for all the reasons explained by Petition- ers. However , that resolution would lead many govern- ments to believe that, as long as they are just more careful about it, they can still \"tell people \"\u2014including religious organizations \u2014\"what they must say .\" Alli- 6 ance for Open Soc iety, 133 S. Ct. at 2327 . And govern- mental speech mandates directed at religious institu- tions would continue to proliferat e. To prevent that result \u2014and the consequent need for years of litigation over the proper application of the Free Speech Clause to speech mandates imposed on religious institutions \u2014amici urge the Court to resolve this case on a different and arguably narrower grou nd: Where, as here, a message the government seeks to compel runs counter to the beliefs of a religious non - profit subject to a speech mandate , that mandate must satisfy strict scrutiny. As explained in detail below, that approach is compelled by a long li ne of this Court's precedent. And it would protect religious non - profits like Petitioners and amici from future efforts to compel speech in violation of religious belief s. 7 ARGUMENT I. Governments of all stripes are increasingly trying to coerce institutions of faith to en- dorse secular ideas that contravene the in- stitutions' religious beliefs. When it comes to efforts to compel speech by reli- gious institutions, this case is only the tip of the ice- berg. Indeed, the Fourth Circuit recently struck down a Baltimore ordinance similar to the FACT Ac t as ap- plied to a clinic hosted at a local Catholic church . See Greater Balt. Ctr. for Pregnancy Concerns v. Mayor & City Council of Balt. , 2018 WL 298142 (4th Cir. Jan. 5, 2018) . And other governments throughout the Nation increasingly attempt to coerce institutions of faith to communicate ideas that further the government's sec- ular policies but contravene religious beliefs . If it stands, the Ninth Circuit's holding that laws like the FACT Act need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny will accelerate this dangerous trend. 1. For example, a bill passed by the California Leg- islature just last year (but vetoed by the governor) would have required all employers \u2014houses of worship and other religious institutions included \u2014to publish notices in their employee handbooks stating that non - ministerial employees have a right to be free from \" any adverse action . . . for thei r reproductive health deci- sions[.]\" See Assembly Bill 569 (Cal. 2017) . This provision, much like the signs in this case, would clearly compel speech. And the bill's broader purpose, accord ing to its sponsor, was to change the hiring practices of local religious organizations: The sponsor specifically mentioned that the bill would im- pact the Diocese of Santa Rosa, California and its Par- ishes , which hire individuals who will act in 8 accordance with religious teachings.5 But because the law would have applied to all employers, not just churches, the law would likely have survived a free speech challenge under the Ninth Circuit's logic. 2. The burgeoning effort to compel speech also di- rectly aff ects religion -based organizations such as reli- gious schools and hospitals. For example, the City of St. Louis has tried to prevent religious schools and other institutions from even stating a preference to hire people whose conduct conforms to the institut ion's central religious tenets. Specifically, the City has for- bidden all employers \u2014including houses of worship and other religious institutions \u2014from \"mak[ing] any inquiry in connection with prospective employment, which expresse s directly or indirectly any preference, limitation, specification or discrimination because of reproductive health decisions [.]\" City of St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance 70459 \u00a7 2(B)(5) (Feb. 1, 2017) . In response, the Catholic Archdiocesan Elementary Schools have sued the City for the right to state and abide by their religious hiring preferences . In the memorandum supporting summary judgmen t filed by the City, the City argues that its ordinance does not violate the Free Speech Clause as applied to the Arch- diocese and its schools. Further, b ecause the \" Archdi- ocese [schools] will not hire people who have [had] abortion s,\" the city says, the la w seeks to protect the 5 California Executive Committee on Judiciary, Committee Re- port, AB569 at 3, https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnal- ysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB569 (click on link that says \"04/21/17 - Assembly Judiciary\"). 9 Archdiocese's employees and potential employees from \"reproductive health discrimination .\"6 In so doing, St. Louis repeats some of the very ar- guments the Ninth Circuit embraced. For example, the city claims that , because \"[n] o viewpo int is being sup- ported or demonized by this Ordinance,\" the ordinance is viewpoint -neutral.7 This argument is nearly indis- tinguishable from the Ninth Circuit's claim that \" the Act applies to all licensed and unlicensed facilities, re- gardless of what, if an y, objections they may have to certain family -planning services. \" Pet. 20a. Accordingly, if affirmed by this Court, the Ninth Circuit's decision would likely permit and encourage other jurisdictions to compel the speech of all religious organizations \u2014inclu ding religious hospitals and schools as well as houses of worship \u2014in the manner that St. Louis is now attempting to do. 3. Other examples come from Iowa and Massachu- setts, which now effectively require houses of worship and other religious institutions to address individuals using pronouns contrary to how some religious bodies view sex and gender identity .8 In Massachusetts, the 6 Defendant 's Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment, Our Lady's Inn v. City of St. Louis at 10 , 4:17-10543, Dkt. # 20 -2 (E.D. Mo. Oct. 30, 2017 ). 7 Id. at 9. 8 Although the Iowa and Massachusetts laws do not specifically single out the use of pronouns ba sed on biological sex as inher- ently discriminatory, the agency determinations that such con- duct is discriminatory are likely to be persuasive in court. See Iowa Code \u00a7 216.5 (granting agency extensiv e power to laws); Mass. Ann. Laws ch. 151B, \u00a7 3 (similar). 10 relevant state guidance document notes that \"a reli- gious organization may be subject to \" such a require- ment whenever it \" engages i n or its facilities are used for a 'public, secular function'\" \u2014which of course is true of almost all houses of worship.9 Likewise, the Iowa guidance document notes that \"[p] laces of worship (e.g. churches, synagogues, mosques, etc.) are generally ex- empt fr om the Iowa law's prohibition of discrimina- tion, unless the place of worship engages in non - religious activities which are open to the public \"\u2014 which, again, virtually all houses of worship do.10 Such policies conflict with the teachings of some faiths that they should say only true things, including what they view as the truth about how God \" made [mankind] at the begi nning . . . male and female.\"11 For these houses of worship , their members, and their af- filiated charities and other institutions , stating that someone's true sex is different from the person's bio- logical sex contradicts this truth regarding human cre- ation. In their view, the law now compels them to affirm something with which they disagree . Purporting to limit such state policies to a religion - based organization's \"secular\" activities does not solve the problem. As this Court noted in Corporation of Pre- siding Bishop v. Amos , there \" is a significant burden on a religious organization \" if it has \" to predict which 9 Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination, Gender Identity Guid- ance 1, 4 (Dec. 2016), htt p://www.mass.gov/mcad/docs/gender - identity -guidance -12-05-16.pdf [https://perma.cc/CSW6 -G3SN]. 10 Iowa Civil Rights Commission, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity: A Public Accommodations Provider's Guide to Iowa 11 Matthew 19:4; Genesis 1:27. 11 of its activities a secular court will consider religious. \" 483 U.S. 327, 336 (1987 ). Indeed, \"f ear of potential lia- bility might affect the way an organization carried out what it understo od to be its religious mission. \" Ibid. And many church activities \u2014a book club, a bake sale , or a gymnasium as in Amos \u2014may appear secular yet represent important parts of the church's religio n- based outreach. Perhaps jus t as important, these \"sec- ular\" activities fulfill a religious mission to bring greater unity to an American culture whose success hinges on seeking harmony in diversity.12 And of course, although religious schools and hospitals may provide some services th at are also offered by secular institutions, the government has long recognized that they are bona fide religious organizations because of their affiliation with a church or their grounding in a church's religious traditions and beliefs.13 4. Another examp le of an intrusive policy that the Ninth Circuit's approach would allow arises from the current administration's efforts to punish what some call \"sanctuary cities ,\" which seek to assist undocu- 12 See Robert Putnam, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Commu nity (2000 ). Such outreach is often rooted in express religious te achings. See, e.g., Luke 10:25-37 (parable of good Samaritan); Vatican II, Gaudium et Spes , No. 29 (\"Every form o f social or cultural discrimination in fundamental personal rights on the grounds of sex, race, color, social conditions, lan- guage, or religion must be curbed and eradicated as incompatible with God 's design.\"); 2 Nephi 26:33 (Latter -day Saint) (\"[Christ] denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen .\"). 13 See, e.g., Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton , 137 S. Ct. 1652 (2017) ; Hosanna -Tabor Church & . v. EEOC , 565 U.S. 171 (2012) . 12 mented immigrants . Many religious institutions, in- cluding house s of worship and religious colleges, have religious doctrine s urging compassion for immigrants , whether or not the immigrants have proper documen- tation .14 And yet, if the administration decided to fur- ther pursue its immigration policy goals , religious colleges or houses of worship could well be compelled to disclose to their members and others a government - prescribed message contrary to their religious beliefs about immigration \u2014a message, for example, articulat- ing an obligation to cooperate with immigration au- thorities. Under the Ninth Circuit's rationale, the administration could readily immunize such a policy from strict scrutiny, and make it subject only to inter- mediate scrutiny as viewpoint neutral, by also apply- ing the policy to institutions that support the administration's policy. Here again, if the Ninth Circuit's ruling stands, re- ligious organizations w ill have no free -speech defense to these and many other laws that seek to force such institutions to propagate governmental message s that contradict the institutions' religious beliefs. 5. As these examples show, affirming the Ninth Circuit's ruling would open the door to blatant target- ing of religious institutions nationwide . In the future, 14 E.g. Leviticus 19:34 (\"The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native -born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt.\"). Some houses of worship have even declared themselves \"sanctuary churches.\" See, e.g., Southside Presbyterian Church, The Sanctuary Movement , http://www.southsidepresbyterian.org/sanctuary.html (detailing the history of the \"sanctuary church \" movement and claiming the support of approximatel y 800 congregations). 13 for example, governments could well try to force reli- gious ins titutions to promote messages (e.g., \"Living a celibate lifestyle can lead to depression. Here are some resources for depression.\") that contradict religious teachings on chastity and sexuality.15 Other compelled messages (e.g., \"Studies have shown that chi ldren re- ally do not need parents of both genders\") could just as easily contradict the belief of some faiths and reli- giously -oriented institutions that, where possible, chil- dren should be raised by both a mother and father.16 These sorts of messages are not like traditional commercial disclosures, such as ingredient lists and calorie count s on food label s. Rather, these kinds of compelled \"disclosures \"\u2014including those at issue in this case \u2014force those on one side of a political or social debate to propagate the views of their opponents, and in a way that is designed to diminish or even neuter the speaker's own views. No religious institution should be required to make these sorts of \"disclosures\" when they contradict the institution's religious beliefs. But if the decision below is affirmed, more and more governments around the country are likely to target houses of worship and other religious institutions in just that way. 15 E.g., 1 Corinthians 6:18 (\"Avoid immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the immoral person sins against his own body .\"). Multiple religious tr aditions teach that a chaste lifestyle leads to happiness for both the individual and oth- ers. E.g. 3 John 1:4 (\"Nothing gives me greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth .\"). 16 E.g. Human Sexuality: A Theological Perspective 17-20 (1981 ) 1641, 1653, 1666 ; The Family: A the World (1995 ) (Lat- ter-day Saint ). 14 II. This Court should hold that the Free Speech Clause does not permit governments to ap- ply even supposedly neutral speech require- ments against objecting non-profit institutions of faith without satisfying strict scrutiny . To prevent such harms to free speech, this Court should hold that the Free Speech Clause requires that the application of \"disclosure\" laws such as the FACT Act pass strict scrutiny. And the cleanest way to do that here is to hold that a mandate directing an object- ing religious n on-profit to convey the State's preferred message is always subject to strict scrutiny. Alterna- tively, strict scrutiny is required because, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's conclusion, the FACT Act is based on viewpoint discrimination, not just content. And f or all the reasons explained by Petitioners (at 49-57), the FACT Act cannot survive strict scrutiny. A. A requirement that a n objecting religious non-profit convey the State's preferred message should always be subject to strict scrutiny. Regardless of its targeting of politically -disfavored speech, the FACT Act 's compelled speech requirement should be subject to strict scrutiny . The Ninth Circuit attempted to avoid this result in part by holding that Petitioners' government -required speech about abor- tion is \"professional\" s peech, subject only to intermedi- ate scrutiny. Pet. 28a-29a. But t hat cannot be correct: Petitioners are all non-profit organizations incorpo- rated to pursue religious missions that include speech opposing abortion and endorsing alternatives. Pet. 89a-90a. W hatever the standard may be in other cir- cumstances, with other kinds of speakers, it makes no 15 sense to allow the State to compel speech from institu- tions like Petitioners without satisfying strict scru- tiny. 1. One of the First Amendment's deepest concerns is to protect religious expression from government co- ercion. Indeed, as this Court has noted, \"a free -speech clause without religion would be Hamlet without the prince .\" Pinette , 515 U.S. at 760 (1995). As explained above, religious institutions are frequ ently countercul- tural: Owing their allegiance to divine authority, they often find themselves at odds with the norms prevail- ing in their local communities , or in the broader world . This Court has accordingly recognized that those institutions are best ser ved (and can best serve their members and society) under guarantees of autonomy , specifically, \"an independence from secular control or manipulation \u2014in short, power to decide for them- selves, free from state interference, matters of church government as wel l as those of faith and doc- trine.\" Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in North America, 344 U.S. 94, 116 (1952) . In a long line of cases \u2014many under the Estab- lishment and Free Exercise Clauses \u2014this Court has guaranteed the right of such organizations to deter- mine th eir own messages without government inter- ference. See, e.g., Hosanna -Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch . v. E.E.O.C ., 565 U.S. 171, 188 (2012) (holding that anti-discrimination laws cannot be deployed to \"depriv[e] [a] church of control over the selection of those who will personify its beliefs\"). Other n on-profit religious organizations are like- wise central to the First Amendment's protections. Even in cases of disagreement about the outer bounds of the religion clauses in the for -profit realm , everyone 16 agrees that \"[t]he First Amendment's free exercise pro- tections . Burwell v. Hobby 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2794 (2014) (Ginsburg, J., joined by Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (emphasis ad ded). Some such organizations exist to serve a religious com- munity. Ibid. Others exist to win converts to their re- ligious views , or\u2014like Petitioners \u2014put their religious community' s principles to work through service in the world at large. Petitioners thus stand at the intersec- tion of two circumstances in which this Court has al- ways considered constitutional protections most important: they are organizations that are both reli- gious and non-profit in nature. See, e.g., Amos , 483 U.S. at 344 -45 (Brennan, J., concurring) (constitu- tional concerns at their height with respect to non- profit activities of religious organizations). 2. In light of Petitione rs' religious and non -profit character , treating their speech like the ordinary ad- vice of professionals serving clients ignores reality. When religious n on-profits speak, they are not merely providing professional services . Rather, they are per- forming reli gious functions and conveying messages that they believe hold ultimate significance. Their speech thus lies at the core of the First Amendment's protections . This Court , moreover, has always held that strict scrutiny applies when ever the government compels types of expression approaching that level of im- portance. See Wooley v. Maynard , 430 U.S. 705 , 716 (1977) (evaluating whether the State had an \" interest . . . sufficiently compelling to justify requiring appel- lees to display the state motto on their license plates \") (citation omitted) ; see also Hurley v. Irish -Am. Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Bos ton, 515 U.S. 557, 573 17 (1995) (explaining that the State \" may not compel af- firmance of a belief with which the speaker disagrees \") (citation omitted) . This Court's precedent thus \" estab- lishes that private religious speech, fa r from being a First Amendment orphan, is as fully protected under the Free Speech Clause as secular private expression. \" Pinette , 515 U.S. at 760. Moreover, s trict scrut iny applies \"not only to [com- pelled] expressions of value, opinion, or endorsement, but equally to statements of fact the speaker would ra- ther avoid .\" Hurley , 515 U.S. at 573 . Even on the State's assumptions, that holding describes the pre- sent case perfectly. It follows that strict scrutiny should apply. The Fourth Circuit recently reached a similar con- clusion. In ruling that a Baltimore city ordinance , sim- ilar to th e FACT Act , is unconstitutional as applied to religious non -profits, that court noted that the ordi- nance was \" antithetical to the very moral, religious, and ideological reasons the [non-profit] exists. \" Greater Balt. Ctr. for Pregnancy Concerns v. Mayor & City Council of Balt ., 2018 WL 298142 at *5 (4th Cir. Jan. 5, 2018 ). The court further held that, unless such institutions enjoy a right \"to [not] utter political and philosophical beliefs that the state wishes to h ave said,\" \" states [could] bend individuals to their own be- liefs and use compelled speech as a weapon to run [their] ideological foes into the ground. \" Ibid. Perhaps California or Baltimore could regulate some kinds of secular, for -profit speakers in the way in which they seek to r egulate the institutions in these cases. But absent a showing that the law survives strict scrutiny, neither they nor any other jurisdiction can be allowed to compel speech from religious institu- tions that disagree with the government's message on 18 religiou s grounds. Yet that is what California is doing here: declaring Petitioners a threat to their policy goals and compelling their contrary speech. See supra pp. 3-4; Pet.Br. 7 -8. The decision below must be re- versed for this reason alone. 3. Moreover , the leg islative history and text of the FACT Act show that the legislature enacted the law because it disagrees with the religious speech of Peti- tioners and other religious organizations . The legisla- ture is thus trying to discredit religious s peech in favor of its preferred, secular message \u2014that is, it is at- tempting to \"use compelled speech as a weapon to run its ideological foes into the ground.\" Greater Baltimore Center, supra, 2018 WL 298142 at *5 . This is unques- tionably unconstitutional in the religious setting, whatever the status of analogous secular speech . A simple analogy explains the unconstitutionality of a stat e attempting to discredit religious speech. It would be an obvious violation of the Free Speech Clause for a state to mandate that , as a condition of allowing publication of a religious text , a statement be included suggesting sources contradicting that te xt's core teachings. At a minimum , such a disclaimer would have to survive strict scrutiny. But the Ninth Circuit claim s that the FACT Act should receive inter- mediate scrutiny even though it forces Petitioners to preface their religious statements , both orally and in written materials , with government -compelled mes- sages that effectively urge readers to question Peti- tioners' own statements . This religious targeting violates the First Amendment . This analogy also illustrates why this C ourt need not answer in this case question s about whether the First Amendment permits similar regulation of for- 19 profit speakers. While California may regulate (for ex- ample) medical textbooks to ensure adequate training of its doctors , it may not regulate the c ontent of reli- gious texts instructing on how to minister to the sick. At very least, compulsion of speech from religious non-profits like Petitioners should not be subject to less scrutiny than this Court applied to an individual's objection to his State' s motto, see Wooley , 430 U.S. 705 , or to a cultural organization's annual parade, see Hur- ley, 515 U.S. 557 . Once a gain, religious speech is not a First Amendment orphan. Pinette , 515 U.S. at 760. In- deed, t he conjunction of a highly suspect compelled speech requirement with the highly protected status of religious n on-profits makes strict scrutiny all the more appropri ate. Cf., e.g., Employment Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881 (1990) . 4. This approach \u2014a safe harbor for non -profit re- ligious institutions under the Free Speech Clause \u2014 would allow the Court to protect a substantial swath of clearly protected activity while reserving more diffi- cult issues for future cases. This Court has long distin- guished for-profit commercial speech from other types of speec h. See, e.g., Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio , 471 U.S. 626, 651 (1985) . Although amici take no position on the legiti- macy of that approach , the difference between reli- gious n on-profits and ordinary commercial entities \u2014 and any differences in the overall content of those e n- tities' speech \u2014would allow the present case to be dis- tinguish ed from an otherwise -similar controversy involving a purely secular medical practice, or a large publicly -held company. If such a case were ever pre- sented, this Court should address it on its pa rticular facts. 20 In short, b ecause strict scrutiny protection for reli- gious n on-profits makes sense for unique reasons, ap- plying that level of scrutiny to this case defers the question of how to review similar laws in other con- texts. Cf. Hobby Lobby , 134 S . Ct. at 2774 (explaining that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act applied because \"[t]he companies in the cases before us are closely held corporations\"). For all these reason s, the Court should rule that the Free Speech Clause requires strict scrutiny of any governmental attempt to force Petitioners to convey a government -endorsed message in conflict with their religious belief, simply because they are religious non - profits. B. The State's action here was viewpoint - based and therefore subject to strict scru- tiny for that reason as well . In any event, there is no question that the FACT Act was intended to \u2014and in fact does \u2014compel groups that convey a politically -disfavored message to convey the State's message as well. And t his Court has long held that strict scrutiny applies to \" speaker -based laws . . . when they reflect the Government . aver- sion to what the disfavored speakers have to say [.]\" Turner Broad . Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C. , 512 U.S. 622, 65 8 (1994) . To hold that strict scrutiny applies here, this Court need only appl y that well -established rule to the undisputed facts of this case. The FACT Act particularly targets speakers \u2014in- cluding Petitioners \u2014who regularly disseminate mes- sages with which the State disagrees. The whole point of the FACT Act , as the Legislature openly admitted , was to destroy the effectiveness of \"'crisis pregnancy centers '\" that \"'aim to discourage and prevent women 21 from seeking abortions '\" by \"'interfer[ing] with women's ability to be fully informed and exerci se their reproductive rights. '\" Pet. 7a (quoting Assem bly Com- mittee on Health, Analysis of Assembly Bill No. 775 at 3). In the State's view, crisis pregnancy centers \"'often confuse, misinform, and even intimidate women from making fully -informed, time -sensitive decisions about critical health care. '\" Pet. 7a (quoting Analysis of As- sembly Bill No. 775 at 3 ). Having determined that the speech of crisis preg- nancy centers is \"confus[ing]\" or mistaken, Pet. 7a , the State decided that the most appropriate response was to compel them to convey the State's message as well. In the Ninth Circuit's words, \" the Legislature found that the most effective way to ensure that women are able to receive access to family plann ing services, and accurate information about such services, was to re- quire licensed pregnancy -related clinics . . . to state the existence of these services .\" Pet. 7a .17 The State t hus elected to make the clinics \" an instrument for fostering public adherence to a specific ideological point of view \"\u2014namely, the acceptability of abortion as a method of birth control \u2014that Petitioners \"find[] unac- ceptable .\" Wooley 70 5, 715 (1977) . 17 The State's concern that crisis pregnancy centers \"misinform\" and \"intimidate\" women is a smokescreen. Pet. 7a. California did not need a new law to address such problems: it already had an exten sive regulatory system directed at unfair and deceptive trade practices, which would already be implicated if misinfor- mation or deception were present here. See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17200 et seq. (Unfair Competition Law); Cal. Bus. & Code \u00a7 17500 et \u00a7 1770 et seq. (Consumer Legal Remedies Act). 22 Other aspects of the FACT Act underscore that clinics with Petitioners' particular moral perspectives were intended to bear a special burden. For example, the law contains an exception for any \"licensed pri- mary care clinic that is enrolled as a Medi -Cal provider and a provider in the Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment Program ,\" Pet. 80a , which is the State's system of \"reproductive health See Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code \u00a7 14132 . The FACT Act was crafted, in other words, to exe mpt licensed clinics that are already putting out the State's preferred me ssage about abortion. Conversely, the only licensed providers that the FACT Act affects are those that the State be- lieves are not adequately communicating the govern- ment 's message . The inference can hardly be clearer: The State dis- liked the speech of certain organizations, and set out to muddy, obscure, and drown it out through legisla- tion. That is clear from the Ninth Circuit's account of the FACT Act , not merely Petitioners' or amici's. But whatever a given policyma ker might think about abor- tion, \"freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say.\" Agency for Int 'l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc 'y, 570 U.S. 205, 133 S. Ct. 2321, 2327 (2013 ) (quotes omitted). To target a disfa- vored category of speakers based on aversion to their speech is the essence of a viewpoint -based restriction on speech , and it calls for strict scrutiny. Turner Broad. , 512 U.S. a t 658 ; see also Reed v. Town of Gil- bert, Ariz ., 135 S. Ct. 2218, 2230 (2015) . The Ninth Cir- cuit gravely erred by applying merely intermediate scrutiny instead. 23 CONCLUSION The Ninth Circuit's decision is a judicial wrecking ball that, if affirmed by this Court, would destroy a large swath of First Ame ndment rights properly en- joyed, not only by religiously -affiliated pregnancy cen- ters, but by all institutions of faith. The decision below should be reversed. Respectfully submitted, ANTHONY R. PICARELLO , JR. GENE C. SCHAERR JEFFREY HUNTER MOON MICHAEL F.

USCCB advocates and promotes the pastoral teachings of the U.S. Catholic Bishops in such dive rse areas of the N ation's life as the free ex- pression of ideas, fair employment and equal oppor- tunity for the underprivileged, immigration, protection of the rights of parents and children, the sanctity of life, and the importance of education. Val- ues of p articular importance to the Conference include the protection of the rights of religious organizations and their adherents under the First Amendment , and the proper development of this Court's jurisprudence in that regard. The California Catholic Conference is a non- profit corporation, the members of which are the active Catholic Bishops of the State of California . The Con- ference promotes the teachings of the Catholic Church and advocates on behalf of the sacredness of all huma n life, the importance of family life and the education of youth, justice for immigrants, the imprisoned and vic- tims of human trafficking. The Conference supports programs serving people living in poverty and those in need of health care. It also supports the enforcement of state and federal laws protecting the rights of reli- gious organizations. The Catholic Health Association of the United States (\"CHA\") is the national leadership organiza- tion for the Catholic Church's health ministry. This ministry compri ses more than 600 hospitals and 1400 long-term care and other health facilities in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. CHA advances the 2a Catholic health ministry's commitment to a just, com- passionate health care system that protects life. CHA's memb ers could be directly affected if governments could compel religiously -affiliated organizations to convey messages in contravention to their religious be- liefs. The Lutheran Church \u2014Missouri (\"the Synod\") has some 6100 member congregations with 2,100,000 baptized members throughout the United States. The Synod has two seminaries, ten universi- ties, numerous related Synod -wide corporate entities, hundreds of recognized service organizations , and the largest Protestant parochial school system in America. The Synod steadfastly adheres to orthodox Lutheran theology and practice and has a keen interest in the High Court 's fully preserving and protecting all reli- gious liberties and freedom of speech provided under the First Amendment. Christian Legal Society (\"CLS\" ) is an association of attorneys, law students, and law professors, founded in 1961, with attorney chapters and law student chap- ters nationwide. CLS's advocacy arm, the Center for Law and Religious Freedom, defends freedom of speech, the free exercise of r eligion, and the sanctity of human life in the courts, legislatures, and public square. CLS has long believed that pluralism, essen- tial to a free society, prospers only when the First Amendment rights of all Americans are protected, in- cluding the right not to engage in compelled speech, which is at stake in this case. Based on its belief that the Bible commands Chris- tians to plead the cause of the poor and needy, CLS encourages and equips its members to volunteer their time and resources to help those in n eed in their com- munities. Through its legal aid ministry, CLS provides 3a resources and training to assist approximately 60 local legal aid clinics nationwide. These clinics represent one category of religious ministries whose work could be adversely affected if states may use compelled speech laws, such as those challenged in this case, to force them to express messages contrary to their reli- gious beliefs. Agudath Israel of America , founded in 1922, is a national grassroots Orthodox Jewish organization. Among its other functions and activities, Agudath Is- rael articulates and advances the position of the Or- thodox Jewish community on a broad range of legal issues affecting religious rights and liberties in the United States. Agudath Israel regularly intervenes a t all levels of government \u2014federal, state, and local; leg- islative, administrative, and judicial (including through the submission or participation in amicus cu- riae briefs) \u2014to advocate and protect the interests of the Orthodox Jewish community in the United States in particular and religious liberty in general. We join in this amicus curiae brief because we believe strongly that government should not compel religious organiza- tions to propagate messages that conflict with their re- ligious beliefs, and that the issue at stake in this case could have ramifications in a broad array of contexts that are of concern to religious communities like ours.
