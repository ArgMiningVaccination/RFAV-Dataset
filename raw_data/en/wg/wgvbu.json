This report could not have been possible without all the support received by women from across the globe. We are extremely grateful to the women representatives of the four LFs for their time, contributions, guidance, and all the invaluable inside stories shared with the team. We would like to also give thank s to the support of external stakeholders, including Prospera, AWID and APWR and also prominent indigenous women who are leading global indigenous Funds. We would like to extend our deepest gratitude to the amazing women representatives or members of the grantees' organisatio ns and those working behind the scene, who took the time to meet with us, even under difficult circumstances (some had lost family members through COVID -19, or had to travel many hours to have access to the internet) to tell us their stories, their example s of persistence, struggles to fight for the rights of women in difficult and patriarchal contexts and societies, their insights on how to sustain themselves, and how resilient they have been all the way, to even push for a change in national laws. All the contributions from all these feminist and indigenous strong and resilient women from different backgrounds and origins have significantly informed and shaped this final ev aluation report. Their pathways of change have also taken us on a journey through their knowledge, proposals and vision for a fair, inclusive and non -discriminatory world. We hope that these pathways of change have been fully captured in this report. iii TABL E OF CONTENTS Acknowledgements ................................ .................... 1 1.2 Objectives the Evaluation ................................ ................................ research . 43 Annex B.

The programme had four key objectives: (1) provide innovative and flexible grants to women's organisations and change agents in the Global South; (2) support capacity building through technical and financial resourcing to strengthen ca pacities of change agents; (3) promote advocacy by supporting women's movements and networks in the Global South; and (4) help build partnerships across strategic regional and global alliances, South -South learning and joint progress on common goals. Leading from the South aimed to complement other Dutch funding for women 's rights. In specific, Leading from the South aimed to support the consolidation of women's movement s in the Global South by allowing Women 's Rights Organisations from the Global South t o take decisions on the thematic, priorities and distribution of the grants in each region. In this sense, the taskforce for Women's Rights and Gender equality (TFVG) of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to select three Southern regional women' s funds and one global fund , to disburse grants to Southern women's organisations and their networks, particularly those with higher vulnerabilities. The selection process followed rigorous criteria and numerous consultations with expert organisations that understand the specific regional contexts. The four L eading Funds selected were the African Women's Development Fund (AWDF), Fondo de Mujeres del Sur de Mujeres Ind\u00edgenas (FIMI), and Women's Fund Asia (WFA). As the L eading from the South programme came to an end on 31 December 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commissioned this end -term evaluation of the overall L eading from the South programme . The consultancy firms Transition Internatio nal and Transtec were hired to undertake the evaluation. The overall objective of the end -term evaluation was to gain insight into the extent to which the main goals of this policy framework and the L eading from the South women's funds have been achieved, and if so, through what evidence this achievement be substantiated. Methodologically , the evaluation team used mix ed approaches including surveys, KIIs and documentary information, including the information consolidated already by the endline reviews. The evaluation used feminist principles, including the use of transformative, intersectional and gender -based approach es, explained in detail below, and organised the information around five OECD -DAC evaluation criteria (relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability ). The table below presents the number and type of participants in the evaluation .

Given the existing regulations and quarantine limitations in most countries as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, and the risk of bringing new variants of the virus to local communities which are likely not vaccinated and at high risk, it was decided that the evaluation was to be conducted remotely. In order to reach the most remote communities/grantees given the current context, the evaluation team used a variety of mechanisms (Google Forms, Zoom, WhatsApp, Signal, Proton Mail) to receive responses from beneficiaries, and allowed great flexibility in schedules and timelines for the responses. The findings were organised around five OECD criteria mentioned below : The first of the criteria is related to relevance. The programme was highly relevant and was designed to respond to the needs and aspirations of the beneficiaries. As indicated in the introduction, its origin stems from dialogues facilitated by Prospera and organisations that were not included in the second phase of the FLOW programme financed by the M inistry of Foreign Affairs . Thus, the programme was developed to give the organisations another opportunity to receive support to further build on initiatives that they were already undertaking. Grantees had the flexibility to determine the thematic areas they would like to work on, which generally fell into their domain of expertise, as well as the challenge(s) that they wanted to address at the local, national, regional, or international level. Grantees and L eading Funds mention that the implementat ion modalities put in place were appropriate, including the choice of the funds, the specialisations of the funds, the approach of the implementation of the project, the flexibility to adapt fund level ToCs and indicators, and the intersectional approach that was used to maximise the benefits of the project for the targeted beneficiaries. In response to COVID -19, consistent evidence of L eading Funds programmes and grants taking the initiative to adapt and respond to the changing needs of the grantees and th eir beneficiaries was observed. In terms of coherence, the evaluation found that the way in which coordination and dialogue were promoted between the M inistry of Foreign Affairs and L eading Funds , helped to open the door for a more horizontal and trustwort hy relation between donors and women's rights organisations in the Global South. In particular, the L eading from the South model of horizontality, trust, and delegation of the decision -making to women's rights organisations in the Global South is now being used as a model to initiate dialogue and new funding streams from other international donors. The evaluation noticed increased coordination across the L eading Funds, particularly around the prioritisation, selection and monitoring, evaluation, and learnin g processes, or common areas of advocacy for women and girls, and growing interregional coordination with other regional women's rights organisations. This increasing harmonisation was passed down to grantees, particularly within the same regions, and some initial consortia and integrated approaches were observed, facilitating the sharing of best practices. A key result from this increased coordination was bringing awareness to intersectionalities across the feminist and indigenous agendas, and especially t he need to pay specific attention to the needs and priorities of women with disabilities, African -descendent communities, and LBTIQ+ persons. Yet, the effectiveness of the coordination tools (linking and learning tools) was thwarted by COVID -19 and the lack of time and incentives to motivate grantees to stay connected . Further, the process of increasing harmonization across grantees fr om different regions is just starting, more could be done to involve Dutch diplomatic missions constructively . vi In terms of efficiency, the financial and narrative documents provided evidence that despite COVID -19 being a big obstacle to implement all proje ct activities, a great majority of grants and the Leading Fund action plans and budgets were implemented according to initial budgets and objectives, with adaptations being done only in terms of how these outputs/outcomes were achieved. In relation to COVI D-19, time limitations, rather than budget limitations were seen as a key limitation. This was unfortunately an area where the M inistry of Foreign Affairs could not provide additional flexibility, as in other areas, because of contractual and institutional reasons which could have delayed the process of launching the second phase of the programme. The evaluation found that results -based budgeting was used consistently for both the grantees and Leading Fund budgets, although the level of detail within the b udgets adjusted according to the size of the projects. In general, interviews revealed that most of the grantees were using them already and thus facilitated the process of adaptation to COVID -19. In terms of the key costs affecting Value for Money, the evaluation revealed that human resources, travel, and accommodation and hiring of consultants/researchers/ trainers were the key cost drivers for grantees. The pandemic also had some effects on individual budget lines (i.e., travel and accommodation), especi ally for organisations in remote areas. This discussion brought forward questions about how to include qualitative and intangible costs (activism, trust and volunteering are a key part of the feminist movement) within the V alue For Money model. In terms o f effectiveness, at the macro level (change in environment), we found that Leading from the South contributed to enhancing women's capabilities for influencing a wide range of policy changes at local, national, and regional levels, with less emphasis on in fluencing the macro -level of policymaking and challenging areas such as economic and environmental policies. At the meso -level change, the tools developed through Leading from the South contributed to enhancing the capacities of thousands of women and girl s through accessing information and learning about their human rights, ensuring that they felt seen and heard, increased their self -esteem and power to transform the unfair policies and practices affecting their daily lives. Finally, at the micro -level ch ange: the Leading from the South grants contributed to individual and collective trajectories of women's empowerment. These trajectories include the technical, social, cultural, political, and economic dimensions, and were instrumental to further enhance w omen's power for agency (i.e., influencing policies and practices in ways that are beneficial to women in their complex diversity). Overall, the Leading from the South grants contributed to grounded processes of change that are embedded in a systemic visi on of transformation. Pathways of change , in general , were shaped by the specific enabling and limiting factors in each context, and particular unforeseen contingencies. Significant key enablers were the strong support and flexibility from the L eading Funds, the existence of networks and key contacts, the commitment and efforts from organisations and their communities. Significant limiting factors were the impact of COVID -19, changes in the political system resulting in risks for grantees and beneficiaries, too short timeframes, and lack of resources for longer term impact. Key stakeholders (such as local leaders, communities, and governments) emerged as enablers and/or limiting factors depending on the area of intervention and the political context. For sustainability , key areas in which the funds provided capacity building support included planning and fundraising, advocacy and networking, institutional development, financial management and virtual engagements. According to the interviews and end line repor ts, the organisations received diverse capacity related support, some of which were specific to their needs. Some of the tailored approaches vii for capacity building were specifically commended. For example, in the African Women's Development Fund (AWFD ), exclusive funding for capacity building was offered, usually within the range of $9,000, with the grantees determining the areas in which they would like to invest the funds. Most of the grantees interviewed and surveyed (89%) mention that they have con tinued with the activities and outputs implemented or are continuing to advocate for the policies and other results being built during the projects, even if not at the same level as before (mainly as a result of less available funding which has been reduce d in size since the COVID -19 pandemic). the main challenges against sustainability relate to not having sufficient funding or flexibility in the use of those funds (35%), and short timeframes of implementation (18%). Several interviewees (and two external shareholders) referred to the mismatch between the short timeframe of grants and the long -lasting changes pursued by the L eading from the South Programme. In conclusion , The L eading from the South I programme was a relevant programme that sought to address the lack of direct support to women -led organisations in the Global South. It succeeded in reaching a wide range of organisations across the Global South and provided them with flexible grants, supported capacity building initiatives, promoted their abili ty to advocate and lobby on issues on equality and other related issues. It contributed to building partnerships across strategic regional and global alliances that continue to provide critical spaces for South -South learning and progress. Generally, the g rants were efficiently used by the grantees, with Value for Money ensured, and overall sufficient funds were provided. However, the outbreak of COVID -19 had significant implications for the grantees. Activities long -planned had to be cancelled or delayed and grantees encountered difficulty in building networks or continuing with advocacy activities. Overall, the evaluation observed a high degree of sustainability of the L eading From the South I programme , as most organisations succeeded in having the requir ed capacity to build on the gains of the L eading from the South I. As indicated by the grantees, many grassroot s organisations succeeded in building capacity and empowering women in their local communities to advocate for their rights. The recommendations are mentioned below: Supporting resilience, adaptability and responses to challenges R1 For the LFs Maintain and if possible, increase the level of training and capacity provided, particularly one-to-one support for grassroot organisations . R2 Increase training and support in regards to digital safety and security, responses to online bullying , could be done using local champions. R3 For the MFA Includ e a budget item for emergency support. R4 For the MFA and LFs More flexibility to increase staffing and operational costs when needed (crisis). R5 Additional resources (monetary, training, support) might be needed to ensure physical and mental health and well -being of individual activists and leaders. R6 Linking and Learning processes could be specifically focused on generating inter - regional conversations on arising limitations and challenges . On promoting coordination, linking & Learning R7 For the LFs Promote smaller thematic dialogues/workshops amongst grantees with common interests. These could be delegated to grantees with specific thematic expertise . R8 Continue and expand exchange programmes but agree to specific deliverables which could include the preparation of case studies, presentations, or workshops . R9 Promote cross learning in regard to proposal/grant writing. viii R10 Include former grantees in the linking and learning processes. If funding to have them in physical spaces is limited, at least allow participation in virtual spaces. R11 Make use of virtual spaces to facilitate these more frequent encounters, including those already existing (FMS Toolbox ), and share best practices. R12 For the MFA Start bringing Dutch Diplomatic Missions as supporters and audiences of the Programme will be useful for sustainability of the process, but avoid creating additional workload into the LFs or diminishing their decision -making power. On measuring change/results and VFM R13 For the MFA and LFs Consider setting specific tools and methodologies that facilitate measuring the pathways of change (progress and process to achieve a specific result) and understanding key limitations and challenges . R14 Pilot direct conversations between the MFA Task Force and the grantees on the different expectations when reporting outcomes and outputs. Use more experienced grantees to set training/schools in this area. R15 Start a collective discussion on the concept of Value for Money and how to measure it and set a framework to evaluate it in future evaluations . R16 For the LFs Increase the support, particularly within grassroots organisations, for the monitoring and reporting processes, including use of qualitative methodologies. On accompanying long term change and sustainability R17 For the LFs Continue with some of the changes implemented in LFS I I to increase projects timeframes and flexibility and communicate this to the grantees . R18 Allow additional funding and timeframes to be allocated towards core support, particularly for grassroots organisations. Emphasise the importance of sustainability and exit strategies . R19 Continue showcasing the LFS and its results as a transformative mechanism to provide voice and decision -making to the women in the Global South . R20 Start conversations between the LFs and other regional feminist organisations from the Global South about how to achieve greater financial independence . R21 For the MFA Review the exclusion of Southern countries like Chile and Uruguay from the list of potential beneficiaries . ix ACRONYMS AWDF African Women's Development Fund COVID -19 Corona Virus

INTRODUCTION AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH 1.1 BACKGROUND The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is pursuing a three -track policy on women's rights and gender equality.1 This consists of (i) diplomatic efforts to promote gender equality and women's rights, (ii) integra tion of equal rights and opportunities for women into general foreign policy and (iii) targeted financing for gender equality and women's rights in low -income and lower -middle -income countries. One example of this targeted financing is the Leading from the South (LFS) programme. LFS I was a four -year (2016 - 2020) \u20ac42 million programme that fell under the policy on women's rights and gender equality, as well as the Policy Framework Dialogue and Dissent of the MFA of the Netherlands. The programme targeted different sets of regions and countries listed on the Organisation for Economic - Cooperation and Development -Development Assistance Committee (OECD -DAC) list and aiming to create a balance between working on various themes and types of organisations, which included small grassroots organisations, medium -sized organisations and large organisations and networks. The programme history goes back to 2016, when the Dutch Parliament passed a motion stating that '(...) gender equality is a priority within Dutch develo pment cooperation policy, and continuing efforts to reinforce Southern women's organisations is in line with the UN Global Goals. Noting that Southern women's organisations in countries where women's rights are flouted have unique women's networks enabling them to make an essential contribution to the struggle for equal rights for men and women (...)\" and requested the Dutch government to increase the Accountability Fund by 10 million EUR per year from 2017 and make this money available for southern women's o rganisations for the remaining duration of the accountability fund (2017 -2020) .2 Given the risk that the embassies, due to limited capacity, would be unable to allocate these extra funds within the Accountability Fund, a separate funding window was set up within the Dialogue and Dissent grants framework. The MFA T askforce for Women's Rights and Gender Equality was assigned with the development of the new funding mechanism. The taskforce decided to select three Southern regional women's funds and one global fund to disburse grants to Southern women's organisations and their networks , particularly those with higher vulnerabilities . These women's funds were selected on the basis of the following criteria: (1) based in the global South; (2) having a feminist m andate; (3) having demonstrable experience and the capacity to strengthen local women's organisations and connect them within the region; (4) having demonstrated their legitimacy by ensuring a balanced regional distribution of partner organisations and tar get groups; (5) proven their reliability in terms of continuity, broad support among target groups and donor organisations, and sufficient management capacity. The selection process was done through numerous consultations with expert organisations based on those organisations that complied with the above criteria. The four LFs selected were the African Women's Development Fund (AWDF), Fondo de Mujeres del Sur (FMS), International (Foro Internaciona l de Ind\u00edgenas) / AYNI, 1 Also see ToC of Rights and Gender Equality https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/publicaties/2018/11/08/theory -of- changeontwikkelingssamenwerking/Theory+of+Change+ -+Vrouwenrechten+en+Gendergelijkheid++najaar+2018.pdf 2 ACE Europe. Assessment of the First Call Leading from t he South Fund, page 4. 2 and Women's Fund Asia (WFA). According to interviews with the supporting organisations that accompanied the process (Pro spera , Mama Cash) . These four women's funds were selected by the Dutch MFA because of their uniqueness in terms of their commitment to feminist ideologies as well as their location in the Global South. Some initial negative responses to the selection of these four organisations were reported in previous evaluations ( Mid Term Review (MTR) and evaluation of the first call of proposals ), but the documents observed that these ha d been solved and even lead to new alliances which we will cover in the Coherence section of this report. The LFS also aimed to complement other Dutch funding for women rights, including the Funding Leadership and Opportunities for Women ( FLOW ) 2016 -2020 ). FLOW 2016 -2020 supports interventions by Dutch and international mainstream civil society organisations (CSOs) (and their consortia) which promote an enabling environment for equal opportunities, rights and safety for women and girls in low- and lower -middle -income countries. The LFS, on the other hand , aims to add value by supporting the consolidation of the women's movement in the Global S outh by allowing Women Rights Organisations (WROs ) from the Global South to take decisions on the thematic al areas , priorities and distribution of the grants in each region. The LFS also allows access to smaller southern organ isations that could not access FLOW funds, and traditionally survive from their own resources. This offers the potential benefits to (1) enhance the capacity of regional organisations to manage, distribute funding and use their own knowledge to define prior ities for the feminist movement in each region, (2) strengthen regional alliances and networks and create incentives for inter -regional networkin g, and (3) increase the access of funding to grassroots organisations . The mission of LFS is therefore to resou rce and support women -led organisations, groups, and movements working on women and girls' rights to lead change and transform societies towards the full achievement of their human rights in the Global South , by their own agency and effort . To this end, LFS funds (1) provided innovative and flexible grants to women's organisations and change agents in the Global South; (2) supported capacity building through technical and financial resourcing to strengthen capacities of change agents; (3) pr omoted advocacy by supporting women's movements and networks in the Global South; and (4) helped build partnerships across strategic regional and global alliances that can provide critical spaces for South -South learning and progress through overlapping ag endas . A total of 254 projects were implemented through four Leading Funds (LFs) . A summary of the grants provided per region, thematic area and specific distribution is provided in Annex J. 1.2 OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION As the LFS programme came to an end on 31 December 2020, the MFA commissioned this end -term evaluation of the overall LFS programme, with the consultancy firms Transition International and Transtec eventually hired to undertake the evaluation. The overall objective of the end -term evaluation was to gain insight into the extent to which the main goals of this policy framework and the LFS women's funds have been achieved, and if so, through what evidence this achievement be substantiated. As set out in the Terms of Refe rence (ToR) this objective was to be achieved based on: A meta -evaluation of the external end -line evaluations that were commissioned by the four individual LFS women's funds , and which were implemented between November 2020 and January 2021 by external te ams hired by the LFs. Additional desk research and interviews to elaborate on and substantiate the conclusions from the independent end evaluations that were externally commissioned by the women's funds. 3 Complementing results by conducting four to five (d igital) visits to LFS grantees. The timeframe of this consultancy was five months, from June to October 2021 and it covered the implementation period of the LFS 1 programme (January 2017 -December 2020 ). The data collection phase took place between August and September 2021 and included research in Latin America, Africa, Middle East, South/ Southeast /Central Asia . 1.3 METHODOLOG ICAL APPROACH Conceptual Methodology and application of a feminist intersectional approach Methodologically, the evaluation team used mixed approaches including surveys, Key Informant Interviews ( KIIs) and documentary information, including the information consolidated already by the endline reviews . As requested in the evaluation ToRs, the project used feminist prin ciples for the evaluation, including the use of transformative, intersectional and gender -based approach which will be explained in detail below . In the first instance, the approach was based on intersectional3 feminist principles. The evaluation was guided by the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG)4 and the UN Women Evaluation and Gender - Responsive Evaluation guidelines, with the OECD -DAC criteria used to conduct the evaluation. The specific criteria assess ed were Relevance (which also assessed the quality of the design and the intervention logic), Efficiency (which covered aspects of Value for Money (VfM) , results based budgeting and achievement of outputs) and Coherence (this criteri on was added on the bas is of the 2020 review of OECD -DAC criteria and evaluate coordination, complementarity and the nature of the relationship between the MFA and the respective funds, as well as the relationship that exists among the respective funds, and between the funds and their grantees), effectiveness (which also reviewed how effective the response to the MTR recommendations has been), sustainability (measured the likelihood of maintaining results). Lessons learned, good practices and challenges were reviewed as a cross -cutting aspect throughout all the above -mentioned criteria. Considering the character of the LFS programme and based on initial interviews with the four LFs, a mixed methods approach, with an emphasis on qualitative research methods . The consultancy team looked at both intended and unintended outcomes (both positive and negative) at the micro 3 Cf.

Figure 1 provides an overview of the various levels of analysis and the interlinkages that were considered during the evaluation. This approach is consistent with the Gender at Work analytical framework and examines the interrelationship between gender equality, organisational change, and institutions or 'rules of the game' held in place by power dynamics within communities (Rao et al. 2016). The evaluation als o seeks to examine issues related to intersectionality (specifically, interlocking forms of discrimination affecting women in all their diversity), and how socio -political changes at different levels are either hampering or contributing to reinforc ing positive or negative transformation. Specific methodological approaches already proven adequate were taken from the documentary review of past evaluations and the end line reviews done by each of the Funds .5 These included allowing additional time for grassroot/remote organisat ions to provide their responses, allowing for more open responses for those organisations and focusing only on questions and case studies not already covered by the endline reviews to a void duplications. A more detailed analysis of each of the endline reviews and methodological decisions taken as a response to the review of those documents is included in Annex G . Furthermore, t he Evaluation Criteria is described in detail in Annex A (and it is based on the ToRs shared by the Netherlands MFA), and Gender -specific Ethical Considerations are explained in detail in Annex B. Approach to the Evaluation To achieve its objectives, the evaluation was segmented into four distinct phases, described below. Phase 1: Inception phase This phase include d a pre -assessment of the documents available for the meta -evaluation and initial conversations with the four LFs. The pre -assessment of the documents included a review of the methodological tools used in previous evaluations, the evaluation questions used, and the recommendations provided specifically by the MTR which are reviewed in detail in the Effectiveness section. As mentioned above, an in-detail review of the information available across all four en d line reviews is included in Annex G. These documents and conversations informed the development of a full methodological proposal for data collection and analysis. Additional documents obtained during engagements with the relevant institutions were revie wed as they were accessed and were used to triangulate data from the field. Phase 2: Data collection Given the dynamic situation with the COVID -19 pandemic and the number of locations that are part of the LFS programme, the evaluation team did not travel to project locations. To ensure efficiency and VfM, and that existing challenges did not undermine the data collection process and the quality of the data to be collected, the team of four experts divided the workload across the four LFs, with a co -lead identified for every area. This division of work guaranteed permanent support and a more substantive pro cess of data collection. Tools are described in the next section and available in Annex C. Phase 3: Analysis All qualitative data collected was entered (anonymised) into a central database. The database collected 5 End line revi ews were part of the requirements for the closure of the LFS I programme in December 2020. Most were done only months before this end line review. An analysis of information already available from the end line reviews was also done, to avoid duplications a nd research tiredness from the stakeholders. See also section on Challenges and Limitations. 5 information for each of the evaluation questions /criteria, as given in each of the interviews, to allow cross - comparison across all responses and. thus ensure that information was triangulated and gaps in the information were detected. This database is provided (anonymized) to the MF A, as supporting information but not shared publicly . Once the reception of responses to the surveys was completed, the information provided was also compared . The Evaluation team has ensured that each of the questions includes both information from the qu antitative data collected in the surveys and qualitative data collected in interviews and case studies/ virtual visits. Data consolidation was done in real -time (i.e., daily or weekly), so that analysis, triangulation, and identification of information gaps could be done continuously throughout the evaluation and not just at the end of the data collection phase. The team met regularly and discussed the collected data, findings, and information gaps, and they responded timely and flexibly during the evaluatio n (e.g., in case of missing or conflicting findings). Constant data -analysis also allowed to identify trends and better examine preliminary conclusions, lessons, and recommendations. Phase 4: Reporting and validation The draft report was provided to the M FA on 26 October 2021, with a validation workshop conducted on 7 October 2021. Tools and samplings Remote Key Stakeholder Open Conversations were conducted with grantees, external organisations6, the LFs, members of the Netherlands' MFA, and beneficiaries . A full breakdown of the targets and numbers achieved is available in Annex D and below. Seventy -one (71) interviews with grassroots, intermediate and large grantees were conducted; the selection criteria of the grantees includ ed: Proportionality in the number of grantees across the four LFs, with the aim of conducting more interviews for those Funds with a higher number of grantees. Within each of the samples select ed per LF, the following criteria were used: o Proportionality in the geographic distribution, within each of the lead funds and across them. o Proportionality regarding grants size (groups differed across the four lead funds). o Proportionality regarding the t hematic focus of the grant. o Intersectional attention to the sample of grantees interviewed.7 Per each LF, we included grantees that lost the funding or did not implement in full. Twenty -five (25) Interviews with external stakeholders were held, including: Representatives from the lead LFs AWDF, FMS, FIMI and WFA. Relevant members of the Taskforce Women's Rights and Gender Equality (TFVG), and Embassies of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Other donors and experts supporting the LFS. 6 Including organisations that supported the LFs, opposed initially their selection, and former external evaluators. 7 The rationale behind these criteria is in line with our intersectional feminist approach in the sense that it recognises that women are not a homogenous social group. There are indeed women who endure intersecting forms of discrimination which go beyond gender -based discrimination and include dis crimination based on race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, disability status, migrancy/displacement, to name but a few. Afro descendant, LBTQ, or women from so called minority groups (such as Dalit communities) were privileged during selection, as an e xample. 6 Nongovernmental organisations ( NGOs )/regional networks that have partnered with the LFs (some initially opposing their selection) . Advisors/researchers who have partnered/interacted with the activities of Leading from the South. An online survey was conducted targeting all grantees, with the aim of having at least 193 (70%) of the grante es responding to the survey. A total of 184 (65%) grantees completed the survey, reaching a 95% confidence level, and 4,28% confidence interval, thus achieving sufficient statistical significance. The survey results helped provide quantitative data that fu rther enriched the analysis in the report and guided the interview process. Surveys were translated to Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and French, and delivered through Google Forms. Answers to doubts from the respondents were provided via email or phone when needed (5 cases), but no direct support was given when responding to the survey to maintain independence in the responses. At the request of the FIMI/AYNI FUND, two open questions were added at the end of the Survey (questions #15 and #16). One of the building blocks of intersectional transformative development (policies and practices) is the recognition and revalorisation of discredited knowledge. In the case of indigenous women, their traditional knowledge and spirituality are key elements of their sense of empowerment8, both as women and as people. Th us, two questions requested by FIMI that the Team added to the survey respond to a claim for collecting data on the role of indige nous women's knowledge and spirituality to achieve results at any of the three levels outlined by the common LFS indicators. Consistent with its intersectional approach, the LFS created the space required for this reclaiming. In doing so, it has facilitate d the repositioning of indigenous women as knowledge -bearers. In transformative pathways of change, this can be considered an act of agency (power over dominant systems of belief and knowledge) .9 Case studies and (digital) visits with LFS grantees: The th ematic area of the case studies and the implementing grantees were selected with the collaboration of the lead women's fund partners. The f ocus was on cases that had not been documented in previous evaluations/reports. The data collection for these case st udies was done using innovative methods, including digital attendance to events being planned by the partners, and video/photographic or audio testimonies from beneficiaries and local partners (including institutional/government partners) working with the organisations. For the efficiency criteria, which assessed VfM and results -based budgeting (RBB), a more in-depth documentary analysis of a sample of 42 grant budgets was used as the basis for the analysis (at least 10 per LF), using the surveys and KIIs to validate the findings. The selection of these budgets was done using the same criteria as for the KIIs with grantees. The summary of the samples achieved, and targets are given below, with a full description of the sample in Annex D and the stakeholders in Annex E. 8 In the scope of this evaluation report, by empowerment we mean a process of becoming aware of the unequal power relations affecting equal access to rights, assets and decision -making for all women in their rich diversity. 9 Cf. \"Indigenous People's Traditional Knowledge Must Be Preserved, Valued Globally, Speakers Stress as Permanent Forum Opens Annual Session,\" https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/hr5431.doc.htm 7 Type of Stakeholder # Grantees10 Target # surveys Actual # surveys Target # budgets Actual # budgets Target # KIIs/conv Actual # KIIS11 Grantees AWDF 103 72 63 10 10 19-21 18 Grantees FMS 47 33 37 10 11 16-17 19 Grantees FIMI 89 62 52 10 10 18-20 18 Grantees WFA 42 29 N.A. 8 17 Totals 197 184 40 42 85-91 97 Case Studies/Virtual Visits Virtual visits to grantees ( 4), case studies (covering experiences of 5 organisations) and consul tations with the beneficiaries were consolidated within one tool to avoid research tiredness . 1.4 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH AND MITIGATIONS MEASURES Limitation Mitigation Measure and Impacts on the research Number of cases and status of the COVID -19 lockdown did allow for direct interviews of stakeholders. Given the existing regulations and quarantine limitations in most co untries as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, and the risk of bringing new variants of the virus to local communities which are likely not vaccinated and at high risk, it was decided that the evaluation be conducted remotely. The evaluation seriously takes into consideration the principle of 'Do no Harm' and as such, the safety and security of both the evaluation team and the communities to be visited was treated as paramount; as a result, all primary data collection was done online. Lack of internet and electricity in some of the targeted locations limits the reach of the tools. In accordance with Ethical Considerations (Annex B), and given the current context, the evaluation team used a variety of mechanisms (Google Forms, Zoom, What sApp, Signal, Proton Mail) to receive responses from beneficiaries, to engage with respondents and collect the required data. The team and the MFA provided a window of four weeks to allow survey and KII responses and allowed responses to also be given via voice messages, emails, or telephonic calls. Time limitation s and/or unrealistic timeframes do not allow for all relevant stakeholders to be consulted, creating gaps in the analysis. Due to challenges related to accessing and interviewing respondents and LFs, the evaluation team requested for an additional two weeks from the MFA, to ensure that the team collect the required data and draft the report. This was granted by the MFA. Yet the coincidence with specific events by the LFs such as the Second Global Conference of Indigenous Women organised by FIMI, and the review process of Grants selected for LFSII limited the ability of some of the Funds to reply immediately to the questions and requests of the evaluation team. Furthermor e, the participatory process of discussion/open conversations that were meant to be done with the grantees was not possible in all cases, as several grantees were too busy to provide more than 30 minutes of their time. The number of questions in all data c ollections tools was kept low to ensure relevance and avoid duplication , and time to be taken was agreed with each interviewee. As described in footnote #9, some grantees replied too late and survey targets were not met (KIIs targets were), but still reach ed statistical significance. Difficulties in reaching remote and isolated communities, which are needed to have the stories from the most isolated communities. The sample selection ensured that at least 20% of the sample included hard to reach organisati ons. Furthermore, for at least 15% of the grantees interviewed, the evaluation team identified groups of intended final beneficiaries to converse with and have a better view of their needs and observations. Given the time limitations described above, the b eneficiary group conversations were combined, when possible, with virtual visits (in at least four cases) and served to inform case studies. When facing difficulties, the team engaged the four LFs and solicited their support in reaching organisations in r emote and isolated communities and to have their views on how they normally engage institutions and other stakeholders in those communities, following their best practices. This allowed for 17 of the 20 remote organisations initially selected for in -depth interviews to be contacted, with the three remaining being replaced with other three organisations also in remote locations. The three missing organisations were located in Myanmar, border areas of Pakistan/Afghanistan and Ethiopia , 10 Grantees who received two grants or more (including those receiving grants from two different LFs) were counted only once. 11 Three FIMI, AWDF and WFA (one each) grantee s replied after the closure of surveys and KIIs, saying they had time for KIIs and surveys. Unfortunately, this was done 2 days after the evaluation draft was produced and being analysed. 12 This include d other NGOs/CSOs, government actors/institutions, and supporting organisations/donors. 8 Limitation Mitigation Measure and Impacts on the research whose contexts might explain the problems in being reached. These were replaced with organisations in rural areas of the Philippines , border areas of Thailand/Myanmar and Uganda. Research fatigue from the LFs and grantees, because of several internal and external assessments being done over the last two years. The methodological approach adopted by the team offered both surveys and KIIs that focused only on areas/questions either not covered by previous assessments, or where more information could add valu e. Within each tool and at the start of each KII, a text explaining the specific objective of this evaluation and how it differed from previous ones was included . Also, as there was some consistency in the level of information available for outcome/results , data collected during the evaluation was only used to verify the results from the end line reviews. Mitigation was not satisfactory for all participants, some of whom recommended that for future evaluations, the ToRs were shared with the LFs in advance t o guarantee that these reviews provided all required information for the portfolio level evaluations. Possibility for bias in the information, as opposing stakeholders cannot be considered. In the inception report, we reviewed possible stakeholders that could present an opposing or more critical view and had a discussion about what was feasible or not. For this reason, we included members of the Netherlands Diplomatic Missions (which were not included in the decision making process for reasons mentioned above), regional organisations which were initial \"competitors\" to the four selected LFs (some of them now supporting the process), former evaluators who had the chance to visit some of the projects in the ground, grantees who lost their f unding or did not get funding in the next cycles, and in case studies members of local governments and local communities which were not initially supported of the process. Further, t rying to interview local national governments specifically opposing the pr oject was not seen adequate as it could jeopardize the security of the grantees and the actual delivery of some of the projects. The same applied to organisations that normally oppose the work of WRO (conservative or religious organisations. 9 2. FINDINGS 2.1 RELEVANCE To what extent did LFS respond to the identified gap in direct funding support to southern women's rights organisations? Finding #1: The LFS was highly relevant and designed to respond to the needs and aspirations of the beneficiaries in a n inclusive and participatory way, and increased the capacity of the grantees to identify, prioritise and better measure key priorities. From the conversations with the four Women's Funds, the grantees, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders, it was concluded that the programme was highly relevant and was designed to respond to the needs and aspirations of the beneficiaries. As indicated in the introduction , its origin stems from dialogues facilitated by Prospera and organisations that were not included in the second phase of the FLOW programme financed by the MFA. Thus, the programme was developed with the aim of giving the organisations ano ther opportunity to receive support to further build on initiatives that they were already undertaking. The LFS was based on the Dialogue and Dissent Policy Framework.13 Consequently, it was focused on strengthening the lobbying and advocacy capacity of S outhern women, yet with a key difference - decision -making and particularly the identification of priorities was to be owned and led by the grantees . The programme responded to the needs of the movements by having the LFs work with the grantee s to identify their needs, determine their local priorities, build their capacity, and provide them with the resources to undertake them. The design of the programme is also linked to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially goals 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities). References to the goals were made in the ToCs of the respective funds, and the project documents and implementation approach of the grantees. This approach further strengthened the relevance of the LFS project, as t he funds identified key areas of gender and other forms of intersecting inequalities that undermined the agency, rights, and ability of women to adequately respond to challenges they contend with daily and at different levels of society. For example, each LF identified three to five thematic areas of focus, which in general were consistent with each other, but highlighted contextual differences,14 and within which the grantees found sufficient flexibility to adapt to specific needs.15 Proposals sent in by potential grantees went through rigorous scrutiny processes to ensure that they were highly relevant to the ToC of the respective funds, and that they also had a women -centric approach to promoting the envisaged transformation in their societies. Even afte r the selection process, LFs and the grantees took time to discuss and strengthen their indicators and budgets to better respond to the key needs and priorities identified within the proposals, but this was never seen as an imposition, rather 13 It is important to note that the Dialogue and Dissent Policy builds on the 'A World to Gain' policy document published in April 2013 and its elaboration in the letter to parliament on 9 October 2013. 14 For example, all focused on issues of Autonomy, Decisions and Sexual Rights (some with specific focus on Access to Justice), Environmental Justice and Climate Change (in some cases with a focus on Land and Territory), Economic Justice, Movement and Labo ur rights, and Leadership and Strengthening Feminist Voices. Additionally, FIMI had a specific category focusing on institutional strengthening, which in the other funds was part the support given to all grantees. 15 However, some partners requested more cla rity regarding the possibility to fund new arising priorities such as mental health and protection against online harassment and cyber -security threats. 10 a conversatio n aiming to offer better support. According to the surveys, 91% of the organisations indicated that the LFS provided either adequate or sufficient support and only 8% indicated that support was only partly provided. However, a significant number of grantee s from FIMI (16%) observed that their gaps and needs were only covered partly. This could be perhaps explained by the fact that many of FIMI's grantees interviewed expressed that a one -year timeframe and funding was too short to demonstrate results at the outcome level, especially in areas where shifts have occurred (political backlash, climate change hazards, political/electoral and ethnic conflict). Some grantees from grassroots organisations stated that they need support to further develop tools to repor t on results and to comply with donor requirements, as grassroots women are often not familiar with the tools and the terminology used by the MFA. Figure 2 Responsiveness to gaps and priorities from the LFS by LF, according to t he survey responses Finding #2: The LFs provided flexibility to the grantees to identify their own prio rities and even provided flexibility in areas such as capacity building. Further analysis of the graphs above and data from organisations interviewed suggests that grantees had the flexibility to determine the thematic areas they would like to work on, which generally fell into their domain of expertise, as well as challenge(s) that they wanted to address at the local, national, regional, or international level. Grantees and LFs also mentioned that the implementation modalities put in place were appropriate, including the choice of the funds, the specialisations of the funds, th e approach of the implementation of the project, the flexibility to adapt Fund level ToCs and indicators, and the intersectional approach that was used to maximise the benefits of the project for the targeted beneficiaries. This provides a clear indication that the programme was carefully thought through at the design stage, to ensure fluidity and responsiveness. A quote that in our view exemplifies the feelings of many of the grantees, was a statement by a grantee in Asia: \" LFS and WFA are one of the most non-interfering donors that we have worked with. Instead of asking to modify priorities, they helped better consolidate our indicators and action plans. The programme helped us to address a vital gap of creating understanding around structural factors for the lack of prevention and redressal of violence against women with disabilities\" (KII, 26 Aug 2021). 11 Were there contextual changes during the implementation of the programme? Finding #3: COVID -19 was mentioned as a key disruptor of delivery. Other disr uptors mentioned were climate hazards, political turmoil, and increasing closure of civic society spaces. All these affected project implementations before and during the pandemic . Figure 3 Changes in regional/general priorities during implementation, according to survey responses The survey asked grantees whether there were changes in the regional/general priorities of organisations during project implementation. A large majority, 56% (and mainly those having Grants covering 2020) indicated that they did.16 These responses were consistent across all funds, yet grantees from WFA mentioned having additional changes and adaptations. Consistently, interviews with WFA's grantees mentioned that im plementation of the project's activities had been affected by the COVID -19 pandemic, political changes or climate hazards more consistently. Changes were attributed to a wide range of issues, with the most important being the need to include new areas of work (34%), changes in the tools and modalities used to replace face -to-face activities (move to virtuality) (33%), and changes in budget allocation because of the COVID -19 pandemic (15%). It can be seen from the two graphs below that the bulk of the changes were attributed to the COVID -19 pandemic, with results largely consistent across grantees from all four LFs. 16 41% indicated \"No\" and 3% indicated \"Don't Know\".

Finding #4: The LFs offered sufficient flexibility and support in the process of adapting to changes, even considering the specific limitations of the LFS in terms of timeframes and/or the provis ion of emergency aid support. In response to COVID -19, consistent evidence of LF programmes and grants taking the initiative to adapt and respond to the changing needs of the grantees and their beneficiaries was observed . From the above, and the qualitativ e information from interviews, it was also deduced that the general objectives of the projects were maintained, but changes were allowed in terms of the timeframes and mechanisms/tools/outputs to obtain them.17 The MFA worked with the LFs during this perio d to ensure that the changes in context and the adaptations made do not undermine the objectives of the programme. As an AWDF grantee recounted: \"We tried hard to ensure that we keep to the objectives of the project, but it was certain that we were going t o change most of the initial plans in our project document, if we were to continue engaging the government and getting them to understand the needs of women and girls and how they can better approach and support them. We could not give up because of the CO VID, we rather had to adjust and keep on engaging the government and their partners using virtual means to meet, train them and undertake lobbying and advocacy activities. We knew it was not going to be easy, but we had to remain responsive.\" (KII, 1 Sep 2 021) Furthermore, most grantees mentioned feeling adequately supported through regular engagements with the LFs that responded to their questions and provided clarification on adapting their projects to the COVID -19 context . Th guarantees were also to prov ide them with the capacity required to embark on virtual engagements with partners . As shown in the chart below, 58% of the organisations indicated that they were requested for feedback routinely in relation to new priorities; 24% indicated that new priorities were discussed in quarterly/routine meetings and taken into consideration; 14 % indicated that while this was done using means such as bi -lateral discussions with the Funds, engagements on the priorities could be adapted to the changing contexts, etc. Only a 4% indicated that they were either not requested for feedback or decisions were made without consulting them. Figure 5 Ways in which Funds ensured that priorities were included by LF according to surveys 17 Similar findings at the budget level are described in the Efficiency del Sur (FMS)International Indigenous Women's Forum (FIMI) / AYNI Fund (AYNI)Women's Fund Asia (WFA)How did the programme ensure that new priorities were included or taken into consideration? We were not requested for feedback Decisions on adaptations were taken without asking us Other In quarterly/routinely meetings We were requested for feedback routinelyN=15713 During interviews with some of the grantees who answered the Google survey, evaluators asked them about the reasons for such a response. Some mentioned that certain decisions had been taken by the Funds (or donor) without consulting them. Some examples mentioned were: decision on final timeframes (inability to extend grants after December 2020) or what could and could not be funded as a response to COVID -19 (particularly lack of flexibility for the inclusion of emergency aid support). These decisions were made by the MFA and from engagements with the MFA, it was deduced that they wanted to end the LFS I within the stated timelines and commence the process of the LFS II. This has been a consistent complaint across all sections of this report. As mentioned by an AWDF grantee organisation \" We could have done much more if we were granted a no -cost extension. We could have used the resources to strengthen programming and embark on virtual means, alongside other COVID -19 measures to respond to the needs of our beneficiaries \" (KII, 6 Sep 2020). Other grantees mentioned that this inflexibility was \" putting activis t in peril, and activists in a difficult situation of choosing to find livelihoods that would allow them to survive or continue the fight \" (KII, 27 Aug 2021). Explanations of why these extensions were not provided by the MFA are added in Finding #12. Furth ermore, COVID -19 was the only crisis being experienced by the grantees in 2020. At the same time, a large part of the organisations interviewed (and corresponding to comments in all four ending reviews) experienced a substantial shrink in civil society spa ce, heightened by the arrival of new, more right -wing governments, who used the COVID -19 pandemic as an opportunity to crack down on feminist organisations. Despite the difficult operating environment, 95% of the respondents indicated that the adaptations and flexibility offered during programme implementation were sufficient, with levels of satisfaction largely consistent across LFs. Grantees in Southeast Asia mentioned that: \" they (WFA) were very understanding and genuinely care about their situation and that of their communities. Changes and funding support were provided always immediately, even in some cases within hours. When we had doubts, we were listened to, and when we did not have solutions, they shared good practices from others or brainstorm with us\" (KII, 8 Sept 2021). Figure 6 Level of satisfaction with the adaptations and flexibility offered by LF according to the surveys Furthermore, the grantees lauded the efforts of the LFs, who, when facing the specific limitations of LFS (in terms of the inability to provide emergency aid support or extend the timeframes of implementation) set their own funding mechanisms (with support from other donors and not the Government of the 14 Netherlands ) or provided information t o other sources of funding) that were specific for COVID -19 relief.18 In conclusion, the programme was highly relevant and was also well designed with the aim of ensuring that it responded to the needs and priorities of the grantees. 2.2 COHERENCE What was the added value of the collaboration between the four Leading from the South women's funds and between the four women's funds and the MFA? Finding #5: The way in which coordination and dialogue were promoted between the MFA and LFs, helped to open the door for a more horizontal and trustworthy relation between donors and WROs in the Global South. All four end line reviews highlighted the relationship between the MFA and LFs as a strategic partnership beyond the regular parameters of donor/ grantee. One of the LFs described the relationship \"as a partnership based on trust and transparency, with permanent search for consensus and dialogue\" (KII, 8 Sep 2021). Two specific operative elements helped to strengthen the partnership. The first was the designation among the Consortium members, of a focal point each year for communications with the MFA (FMS End line Review, 2021). The second was \"having resources assigned for simultaneous interpretation during t he Linking and Learning meetings, and at the work meetings held with the organisations. This made communication between the four LFs easier and contributed to generating spaces for dialogue on an equal footing and reducing the imbalances existing between r egions as well as the barriers created by the dominant languages\" (FIMI End line Review, 2021). The relationship also added value by strengthening the feminist and indigenous women's movements through advocacy with other donors. The LFS model of horizontal ity, trust, and delegation of the decision - making to WROs in the Global South is being used as a model to initiate dialogue and new funding streams from other bilateral partners , such as the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs or Swedish SIDA or Globa l Affairs Canada (GAC). This being a demonstration of how unique the LFS has been and how it is opening doors for new streaming funds based on decisions from the South and for the South. Furthermore, some of the participants in the LFS Fund are also partne rs with the Dutch government in other initiatives of Dialogue and Dissent. For example, FMS participates in GAGGA via FCAM and Asia Women Fund ( WFA ) via Mama Cash, AWDF is involved in the SRHR partnership via the Global Fund for Women, and these operate wi th a different premise, closer to that of a partnership relationship (WFA End line review, 2020). Other specific examples are provided in Annex F . Finding #6: The LFS increased coordination across the LFs, particularly around the prioritisation, selection and monitoring, evaluation and lea rning (MEL) processes. One of the initial results of the LFS was the geographical expansion of the four LFs.19 This expansion, and mainly FIMI's global reach meant that coordination was needed within the grantee selection process, to avoid duplications or confusion amongst the grantees. For this purpose, \"a common language was 18 Grantees of the WFA mention ed Kaagapay, a special pool fund created to respond specifically to the COVID -19 crisis, and which allowed greater flexibility to adapt to those changing circumstances. 19 The FMS expanded to the Andean region, Central America, and the Caribbean, the AWDF increased their reach into African francophone countries and Middle East states; the WFA changed from the South Asia Women fund into a regional fund including Southeast and Central Asia; and FIMI, already a global fund, committed to expanding its outreach i n Africa and in Asia. 15 developed and used in each of the calls for proposals as distributed by all the four women's funds \" (LFS Evaluation of the First Call for proposals, 2017). In general, evidence from documentary review and interviews with grantees and LFs demonstrates that both the first and second call were well coordinated amongst the four LFs. This included coherence in the requirements for the grants, the guideline s for the distribution of the funds, and even within the thematic areas, despite the names being slightly different to help recognise specific contextual issues. The MFA Grants framework also promoted stronger coordination in the selection process, as it i ncluded the possibility of supporting organisations and movements that were active in more than one region. Evidence was found of coordinated efforts to fund complementary grants from various organisations across all regions. According to one of the grante es, this \" offered us the opportunity to have a strong financial, monitoring and technical assistance from FMS, as well as continuing support from FIMI in regard to communications and construction of our indigenous identity. \" It also allowed them to build \" networks outside our usual set up and discover that women, particularly within the afro descendent communities, shared the struggles in terms of lack or representation and discrimination \" (KII, 6 Sep 2021). Stronger coordination was also achieved i n MEL. Testimonies from external experts and the LFs revealed that the four organisations developed, adapted and/or standardised and systematised procedures and processes: \" Practice has allowed to learn from each other, how to do the work, how to engage in supporting movements and organisations in ways which are not bureaucratic and understanding how to do things more efficiently. Supporting each other has enabled them to grow from their strength points, from FMS technical MEL expertise, AWDF and WFA politi cal advocacy and outreach experience, and FIMI global reach and thematic knowledg e\" (31 August 2018). More on this is available in Finding #22. Finally , the LFS also allowed for interregional coordination with other regional WROs (some of them initially c ompeting in the selection process of the LFs). A good example was the Advisory Council of LFS for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) created in 2018. The role of this Advisory Council - integrated by the Executive Directors of FCAM, FAU, Fundo Elas and FMS Board members - was to provide accompaniment and strategic advice during the implementation of LFS by the FMS. We interviewed many of their members who expressed this mechanism was key to consolidate a more regional outlook in the work of the LFS in Lat in America and reduce potential frictions. Finding #7: Areas for improvement exist in relation to the timeframe and resources allocated for the LFs to consolidate their relationship as a consortium, and lack of coordination with diplomatic missions. The LFs and external supporters mentioned two clear limitations in the coordination process. On one hand, the organisations had a limited overhead percentage (15%) to respond to the contractual obligations (including the expansion of their g eographical coverag e, accompany and monitor projects, ensure financial transactions to all organisations despite the increasing g overnmental limitations and transaction costs) , develop their institutional and geographical growth , develop their political and advocacy strategy and ensure coordination across their own regions and themselves . The Funds were mainly supported by Mama Cash, Prospera , Philanthropy Advancing Women's Rights ( PAWHR ) and other organisations, in areas of common work such as communications and branding, re porting, or monitoring and evaluation, through the Accompaniment Initiative. This Initiative will not be available for the second phase of the LFS, which creates a potential gap within the next five years. On the other hand, LFs and external organisations mentioned the timeframe of the contracts as a key limitation, even more than budgets: \" the opportunity that the LFS has provided cannot be fully consolidated. The day -to-day requirements are overwhelming. This leaves them overstretched and does 16 not give time to think collectively \" (KIII 7 September 2021). The issue of the timeframe planned a nd the time it takes to implement activities, including monitoring and reporting on tangible results, was a recurrent issue during interviews and has been repeatedly mentioned across different sections of the report. This issue seems to have been discussed for the LFS II, as a larger timeframe for implementation has been given (5 years) . Finally, Dutch Embassies interviewed during the data collection process, stated that they had not been fully integrated into the activities of the programme and found this a fundamental gap of the programme . During the interview with the MFA T askforce , they explained that the lack of involvement of the Embassies was purposely done as part of the design of the project. The main reasons being: 1) the lack of sufficient staff in diplomatic missions to manage the funds (already mentioned in the introduction), 2) the specific intention of the programme to give decision making to organisations from the South for decisions incumbent to the South, 3) the potential difficulties of in volving all relevant diplomatic missions into the planning processes, which could have required longer discussions, delays and again going against the main objective of allowing the programme to \"be lead from the South\". Yet the missions interviewed point ed that not knowing or being more involved programme and its activities also entail ed the risk of duplication of efforts and undermines complementarity. On the other side the LFs mentioned specific examples in which they have directly reached out to some o f the Embassies, in some cases not obtaining responses, but in others having a very productive relation (Ghana and Peru were given as specific examples). Both the embassies and the LFs signalled th at this is an area where MFA Task force could lead future ef forts to ensure clarity and coordination . Thus, a first step in the process of involving the Embassies into the process without risking going against the main purpose of the programme, is to use this evaluation to introduce the most relevant Embassies to t he work of the LFS , the benefits of giving decision making power to organisations from the South and exploring specific mechanisms or areas in which the Embassies could be kept involved to avoid the potential risks . Finding #8: The LFS promoted greater coo rdination and linkages amongst the grantees and facilitated the sharing of best practices. There was strong evidence of collaboration between women organisations, highlighting networks that were built through the LFS. According to the survey responses, mor e than two -thirds of the respondents (71%) expressed knowing other grantees, with 39% saying that they had also cooperated with new partners. Cooperation seemed to be stronger in some regions than in others. Organisations in Latin America showed a stronger disposition for collaboration (58%). This could be explained by the benefits of largely sharing a common language and significant history of joint political activism across the region, underlined by the consolidation of specific cross -country initiatives like Elas Pretas.20 The primary strategy employed by the LFS programme to facilitate alliance -building among women's and trans -rights activists, organisations and movements w ere organising regional convenings for Linking and Learning (L&L) (WFA End line Review, 2020). These regional convenings were organised once a year by each LF (so 16 in total) , and as mentioned before, includ ing a joint meeting between FIMI and FMS 20 The Elas Pretas project was an initiative designed and executed by seven afro descendant women organisations in Latin America that started to articulate within the framework of LFS. These included Mamkumba/Colombia, Coletivo Nega/Br Nordeste/Brazil, EMUDE/Dominican Republic, and Neges Kreyol/Haiti. They joined efforts in a common project to: foster the articulations of black women participating in LFS in LAC, strengthen the Network of Black Women from Latin American and Caribbean (ELLAS CUIDAM) and create advocacy content and spaces for dissemination (FMS Annual Narrative Progress Report 2020). 17 grantees in 2017. The convenings were designed to be inclusive, accessib le and to support the active participation of grassroots and community -based groups as well as persons with disabilities. Modalities included the provision of multiple language translations, including sign language, and live transcriptions. Most grantees i nterviewed said that they found these coordination spaces useful, particularly in terms of learning from others and getting inspiration. \" It was a learning opportunity, to understand the needs and priorities from other countries, and specifically the issue s on women and girls' rights in other contexts, and how to do common advocacy but respecting different agendas\" (KII, 26 August 2021)\". Figure 7 Percentage of grantees cooperating with others across LFs, according to the survey responses External partners and donors who attended the encounters also found these spaces extremely useful. As described by one of them, these spaces helped to \" bring larger organisations in contact with grassroots, shifted power dynamics and was a great mechanism to disrupt the process of concentration of power amongst a few voices, and democrati sing the context \". We had \" more intentional bringing in of marginalised voices . More discussion about the collective and individual rights, and additional convers ations about how to bring the issues of discrimination, colonisation and collective rights into the table \" (KII, 31 August 2021). Alongside the regional meetings , the LFs supported or were planning21 to support the participation of grantees/activists in existing regional thematic spaces, and/or offer funding to support exchange programmes between those wishing to do so. In Latin America, 50 grantees participated in 25 exchange programmes. Significant results were the Elas Pretas project or assisting existing networks (Red de Salud de las Mujeres Latino americanas y del Caribe - RSMLAC) to increase their reach. Grantees from FIMI, AWDF and WFA also stated that through the LFS, they could amplify their vo ices at the local, national, and international levels and position their proposals in key world summits (UN Climate Change, UN Population Summit, CSW CEDAW, BEIJING+25, UN Women Generation Equality). This information was verified in more detail in the endl ine reports and evidence provided in narrative grant reports. Finally, the LFs also supported consortium -built grants and the creation of new ones. According to the WFA end line reviews \" consortia grants supported organisations and networks to organise me etings, conferences, training and workshops, which can help to create new connections, build alliances, expand 21 This was temporarily postponed because of the pandemic. 18 networks, and incubate new collaborations both within feminist movements and between feminist and other movements. \" An example beyond Elas Pretas , already mentioned in this report , end line reviews for FIMI and WFA showed evidence of indigenous women partnering with LBTQI activists in Nepal, or sex workers rights' defenders working together with child rights activists in Thailand. Finding #9: Coor dination spaces brought increasing attention to intersectionalities across the feminist and indigenous agendas, and especially the need to pay specific attention to the needs and priorities of women with disabilities, African -descendent communities, and LB TQ persons. Having common grantees and areas of work also incentivised th e LFs to share spaces in regional coordination meetings22, and brought attention to intersectionalities in feminist and indigenous women's agendas. For example, these spaces allowed \" FIMI and its grantees to bring feminist and African - descendent perspectives into the work of indigenous organisations, while it has stretched FMS, AWDF and WFA efforts to support indigenous organisations and have new conversations on that area . Without FIM I as part of this process, indigenous organisations would not have that voice or space \" (KII, 7 Sep 2021). This intersectionality process also trickled down to the grantees, with various exchange opportunities between indigenous, afro descendent , LBTQ, ru ral and urban WROs. On this area, a beneficiary of the exchange programmes said that \" as well as finding out that their needs and fights are similar, I also learned to organise my advocacy efforts in a better and more conducive and holistic way, reflecting our own context and also the shared cosmogony of our people\" (KII, 5 Sep 2021). Grantees also expanded their activities to be more inclusive of the needs of women with disabilities, after having conversations with other organisations during the coordinati on meetings. A few of them started to offer sign -language translation in internal forums as a result. The intersectional approach of the LFS has also created a space for the voices of Trans women living with some form of disability in the Asian region, as evidenced by the Convening organised by the WFA in 2020.23 Finding #10: The effectiveness of L&L spaces as coordination tools were thwarted by COVID -19, the unavailability of time and incentives to continue the relationships built and having to o many participants.24 Despite their usefulness, there is room for improvement across the L&L spaces. According to the interviews, the regional meetings were too short and too full of content/activities to really allow for the creation of sustainable relat ions. Furthermore, many grantees said they did not meet or talk again because they were busy with their own agendas and projects or had no common project to continue to build relations with. They added that the COVID -19 pandemic restricted the effectivenes s of those spaces. Virtual meetings were seen as a \"more difficult environment to build relationships\", both because it was difficult to \"have side -line discussions\" or \"meet for a coffee/lunch afterwards.\"25 As mentioned by one of FIMI's grantees, \" If CO VID had not hit, we would have invited other women's organisations from other countries to visit our project and our gardens and share with them our 22 For ex ample, FMS and FIMI shared their first grantee coordination meeting in Lima in 2017. 23 Cf. Disability Rights Convening Report, 6 -8 February 2020, Colombo, Sri Lanka. 24 A specific Case Study on L&L is available in Case Study #5. 25 Yet we saw evidence of mo re meetings happening and were possible thanks to the new technologies that took foot during the pandemic. We received specific examples of organisations that grew because of taking advantage of these new technologies (Case Study #4). 19 conservation practices. We would have been able to empower ourselves across boundaries \" (KII, Sep 9, 2021). Possibly because of the above, not much evidence of networks being built across geographical regions was found . In response to this, several grantees recommended that these events be included in a more systematic way of working together that is not neces sarily limited to the duration of a specific grant. This included requests to do more regular thematically focused meetings with smaller groups (face to face or virtually), continuing or expanding the funding for exchange programmes or thematic workshops implemented by grantees (including support during the proposal making process by larger and more experienced organisations), piloting exchanges across geographical regions, and recognizing that \"collaborations and relations are not built -in hours or days, b ut in months and years of common work and around concrete projects and aims \" (KII, 24 August 2021) 2.3 EFFICIENCY To what extent has LFS implemented the interventions it intended? Finding #11: The financial and narrative documents analysed provide evidence that despite COVID -19 being a big obstacle to implement all project activities, a great majority of grants and the LF action plans and budgets were implemented according to initial budgets and objectives , with adaptations being done only i n terms of how these outputs /outcomes were achieved . Financial reports of the LF budgets show implementation rates between 97% to 100%. In all cases, grant - making showed the highest levels of implementation (between 95% and 99%). This was not due to all grants being implemented in full26 but rather because of an active effort on the p art of the LFs to either adapt individual grants when necessary or to manage underspending and/or creating new funding streams.27 Lowest implementation rates were observed on networking and partnership, hiring of consultants and MEL. In all cases, lower sp ending in these areas was not related to poor planning or an excess in the initial budget allocation, but because of the COVID -19 pandemic. Restrictions imposed all around the world made it impossible to keep ahead with many of the grantees' planned activ ities. Since March 2020, the LFs had to postpone activities requiring international travel and given an initial uncertainty about the progress of the pandemic, adaptations took time. Yet by June 2020, all Funds had consolidated COVID -19 response plans whic h were specific to their region/context and had already reached out to each of their partners to inquire about the effects of the pandemic on their teams, organisation, delivery targets and budgets. The related changes were regarding how activities were d elivered rather than a change in the outputs or outcomes. Changes included technical support and budget to facilitate a transition into virtual spaces, finding new and creative ways to reach communities in remote areas, and the use of potential underspendi ng/savings to provide specific responses to COVID -19. These responses, in turn, varied depending on the context, but in general included livelihoods and emergency support, public health awareness campaigns and provision of hygiene kits/protective equipment . 26 Out of the sample o f budgets and/or action plans reviews, 96% (40 out of 42) were implemented in full. Grant databases and end line reports showed only seven projects which had to be closed or changed significantly. Reasons for these varied, but mo st commonly included change s in grantee management, a rupture in the relationship of consortia members, or inability to implement in some of the areas because of conflict or natural disasters. 27 For example: Pandemic response, on research and learning and/or fostering/supporting col laboration between grantees. 20 In many cases, some of the 'new' interventions brought in by COVID -19 were used to increase the geographical scope of some outputs, and even the number of said outputs. For example, in 15 of the 70 interviews with the grantees, examples of partners open ing hotlines for counselling and legal aid or using existing online platforms to offer new resources for victims and potential victims (mapping of legal and psychosocial counselling services) were mentioned . This was all in response to an increase in viole nce against women and vulnerable groups of populations during the pandemic. Some key examples are provided in Case Study #4. Finding #12: Time limitations, rather than budget limitations were seen as a more important issue for the delivery of the projects Despite most objectives being achieved, a big proportion of grantees surveyed (24%) mentioned not having achieved all project objectives on time. This was particularly the case for grantees from WFA (31%) and FIMI (27%), as shown in the graphic be low, and was consistent with what was found in interviews. External stakeholders close to the process referred to the mismatch between the short timeframe of grants and the long -lasting changes pursued by the LFS Programme. A WFA grantee even expressed tha t more than an issue with the budgets, their biggest implementation risk came from \" the reduced timeframes for work (...) Sometimes even with the same budget but having more time, we could achieve more and particularly be more sustainabl e\" (KII, 26 August 20 21). Figure 8 Project delivery against timeframes available, according to the surveys Even though extensions were granted, there was no flexibility from the MFA on the extension of grants beyond the end of the individual LFS I c ontracts (KII, 31 December 2020). As put by one of the grantees, \"at the beginning we felt understanding from the donor because we were all in the same situation. But as time went by, we were asked to adjust to this unattainable delivery time, and we felt quite anguished because we were very late. The first few months were very difficult and that put us under a lot of pressure. We requested for an extension in timelines which was not approved. Even though we did it, we would have appreciated it to understan d why an extension was not possible\" (KII, 24 August 2021). The MFA explained this was due to contractual limitations, but also to the fact that in order to launch the LFS Phase II, all grants associated to LFS I needed to finish in time. Further extension s could have limited the launch of the. new funding stream which could potentially be more adequate to re spond to the aftermath of the COVID -19 pandemic. Despite these justifications being reasonable, there seems that they were not sufficiently communicate d down to the grantees, or that not all grantees had the previous experience with bilateral donors to understand the processes and challenges that the extension might have implied. Furthermore, given how personal and large was the effect of COVID -19 on the grantees, 21 the possibility to relate to any justification was lowered, and thus lack of flexibility was an issue frequently mentioned as a challenge for delivery, and seen as a source of stress and anguish. To what extent was results -based budgeting applie d (budget and expenditure per output)? Finding #13: Results -based budgeting was used consistently for both the Grantees and LF budgets, and the level of detail in the budgets corresponded mainly to the size of the grants. All the 42 grantee budgets analysed used result -based budgeting, and the budgets were, in a large majority of the cases, consistent with the action plans and/or proposals sent. These findings are also supported by the end line reviews. Yet the level of detail in terms of activities and unit costs, varied across the different budgets , especially depending on the size of the budget.28 Smaller grants were allowed to provide less det ail, yet always maintained information across three minimum common areas: Human Resources, Administration Costs and Project Level Costs/Activities. Furthermore, for larger grants and in the case of the FIMI grants, whe re co-funding/co -investing was request ed and/or encouraged from the grantees , the budgets would discriminate where this funding was allocated . Finally, in those projects where activities specific to COVID -19 were added (either in terms of communication of public health messaging, provision of protective equipment or short -term cash support) , funding provided to these activities was put separately. For the Evaluators, the budget's template used by the FMS was particularly useful for the VfM analysis (covered in the next section). This template was in many cases easier to read, with unit costs being better identifiable and costs discriminated across five main categories, including Staff/Human Resources, Operational expenses, Communication, and visibility, Monitoring and Evaluation, Audit/Financia l Expenses, and Output specific activities.29 Trying to set up financial templates which were common across the LFs, yet adequate for the size of the grants, might be useful for the new phase of the Fund, as those partners who received funding from two of the LFs mentioned that they were confused at times with the different requirements. For example, a FIMI/FMS common grantee (interview) mentioned that FIMI's templates allowed them to have greater flexibility at the time of reporting, but the FMS financial templates forced them to think more strategically about how to distribute the resources and report specific invoices. As said by this grantee, \" despite a difficult initial adaptation to the FMS template, they were very flexible and we managed to adapt and use those same templates for proposals done to other donors, which required the same level of classification or detail \" (KII, 6 Sept 2021). In terms of implementation, results -based budgeting was not seen as a challenge, but neither as a key enabler for the grantees. In general, interviews revealed that most of the grantees are used to th is kind of budgeting. Yet for the LFs and those who evaluated/selected the grants in each of the funding cycles, it supported the process of linking budgets with intended outputs/ outcomes and facilitated the process of adapting the budgets to the new realities brought by COVID -19. 28 The guidelines for the distribution of funds normally followed these guidelines: \"small grassroots organisations no more than \u20ac50,000 per year per application, medium -sized organisations between \u20ac50,000 and \u20ac200,000 per year per application, large organisations between \u20ac200,000 and \u20ac500,000 per year per application\" Evaluation First Call for Proposals (2017). 29 Travel and Accommodation expenses were in some cases included within one of the others. 22 What were the significant factors affecting VfM during program implementation?30 Finding #14: Human resources, travel and accommodation and hiring of consultants/researchers/ trainers were the key cost drivers for grantees . As shown in the below graphic, staffing costs (average 22%), travel and accommodation (average 15%), and output specific costs (average 43%) were the larg est budget categories. Within the output specific costs31, the majority corresponded to expenses related to the payment of consultants/researchers/trainers for the implementation of specific outputs. When comparing costs across grantees per LF, an interest ing finding is that staffing and operational costs were significantly lower for FIMI, while at the same time FIMI's grantees showed the largest percentage for travel and accommodation and output -specific expenses. On the other hand, operational expenses we re larger for AWDF . Communications and visibility were also particularly important for FMS grantees, who reported the largest costs in this area. Finally, those who appear to have invested the most in MEL activities (particularly through external baselines and end lines) were WFA grantees. Figure 9 Key Cost Drivers by the size of the Grant The differences seen for the FIMI grantees could be explain ed by information from the KIIs. Indigenous organisations give particular importance to having spaces for communal decision making and advocacy which require additional travel and comms . Indigenous communities also tend to live far away from each other and/or geographical conditions required them to take on more expensive and di verse ways of travel, and/or to find accommodation and food, as return travel within the same day was not possible. Furthermore, indigenous grantees, despite not mentioning voluntary work, expressed that project work was seen as something that would benefi t the community and which in some cases would not require payment, which might explain lower staffing costs . 30 For this question, the agre ed methodology (as per the inception report) was the review of key costs driver and consolidation of initial possible benchmarks to allow comparison in future evaluations. For these all 42 grantee financial reports were classified against the same budget c ategories: Human Resources/Staffing, Operational expenses, Travel and Accommodation, Communication, and visibility, Monitoring and Evaluation, Output -specific, External audit, and COVID -19 specific added costs (when existing). Percentage participation of t hose budget lines against the total allocated budget was then compared. 31 Costs specifically related to the outputs . Costs such as human resources, MEL, audits or operational expenses were normally requested to be set separately within the budgets, in order to ensure that they would not surpass limits imposed. Yet, travel and accommodation and Comms/visibility costs we re sometimes included within output -specific costs, but for the purposes of this analysis were discriminated to allow for a better and common analysis. 23 In relation to FMS and WFA differences, d uring interviews , FMS grantees also mentioned the importance of communications and visibility and provided examples of the use of online tools and graphic design for their advocacy outputs. On the other side, many of the WFA grantees mentioned either expanding their work into new regions or needing to document changes in their environments, requiring them to c onduct additional baseline research. Also, within output specific expenses, costs of training, capacity building and income generation were mentioned consistently across the interviews as the largest unitary costs. Finally , the structure of the expenditure for AWDF , and particularly the large size of staffing costs, was explained by AWDF as a consequence of higher unit costs for salaries in the region, given the amount of funding provided already by other donors/agencies. This was consistent with the result s of the budget analysis which shows that on average staffing costs are 20 to 35% larger in Africa than in other regions. The Evaluation Team is not sure if the LFS programme can do something to affect this specific issue, as previous evaluations implement ed by this team have shown similar results and forcing AWDF to lower staffing costs can thus decrease the level of the staff working in the programmes. A specific discussion on the subject might be needed with AWDF to explore solutions if needed or just ac cepting it as it is. When comparing the average percentage against the size of the grants ( graphic in Annex H), the budget reviews show that smaller projects had higher staffing and output -specific costs in correspondence to their size, which is natural as , regardless of the size, all projects need a minimum number of people to manage them. Furthermore, many of the smaller projects were used for institutional strengthening, which in many cases directly involves additional staffing. This is particularly the case for AWDF , were despite providing the largest grants in relation to other LFs, they specifically allowed additional funding for institutional strengthening for smaller grassroot grants. Given the lack of a specific definition of VfM for this programme , it is difficult to assess whether the above is consistent with what was aimed. Yet, the overall cost structure shows that a majority of the funding is specifically related to output -specific budget lines, and that the other budget lines are all related t o the achievement of the specific outputs/outcomes set within the programme. Yet, some recommendations are provided above and in the recommendations section, for example whether travel costs can be diminished through virtual tools or staffing costs can be lowered in some regions. More below on the specific consequences of COVID -19 on the cost structure. Finding #15: Additional COVID -19 related costs only amounted on average to 2% of the total budgets, but the pandemic had strong effects on other individual budget lines. As mentioned above, COVID -19 had a strong effect on project implementation. Yet in terms of the key cost drivers, the differences were only a few (full graphic in Annex H). The first observation is that new specific activities rela ted to COVID -19 relief only accounted for 2% of the budgets, as seen below. A possible reason was the fact that the LFS had limitations on which expenses it could fund and which it could not . Given the existence of other specific funding provided by the MF A for COVID -19 specific support, the LFs were asked to avoid funding emergency aid support and limiting changes in budget towards these areas. As a response \"some grantee partners, and even LFs created their own emergency grant facilities and/or did locall y-based fundraising for relief efforts: 'we kept the office open and raised a small amount of donations to meet the immediate needs of women and girls experiencing violence, women living with disabilities, and queer persons in crisis' \" (WFA End line review ). Others concentrated instead on linking women's organisations and individual beneficiaries with government agencies providing emergency relief. Many examples of this are offered in the four end line reviews and the interviews. 24 COVID -19 also created an increase in the level of output -specific costs (with more activities needed to deliver the same outputs through virtual means or hiring local consultants to support direct work in the field) and slightly diminished travel and accommodation costs (a large de crease was not observed, as the unit costs for travel increased and local -travel budgets had to increase for local consultants to supplement the MEL/reporting roles done previously by project staff) . Many grantees also expressed that larger output -specific costs increased during the pandemic, as additional research and scoping was initially needed to understand how to respond to the changing environment and pressing needs. Grantees also had to set new relationships with companies or organisations that would enable them to connect to their grantees, with those organisations already offering online services due to a surge in requests; others said that new equipment and internet packages had to be purchased to continue their activities.32 Related to the above, the end line reviews found that much support was still \" needed for raising the technological capacity of women in the provinces/rural areas by allowing them access to online platforms to bridge the technological gap which has become even more stark during the COVID -19 pandemic (...). Alongside the equipment and training needed to operate online, grantee partners also need further capacity with regard to online security. COVID -19 has been used to justify increases in monitoring of organisations' work in variou s countries, and WHRDs need to know how to protect themselves \" (WFA end line review, 2021). This evaluation and the end line review have already helped to identify best practices and champions in this area (covered in Case Study #4), which can support the capacity building process. Additional funding and purposeful training and support in this area would help to reinforce best practices and ensure cross -learning. Finding #16: VfM might not be an adequate framework to measure feminist and indigen ous women's work, unless it allows measuring intangible costs. During the evaluation, the analysis of key costs drivers as a VfM method to evaluate efficiency was criticised by many of the LFs, external organisations and grantees. For example, a WFA grante e expressed \"funders always look for the VfM in the numbers and budgets, but they should be looking for VfM from the perspective of the communities, the amount of costs they have and are contributing and the fact that even if not easy to quantify they save costs\" (KII, 2 Sept 2021). External evaluators, advisors and LFs also said that VFM was not a framework that could easily adapt to feminist and intersectional work. On this perspective, \" sometimes it is devoid of an understanding of how human rights and c ontext works, of the fact that in order to achieve change you need time and longstanding effort that is not counted in a budget for one, two or even four years \" (KII, 7 Sept 2021). As seen from the above comments, the complaints were mainly about the focu s of VFM on economy, and cost -efficiency and the lack of proper definitions in the existing evaluation literature about the quantification of \"hidden costs\". For example, VFM might not offer the best option to count the effort that was put in before the pr oject, and which allowed results to come to fruition, to measure what was done during the project by the many volunteers or underpaid staff who offered more of their time that they needed to give and will not count the effort put in after the project to su stain the results. Therefore, the LFs and external organisations requested a constructive dialogue on this question to consolidate transformative VfM systems, measuring intangibles and possibly leading the way for implementation in other feminist funds. So me intangibles to consider in this conversation include: 32 Although these last expenses should have been reported as operational or communication expenses. It is assumed, that grantees reported them within the output -specific lines as the additional equipment was not necessarily for institutional strengthening, but as one FGD participant in the FMS end line review put it, is \"no longer a luxury but a necessity\". 25 Activists' commitment and small process achievements (small progress towards a change in policies but which are not successful yet by the end of the project), and the display of solidarity, empathy, and mutual support across women groups; Efforts not to achieve change but instead to prevent feminist progressive policies from being taken down by new governments and to counter the effects of backlashes on women's rights; Additional energy to ensure the creation of inclusive spaces, including translation, context -tailored transportation and additional time taken on coordination/participation; Time/happiness/leisure lost, and risk (security and health -related) taken by activists to achieve chang e and work against small budgets and tight deadlines. Yet, in a certain way, the LFS has already taken steps in this direction. For example, indigenous organisations lauded FIMI's flexibility in allowing them to report a likely measure of their own intangi ble costs (like community healing and support) within their budgets as co -funding/co -investment within those budgets. According to FIMI's end line review (2021) this way of measuring co -funding \"t ranslated into greater individual empowerment, both for wome n who are members of these partner organisations as well as for the women, people, and communities who were the final beneficiaries .\"33 Additional ideas might already be a part of other LFs and grantees, and thus it is worth taking the conversation further . How do the budget needs compare with the available budget? Finding #17: A large majority of grantees said that budgets were sufficient A large majority of grantees surveyed said that the budgets/ funds were sufficient for the implementation of the activities (71% across all Funds). Yet, a close look at the differences across funds, shows that FMS and FIMI/AYNI grantees were more unsatisfi ed with the number of resources provided. This was in some ways correlated with the findings from the interviews and documentary review. In the case of AWDF , it must be noted that they had access to more funds than the other LFs and provided the largest gr ants across all categories.34 FIMI, on the other hand, provided smaller grants, considering the absorption capacity of their constituencies. Figure 10 Were funds sufficient for implementation of all activities? 33 FIMI speaks of co -investment to refer to a transformative model of resource management which they are promoting as part of their actions in intercultural philanthropy for a good living /buenvivir. By co -investment , FIMI means : \"gathering resources (both quantifiable and non-quantifiable) to invest in individuals and collective well -being.\" In a co -investment model, organisations and communities provide their own resources, such as knowledge, languages, spirituality, time, organisational skills, etc., all of which are aimed at a collective goal. Cf. 2020 and 2017 -2020 Multiannual Narrative Report, pp.31,49. 34 AWDF provided grants up to \u20ac50,000 USD for grassroot organisations, the amount being often much lower for the other three and was the only one providing grants above \u20ac200.000. 26 The WFA, however, contradicted the results of their end line review. According to it, \" just over half of the survey respondents agreed that their LFS grant provided sufficient (...) funding (55%), though a notable portion actively disagreed (18%).\" Furthermore, when individu al WFA and FMS grantees were asked this question, they mentioned that despite having sufficient resources pre -pandemic, they struggled to adapt and adjust the activities to the new reality. Also, in around 88% of the survey responses and 80% of the intervi ews, grantees said that they were accustomed to these kinds of situations, and thus already had other funds available to complement existing funding35 or were able to adapt by relying more on volunteer work from their teams, communities, and partners. As seen in the graphic below, all the partners who expressed not having sufficient resources counted on other mechanisms to cover the gaps, particularly through external and internal fundraising. Yet, other than monetary resources, partners said that a key li mitation was the lack of sufficient time to implement all activities or to accompany processes which eventually would have increased or made results more sustainable (as mentioned in Finding #12). Figure 11 Mechanisms of adaptation to insufficient budgets Overall, the information collected demonstrates a strong level of resilience, creativity, and proactivity amongst the grantees and LFs when faced with budget constraints during project implementation. Howev er, it points to the emergence of new priority areas , which can impact institutional resilience in the future. Four specific issues were mentioned for consideration: Emergency support. The contexts in which grantees are working intends to be volatile and c onflict - affected (armed, political, ethnic, climate change related) and usually take a heavy toll on vulnerable women and their communities. Despite the limitations of the LFS funds, implementing specific mechanisms to respond to these crises would be usef ul in the future. Additional resources might be needed to ensure the physical and mental health and well -being of individual activists and leaders . Specific thematic or investments in digital safety and security, and/or training on how to respond to onlin e bullying; as well as more robust institutional policies, systems, and processes able to withstand increasing closure in civil society spaces. More flexibility to increase staffing and operational costs when needed, particularly in times of crisis. The t raditional way of decreasing some of these costs (consultancies, hiring external services) sometimes ends up increasing them, and does not offer health insurance to women working through them. 35 Additional funding in this case should not be understood in this case only from the point of view of bilateral or external public or private funding. Many organisations , as shared in the case studies, comes from collection of funds from the communities or livelihood activities such as the selling of products or services. 22%30%42%46% 0% 5% 10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50%Eliminate activitiesFind other sources of funding - core fundingReduce costsFind other sources of funding - other donorsIf not, what mechanisms you used to cover the gaps? N=7627 2.4 EFFECTIVENESS To what extent has LFS contributed to the overall objective and the three specific objectives laid down in the policy framework LFS (2017 -2020)? Originally, there was no common LFS ToC or common targets. Each Fund developed its own ToC, which was in line with the three Dialogue and Dissent policy goals.36 The four ToCs were approved by the MFA and confirmed as valid by the four endline evaluations in 20 20. At a later stage, a set of LFS common indicators and targets were developed (micro, meso, macro level). These indicators wer e aligned to the four LF's ToC and the D&D. In the new LFS II phase, there is a common ToC with common targets. This common ToC for LFS II was developed with the support of Prospera and Mama Cash. This important development increases the likelihood of enha ncing joint monitoring, evaluation, and assessment of results, in addition to adjustments/risk management measures related to unplanned/unexpected changes on the field. As stated in the end line reports : \"the experience gained after the first year of the implementation of the LFS initiative by the FMS showed that the Theory of Change (ToC) initially designed was coherent and valid, but it needed to be restructured and simplified in order to respond to the results chain effectively put in place by the supported grantees. This need of restructuration affected mainly the initial outcomes and outputs defined, and not the previously defined impacts and key assumptions.\"37 In line with the FMS Team, the Coordina ting Team of the indigenous women's fund FIMI/AYN I confirmed that in the new ToC included in phase 2 of the LFS, the same ToC levels have been maintained, strengthening some aspects linked to the accompaniment of partners and the participation of national organisations, aiming at connecting the local and the international level. In the framework of the presentation of the MEL Plan, the three collective indicators committed by the Consortium were included in the ToC of the LFS2 ToC and linked to the ToC of e ach specific fund in order to further integrate the institutional results and indicators with the LFS programme.38 The joint indicators against which results would be monitored and measured (both in qualitative and qualitative terms) are as follows: Macro (changes in the environment; outcome level indicator): This level looks at positive changes in pre-conditions (adoption of new pre -conditions, blocking of negative ones and improvement or implementation of existing ones) towards an enabling environment for advancing women's rights and gender equality. Five do mains of change were identified at this level: changes in control (laws, policies and regulations), changes in values and norms, changes in actions, changes in association, changes in resource allocation. Meso (changes in organisations; output level indic ator): This level relates to strong Southern Women's Rights Organisation (SWROs) advancing women's rights and gender equality. LFS alliances have worked to advance women's rights through advocating for policy reform, implementation of existing policy and s trengthening current systems. 36 The D&D policy goals are: i) To strengthen Southern feminist women's organisations, m ovements and networks, enabling them to influence policy at local, national, regional and international level; ii) To set in motion an empowerment process to improve women's social, political and economic participation in order to influence government so that barriers to participation are removed; iii) To provide women's organisations, movements and networks with the tools to reduce exclusion, discrimination, violence and unequal treatment. 37 FMS Narrative Report Final narrative report -Reporting period: December 2016 - December 2020, p.5 -6. 38 FIMI/AYNI FUND 2021, Final Evaluation, p. 6; Interview with LFS - FIMI/AYNI Coordinating Team and Board September 16. 28 Micro (changes at the individual level; output level indicator): This indicator includes consideration of the number of women and girls who are holding positions in different organisations at different levels, whether formal or informal as well as active engagement in dialogues with different stakeholders. Analysis of data from grantees has shown that involvement in activities funded through LFS has contributed to a process of activating women to increase their participation a nd action on women's rights issues as well as to take on more leadership roles.39 The set of common indicators to report on LFS results has been monitored by the LFS MEL working group. In their own view, the indicators reflected a shared priority to facili tate the emergence of a common language around results, to ensure consistent monitoring and assessment of the changes that the LFS was striving to produce at different levels set by the joint indicators (individual, organisational, environmental ).40 The common scheme to report on the indicators mandated by the MFA was the International Aid Transparency Initiative standard (IATI). The following subsections summarise specific findings and stories of change provided by WROs during interviews and end line evaluations. The (quantitative and qualitative) findings presented below have been listed according to the three levels of indicators agreed upon by the Consortium. As regards quantitative results, it was not possible to crosscheck data with the IATI conso lidated results framework. For this reason, the Team focused on the quantitative and qualitative information found in the four end line evaluations and the 2019 MTR. Results also include qualitative information collected during the interviews. The lack of a consolidated results framework for all four LFs presented a significant challenge to the evaluating Team. Even though full contribution cannot be claimed in absolute terms, there is demonstrable evidence that changes did take place; and these changes wer e documented by the individual Monitoring and Reporting tools used by each of the MEL Teams in the four LFs .41 Having results consolidated in IATI in the future can better support these types of evaluations and offered additional public ly available information for verification purposes of those reading the report. Finding #18: Macro level (change in environment): The LFS contributed to enhancing women's capabilities for influencing a wide range of policy cha nges at local, national, and regional levels, with less emphasis on influencing the macro -level of policy making and challenging areas such as economic and environmental policies .42 Quantitative data analysis taken from the endline reviews and final report s from the LFs, shows the following macro/environmental level achievements: at least 215 changes reports in regard to local, regional and regional laws and public policies advancing WRGE. 363 positive changes reported and detailed in annual reports and external evaluations, at the macro level, including 215 changes in policies/laws (national, regional or local), 37 in va lues and norms, 85 in actions and 26 in reports on WRGE.\" In r esponses to the survey ,43 the most frequently selected achievements at the macro/environment level ) were stronger capacity building (70% of preferences); changes in 39 Cf.

To strengthen Southern feminist women's organisations, movements, and networks, enabling them to influence policy at local, national, regional, and international level. 29 social/cultural norms limitin g women's agency44 (54%); specific changes in public policies aimed at improving women's rights (35%); better instruments to guarantee access to justice and reparation (23%), better access to economic resources/ livelihoods (7%) (See also Graphic in Annex H). Robust qualitative evidence confirms that key achievements were realised in the following areas: Influencing policy shifts at the local level and valorisation women's roles in the public policy arena. The examples collected from all four LFs bear wi tness to the contribution of women to the enforcement of laws/policies and government programmes, as well as to government officials and community leaders consulting with women. During interviews, grantees mentioned achievements related to accessing govern ment schemes and programmes (for example widows in India, indigenous women in Paraguay) and to accessing public funds/procurement (through writing tenders, as in Africa). Other grantees from Africa stated that thanks to their persistent lobbying and advoca cy work, women were elected on various boards (at schools, churches). In Mongolia, thanks to the LFS programme, the Mongolian Gender Equality Center (MGEC) had a series of engagements with the Mongolia government and related agencies. For example, it was re -elected to the Sub -Council against Human Trafficking in 2018 and established a cooperation MOU with the Crime Prevention Council under the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs. The goal was to develop collaboration on the prevention of crimes such as human trafficking. The MGEC has also been working as a member of the Working Group against Domestic Violence and provided policy inputs to the 2018 Sub -Council action plan. MGEC also collaborates with the Mongolian Bar Association and Pre ss Institute as part of the LFS programme (MEL Interactive Report , p. 19). Influencing processes of law reforms or contributing to the drafting of new laws at the national level. Worth mentioning are achievements in legal frameworks protecting women's SRHR . One case in point is the landmark adoption of the law that legalised abortion in Argentina, where grantees played an active role in the women's movements that influenced the adoption of the Law on Free, Fair and Safe Abortion, and the wave across Latin A merica that recently led to similar legislation in Mexico.45 This change was possible thanks to long -standing work implemented by Cat\u00f3licas in Argentina as well as many other WROs , yet the LFS funding allowed them to concentrate efforts in changing the mindsets of politicians and electorate in specific regions in Argentina, which until that time had been a key challenge in the passage of the law. The end line reviews provide lists of other significant changes, which as mentioned above were counted to be at least 200 in the programme reports46. Policy changes in the status of intersectionally discriminated persons . In Pakistan, after years of lobbying and advocacy work by LFS grantees, two significant laws were passed that protect and promote the civil and p olitical rights of non -Muslims, persons with disabilities and transgender citizens in the electoral rolls as voters (WFA End line Review, 2021, p. 41). In Thailand, the Thai 44 By agency we mean the power to transform unfair policies and practices in ways that are empowering to women individually and collectively. It also means taking action on a source or mechanism that is experienced as unfair and discriminatory , and being able to actually negotiate the terms and contents of policies affecting women's lives, enjoyment of their rights, and livelihoods . Finally, it entails proposing a lternatives to c orrect those injustices . 45 It is important to note that the LFS was only a contributor to a longstanding effort taken by Argentinian women leaders and WROs, that goes back almost 25 years. Yet according to interviews with Cat\u00f3licas por el D erecho a Decidir en Argentina, the LFS contributed by providing resources for advocacy in regions where the law proposal was having heavy opposition, as well as oth er communication funds. (KII, 10 Sep 2021) 46 Each of the changes reported for FMS, FIMI and WFA were disaggregated in detail in each of the endline reviews and during the KIIs we received evidence on a sample of those. 30 women's movement, grassroots women's collectives, child rights advocates and the p olitical movement for democracy changed their positions on sex work and now support the decriminalisation of sex work, despite some having previous positions that actively opposed decriminalisation. This coalition was joined by one grantee from the sex wor kers' movement who declared that the support from the LFS has been crucial to mobilise constituencies and public opinion on the need to pass the law (KII, Sept. 5, 2021). Policy changes in public budgetary exercises and social protection schemes. In Nepal, the Women, Children and Senior Citizen Ministry has allocated budgets in 2021 for LBTIQ communities at the local level (WFA End line Review, 2021, pp. 41). In Uganda, 2 Batwa women are members of the National Council of Women at the local level; one Mutwa woman was elected to be a member of the National Committee for Mediators at the cell level; 41 Batwa women benefited from work in the program 'Vision 2020 Umurenge,' which is a government program that offers paid work to vulnerable families. Through dialogues and meetings with authorities, some government officials have started to integrate Batwa women into certain social protection programs (FIMI End line review, p. 31.) Influencing policies related to climate change: The central government of In donesia and the UN recognised the support that women with disabilities (WwD) needed in relation to disaster management and provided funding for training for WwD living on Sumatra Island (KII, 3 Sep 2021) In Kenya and Tanzania, indigenous women capably enga ged with key environmental actors at the local and national level and participated in the Africa Regional Conference on Community Conservation, where they could lobby their governments.47 Influencing policy processes at the international level (the Multila teral level). In the global arena, grantees took part in policy drafting processes within international organisations, as illustrated by the experience of a Mongolia grantee: \" thanks to the LFS we were a key stakeholder in writing the Mongolia CEDAW 2020 report, at the end of the project we had meetings with parliamentarians and government officials. [ ...] The project also allowed the creation of the Powerful Girls app, to receive information and reports about the CEDAW. This experience not only increas ed women's knowledge of CEDAW but also improved our monitoring capacity on government's compliance. We were able to even access funding and support from CEDAW directly \" (KII, 27 Aug 2021). Contribution to influencing policies for women's rights to sustain able livelihoods (including access to land and territory, local production models that protect biodiversity, and economic networks). Local women who engaged in agroecology projects as part of the LFS grants have successfully involved state agencies and Min istries in their activities. In Cameroon, four ministries attended their workshop on fertilisation. They have also advocated to the ministry responsible for the SDGs in their country. As a result of their training workshops, the women are able to engage di rectly with the Ministry officials and express their needs and claims. They are also looking for new customers without intermediaries. In other regions, women are implementing sustainability strategies that are in line with their practices and traditions a s indigenous women living in very remote areas, for example, \"passing on the gift\" to ensure financial sustainability (KII 1 Sept 2021). During interviews with grantees, several organisations put forward achievements at the policy level, with more emphasis on the local and national levels after 2019. They explained that the reason for the decrease in influencing policy processes in the international arena was the COVID 19 pandemic, which not only meant radical losses of livelihoods for women, their families , and their communities, but also a drastic restriction on mobility (national and international). Despite this, women's organisations took the 47 Cf. FIMI's 2018 Annual Report and Case Study #1. 31 pandemic as an opportunity to improve their internet skills, ensuring connectivity for as many members as possibl e. Grantees from the Middle East and North Africa ( MENA ) region expressed mixed feelings in relation to the gains made by organisations in obtaining the support of policymakers in places like North Africa and the Middle East, since the space for an active civil society shrank during the COVID -19 pandemic, with the pandemic used as an excuse to curb civil society activities and to further limit the rights and freedoms of women. This reveals the need for the MFA to increase efforts for close monitoring and fo llow up of the situation on the ground via the four LFs as well as through frequent risk assessments (including climate change and the pandemic as a structural risk) and updates on political conjunctures. Finding # 19: Meso -level change: The tools develope d through the LFS contributed to enhancing the capacities of thousands of women and girls through accessing information and learning about their human rights, ensuring that they felt seen and heard, increased their self -esteem and power to transform the unfair policies and practices affecting their daily lives.48 According to consolidated information from the end line reviews, at least 4276 women and girls began assuming leadership positions to promote WRGEs and 48036 women and girls mention ing increases in their political participation to promote WRGE, either by holding positions of power in different levels, actively engaging in dialogues regarding these subjects or formally involved in structures of governance. The bulk of the funds provid ed direct capacity building activities for grassroots women working to transform unequal norms and practices in the communities in which they work. It also equipped them with the knowledge and skills required to claim and defend their rights, and contribut e to changes in their respective contexts, included changes within their communities. Topics included, for example, existing legislation (national, regional international) relative to women's rights (such as CEDAW, BEIJING, MAPUTO Protocol), SDG 2030 agend a, climate change policies, enhancing lobbying and advocacy techniques. Capacity building activities included also included developing skills to be more able to participate in political, economic, social, and cultural leadership and decision -making process es. Some organisations embarked on training related to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) , gender -based violence ( GBV ) and Violence Against Women and Girls ( VAWG ), legal frameworks ensuring women's rights, including those enshrined in the Co nstitution, in regional and international protocols for which States, as duty bearers are accountable. Some organisations also provided advisory and legal services to different categories of acutely marginalised women and girls. Several changes reported in the endline evaluations and MTR review also attest to the reinforcement of grantees' capacities to design, monitor and assess results of their projects. In terms of acquiring argumentative power to effectively engage in lobbying and advocacy for policy in fluence, some results were also achieved as illustrated in the following change story from Uganda: \" We are slowly but steadily becoming a resource; we are contacted about specific topics by researchers and organisations with similar objectives of communic ation and reaching out to people about issues of women and girls with disabilities \" (AWDF Grantee).49 The training tools used to empower women and facilitate their pathways to agency included different methodologies (such as Training of Trainers, storytelling for transformative change, legal literacy using primers in local languages, media work, radio programmes to advocate resistant government and traditional leaders, among others). In some countries like Zimbabwe, due to the deteriorating economi c 48 This achievement relates to LFS Objective 3: To provide women's organisati ons, movements, and networks with the tools to reduce exclusion, discrimination, violence, and unequal treatment. Other examples also in Finding #23. 49 MEL Working Group Joint report 2019, p. 13. 32 situation, peer educators were used as a strategy to assist women and children in communities because they are readily available and provide services including assistance in referrals and filing of maintenance and protection order forms (KII, 2 September 2021). Some of these tools also lead to increased leadership within local communities, with women in Indonesia and Kenya, now preparing to be part of local elections, and their local organisations supporting them in the process. Furthermore, advocacy tool s for land access and/or economic justice also laid the ground for sustainable livelihoods and furthering other women and girls' rights. As one grantee put it: \" we are still struggling for our access to land but now we achieved a source of income thanks to the project. We received a lot of training, and we are now training others. There is an aspect of leadership that came with the trainings, and which has been key for our women to realise the importance of increasing awareness among the community on the im portance of educating our daughters. Thanks to the project now women can pay for their school fees \" (KII, 1 Sept. 2021). Training on innovative agroecological practices through preserving indigenous traditional knowledge (such as seed banks), and climate c hange mitigation also involved governments and communities to think and act together for the sustainable future of their communities, their local economies, and the new generations (see Case study #3). In fact, one important finding of this portfolio evalu ation is that women's struggles towards empowerment have a greater impact when individual power co -exists with collective power and common agendas for transformation are shared . Two cases in point are the following changes in actions achieved thanks to str ategic alliance -building by grantees from FIMI/AYNI Fund: the LFS supported the participation of three indigenous women to engage with the preparation and submission of the Shadow Reports of Nepal and Mexico to the CEDAW. They allied with the National Indi genous Women's Federation (Nepal); the coalition integrated by the \"Fundaci\u00f3n Paso a Paso AC Amicam (partner 2017), the International Land Coalition, the University A. Chapingo and Ecommunnis AC from Mexico to prepare and finally officially submitting thei r shadow report as part of the global advocacy efforts to monitor and control the role of states over the fulfilment of individual and collective rights of indigenous women, contributing to visibility at the national levels and subsequent strengthening of the capabilities for indigenous women to engage in movement building for policy influence.50 Through political advocacy and lobbying, women went a long way in shaping the conversations and narratives around changing policies that fail to recognise the agency of women and promote/enforce their rights. Importantly, the Programme's concern with redre ssing the unequal access to training tools and knowledge affecting grassroots women living in most remote areas in the world constitutes a transformative achievement. On a broader level, it points to a pedagogy of transformation led by the women themselves . Finding # 20. Micro -level change: The LFS Grants contributed to individual and collective trajectories of women's empowerment. These trajectories include the technical, social, cultural, political, and economic dimensions, and were instrumental to furthe r enhance women's power for agency (i.e., influencing policies and practices in ways that are beneficial to women in their rich and complex diversity).51 Across the regions, grantees interviewed indicated that the empowerment processes that they had been able to develop thanks to the LFS Grants had facilitated their engagement with state actors (duty bearers) 50 The Shadow Reports were included as Annex 8.A. and Annex 8.B. in FIMI/AYNI FUND's second annual narrative report for the period Jan. Dec. 2018. Submitted in May 2019. 51 This and next finding are related to LFS Objective #2: To set in motion an empowerment process to improve women's social, political, and economic participation in order to influence government so that barriers to participation are removed. 33 and, to a lesser extent, to non -state actors (for example the private sector, Trade Unions). In the case of grantees from the FIMI/AYNI Fund, they t argeted local, national, and multilateral policymakers to push for their accountability as duty bearers, and for enforcing the rights of indigenous women and men as a people at the national level and in the international policymaking arena.52 For the other three LFs, there was no specific regional or international targeting, and it widely depended on the specificities of the national context in each region. In fact, a trend was identified whereby, in the four years covered by this portfolio evaluation, the technical, strategic, and political support provided to the grantees through the four LFs has effectively led to improved capacities for planning, monitoring, and reporting on concrete achievements on the ground. In the view of a majority of grantees, wit hout this type of support, achieving their planned results would have been less feasible. More importantly, enhancing their influence on duty bearers on their accountability to enforce policies and laws aiming to reduce gender and intersectional discrimina tion would have been less feasible. As one grantee from Paraguay put it \" challenging as they were, we have also learnt from the reporting requirements; we have grown as women's organisations \" (KII, 27 Aug 2021). Another grantee from Africa said that the LFS \" provided the platform (...) and flexibility required for them to come up with and new discuss ideas with AWDF that led to the projects that they eventually embarked on .\" A similar finding in the MTR confirms the empowering effect of the institutional strengthening granted through the LFS: \"The grants have not only helped the organisations to increase their capacity to develop long -term strategic plans, but they were also able to strengthen learning and reflection in their own institutional practices (p. 35). Most of the grantees agreed that the flexibility of the LFS Fund and its decentralised nature was empowering to them. In the words of a grantee from Cameroon: \" When I wrote the project I did not know how to report on results. It has been a learning ex perience and has helped me to go internationally. From the remoteness of my village, I am now capable of speaking to the UN on food nutrition in our indigenous communities and our struggle for food sovereignty, including access to land. For example, betwee n 2019 and 2020, I could attend 6 to 8 meetings of the FAO in Rome. There we, indigenous women, together with the alliance for food sovereignty, were able to negotiate and our voices were heard. I am part of both movements. Now with the COVID I participate in the online sessions \" (KII, Sept. 1, 2021). This example sums up a lived experience of empowerment which is connected to being able to negotiate the terms and contents of policies affecting women's lives, enjoyment of their rights, and livelihoods. In addition to this, the model of providing tailor -made capacity building support through small grants was heavily praised as being an effective model that significantly contributed to the organisations' strategic positioning and to effectively delivering on results. As indicated by a small fund grantee from Africa, \"we would have struggled to implement the project with the capacity we had. We would have at the end repurposed some of the funds for capacity building, certainly with the agreement of AWDF, but th e additional amount made all the difference \" ( KII, 2 Sep 2021). Narratives of empowerment from the other three regional LSF funds demonstrate a similar trajectory of empowerment at the level of shifting individual consciousness \" Before joining the project , I did not know about women's rights or the rights of indigenous people. I was able to build my capacity through training, workshops, and orientations about the rights of indigenous women, the value of the culture, and access to local government. After joining the project, the women into the Indigenous Women Group are able to 52 Including their right to informed and prior consent in the area of extractive industries/mining. 34 work collectively, claim funds from the local authority which are allocated to them, and raise their voices collectively. I am very happy to work with NIWF and WFA \" (MTR , p. 54). The empowering potential of the LFS Programme was also recognised by the LFs: \"the four LFS partners are based in the Global South which means that they understand the context of planned interventions and the intersectional nature of their work in each region. Their expertise on the needs, opportunities, and contexts of WROs has been built up over time and derives from being based in the same region, part of the movement and in constant contact with the issues on the ground. Most significantly, the fact that the LFS money flows directly to the Global South, via the four managing WFs to organisations where women and girls are in control of what they do with it, is the only way to promote a real shift in power changing the prevailing wisdom around who has the capacity and expertise to manage large pools of funding, \" ( LFS Working Group Joint Report, p. 5) . What did pathways of change look like? How were the changes obtained? Were these pathways consistent with the policy framework LFS (2017 -2020)? Finding #21: LFS Grants have contributed to grounded processes of change that are embedded in a systemic vision of transformation. It emerges from the evidence analysed that the 4 Funds share a common vision of change: structural change cannot happen without change at the individual level , where women first develop a feminist consciousness and then impact the structures that affect their lives . Consistent with this shared vision, the four LFs framed the indicators in a way that they could create space to report on the effects of LFS funding in terms of changes at the organisational and individual level (looking at the agents of change but also their relationships, alliances and strategies) as well as the environmental level. These are the shared components that define the pathways of change embedded in the LFS 1 results framework , and which are consistent with the four individual ToC and the D&D policy framework. Altogether, they demonstrat e a broader, feminist and intersectional understanding of advocacy and how change happens on the ground.53 One feature that distinguish es feminist from indigenous pathways of change in the LFS is how change happens in the lives of indigenous women, regard less of the fact that they are feminist s or not. Pathways of change to indigen ous women are defined by an inextricable cor relation between individual and collective rights, in addition to claiming their rights as knowledge bearers on equal terms with femin ist, non-indigenous knowledge bearers.54 The LFS common vision includes tackling the structural factors and interlocking systems of oppression impinging on the lives, livelihoods, and rights of women in all their diversity. These pathways of change are context -specific, non -linear and include ris k analysis as a key element of women's trajectories towards empowering themselves and influencing policies that respect and enforce their fundamental human rights. All evidence considered corroborates the fact that the MFA, through the work and commitment of the four LFs, has consolidated and/or created grounded pathways of change for women's 53 MEL Working Group Joint Report, October, 2019; op ctd. 54 As illustrated by their publications, training material, narrative reports and endline evaluation, t his idea of change is so key to FIMI/AYNI Fund that it also shapes their vision of \"i ntercultural ph ilanthropy,\" which centres around the respect for all systems of traditional knowledge, ancient wisdom, and the elderly as the basis for inter -generational dialogue in the exchange and anal ysis of information among Indigenous Peoples. As evidenced by their endline evaluation, their systemic vision of change is also reflected in the choice of grantees/partners, and profile of the Indigenous Committee who takes part in the selection process and selection criteria (cf. p. 25). 35 empowerment and agency.55 These changes, however , were defined or disa ggregated in different ways by the four LFs. For FIMI/AYNI and FMS case, they divided changed acr oss level s of control (laws, public policies), changes in actions ( implementation of approved policies or changes in actions without policies being) and changes in values and norms . For WFA and, changes were not disaggregated , but according to the intervie ws only referred to changes in levels of control, as these were the only ones easily quantifiable and verifiable. In many cases, through empowering grantees on the ground, the LFS has also contributed to reinforcing community -driven processes of change wh ich have opened discussions on issues that are usually considered taboos such as gender norms and cultural practices that perpetuate inequalities and violence on the ground ( i.e., child marriage, rape of LTBI persons). At the systemic level, an indispensab le area of transformative funding, the LFS approach has created space for exposing the impact of racism in the lives of indigenous, and afro -descendent women and their communities, the impact of extractive industries and climate changes on the lives of gra ssroots women fighting for their right to land, territories, and productive resources, including our common goods (water, clean air, biodiversity). The LFS approach has also embraced the struggles of non -binary women/persons, LTBQ groups and women with dis abilities. As demonstrated by the change stories shared by int erviewees from the four LFs, the end line evaluations, and the MTR, and in the specific case of Trans wom en with disabi lities who are grantees from the WFA: Finding #22: Pathways of change are enshrined in women's human rights (WHR) frameworks, in addition to feminist and intersectional principles have been crucial in sustaining the changes achieved. The four LFs used WHR as a concrete basis for stressing wom en's agency as rights holders and states, with their public institutions, as duty bearers at different levels (local, national, regional, and international). This approach also entailed raising awareness on women's capacities to organise themselves, along with other like -minded allies, to achieve the transformative changes required to reduce, and ultimately, to eradicate gender and other forms of intersecting discrimination impinging on women's lives on the ground. Another added value of the LFS grants is t heir capacity to promote feminist and intersectional principles that can more effectively embrace the aspirations and political agendas of women's rights organisations in all their rich diversity. Even though the term was not used by all women's organisati ons, several grantees interviewed alluded to the rich potential of intersectional inclusion. As mentioned in Finding #9, the coordination opportunities offered by the LFS brought attention to intersectionalities in feminist and indigenous women's agendas. This created changes in behaviour within women's organisations and made intersectionality a more intentional practice. For example, one grantee from Colombia expressed that an achievement for them was the generation of alliances with multicultural organisa tions, particularly with indigenous and Afro-descendant women: \" the project gave us the possibility to carry it out and the political will. Work with these organisations already existing but LFS made it an intentional objective \" (KII, 24 August 2021). One additional evidence of the added value of the intersectional approach in the LFS is that it embraced the traditional knowledge of indigenous women and their peoples. Historically their knowledge has been made invisible and discredited. Through the LFS, these knowledges have been valorised are equipping indigenous women with political and technical tools to influence policies in a wide range of issues and at 55 In the limited scope of this evaluation report, \"grounded pathways\" refer to context -specific trajectories of becoming empowered and actually taking action to expose, counter and transform discriminatory mechanisms and structures. 36 the local, national, and multilateral level. Furthermore, as responses to the Google survey show, the LFS has also created a space for the expression of indigenous women's spirituality and cosmogony. Finding #23: Pathways of change followed a logical sequence, and paths were dependent of enabling and limiting factors, in addition to unforeseen contingencies 56 Despite the fact that there was not one common ToC and targets against which results could be assessed and measured , the common set of indicators were useful elements to trace the pathways of change to achieve the results identified, and in particular the linkages between the micro, meso and the macro level of results achieved. As regards to the e nablers that influenced pathways of change at the individual, organisational and macro/environment level, the following factors were identified via surveys and interviews with KII. Firstly, recognition by grantees, that the strong support and flexibility f rom the LFs, and decentralised nature of the relationship was key to achieve the projects' results (35%). Secondly, the existence of networks and key contacts, consolidated before or during the project (20%). This was particularly significant for grantees of FIMI, who mentioned that the LFS contributed to increasing their access to multilateral dialogue platforms, for example, in the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the CSW, the CEDAW and, more particularly, through other programmes within FIMI (suc h as the Global Leadership School, Political Advocacy, and its Research Programme).57 Thirdly, some grantees referred to the possibility of enjoying the support of local leaders and/or local, regional, or national governments. As seen in Finding #18, and where this was available, the impact was stronger, particularly in regard to the effect on policies. In many cases, greater support from governments within the agendas has been the result of years of relentless work on the same area. This was the case for example, in Argentina, where the National Law on Legal, Safe and Free Abortion, was passed thanks to a longstanding women's struggle and the political will of the government in power. \" The process takes a greater momentum since 2015, with a greater inc idence of communication and social media on behavioural change. This was anchored from the speech of \"Ni Una Menos\" (Not a Single Women Less), where we brought awareness about women who die during clandestine abortions or when abortions that put in risk th eir health are not allowed in time \" (KII, 7 Sep 2021). However, in the view of other grantees, the state, community and traditional leaders were not perceived as enabling actors and, in some cases, especially in c onflict affected areas, such as the MENA re gion, they were perceived as potential constraining factors. Another key enabler was the commitment and effort from activists and their communities, which particularly increased as their participation in project activities increased their motivation. An F MS grantee expressed: \" what helps the most is that once you are convinced of the reason for this activism, there is no one to stop you. Some of us left our husbands who mistreated us and started our own businesses. Others ran as community leaders, many of us became friends with each other \" (KII, 5 Sept 2021). However, this commitment also represented a high risk for some activists, who, because of the high level of pressure they had, were reportedly suffering from \"burn -out\" and mental problems/depression, as already mentioned in other sections. 56 This finding relates to path dependency and data was collected through the following evaluation question: What were the enabling, limiting factors and risks that contributed to the achievement of results and what actions needed to be taken to overcome them? Data from surveys w as triangulated with interviews , endline evaluations and MTR. 57 FIMI 2020 Annual Report & 2017 -2020 Final Report, p. 12. 37 Finally, interviews with the KIIs revealed additional path enablers at the project level, where some activities/strategies were considered as key tools to ensure progress towards expected results. These strategies were (i) to have sufficient evidence -base to strengthen the foundations of an adequate project plan, strengthen advocacy work and plan for contingencies; (ii) focusing training and capacity building on the new generations, to ensure the \"passage of the fla gs\" and that historical memories and wisdom are not lost; (iii) using the knowledge of the new generations to embrace new technologies and ways of doing advocacy and communication. With respect to challenges and limitations hampering these pathways of change , the most significant challenges identified by grantees were: impact of COVID -19 in terms of mobility restrictions, additional needs (Food security, loss of livelihoods, and loss of internal capacity because of the pandemic (WFA reported a 35% of internal capacity affected by COVID - 19). The lack of flexibility in the timeframes and use of the resources was also mentioned (between the 25% for FMS and the 65% for FIMI/AYNI) - see more details in the graph below. The emerging challenge most commonly mentioned in interviews relates to how changes in the political system are increasingly bringing along persecution and physical risks for organisations and activists themselves. This was compellingly put by a grantee in the Middle East: \"The greatest threat to responding to the needs of our beneficiaries came with the COVID -19 pandemic, when the attention of the world was on fighting the vir us, the business of governments in the Middle East was to close the space within which civil society organisation's function. The grant received from AWDF became even more relevant than to contest the moves of states in the region to voice the challenges t hat women contend with and the need for their rights and dignity to be protected at all times. Thus, our response to existing gaps was not limited to what was within our project document, it expanded to the need to deeply reflect on the changing times and the need for feminist organisations to be engaged and not lose sight of the shrinking space and the need to contest it\" (KII, 17 Sep 2020). 0% 5% 10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%Good knowledge of the contextNot affected by the leaders elected/chosen in decision-making spacesUse of innovative tools (media/online)Already working virtually or moving towardsGood internal/own monitoring toolsPositive changes in local context (policies / laws / government)Quick adaptations to contextEvidence-based and/or long term planningCommunity/team incentivized by resultsCommitment and work from project teams and/or communitiesNetworks and key contacts/champions consolidated before or during the projectStrong support and flexibility from leading fundIf yes, what was or were the main factor(s) of success/enablers?

For exa mple, one AWDF grantee mentioned that the national government never gave them the authorisation to receive the payment, and they had to look for alternative solutions . In some countries in Asia, the LFS funds could not be given directly to unregistered gro ups due to challenges posed by prevailing governmental regulations in many countries. In spite of this, such groups could enter into fiduciary collaborations with other registered groups that were eligible to receive funds. In some cases, these temporary s olutions posed problems and meant the loss of resources in bank charges and overheads. More recently, these types of arrangements have been bolted by national governments under the excuse to tackle extremism and terrorism. This is in contrast with the wealth of resources available to conservative organisations, which in many areas opposed the grantees' work. As a WFA grantee reported, \" on the one side we have ve ry conservative society and families, which sometimes do not support our fight. And on the other, we have private investors sometimes pressuring or threatening us to stop helping women in accessing their rights .\" ( KII, 2 Sep 2021). Another grantee from AWD F stated: \" the increase of the power of the political -religious groups in our community, which organised demonstrations in the streets and lead campaigns on the social media to fight against women rights especially after the government approved CEDAW\" (KII, 30 Aug 2021). As mentioned above, while the communities and governments are perceived as enablers, by some grantees, they can also be a constraining factor depending on the area of intervention and the political context. This opposition also exist within local communities, especially when the work of the organisations opposed traditional beliefs or when w omen were encouraged to do more outside their households. For example, AWDF grantees stated that \" there is reluctance from the chiefs of villages to change their traditions and adapt to new things. We had to explain them that women also have a voice \" (KII, 2 Sep 2021). These problems were more commonly mentioned by organisations in remote or inaccessible areas, which also made their advocacy work difficult, expensive, and strenuous.

African Women's Development Fund (AWDF) Fondo de Mujeres del Sur (FMS) International Indigenous Women's Forum (FIMI) / AYNI Fund (AYNI) Women's Fund Asia (WFA)Multipleanswers, N=4239 The evaluation also found that in many regions (for example the MENA region, Asia and Latin America) constraints have been compounded by a reduction of the policy space available to make progress in WRGE s. The situation for WROs and in particular women human rights defenders (WHRD) is especially critical, reaching levels of extreme human insecurity in some areas. In Thailand, th rough support from the LFS, WHRDs were equipped with the tools, techniques and skills to develop self-care and provide mental support to their members . Training was also provided to frontline defender s including strengthening their skills for gender and power analyses. Th rough the LFS, they were also able to engage in strategic alliance building with other human rights movements to strengthen intersectional social justice activism .58 Another important constraint identified is the low level of funding, which is having consequences on the mental health of the activists working with these organisations. Some are at risk of losing capacity, knowledge, and institutional strength. A WFA gran tee said that \" we had a plummeting of physical and emotional health of personnel and grassroot organisations. Many of us got sick during the pandemic or lost members of our family. There was no time to grieve, because we needed to keep working \" (KII, 7 Sep 2020). Furthermore, some organisations reported depression and suicides within their organisations. The findings also point to an increasingly difficult operating environment, particularly for smaller grassroots organisations in remote areas (and thus th e ones in more need of resources). This will need to be tackled in the new phase of the LFS and could be done through the sharing of best practices and solidarity actions amongst WRO across the whole Global South becoming more important. 2.5 SUSTAINABILI TY To what extent the LFS has increased the capacity of the grantees and LFs and contribute to resul ts be sustainable? Finding #2 4: Capacity gains as shown in Finding #19, allowed the LFS and grantee's ability to do advocacy, respond to challenges and limitations, expand their portfolios, and leverage additional resources. Most of the specific training and capability results of these programme s are mentioned in Finding # 19, so we will not duplicate findings here. We will focus on the evidence of how that capacity allowed the grantees to respond to the many limitations mentioned in the previous section. The COVID -19 pandemic, despite the many negative challenges it created, was also a gr eat testing ground to put capacity into practice, and in particular to highlight what type of approaches (both individualised and collective) were most effective. Key areas in which the funds provided capacity building support included planning and fundrai sing, advocacy and networking, institutional development, financial management and virtual engagements. According to the interviews and end line reports , the organisations received diverse capacity related support . Some of the tailored approaches for capac ity building were specifically commended. For example, in AWDF , exclusive funding for capacity building was offered, usually within the range of $9,000, with the grantees determining the areas in which they would like to invest the funds . AWDF grantees indicated that this gave them the autonomy, flexibility, and conf idence they required to address the gaps in their institutions. It also strategically positioned them to be able to embark on lobbying and advocacy efficiently and effectively, and to better deliver services to their beneficiaries. The type of training 58 For example, see WFA, programme \"Supporting human rights defenders in Thailand\" , which has been explored in more detail in the endlin e review, or the programme Elas Pretas already addressed before. 40 activities implemented with these funding differed widely, as mentioned in Finding #19. FIMI grantees, on the other hand made a point of the added value of small grants (proyectos semillas/seeds grants) and co-investment practices supported their trajectories of institutional strengthening for political advocacy. Some of the related results not already mentioned, are in terms of obtaining other sources of sustainable funding. For WFA and FMS, on the other side, grantees mentioned that the strongest capacity w as created during the tailored support that was given during the delivery process . As one WFA grante e mentioned \" it was a very respectful relationship that was managed through dialogue. The fact of permanently exchanging information allowed communication a nd consultation to be very fluid. Agreements and dialogues were appropriate, and we felt like training was being provided in our regular interactions as peers \" (KII, 31 Aug 2021). In many cases, the horizontal and decentralised relationship created a stron g bond: \" they are like our moms ... or our sisters. When we thought that they could not continue supporting us, we almost died, because we never had a support like theirs. There was no pressure or persecution for the results. They always ready to collabora te. This was very important for us because we started from scratch, and thanks to the Funds and the patience of the colleagues, our first financial and narrative report was presented. They accompanied us throughout the process, even though we were not the only grantee asking for help. Other funds would not have supported us in the same way \" (KII, 2 Sep 2021). The results of the above were mainly to allow grantees to become more credible and stronger partners within the regions where they operate. For exampl e, expanding their geographical reach, the LFs became increasingly skilled and knowledgeable in handling bigger grants and managing funds and institutions across different regions , and created networks within their own region that did not exist before (see finding #6) . The same was valid for grantees, with more than 600 organisations reporting having enhances their political participation, establishing dialogues or alliances with key stakeholders (CSOs, NGOs, local/national governme nts) to advance WRGEs (47 for FMS, 61 for WFA, 30 for AFWD and 648 for FIMI ).59 Furthermore, i n both the cases of the grantees and the LFs, the capacity gained during the implementation of the grants and LFS contracts enabled some of them to raise additiona l funds and to expand on their activities. For example, the FMS end line review mentioned that the FMS \" expanded it pool of donors, doubled its staff and increased in 150% its total budget. This growing is reflected in an exponential increase in the number of grantees supported, the number of grants awarded, and the number of countries covered by the different programmes ran by the FMS \". Some grantees indicated that the process they went through in securing the LFS I grant provided them with the confidence and skills they require to engage other donors, as well as the credibility that brought having secured and fully implemented an LFS grant. The endline reviews and KIIs showcased at least 34 cases in which grantees documented having achieved new funding str eams (both from private and public donors, some of them belonging to programmes being \"inspired\" by the LFS such the GAC, but these unfortunately were not consolidated into an indicator which could have supported stronger evidence for this finding. Capacit y also created the ability to elaborate their own businesses and livelihood ideas. In Kenya, for example, women that received a small amount of LFS funding trained themselves to make soap and sell it. Then, with the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic and its s ubsequent limitations, they adapted by learning to use innovative means of communication and transferring money, such as by e -banking via 59 Specific evidence for each of these aliances was provided in the end line reports or end of year reports, which in some cases documented one by one the type of aliances built. 41 their mobile phones (MPESA). \" These knowledge and skills will remain with us forever and we will continue using them, as it makes conducting business easier \" (KII, 2 Sep 2021). Another example from Cameroon, is covered in more detail in Case Study #2. Yet, two area s where capacity building may have been missed is in consolidating sustainability plans and ensuring that tho se that received training and capacity remain within the WROs. Except for six organisation interviews, grantees stated that they did not have a written sustainability strategy before or during the implementation of the grant. This did not mean that sustain ability strategies were not in the mindset of the grantees or the LFS, but rather tha t thinking was more focused on the delivery of the projects. On the other hand, with an increasingly restricted implementation space and more persecution and threats on th e rise, the feminist movement has seen increas ed pressure on individual activist s, which adds to the regular preoccupation with achieving new sources of funding, as the timeframe of th e existing fund ing is limited to a year or maximum two. As mentioned by one of the regional organisations that have been accompanying the process: \"There is a strong insecurity about the survival of the organisations and the women working within. This sucks energy from the org anisations and leads to low motivation and stress. This has particularly increase after COVID -19. Also, non -financial security has become an issue, increasingly so. Feminist activist, human rights defenders, are quite constantly under attack by state and n on-state actors (particularly religious organisations), using digital security and anti -terrorism laws. The capacity that was build is being eroded\". (KII, 6 September 2021) . More on this issue is covered in the next and final section. What is the likelih ood of the results of LFS to be maintained in the longer term (post -2020 after LFS I ended)? Finding # 25. Most of the organisations interviewed and surve yed (89%) mentioned that they have continued with the activities and outputs implemented, and that thi s was in large part to the stronger capacity and networks built during the LFS. Most of the grantees interviewed and surveyed (89%) mentioned that they have continued with the activities and outputs implemented or are continuing to advocate for the policies and other results being built during the projects, even if not at the same level as before (mainly as a result of less available funding which has been reduced in size since the COVID -19 pandemic ). The survey results also support findings from the previous section, as 28% said that two key enablers were strong capacity and networks provided by the LFS (see Figure 14, below). There was also consistency with the enablers of change mentioned in Finding #23, with surveys indicating that organisational and individual commitment, and in particular \" persistence regardless of the context/funding \" (14%) and \" community ownership \" (11%) where the most important reasons why results would be sustained. As such, the main contributions of the LFS in terms of sustainability seem to have been the creation of institutional capacity, the opening of new networks amongst WR Os and between them and other donors, and the promotion of new leaderships. On the other hand, and also consistently with Finding #28, the main challenges against sustainability relate to not having sufficient funding or flexibility in the use of those fu nds (35%), and short timeframes of implementation (18%). Several interviewees (and two external shareholders) referred to the mismatch between the short timeframe of grants and the long -lasting changes pursued by the LFS Programme. For example, an external organisation (31 August 2021) stated that \" transformative change takes time and that it is not linear. It requires monitoring and evaluation tools that are less conventional than the ones 42 currently used by the MFA\". Another WFA grantee said that \" the job is to change mentalities, which is not done in a few months or even a few years, and if it is not done insistently, are lost\" (1 Sept 2021). Figure 14 Enablers and challengers of sustainability, according to survey responses As seen above, issues of short -term funding, lack of sufficient budget support for staffing and now the need to offer additional support new emerging priorities results from the dec reasing space for civil/society/feminism have become a consistent cross -cutting finding of this evaluation, which as a result merits specific discussion among partners and grantees. 0% 5% 10%15%20%25%30%35%Development of productive/livelihood capacities for organisationsIndependent financingMore funding for operational budget linesMore support against decreasing space for civil-society/feminismPromoting young leadershipsStronger support from Leading Funds (more people for...More enabling political environmentStronger commitment from communitiesContinue training/monitoring and sharing results after closureMore funding for new emerging areas (climate change/security and self-...More flexible budget (for operational and institutional growth)Longer timeframes of implementation/multi-year fundingMore funding (no details)If not, what is missing to achieve sustainability?

CASE STUDIES AND BEST PRACTICES Here were present a few case studies, inspired by the shared stories of grantees all across the world who were interviewed for this Evaluation. We have focused on stories untold in previous reports, and particularly in the end line reviews for each of the LFs, which should be considered as complementary to th is evaluation report. We would like to restate our acknowledgement and gratitude to all the women of the four Women's Fund who invested their time, enthusiasm and inspiration and shared their transformative narratives with us. The case studies are linked t o specific sections, which have been referred to in earlier sections of this Report. Case study #1: Adaptations and responses to climate change - Women's Community Gardens for Climate Change Adaptation (COGACCA) - TANZANIA (LFS/FIMI/AYNI FUND) COGACCA was a project implemented by a Pastoralist Indigenous women's organisation in Tanzania with the support from FIMI, between 12.02.2020 and 11.12.2020 (US$20,000). The project aims at improving household nutrition as well as bringing together different stakehol ders to initiate discussions on Climate Change, and its effects on the livelihood of Indigenous (Maasai and Hadzabe) women, youth, and the elderly. PIDO is part of the local network known as LONGONET (and the African Indigenous Women Organization (AIWO)). Most of their members are women and people with disabilities. In their words the project works as follows (Group Interview, 9 Sept 2021): \"The nomadic lifestyles of our people make it difficult for them to access funding and social services such as hospita ls and schools. Hence, their development is slower compared to other communities; they are friends of nature though, so their survival has been for many years due to the fact that they have a close and good relationship with Mother Nature . Climate Change h as disrupted many of the existing livelihoods as grazing areas and water resources are diminis hing. We identified the need of diversifying our livelihoods and those of our communities through stabilising food security in 3 villages and supporting women to generate income. Through our regular meetings we asked our women what would help them in the short and long run. They identified gardens for food security and income generation to pay for their children education\" . These priorities are a response to the strongly gendered roles that remain the basis of Maasai society. Women are responsible for maintaining their home, including cooking, cleaning, collecting firewood and water, looking after children, and building and repairing huts. Men are responsible for herding and protecting cattle, building kraals or cattle pens, and contributing to larger decisions about the community through traditional political processes. These relations have changed slightly over time, with the responsibilities of women having rema ined in addition to now providing for the family. Because of climate change, men have resorted to migrating to cities in search of work, and the women are left to care for the children and livestock. The community gardens help them adapt to the hardships b rought about by climate change by being a source of food and income through the sale of vegetables. The grant brought a number of results both in terms of livelihood outputs and organisational strengthening: We were able to establish three community garden s in three villages. They are contributing to improving food security and women's income. Of an original target of 100 women, they ended up reaching more than 600 women who were able to sell their products and have continued selling them. 44 Women are saving money collectively to ensure schooling for their children. They set up a VIKOVA (village community bank). This strengthened their capacity to save money for collective purposes and implement solidarity loans (through rotating funds at a very low interest rate). These loans ensure some additional savings which are divided collectively. Training on climate change was conducted in three villages. The effects of climate have been visible and felt vividly within the community, so the training just put a name to the reason behind all the confusion and hardships. The organization was successfully formalized and received recognition from government officials, with their marginalised communities gaining visibility as well. Some best practices and lessons learned inc luded: Recognition that changes take time: \"We have been careful with traditional leaders. They first need to see if a project is yielding positive results for the community before getting their support. Our women are still working with them\". Inclusion: \" We also work with men from the community; they are advisors on how to keep and breed our goats (...) we are also including youth and women with disabilities (blind women) in our workshops on climate change\". Networking. \"We belong to a Network of women and men (LONGIDO NGO). We took them to the gardens and explained our project to them. They became consumers of our products. AIWO gave us mentoring support\". The women at PIDO remain hopeful that they can share their knowledge and create cross -learnings in the future: \" If COVID had not hit, we would have invited other women's organisations from other countries to visit our project and our gardens and share with them our conservation practices. We would have been able to empower ourselves across boundaries (indi genous women and non -indigenous women). It would have been empowering to learn from each other and share our challenges: \"we are all women first; working across ethnicities would have helped. \" Case study #2: Sustainability and effective use of spaces for a dvocacy -Fight for the total respect of economic rights and justice and the recognition of the contribution of women to the emergency in Cameroon by 2035 The project was financed with $ 51, 000 by the LFS' funds during the year 2020. Due to the political a nd security situation in the country, the NGO had challenges in accessing and working in certain areas of the country. During that period, NGOs were prohibited from organising public events, especially those related to human rights. However, when the COVID -19 pandemic struck the country, the organisation decided to sensitise people on COVID -19 and the consequences for women, while utilising that platform to undertake its LFS activities. They succeeded in getting authorisation to conduct sensitisation as the y were working on raising COVID -19 awareness. During the events, however, they spoke on rights -related issues in the presence of security officials. As indicated by the Director of the organisation (KII, 2 Sep 2021): \" we asked women to talk about their problems and concerns (heritage and land issues) in front of everyone: police, gendarmerie, chiefs, community, etc. When the event was over, the chief of the subprefect asked the women to pass by his office so they could hear their complaints and understand the situation. Thanks to that an official investigation was conducted at the perfect level. As a result, many people have been arrested\". She 45 further stated that: \"We had to use every difficulty as an opportunity to denounce/ advocate for women's right s\". The NGO succeeded in reach ing and engaging 300 women using both face -to-face and virtual means , instead of the initially 100 women targeted as beneficiaries, and instead of only covering one region (their initial target), they are now covering seven regio ns in the whole country. They have also gained prominence in their country as an organisation for women, and as a key organisation combating COVID - 19. The ir activities are grassroots oriented and have demonstrated their potential for sustainability. The director of the NGO stated: \" Our sustainability strategy exists ever since we do exist: we sell chicken and with the sales, we make sure we cover the possible needed costs in the future. All the members of our organization are involved in that activity, ev en me, as the director of the NGO. The idea for the future is to also sell pigs and fish. We are planning to also buy 10 hectares of land for agriculture.\" When asking some women beneficiaries of the project how they felt it had changed their life, they st ated (Virtual visits, between 2 and 15 Sep 2021): \"The NGO gave me a lot of courage, motivation and advice. Also, they put us all in contact with other women in the country. They supported me so much, that I was then able to manage the house, my family but also sustain my family through work without feeling guilty about leaving my children while am working. Even my son is now happy to see me go out for work. \" \"When I met the NGO, I was mentally and psychologically down. I participated in their entreprene urship workshops, and they changed me completely. I realised women are not just legs and arms, we women also have a head, and I can do this. So, I took a decision to change. What I have become today it is thanks to the NGO. Then, I realised that many women in the rural areas were having a lot of problems, so I decided to help them through the same NGO that helped me. I am now a volunteer and I support women on marketing but also listen to them. Since I am helping them, they do not see themselves as victims anymore and that their mindsets have change. I am so happy for them.\" \"Through the trainings I learned that women are capable and have rights and that we can also be in the same positions as men. Now we are proud of ourselves and about having our destiny i n our own hands. The NGO has thought me who I really am, and what I can bring with me (professionally and as a woman)\". Case Study #3: pathways of change focused on networking and relentless advocacy - Strengthening Mukkuvar fisherwomen and headload vendor s win their rights in coastal areas of India The project has been implemented for the benefit of women of the indigenous Mukkuvar fisherwomen living in coastal areas of India. They were supported by the LFS between 01.10.2018 and 30.09.2019, with US$17,54 1. They have been disadvantaged by living in a culture that promotes patriarchal norms. The women needed to increase their knowledge on human rights and how government functions, in order to have easy access to the tools available to them and thereby be pr otected from exploitation and abuses by money lenders and middlemen. The project has worked with a focus to tackle this age -old oppression, build, and strengthen their capacities to claim their rights and achieve sustainable livelihoods for themselves and their communities. Thanks to the project's activities on political advocacy, human rights training, and social protection schemes women achieved the following: Knowledge about government programmes . For example, they lobbied for free access to local 46 public transport and received it. Their children are accessing public services such as school, vocational training, health care, transport. Another problem they were facing was public bus drivers denying them access to the buses due to the smell of the fish that they were taking to the market. As a result of the capacity building training on rights, they started to advocate the drivers for their right to use public transport and succeeded. Now, they are finally able to utilise the buses and can go to local market s to sell their fish. Increased awareness o f pension entitlements . Widows did not know about these rights and the government had not informed them either. Some widows started to advocate to the government and achieved their right to a public pension. The fisherwomen also ended up accessing government schemes to reinforce their small businesses , thereby increasing their capacity for income generation. They are now saving to pay for their childre n's schooling and medicines. Their pathway of change was built as they implemented the project. The first step was for the 208 women leaders from the 52 fisherwomen groups that are part of the Federation to participate in the training provided by the proje ct. They are now ensuring that the 52 women groups within their Federation are functioning collectively and that members have easy access to public services and schemes. Government officials from various relevant departments such as Panchayat, fisheries, e ducation, and health participated in and interacted with the beneficiaries. The participants were able to develop a rapport with the concerned officials in the relevant departments. In turn, the Government officials could finally understand the problems an d needs of the fisherwomen. All participants expressed that advocacy and lobbying were essential for the welfare of women fish vendors. Trained women know what to expect of each other and coordinate in an organised fashion.

Case study #4: Efficient and creative adaptations to COVID -19: best practices and champions for a new time of increasing virtuality Despite the many n egative effects of the COVID -19 pandemic on women organisations and vulnerable population s, this evaluation also helped to highlight best practices and champions that could potentially help other current and past LFS members to adapt to this new environmen t. We bring forward two cases not covered in the end line reviews. This is not to reduce the efforts of other multiple organisations we spoke with, but to avoid duplication. Unexpected results and reach in Chile using virtual training SUR Corporaci\u00f3n de Es tudios Sociales y Educaci\u00f3n was the coordinator of the consortia -level grant given to the Red Mujer y H\u00e1bitat de Am\u00e9rica Latina (The Latin American Women and Habitat Network) between 2019 and 2020 and receiving a grant of over \u20ac200k. The grant was co -imple mented with other five organisations in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, and Guatemala60. The objective of their project was to strengthen the social and political influencing capabilities of women regarding their rights 60 Fundaci\u00f3n AVP Servicios Cono Sur - CISCSA (Argentina), Fundaci\u00f3n Guatemala (Guatemala), and the Uni\u00e3o Nacional por Moradia - UNMP (Br azil). 47 to inhabit urban areas in a safe and participative way, particularly black women, afro descendent, the young and immigrants. The project's main tool was the set -up of a regional training and leadership school covering each of the participant countries, focusing both on capital citi es and regional urban areas. With the pandemic, a shift had to be made towards virtuality. Initially it was seen as a limitation, which was added to the national processes of social revolt and was affecting their ability to deliver; yet it was a pivotal mo ment for engagement and advocacy. According to the coordinators interviewed \" this made us rethink the contents of the schools and the trainings, we needed to become virtual quickly, and instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, we look for support in nation al partners that might have the tools we were needing \". SUR joined efforts with the School of Architecture of the University of Chile, which already had experience in virtual platforms. Their combined efforts brought them unexpected results. Of an initial expectation of 30 participants, more than 2000 nominees subscribed for the courses, and due to limited capacity, this has to be reduced to 400 people through out all of Latin America. Not only was their reach higher than expected, but they also generated gr eater opportunities for advocacy, to understand the gaps in training, and to create a model which has been so successful that the University is considering continuing the training through a specialisation programme. This unexpected reach also brought them increasing recognition, which means that despite Chilean women's organisations being unable to be part of the next phase of the LFS61, have continued working. Potential partners with SUR and the Universidad de Chile could be considered as potential supporters of the movement to virtuality in the LFSII. Tewa - Philanthropy for Equitable Justice and Peace, a case study covered in the WFA end line report, had a similar experience and thus cross -regional work be fomented. The organisations working virtually even before the pandemic Two organisations in Latin America and Asia spoke to us about their experience of being prepared for the pandemic because of having started their work in online spaces even before the pandemic and mentioned how they could add value. Point of View (PoV) in India implemented the project Control Alt Delete: Let's End Online Violence against Women and Trans Peopl e between 2019 and 2020, with a grant of \u20ac90,000. The objective was to tackle increasing cases of online harassment (trolling, harassment, bullying, and abuse), through education, sensitization, and solidarity around WROs. The organisation was working sinc e 2015 in digital feminism and particularly online harassment. The move into virtuality did not come naturally but was the result of research and planning. As the project coordinator put it \" they were a very traditional women's right s organisation (WRO) an d many of us were not that young or experienced in online tools. Yet research indicated that online harassment was one of the key three issues for women regardless of their age, social class/cast e, language, or country, and that no one was working on it. W e sought to use our longstanding work on physical abuse into this new area \". For PoV, WFA was very open to having this proposal on digital spaces as an increasing ly important issue for women and the LBTQ community in the future. Year 1 was before the pand emic, and they had done 61 As Chile and Uruguay were removed from the DAC list of ODA recipients. These exclusions have been highly disputed by regional organisations which signal how bigger and more powerful countries (India, China) are still part of the list, and do not represent a decrease in the inequality and vulnerability in the Global South. 48 a lot of the preparatory work before the pandemic. So, when the pandemic happened, they were already mainly working on virtual spaces. During the pandemic, they trained women in grassroot s organisations to be digital ly literate and secure, also providing digital security to grassroot s organisations to prevent attacks against their organisation s. They also did submissions to the UN special rapporteur on digital violence and were able to bring more awareness on the issue within India. On the other side of the world, technological advances were also part of the contributions of the funds. An e xample of this was providing funds to strengthen the PenhaS app, a platform set up by the Associac\u00e3o Azmina in Brazil. Through a grant of \u20ac100,000, the LFS offered the possibility to strengthen the app and added the opportunity to do a mapping of available public services (delegacies) for victims of violence throughout Brazil. The app has a variety of services. From knowledge information on women's rights and a news feed with collaboration from media agencies, to mapping of women's police stations and care services that make it possible to trace the closest route or access, to panic buttons to request help when needed and confidential dialogue networ ks to share experiences and offer support, and finally offering a quick mechanism to capture evidence of the abuse by activating audio recording. The demand for the app increased during the COVID -19 pandemic, as well as increasing support from a variety of partners. Given the increasing closure o f civil society spaces and the rise in online and physical abuse towards vulnerable population s, projects like this could be used to promote similar strategies in other countries and regions. Case study #5: L&L - A space for weaving collective power for women's rights and social justice The Linking and Learning meetings were an important space within the LFS Programme. Participants to the Linking and Learning events included the MFA, all four LFs and some of thei r local partners. In each L&L meeting, funders from other women's funds62 also took part. So far, four L&L events have been held.63 Collective assessments of the L&L spaces included mappings of what has worked and where there is room for improvement, the r esources required to strengthen feminist and indigenous women's movements, the roles of the four LFs, their relationship with the MFA and their shared vision on women's empowerment and agency. In total Achievements so far include the following: 64 Strate gic Planning and technical expertise development: LFS has been a catalysing force for the Funds, since it allowed different systems and processes to be adjusted, adapted, and improved. Moreover, the programme was flexible and allowed for the harmonization of the ToCs developed by the LFs, with a new collective ToC developed in the new phase of the programme. Political and policy pathways of change and coordination: The L&L activities helped the LFs to learn from each other political and strat egic lessons, sharing best practices regarding how to influence policies and attitudes. This is true for lobbying, which has taken place both regionally 62 For ex. Prospera, Mama Cash and APWR. 63 1st L&L in Sri Lanka Organised by WFA, (Oct. 21 -22, 2017); 2nd L&L organised FMS (Nov. 3rd in Ghana, organised by the AWDF (Nov. 2 -4, 2019), and the 4th L&L event hosted virtually by FIMI (Nov. 23 -26, 2020). 64 \"Knowledge and hands together.\" Report of the 4th meeting of Linking and Learning -LFS, Nov. 23 -26, 2020. 49 and globally. For example, the LFs mentioned \"now being able to publicise our partners at global events and undertake thematic campaigns in the Global South\", (...) as well as \"adopting virtual format for meeting and fieldwork, essential for effectively developing ideas, collaborating, building trust, and strengthening relationships\". One pending topic is the creation of the Program Group, a fourth workgroup, where lessons learned may be shared. We are considering different options. L&L as a process of sharing knowledge and integrating transformative powers particularly for those more vulnerable: the L&L work was according to the LFs a \"critical part of their movement building, strengthening the movement for women's rights by generating new links and networks and reinforcing advocacy\" (2 L&L report, 2018 Argentina). A good example was the Disability Rights Convening (6 -8 February 2020 in Colombo, Sri Lanka). This was held as part of WFA's LFS L&L strategy and brought together twenty -eight disability rights activists from eight countries. They shared their experiences, organised strategies and laid out future aspirations for women and trans -led disability rights movements. The event made visible the specific needs and rights of trans women living with disabilities, as there are often overlo oked within women's groups.65 65 Cf. Disability Rights Convening Report, 6 -8 February 2020, Colombo, Sri Lanka 50 4. CONCLUSIONS The LFS I programme was a relevant programme that sought to address the lack of direct support to women -led organisations in the Global South. It succeeded in reaching a wide range of organis ations across the Global South and provided them with flexible grants, supported capacity building initiatives, promoted their ability to advocate and lobby on issues on equality and other related issues. It also contributed to build ing partnerships across strategic regional and global alliances that continue to provide critical spaces for South -South learning and progress. A wide range of women and girls across the countries targeted benefited from the grants as the funds provided the grantee with the ability to expand on their activities and contribute to i nfluencing policy shifts at various levels including at the local level and valorisation women's roles in the public policy arena , in the status of intersectionally discriminated persons, public budg etary exercises and social protection schemes, climate change, women's rights to sustainable livelihoods, and enhancing processes of law reforms or contributing to the drafting of new laws at the national level. It is also concluded that the grants contrib uted to individual and collective trajectories of women's empowerment. The choice of the LFs was a particular reason for success. They provided both general and one -to-one support to the grantees and created a horizontal relationship of friendship and sup port that was considered by the grantees as the utmost reason for success. The design of the programme also provided grantees with the autonomy to select projects based on their expertise, and to identi fy the most pressing issues/challenges for the women i n their communities. It was concluded that generally, the grants were efficiently used by the grantees, with VfM ensured, and overall sufficient funds were provided. However, the outbreak of the COVID -19 had significant implications for the grantees. Activ ities long planned had to be cancelled or delayed, grantees also encountered difficulty in building networks or continuing with advocacy activities. Further, COVID -19 worsened the economic conditions of the communities with whom the grantees were working, as well as one of the grantees and their programme teams. In these conditions, for the grantees, a critical limitation was the inflexibility that the LFS to extend the timeframe of work, as well as to use the resources for emergency aid and support. Finall y, the pandemic contributed to further shrinking civil society spaces and clamping down of feminist organisations. On the other side, COVID -19 created spaces for innovation and adaptation with grantees seeking innovat ive approaches to engage their stakehol ders. Overall, the evaluation observed a high degree of sustainability of the LFS I, as most organisations succeeded in having the required capacity to build on the gains of the LFS I. As indicated by the grantees, many grassroots organisations succeeded in building capacity and empowering women in their local communities to advocate for their rights. Additionally, there are technological and communication building and advances due to the inadvertent effects of the pandemic, and most organisations are in a better place to engage with local and international partners virtually, as also adopt virtual programming approaches, which has enhanced sustainability and the effective functioning of the organisations. In the next section, specific recommendations in f our cross -cutting areas are provided that hopefully can increase the results, efficiency, coherence, and sustainability of the programme in the next phase of the programme. 51 5. RECOMMENDATIONS Below we present the recommendations of this report divided in to four main areas. The analysis includes specific responsibilities and level of response. Furthermore, as a request from the MFA, an analysis of the actions taken in response to the recommendations given in the MTR are provided in Annex F. Areas of focus Recommendations Responsibility Level of Response66 On supporting resilience, adaptability and responses to challenges Promoting smaller thematic dialogues/workshops amongst grantees with common interests. These do not always need to be organised completely by the LFs but could rather be delegated to grantees with specific expertise in those areas. LFs Immediate Continu ing and expanding exchange programmes but setting up specific objectives on which the participants will have to work for at least the timeframe of their grants. If possible, agree to specific deliverables which could include the preparation of case studies , presentations, or workshops for the LFs community. LFs Immediate Making use of virtual spaces to facilitate these more frequent encounters, including those already existing (e.g., FMS Toolbox). In this area, it will be important to share best practices amongst all other LFs to avoid \"reinventing the wheel\" or duplicating efforts. LFs Medium Including systematic risk and conflict analysis in MFA's dialogues with the four LFs. MFA Immediate On promoting coordination, linking & Learning Continuing and expanding exchange programmes but setting up specific objectives on which the participants will have to work for at least the timeframe of their grants. If possible, agree to specific deliverables which could include the preparation of case studies, presentations, or workshops for the LFs community. LFs Medium Consider setting common reporting formats across the regions, particularly for grantees who are receiving funding from various LFs. LFs Medium One area in which exchange programmes could lead to more long -term relations and aid the geographical expansion of the LFs will be to promote cross learning in regard to proposal/grant writing. LFs Medium Making use of virtual spaces to facilitate more frequent encounters, including those already existing (e.g., FMS Toolbox). In this area, i t will be important to share best practices amongst all other LFs to avoid \"reinventing the wheel\" or duplicating efforts. LFs Immediate A process of integrating Dutch Diplomatic Missions in countries where the programme is implemented will be useful for its sustainability. However, keep in mind the importance of not creating additional workload into already stretched LFs or diminishing the ir decision -making power. For this, the relationship with the embassies needs to be purposeful, setting specific limits and areas where coordination and articulation are necessary. The presentation of MFA Immediate 66 Immediate response, medium -term and long term. 52 Areas of focus Recommendations Responsibility Level of Response66 this evaluation and the regional end line reviews could be a way to introduce them to the results that have been achieved already in their regions. Include former grantees in the linking and learning processes, regardless of if they are no longer a grantee. If funding to have them in physical s paces is limited, at least allow them to participate and collaborate in virtual spaces. LFs Medium On measuring change/results and VFM Change and results need to be measured from a longer -term and qualitative perspective. The process of setting a common ToC and using flexible indicators is already in progress, nonetheless, additional progress could be achieved by considering specific tools and methodologies that facilitate measuring the pathways of change (progress and process to achieve a specific result ) and understanding key limitations and challenges. MFA/LFs Immediate Increase the support, particularly within grassroots organisations, for the monitoring and reporting processes, including the use of qualitative methodologies. LFs Medium Pilot direct conversations between the MFA Task force and the grantees on the different expectations when reporting outcomes and outputs. Use more experienced grantees to set training/schools in this area. MFA/LFs Medium Start a collective discussion on the con cept of VfM and how to measure it and set a framework to evaluate it in future evaluations . If the methodology is to continue to be used in future evaluations, grantees will need to start considering ways in which intangibles are considered (e.g., activists' commitment, solidarity/mutual support, time/happiness lost, and risks taken amongst oth ers). MFA/LFs Immediate On accompanying long term change and sustainability Continue with some of the changes implemented in LFS II to increase projects timeframes and flexibility (see Annex F, MFA Recommendations #5) and communicate this to the grantees, so there is an idea of the progress in regard to their recommendations. MFA /LFs Medium Review the exclusion of Southern countries like Chile and Uruguay from the list of potential beneficiaries . As mentioned in the case studies this has been highly disputed by regional organisations which signal s how bigger and more economicall y powerful countries (India, China) are still part of the ODA list. MFA Immediate Allow additional funding and timeframes to be allocated towards core support, particularly for grassroots organisations. Emphasise the importance of having sustainability and exit strategies amongst the grantees and use best practices from other organisations to give new ideas on how to do it. MFA/LFs Immediate Continue showcasing the LFS and its results as a transformative mechanism to provide voice and de cision -making to the women in the Global South, specifically focusing on sustainability beyond the end of the second phase. MFA/LFs Medium Start conversations between the LFs and other regional feminist organisations from the Global South about how to achieve greater financial independence in the future. This could include crowdfunding across other women/men and LBTQIA that support the Feminist Movement, and who might want to get involved. MFA/LFs Immediate 53 6.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The below ethical considerations were adopted throughout the assignment. They guided the interaction between the consultancy team and the target groups and ensured inclusivity, participation and the safety and convenience of those that will participate in the evaluation. These principles are in line with the Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation (UNEG 2008)67 to ensure the credibility and integrity of the evaluation process and produ cts. Confidentiality: To protect the confidentiality of the respondents, the team has not cited the names of the respondents in the report and did not ask for names during the field data collection. The dataset has been made available to the MFA after submission of the final report, as a basis for future updates. Quality Control: The consultants monito red the validity and quality of the data throughout the data collection period. Data entry and analysis was done gradually. Quality control mechanisms was built in through triangulation and regular feedback loops. Triangulation: The verification and valid ation of data and probing of issues from different perspectives took place by repeatedly asking the various respondent groups the same questions in a slightly different way. A master list of questions was consolidated in Annex B and used for the data conso lidation. Progressive Data Analysis: To ensure maximum quality and completeness, data entry and analysis took place throughout the research period. Where appropriate, the team has presented the data in graphs, disaggregated against relevant categories. Language and Translation: Data collection took place in as many local languages as possible, but mainly using English, French, Portuguese and Spanish. Translations in Nepalese, Hindi/Urdu and Thai were also offered and used. Transcripts and the evaluation r eport and interviews were translated all to English. Intersectional Feminist principles: Feminist evaluation (FE) principles were embedded within the evaluation questions and the methodological approach in general. The evaluation team provided space for th eir application of the principles of autonomy, choice, empowerment and meaningful engagement. This aims to get empirical findings to advocate for social change and ensure a participatory outlook focusing on empowering women who endure intersectional discrimination and promoting social justice agendas.68 Our intersectional feminist approach acknowledged the fact that women are not a homogenous social group. Women an d girls can endure intersecting forms of discrimination that go beyond gender -based discrimination to include discrimination based on race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, disability status, migrancy/displacement, to name but a few. The approach was in clusive of diversity and paid attention to the unequal power relations informing the policies and practices that hamper women's enjoyment of their fundamental rights and impinge on their power to influence decision making processes (at local, national and international level s). Acknowledgement of indigenous women's knowledge, on equal terms with feminist knowledge, was also an important part of this evaluation process . At the request of FIMI, two open questions were added to the Google survey (see Table wit h a summary of responses to questions #15 and #16 in Annex 67 United Nations Evaluation Group, UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation, March 2008 68 UNEG Integrating Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluations 2011, Podems 2014 and 2010. 60 H below). Two major findings from the responses are: a total of 50 (out of 183) respondents across the 4 LFs answered these two questions. This demonstrates the intersectional inclusiveness of the LFS. Secondly, questions related to spirituality are also relevant to feminist women's rights organisations, in the sense that they are part of a \"feminist theology,\" as illustrated by the responses from the women's organisation Cat\u00f3licas por el Derecho a Decidir (Catholics for the Right to Decide). Sensitivity: All tools have been designed and adapted to the context. To avoid controversial or inappropriate word use, the MFA and LFs revised all the Tools produced and adapted them as necessary. The team memb ers were all aware of their moral responsibilities towards all participants in the research and are highly experienced in conducting data collection on sensitive topics and in complex cultural settings, and signed the Code of Conduct in Annex X. Safety and Respect: Throughout the research, the team put the safety and security of participants first. This meant the cancel lation and postponement of interviews, the use of online tools that will better guard against online security threats (use of Signal, Pro tonMail and encrypted Zoom private rooms). Furthermore, times for the interviews were adapted to the needs and time zones of those interviewed, which meant that in certain cases the interviews were done after midnight or before down for the Evaluation Team . Confidentiality and protection: The team used measures to ensure compliance with the evaluator code of conduct including measures to safeguard the rights, safety and confidentiality of the individual and communities interviewed, and provisions to store and maintain security of collected information and protocols to ensure anonymity and confidentiality. The team always explained the principle of confidentiality and anonymity to all participating in this research, and this information was included in all tools. Due to the potentially sensitive nature of information disclosed, the data collection method followed the mechanisms described in the previous points. Also, no names will be recorded during the interviews and no interviews were recorded. No pictures of respondents, revealing their identity, was taken. Informed Consent: The evaluation team respected the principles of voluntary participation. In line with the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) \"Handbook on Data Protection in Humanitarian Actio n\",69 the Team to verified that the respondents understood \"the risks and benefits involved in participating in the research and to exercise his/her right to object and to provide valid consent where applicable.\"70 The decision to participate was based on free will and participants were made aware that they may withdraw from the data collection process at any time.71 69 ICRC (co -editors: Kuner, Christopher and Marelli, Massimo). on Protection Humanitarian Action.

DATA COLLECTION TOOLS Presentation and consent text The TFVG, part of the Department for Social Development (DSO) at the Dutch MFA would like to thank you and appreciate the time and information you are sacrificing to participate in this important and valuable study. The objective of this end -term evaluation is to understand whether the goals of the MFA gender policy framework and the LFS women's funds have been achieved, and if so, how . The assessment also goes beyond the scope of a single geographical fund and will cover the results and learnings across all grantee organisations. This assessment aims at improving the implementation, use of resources, accountability and identify lessons learnt and good practices for the project to grow and better adapt in the future. This research is being developed by Transtec and Transition International and includ es four expert advisors with more than 60 years of combined experience , with the four international experts bringing solid experience in the area of women's rights and gender equality . All experts are fluent in English, three are native Spanish speakers, a ll have working experience in French, and one is a native Arabic speaker.

EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS AGAINST MTR RECOMMENDATIONS RESPONSES TO RECOM MENDATIONS TO PARTNERS OVERALL STRATEGY AND COORDINATION Recommendation 1: Expand the learning and linking initiative to promote learning among grantee partners across regions and across movements ALL: continued with the annual coordination meetings, with participation of the current grantees. This was done virtually during t he COVID -19 pandemic. Many of the events planned for the last year of imp lementation (2020) were put on hold because of the pandemic but expect to be restarted in the new phase of the programme. FMS: Added parallel thematic sessions for grantees working on the same themes to discuss results and lessons learned in smaller gr oups. For example, in the III Regional Grantees Meeting, they organised a session on best practices for advocacy strategies. Based on recommendations made by grantees during the II Regional Meeting (held in Colombia, in 2018) a digital Toolbox was de veloped a nd implemented in the FMS website. This digital instrument was devised to promote the Exchange of learning materials, methodologies, audio -visual products among former and actual grantees. More focus will be put in the Toolbox during Phase II. The implemen ted an exchange programme to encourage learning between organisations, with each of the exchange organisations traveling to l earn from each other and document their findings. These exchange programmes, for example resulted in key cases of success such as t he \"Pretas initiative\". WFA: Implemented and documented many L&L convergence reports in thematics such as Environmental Justice Meeting; Disability Rights Convening; South Asia Convening; South -East Asia Convening; Internal MEL Review; and Regional Convergence on Resourcing. AWDF : AWDF was part of the FIMI partners meeting that took place in Kenya in 2018/2019. Moreover, during the Linking and learning meeting held in Accra grantee partners from across the Middle East and Africa working on diverse labour issues were brought together to share learning and learn from each other. FIMI: During the last c oordination meetings, given that it was implemented virtually, FIMI produced audio -visual material based on the interviews held with indigenous leader women and women leaders from the consortium's funds. FIMI organised and directly involved the other part ner Funds in the participation in the L&Ls. This has meant that our partners have been able to make direct contact with the other consortiums. This allowed many of the grantees to also receive complementary funding from other funds. For Phase II, additiona l cross - regional/cross -LFs meetings are expected. RESOURCE MOBILISATION Recommendation 2: Undertake thematic reviews and consider diversification of grantee portfolio based on the reviews (strengthen or expand investments in grants that provide holistic security to women's rights organizations) FMS: In 2020 published \"Activism in times of pandemics\" with the contributions from all members. \"Activisms in pandemic\" call was launched in 2020, in which one of the eligible actions was \"to develop and implement sustainability strategies that institutionally strengthen organisations and groups, especially considering the proximity of the end of the support of the FM S (design and implementation of exit strategies, training in resource developm ent, among others)\". Grantee organisations for the first cohort were also allowed to submit proposals to this special call. 2 publications and 2 workshops on resource mobilisation. An open channel remained between the partners who participated in th e works hops. WFA: They believe their thematic priorities are broad enough to ensure significant diversity of sub -issues. However, they have introduced another theme of 'emerging issues' to capture issues that are not covered under their thematic areas. Also, they will be undertaking a strategy review in 2020, which will review 77 RESPONSES TO RECOM MENDATIONS TO PARTNERS their thematic priorities in light of the impact of the COVID -19 crisis in the region. They are undertaking a series of institutional strengthening processes, including a detailed strategic review along with LFS Final Evaluation, a consultative process to build our MEL systems and tools, and developed a communications strategy paper. A number of institutional policies and systems were developed. AWDF: The process to review SPIV (2017 - 2021) is underway, however, they noticed that a number of grantees were working on VAWG issues using diverse strategies. As a result, a convening on evidence -based strategies for addressing VAWG was held in order to put together a primer for WROs to address VAWG. Continue to provide a flexible budgeting mechanism for grantees that allowed them to invest 50% of their grants in institutio nal development, however, grantees deemed it appropriate to meet their needs. In addition, each grantee was provided with USD 9,000 every year of their grant to invest in capacity building areas that ensured the viability and sustainability of the organisation. FIMI: Continuous re -definition, reinforcement and adjustment of modalities, strategies, and tools for grant -making as a whole, as well as for MEL and communication, according to the needs of the partners, the Ministry and FIMI itself. A strategy of close personalised accompaniment was built for each organisation through constant meetings, emails, calls to ov ercome. Evaluati on forms for the revision of reports have been included. FIMI works with and for the safety of indigenous women activists who suffer violence for their activism in the framework of t he movement itself and with all its programmes in a cross -cutting manner, through the political participation and advocacy programme, the global leadership school and the research and impact area (observatory against violence). During the implementation of the programme, under pandemic, communication actions have been constantly maintained to create an effective link between the organisations and donors covering emergency expenses (emergency kits have been granted). Recommendation 3: Support grantees to develop exit strategies ALL: different ways of exit' strategies, whether through training and capacity development, or supporting grantees with references and accessing other fun ds FMS: FMS developed a formal exit strategy for the programme in order to allow a soft landing for grantees and provide for a grou p instance to reflect on and formally close the programme. During 2020, FMS also allocated special grants to support strategic actions (the development an d implementation of joint advocacy strategies and/or an exit strategy). Design and implementation of a n integral capacity building scheme on key issues, including resource mobilization capacities. Special call \"Activismo en Pandemia\" (\"Activism under the pandemic\"): a closed call for LFS members (42 were presented and 16 were approved) that arose to cover for activities that were not being carried out due to the pandemic. One of the results: 3 LFS organisations (Azmina, Mo vimiento Campesino, and Balance) were selected by the \"Equality Fund\" (a feminist, activist, and global fund from Canada). The loc al resource area of FMS generated an initiative \"ACTIVATE HERMANA\" (Activate Sister) to implement resource development strate gies (i.e., fund organisations so that they can generate resources). WFA: They undertook their role in Asia as an institutional cha nge (from SAWF to WFA), rather than just a 'four -year project' for us. In the short span of four years 78 RESPONSES TO RECOM MENDATIONS TO PARTNERS WFA has established its identity as a feminist philanthropic institution in the region, committed to its role to mobilise res ources from a range of donor s, to ensure that the resources required for feminist movement building are readily available They recognized the need to define 'sustainability,' especially in a changing socio -political, legal, and resource landscape, for both WFA and grantee -partners, in their respective contexts; and therefore, the need to investigate the long -term financial security of partners, given that they are human rights organisations, and not social enterprises. AWDF: AWDF's contract agreement with its grantees specifies the ru les that govern the partnership agreement. Besides, AWDF provides resource mobilisation training as part of support to strengthen Grantees fundraising capacity, links to other funding sources, as well as reference s for their resource mobilisation. FIMI: FIMI works with LFS partner organisations on a continuous basis and through the circularisation of programmes where experiences, k nowledge and previous executions are rescued in order to strengthen the organisations and the projects they have implemented. There is also the concept of circularisation between the calls of the AYNI Fund itself, in which the partner organisations pre sent themselves and the previous good execution is highlighted. (e.g., we carry out scaling -up projects among others). An exit stra tegy is also related to the training that FIMI has provided and that they provide systematically on project design, logical f rameworks, reporting, evaluation, so that the organisations can and know how to refer to other donors in an autonomous and efficien t way. Recommendation 4: Collaborate to explore new funding mechanisms for women's rights ALL: have explored funding mechanisms outside LFS for women's rights. FMS: Design and implementation of an integral capacity building scheme supported on a training programme on key issues, including resource mobilization capacities. Advocacy actions from FMS to explore support mechanisms to help organisations. 16 LFS members were selected on the special call \"Activismo en Pandemia\". 3 LFS organisations were selected by the \"Equality Fund\" (a feminist, activist, and global fund from Canada). The organisations were: Azmina, Movimien to Campesino, and Balance) WFA: To increase the length of the duration of grant support with allocating more funds towards core support. WFA, both as an individual fund but also as a part of a varied consortiums they have been able to access new/ more flexible f unding. One example in this regard is the Surge Fund supported by Gates and is in partnership with UAF -Africa and US . There is also the Resilience Fund in partnership with Women Win. AWDF: AWDF manages the Equality Fund, a partnership leveraged a good collaborative work exhibited under the LFS Initiative. FIMI: FIMI is now working on restructuring and strengthening the AYNI Fund, in an attempt to further intensify the articulation and coordinated efforts among the different areas in the organisation. To this end specifically, the AYNI FUND team incorporated a Programme Coordinator, a Mon itoring & Evaluation Officer, and an Institutional Strengthening Officer. FIMI participates in the selection committee of the Pawanka Indigenous Fund and has favoured networking between LFS partners and the Fund to facilitate new financing. FIMI has also learnt and transferred knowledge f rom this Fund, which has mutually enriched the individual actions. 79 RESPONSES TO RECOM MENDATIONS TO PARTNERS For phase 2 of the programme , joint actions between the 4 funds are planned, which will strengthen all the actions implemented during phase 1 of the programme in the areas of administrative /financial, communication and MEL. ADVOCACY Recommendation 5: Develop a joint advocacy strategy for LFS ALL: Examples from collective actions on advocacy: The production of a video from the consortium, \"what is leading from the south\" : an advocacy product; Seminary \"Leading from the South Impact and Lessons learnt\" in Sept 2020, prepared and presented by the 4 L FS funds, with more than 100 participants and in two languages (Spanish and English); Participation in the Human Rights Network; and Presentation of the document: \"Donor Brie f on Funding South\" FMS: FMS foster joint advocacy among organisations working on the same issues across the region for greater synergies and impact. FMS fostered joint advocacy among the four women's funds to advance key issues and give visibility to the LFS model / \"brand\" , an agenda was to be discussed. The implementation of that ag enda will take place via the participation in regional/international conferences/forums/meetings. FMS believes that exploring the development of a mentoring programme within the framework of the special initiative in suppor t of advocacy events (whereby novice organizations could be paired with more experienced ones for shadowing during the days of the event in question to have a stronger hands -on learning experience) is quite paternalist. Their strategy is to facilitate each organisation to have its own voi ce in key advocacy spaces. The exchange programme and special support programme for participation in events in order to alleviate their budgets were imp lemented. However , during the pandemic this was suspended for most of the year 2020. WFA: Working with sister funds and also on better showcasing the LFS model as a Southern Led Justice Work. We would like to note that over the last two years has significant spaces which was occupied by us as a LFS consortium as well. AWDF: A joint proposal was developed un der the LFS PII initiative/project. FIMI: Create a clear, consistent, and strongly recognized brand. A webinar of the LFS EDs has had a strong impact and has strengthened the process of trust and joint work for a common goal. These previous steps of collaboration - data during the first phase - and that have been carried out in the 4 years of implementation have produced the construction of a collective advocacy strategy that has been formulated for the proposal phase 2 and that is evidenced in the co llective proposal, in its collective ToC and is also read in the actions of the individual proposals. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND LEARNING Recommendation 6: Undertake long term evaluation of LFS programme ALL: The Linking and Learning Process took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina in November 2018 together with the sister Women's Fund s of the Consortium. This event, whose preparation was successfully carried out by FMS, counted on the participation of the MFA, a nd other important allies like Mama Cash and Prospera International Network. In the frame of this event, the sister Founds, their teams, partner organizations and strategic allies shared their views and prospective for the implementation of the second half of the program, but also to introduce the necessary improvements with the lessons learnt resulting from the MTR Process to be implemented during 2019. FMS: Systematized the experience with LFS, including key strategies, challenges and lessons learned, in order to capitalize on the experience and strengthen its visibility as a best practice with regards to grant -making mechanisms in support of women\u00b4s rights o rganizations. WFA: 80 RESPONSES TO RECOM MENDATIONS TO PARTNERS WFA started ensuring more engagement and interaction with all partners of various collaboration and consortium grants which w ere approved under the second call of LFS 1.0 (2018 - 2019). Moving forward, this practice will further be strengthened under LFS 2.0 through our grants monitoring and learning processes. Used the learning lens in every aspect of their work and shared their feedback with their partners and networks. So, for inst ance, L&L has been a key in the finance capacity b uilding spaces which has been created under LFS. It helps groups connect with us, with one another while at the same time you have strengthening of systems of finance and governance. AWDF: During the L&L meetings, host WF invited her Grantees to create a s pace to connect with others. FIMI: Linking of the programme's administrative area to the partners' support team by creating a grant -making area which addresses our partners as a priority and holds dialogue with FIMI areas in interconnection with the progra mme. During the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020 FIMI encouraged partners' political participation in L&L, through funding of their projects, by organisin g regional preliminary events \u2014 specifically, the 2nd World Conference of Indigenous Women, which resulted in the creation of regional agendas for Indigenous Women within the Movement. Additionally, joined by a variety of key stakeholders such as the international donor community, indigen ous organisations, and social media, FIMI offered a series of webinars throu gh its multiple programmes. These online events, to which the partners were formally invited, served as platforms for political dialogue. COMMUNICATIONS Recommendation 7: Use communications tools more strategically, in addition to the communication material that has already been produced ALL: A roundtable webinar was also convened to increase the visibility of the initiative and promote conversations around it. The highly patronised webinar featured the Executive Directors of the 4 LFs and also the MFA. The Communications Working Group set out to position LFS as a key partner in global philanthropy. This was done with the prod uction of 2 animated videos highlighting the importance of resourcing women's funds, and also showcasing the imp act of LFS in the global south. FMS: FMS's \" Voices on the ground\" illustrates the voices of the protagonists / grantees, where they tell a case study/ a story of change (10 gra ntees / stories). WFA: WFA's Communication policy and strategy has been developed. FIMI: Continues generating visibility for LDS and the Fund's partners, with more outreach networks and the media. The system for the elaboration and systematisation of data has been improved by building specific matrices with appropriate p ersonnel for their systematic reading and reporting. We have bu ilt a new FIMI website, intensified and improved the use of social media to showcase the stories and achievements of our members. Recommendation 8: Strengthen communication with donors, MFA in particular ALL: Have fluid communication with the MFA and other donors through a focal point (each fund). FMS: Communication was quite fluid. FMS had one L&L meeting per year where the donor participates, and a \"Dialogue and Dissent\" me eting where they also participated. Constant contact via email and the establi shment of focal points by each fund. 81 RESPONSES TO RECOM MENDATIONS TO PARTNERS Dialogues with embassies and specific funds remain with Sweden, Canada, etc. WFA: Through a committed program officer, they have been able to strengthen communication with donors etc. They had had more resource mobili zing conversations. AWDF: There is a well -established process to communicate with MFA. Each woman fund will take turns to do the coordination for a year. Moreover, the periodic physical and online meetings provided an avenue for a cordial working relatio nship between WFs and MFA. FIMI: Communication with the Ministry has always been based on great respect, listening and mutual collaboration, on recommendation s and suggestions on FIMI reporting but also on the construction of MEL strategies and indicators. Another relevant aspect has been the transmission of information to the Ministry in a spontaneous way, as in the case of the reports made by our partners, the participation of the Ministry in political events organised by FIMI, as well as the relationship with the gender area and the construction of indicators with the MEL area of the Ministry. RECOM MENDATIONS TO THE MFA OVERALL STRATEGY AND COORDINATION Recommendation 1: Consider the funds allocated to grantees for linking and learning as grant funding and not as a separate capacity building grant The Linking & Learning is included as a separate budget item in the overall budget for LFS II and does not fall under the 15% overhead. Partners also saw that enough flexibility was available to move funds between budget lines and thus did not see the need for it. Some Funds also thought th at it makes sense for the lines to be separate. By separating it, the purpose of the strategy is met and in reality, it has also tr anslated in more groups/ activists being able to Access strategic networking and advocacy related support funds. Yet, as this is a sensitive point and deserves a thorough analysis looking at its pros and cons, but overall, it may represent an opportunity w orth investigating. As a result, this was not a result adapted in the policy framework for LFS II. Recommendation 2: LFS should consider the recruitment of a coordinator that supports and maintains the flow of communication across the four WFs This reco mmendation was followed up, with. the LF's designating one fund as main focal point (rotating annually) to coordinate all communication to a nd from the MFA. This seems to be working very well and has continued into phase II. Yet the LFs agreed that the fig ure of a coordinator was not really necessary, as they have sufficient mechanisms to coordinate among themselves and across individual members. Besides that, other mechanism to improve coordination are being put in place. FMS: A formal Term of Reference will be developed for the Advisory Board (for LFS in just LA). In addition, a proposal will be made in order to ope rationalize the Advisory Board in a more operational structure, probably integrated by one Programme Coordinator per Fund represent ed in the Advisory Board. This operational structure would allow to ground the contextual socio -political discussions. It accompanied different processes during LFS I, as an advisory board. Extra funds for this did not happen. 82 RECOM MENDATIONS TO THE MFA Face to face meetings among the Alliance of Women's Funds in Latin America will be held to discuss political and strategic issues regarding the con text and LFS response. The first meeting was in Buenos Aires in 2018, and in 2019 in Cordoba for partner selection. And then when t he policy framework came out, we met again to look at the collaborative implementation of the LFSII proposal. AWF: As in recommendation 3 below. It would be useful to have additional specific fund (10 -15%) for coordination. In the past PAWHR through the a ccompaniment initiative supported the work of the working groups and some of the coordination work. It would be rather more useful to have more coordination support rather than a separate coordinator for us as funds. AWDF: Coordination of communication is still handled by the funds. A coordinator has not been recruited yet. FIMI: Another relevant aspect is precisely the need for the production of evidence, stories and lessons learned as a consortium, results of the collective L&L of the 4 Funds among othe rs, from an impartial and external point of view and not as an evaluation. RESOURCE MOBILISATION Recommendation 3: Make additional investments into building capacity of these funds by leveraging other funding resources As mentioned in recommendation #6, the Accompaniment Initiative compensated for the lack of support from the MFA at the consortium level. Thi s helped to consolidate the Joint MEL Report. There is incertitude about how this will be done in the second phase as the initiativ e has been finalized. Some LFs said that it would be very interesting to carry out advocacy for more funds, jointly between the MFA and the LFS consortium. The MFA acknowledged the need for the funds to receive additional investments to build their capacit y in light of the expansion made possible by LFS funding and admitted that for the LFS II there was no possibility for the MFA to make such additional investments. Yet, the capacity has been developed in such a way that the need for capacity might be lower now, finally the MFA decided to double the total amount for LFS II (from \u20ac42m for 4 years to \u20ac80m for 5 years). Recommendation 4: Provide more time between disbursement of the LFS funds and call for applications from prospective grantees This was discus sed with the LF's, and more time has been provided to them since. Some of LF's also mentioned that they did not see the need for additional changes as their previous call for proposals worked well. Yet other mentioned that it would be really effective to h ave more time for the preparation of the calls for proposals, in order to be able to make the necessary adjustments, changes and modifications as a result of the analysis o f the previous calls, to carry out a diagnosis with the partner organisations and in this way to improve and adjust the system of calls for proposals according to the real requirements of the Funds, but above all of the indigenous women's organisations that want to participate in accessing these types of funds. It is possible that the add itional year given for implementation of the LFSII will allow this additional support in proposal writing. Recommendation 5: Provide flexible, long -term funding The LF's were given flexibility to increase timeframes as long as they met the duration of their own contract, for legal and budgetary terms. As such there was no flexibility to extend projects beyond December 30th, 2021. Some of the flexible arrangements included: Allowing Individual mid -sized and large organisations selected during the first call for proposals could apply again in the second call for proposals but integrating a new consortium. This decision was justified on the need to increase the financial access opportunity to new groups and orga nisations and to su pport continuity and sustainability of successful initiatives of the first phase. For the new phase, FMS is proposing 4-year long term funding for grassroots organisations (who need more long -term support), as a strategy for sustainability. For WFA, groups under all three categories will be eligible to apply for a support up to 3 years (as opposed to 2 years for Amplifying Voices and Promoting Regional Feminist Agendas under LFS 1.0). In terms of allocating more funds for core support, as the focus of LFS i s lobby and advocacy. 83 RECOM MENDATIONS TO THE MFA Additional funding and timeframes will be particularly allocated towards core support in LFS II. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND LEARNING Recommendation 6: Undertake long term evaluation of LFS programme As LFS came to an end on 31stof December 2020, the MFA is requested an end evaluation of the overall LFS program, to be conducted by an external (team of) consultant(s). The overall objective of the end -term evaluation was to gain insight into the extent to which the main goals of thi s policy framework and the LFS women's funds have been achieved, and if so, through which evidence can this achievement be substantiated. Given this recomme ndation we focused on providing sufficient evidence and tools for future implementation. This Evalua tion also supports the continuous use of qualitative monitoring techniques such as outcome mapping, most significant change or outcome harvesting, which also have a longer -term vision of outcomes. For future evaluations, the LFs requested for the ToRs to be shared with them in advance as to guarantee that these reviews were provided all required information for the portfolio level evaluations. COMMUNICATIONS Recommendation 7: Continue to showcase the LFS programme The MFA has taken this recommendation in fully by showcasing the LFS in online fora or international panel discussions (e.g., Paris Peace Forum) and in bilateral conversations with other donors. Yet, the MFA believes more could be done in this area to show case the results of this flagship program and have integrated this ambition into their annual plan for 2022. The LFs recognize this effort and see the LFS as a program that showcased in itself and has become a paradigm for feminist programmes as mentioned in Finding #5. Analysis: Despite not all MTR recommendations were implemented, the LFs presented strong reasoning for the delays and/or not following them. Th is analysis, nonetheless, helped to identify recommendations that are more applicable. All four LFs continued with the annual coordination meetings after the MTR and invited each other to be part of these meetings. In particular, FIMI has become a linking organisation given their cross -regional work. Unfortunately, many of the events planned for the last year of implementation (2020) were put on hold because of the COVID - 19 pandemic but expect to be restarted in the new phase of the programme. The adaptati ons to the context in 2020 created a steep curve of learning for all LFs but have created opportunities to create cross -regional connections and create online tools to better share learning. Finally, some of the LFs are starting to pilot thematic/sectoral meetings, to bring organisations with similar interests together under a common agenda. The four LFs have developed different exit strategies, whether through training and capacity development or by giving support to grantees with references and accessing other funds. For example, the local resource area of FMS generated an initiative \"Activate Hermana\" (\"Activate Sister\") to implement resource development strategies. All funds have explored funding mechanisms outside LFS for women's rights. FIMI is working on restructuring and strengthening the AYNI Fund, and through FMS three LFS member organisations we re selected by the \"UN -Equality Fund\" Initiative, while AWDF manages the Equality Fund and AWF has managed to access more flexible funding. Other examples from collective actions on advocacy are the production of a video from the consortium, \"What is leadi ng from the south\", and the Seminary \"Leading from the South Impact and Lessons learnt\" of September 2020, which was prepared and presented by the four LFS funds. More videos w ere developed in the framework of the 4th L&L event (held in 2020 and hosted vir tually by FIMI). 84 Furthermore, the L&L Process took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina in November 2018 together with the sister Women's Funds of the Consortium. This event, whose preparation was successfully carried out by FMS, counted on the participation of the MFA, and ot her important allies like Mama Cash, the Philanthropy Advancing Women's Rigths (PAWHR) and Prospera International Network. In the frame of this event, the sister Founds, their teams, partner organisations and str ategic allies shared their views and prospec tive for the implementation of the second half of the program, but also to introduce the necessary improvements with the less ons learnt resulting from the MTR Process to be implemented during 2019. All four LFs have used communication tools more strategic ally. The best example is their participation in a roundtable webinar to increase the visibility of the initiative and promote conversations around it. The highly sponsored webinar featured the Executive Directors of the four LFs and also the MFA. The Comm unications Working Group set out to position LFS as a key partner in global philanthropy. This was done with the production of two animated videos hig hlighting the importance of resourcing women's funds, and also showcasing the impact of LFS in the global south.72 As mentioned in recommendation #6, the Accompaniment Initiative compensated for the lack of support from the MFA at the conso rtium level. This helped to consolidate the Joint MEL Report. There is incertitude as to how this will be done in the seco nd phase as the initiative has been finalised, and the MFA does not have the possibility to provide for this. It is expected that the additional capacity consolidated by the LFs will decrease the need for this support and that the increase in funding and t imeframe for Phase II will permit to generate this support within the programme. 72https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR -ODh5uqiA&feature=youtu.be ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEowfCG1tTU&feature=youtu.be; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxfGBNeqRNU&feature=youtu.be 85 ANNEX G. INITIAL REVIEW OF PROGRAMMATIC AND CONTEXTUAL ISSUES PER FUND This chapter provides a general description based on an initial review of documents presented by the LFs to the evaluation team. The review included activities undertaken by each Fund, level of funding received, geographical scope/reach, the perception of each organisation as regards their role, their aim, the grantees they supported (numbers, types , geographical locations), the institutions that conducted the endline assessments, a general description of the methodology they applied, general risks and challenges from the implementation of their respective components of the programme and points that should be noted during the conduct of the meta -evaluation. The information has been complemented with information from the initial introductory and methodology -based discussions with the four organisations (done between 6 -17 July 2021). A summary of the main findings is presented at the end of this chapter (cf. p.12). This summary will be used for sharpening the team's methodological approach. Women's Fund Asia (W FA) WFA is a regional women's fund working in South, Southeast and East Asia. The organisation was established in 2004, as a sub -regional organisation known as the South Asia Women's Fund aiming to support women's human rights activists, groups and network s in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The LFS initiative gave them the incentive to become a regional organisation, finally relaunching as WFA in March 2018, and increasing their reach from the initial five countries to eighteen73 now. Their core mandate is to support women, girls, trans, and intersex rights groups and activists in Asia, address the non -availability of resources for rights -related work for these constituencies across the region, and support strategies and interventions des igned, implemented, and led by women, girls, trans, and intersex people. For them, it is important that they are recognised as a facilitator of the many regional, national, and local feminist agendas, rather than as a mere implementer or a financial interm ediary. As such, they provide fiscal, technical support and advocacy, and are aiming to move towards developing a regional mandate, which is informed by those local, national, and sub -regional realities, and is guided by a human rights -based approach. Within the LFS, they aim to (i) position women's funds as playing a crucial role in 'the development of a strong women's movement, connecting grassroots, national and regional with international activity levels;\" (ii) having 'expert understanding of the needs and opportunities of women's rights organisations working for human rights in their contexts,' including new and non -mainstream groups, and all of the above through the strengthening of feminist institutions at national, sub -regional and regional levels.74 The first call for LFS applications went out in January 2017, and 209 applications were received. A final list of sixteen projects was recommended for funding in the following categories: frontline defenders (7); amplifying voices (6) and promoting regi onal feminist agendas (3). The proposed projects cut across sixteen out of the eighteen countries eligible for funding.75 The second call for applications was issued in October 2018. It received 260 applications, 125 of which met the technical criteria and were reviewed. There was a total of 29 projects selected, with fourteen under the frontline defender's 73 South Asia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Timor -Leste, and Vietnam. East Asia: Mongolia 74 LFS Proposal, updated October 2016. 75 WFA, MFA Year 1 Annual Report, 2018. 86 category; eleven amplifying voices grants; and four promoting regional feminist agendas projects. The projects have covered twelve countries, namely Ban gladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, The Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. All of these countries fall under the scope of the WFA. The themes covered by the fund included: autonomy, decisions, and sexual ri ghts; access to justice, environmental justice; movement and labour; and strengthening feminist voices. Of the 49 grants awarded, the greatest number (13) went to grants under the 'Autonomy, decisions and sexuality' and 'Movement and labour' themes. The mo st financial resources were allocated to the 'Movement and labour' and 'Access to justice' themes. In relation to geography, the most grants (9) were awarded to grantee partners based in Thailand, followed by India and Sri Lanka at seven each. Many of the grants in Thailand, Malaysia and India, nonetheless, had either a regional perspective or used Thailand only as a base of operations while benefiting work in other countries ( e.g., Burma/Myanmar). LFS grants were available for a period ranging from 1 - 3 years in the first cycle, and within one year in the second cycle.76 The endline assessment was conducted by the organisation between October 2020 and February 2021, and used an outcome harvesting methodology and quantitative surveys. A total of 48 additio nal outcomes were harvested through the survey, whilst 35 of the initial outcomes were validated through survey responses. Three case studies were also developed across three areas: i) cross -movement fertilis ation and intersectionality (how grantee partner s have been able to bridge divides between different, yet related, human rights movements within their context); ii) building strong, resilient organisations and movements (institutional changes that LFS has affected in grantee partners); iii) defending ri ghts in the COVID -19 era (challenges and strategies used by several grantee partners whose work has been disrupted by the COVID -19 pandemic). The risks, issues and challenges identified in the report that may be of relevance to this evaluation include: There is a recent strong political backlash against human rights -based organisations, with feminist organisations being targeted and thus having increasing security risks. They propose to have conversations in more unconventional mechanisms such as Signal or Telegram (even written KIIs that allow group responses to come in different times, instead of a one off), use Proton emails and allow more time for responses. Each grantee should be asked what tool/platform they want/feel secure using. This also is to b e considered in the criteria of selection. Most partners are working from home or working in rotation, and thus do not have access to the information the team may ask as fast as before. Similar mitigations as above. Translation might be required for some partners (two or three organisations). The team could decide to take those off, but they are the ones that might be the least heard off, or dispose funding initially set for travel for translators/local researchers. Surveys/research tiredness/overburdening (partners have also been personally and institutionally affected during the COVID pandemic and might be unwilling to spend additional time doing this): there were surveys and KIIs done in December 2020 and January t his year. There is both a possibility for duplication and research tiredness. Mitigation is for the expert to review what information already exists during the long documentary review and explain in detail the need for more information. 76 See: WFA, LFS call for proposals, 2017 and 2018. 87 African Women's Development Fund (AWDF) The AWDF was established in 2000 as a pan - African philanthropic, grant making initiative to support the realisation and fulfilment of African women's rights by funding autonomous women's rights organisations in Africa. Through the ir inclusion in the LFS programme, AWDF has allocated grants across the continent as well as in selected countries in the Middle East. The LSF initiative has seen AWDF expand its reach to more MENA countries. The core mandate of the fund is to mobilise fi nancial, human and material resources to support initiatives for transformation led by African women, women's rights organisations and African women's movements. This is championed through their values to inclusively promote African women's rights and lead ership capabilities by maintaining a commitment to transparency and forging global partnerships that reflect the intersectionality of feminist values. Within the LFS, they aim to strengthen Southern women's rights organisations to enable them to influence policy and structures at the local, national, regional and international level that continue to exclude, discriminate and sustain inequalities. They aim to achieve this through the LSF approach to invest in capacity building, promote advocacy and support partnerships that advance women's and girls' rights at individual, community and societal levels. During the life of the project (2017 -2020), AWDF awarded a total of 11777 grants, with 54 of the grantee partners receiving multi - year funding. Additionally , 18 of the organisations which received multi - year funding received an additional year of funding at the end of their first two -year grant. The projects have covered 31 countries (Algeria, Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, Jo rdan, Kenya, Lebanon, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Palestine, Senegal, Somalia, Somaliland, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe), covering most of the countries under the scope of AWDF.1 The themes covered by the fund included: Body & Health Rights; Leadership Participation & Peace; and Economic Security & Justice. Of the 117 grants awarded, the greatest number (63) went to grants under the 'Body & Health Rights'. The most financial resources were allocated to the 'Body & Health Rights' and 'Economic security & Justice' themes. In relation to geography, the most grants (39) were awarded to grantee partners based in West & Central Africa, followed by Southern Africa (34), Ea st Africa (32) and MENA (19). The highest number of grants was given to organisations in Tanzania, Togo, Palestine and Lebanon, at 6 respectively. At the inception of the project in 2017, there were very few proposals received from the MENA region. AWDF a ddressed this by commissioning a mapping exercise in 2017 for MENA, which helped in the identification of organisations that apply for funding as well as the key needs for outreach and grant making. This resulted in increased applications from the region a nd particularly in the Middle East. A 2020 final report and 2017 -2020 final report was conducted by the organisation and completed at the beginning of 2021. As with AWDF , it is not clear from the report what methodology was used and it does not seem to ha ve been implemented by a third party/external organisation. The report included an overview of the grant management approach, consolidated outcomes/results, a reflection on the ToC, challenges and lessons learned, and a review of the partnership between AWDF and the MFA. Judging 77 This is based on the final lis t of grantees provided by AWDF. 88 from interviews, it seems that surveys with a sample of grantees were conducted for this report, but recent changes in staffing makes it difficult to accurately assess the data availability. The risks, issues and challenges identifi ed in the report produced by AWDF and that may be of relevance to this evaluation include: Increased diversity in the project was observed by accommodating the needs of AWDF's Middle East partners, by incorporating Arabic interpreters in capacity building programmes. Amendments to the standard training sessions were made to reflect the multi -dimensionality of African feminism and expand safe spaces for grantee partners. The need for an Arab speaker for interviews is thus key during data collection. The rest rictions of COVID - 19 have seen an increase in violence against women due to enforced stay at home rules, and women have seen their financial autonomy hindered as businesses remain shut and they remain enclosed in unsafe spaces. However, as capacity buildi ng events moved online, AWDF was able to increase capacities and skills, build a community and space for grantee partners to share stories, experiences and strategies and interact with AWDF. AWDF will continue their online programmes, expanding them to rea ch more communities, and this could be an area where unexpected changes could be found by this assessment. International Indigenous Women's Forum/Foro Internacional de Mujeres Ind\u00edgenas (FIMI) FIMI is a network of indigenous women leaders from Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its mission is to bring together indigenous women leaders and human rights activists from different parts of the world to coordinate agendas, build capacity, and to develop leadership roles. FIMI encourages indigenous women's part icipation in international decision -making processes by ensuring the consistent and serious inclusion of indigenous women's perspectives in all discussions regarding human rights.78 As part of the global indigenous women's network, FIMI sees indigenous wom en as \"agents of change\" and \"right holders\" in their own development process and that of their communities. Efforts have been made to promote improved access by indigenous women and girls to management of natural resources, with a view to reducing poverty , food insecurity, and loss of land. In addition to this, and despite progress in terms of indigenous women's ability to exercise their rights, there are still important barriers: limited participation in decision -making processes, lack of power to control their own resources and land rights, and limited access to basic services. These barriers are compounded with gender -based violence in armed conflicts, military contexts, and extractive -industry -associated conflicts. The Indigenous Women's Fund AYNI crea ted and hosted by FIMI focuses specifically on indigenous women and is also run by indigenous women. The Fund supports small indigenous women's organisations in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. This Fund was selected because indigenous women as a group are often overlooked and suffer disproportionately from discrimination, exclusion, and violence. In the 4 years of delivery, the LFS Programme through the AYNI FUND supported 91 international women's organisations and 93 projects for a total am ount of EUR 4,518,826. Of the said fund, USD$ 465,000 went to 33 small organisations, USD$ 2,718,900 went to 38 medium -size organisations, and USD$ 1,703,000 went to 22 large organisations. The grants distribution revealed a large part of partners in Latin America (39) and a relatively similar number in Africa and Asia (28 and 24 respectively).79 FIMI/AYNI also provided funding to eight consortia 78 See: https://www.channelfoundation.org/grants/fimi/ 79 FIMI4 -Year Report pp. 29 -30 89 and has also strengthened its geographical reach, covering the MENA and the Pacific region and a few new countri es in Asia. FIMI/AYNI also supported three regional networks (ECMIA (Americas); AIWO (Africa); and TEBTEBBA (Asia), in addition to two national networks (National Indigenous Women's Federation (Nepal) and Ecommunnis AC (Mexico). In particular, FIMI/AYNI wa s able to strongly leverage the funds to reach out to a significantly large pool of new grantees, 79% of the survey respondents noted that they had not received a grant from FIMI before (Gender at Work 2019, p. 24). The thematic focus of the grants was: i) land, territory and natural resources ii) political advocacy iii) mitigation and adaptation to climate change, iv) access to public services, and v) institution strengthening. Through the introductory interview with the Executive Manager of the Fund, the team learnt that an endline evaluation had been recently undertaken and that it would soon be shared. In addition to this, a 2020 final report and 2017 -2020 final report was conducted by the organisation and completed at the beginning of 2021. As with AWDF , it is not clear from the report what methodology was used and it does not seem to have been implemented by a third party/external organisation. The report included an in - depth review of the context across the organisations involved, a description of the activities implemented, a review of outcomes on partnerships and alliances, and some key conclusions. From interviews it seems surveys and KIIs with a sample of grantees were conducted for this report. This information has now been provided. The risks, issues and challenges identified in the report80 produced by FIMI and that may be of relevance to this evaluation include: Unfavourable climate conditions (cyclones, lack and/or loss of resources, compromised food security) and COVID -19 related ris ks continue to affect grantees. In particular, the pandemic affected the implementation of activities originally planned, complicating the managing of projects. It also led to restrictions in mobility, which made field visits very difficult. Given the abov e, technological barriers have been an additional constrain. This barrier limited the scope of work and outreach of the organisations, as fewer or no participants were able to take part in their activities. These risks were mitigated by adjusting some of t he activities for example, in -person activities were replaced by online ones and working with social media and local radios in the communities to ensure women's information, communication, and participation even in the most remote locations. Yet, FIMI caut ion that many organisations might be unable to respond to online surveys at least if given a short timeframe. Systematising data, by means of instruments co -created with partner organisations has been an important step in the creation of a \"historical memo ry\" of the programme within FIMI. This historical memory allows for easier decision - making, both current and future, regarding partners (for example, drafting recommendation letters, selecting organisations or leaders that could participate in other progr ammes or funding lines, supporting presentation of other proposals). There is possibility that documentary data available can mitigate some of these limitations. Fondo de Mujeres del Sur (FMS) FMS is a fund that mobilises financial resources and provides support to organisations that promote women's and lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer plus (LBTIQ+) Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Since 2017 FMS coordinates the programme \"Leading from the South\" (LFS), which covers 21 countries in LAC. FMS finances and supports grassroots initiatives, 80 Cf. Annex A. Risks and Effective Mitigation Measures in 2020 and the 2017 - 2020 Programme Period. 90 organisations and networks created and led by women and LBTIQ+ people, who work to achieve transformative results towards gender equality and justice. Their goal is to strengthen women, fe minist and diversity movements, from a human rights -based approach, gender perspective, empowerment, intersectionality and interculturality. FMS believes that the impacts on gender equality and women empowerment are greater if Southern women's groups and o rganisations have access to resources. Therefore, FMS concentrated its programme on reinforcing the capacity for lobbying and advocacy of SWROs. With the LFS programme, FMS supported 48 organisations with most of them based in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Argentina. More than 70% of the proposals received focused on promoting leadership, voice -agency and women's political participation and on violence against women. 75% of the organisations that applied to the LFS calls in Latin American Countries were gras sroots organisations. For the end -line assessment, FMS created a MEL system that is comprised of four elements, namely: a capacity assessment tool, a monitoring system, a monitoring and learning visits and virtual interviews, and an evaluation, learning a nd planning based on lessons learned. Four factors explain the progress achieved with regard to the outcome indicators: the grantees track record, the support the grantees received, the linking and partnerships, and the favourable context for activism. A final narrative report was conducted by the organisation and completed at the beginning of 2021. It is not clear from the report what methodological approach was used, but the interviews revealed that it was implemented by a third party/external organisatio n. The report included an in -depth review of the context across the region, a review and reflection on risks and ToC, an assessment of the key results achieved, a reflection on sustainability and exit strategies, and cross -cutting issues. From our interview with FMS, it appears that surveys and KIIs with a sample of grantees were conducted for this report, which can be shared with the Evaluation Team. The risks, issues and challenges identified in the report produced by FMS and that may be of relevance to this evaluation include: Broadly, during the four years period of the programme, there were two main challenges. These are a political conservative twist which affected the work of organisations to preserve the achievements made and to gua rantee women's access to rights; and the 2020 worldwide COVID -19 pandemic which affected the fourth year of implementation of LFS. The COVID -19 pandemic made clear that some risks cannot be foreseen and that the only alternative to deal with uncertainty is flexibility. The shrinking of civic space in the region since 2017, through the prevalence of neoconservative and fundamentalist groups and anti -gender -ideology forces (who attack gender equality, same - sex marriage, and legalisation of abortion, and have influenced elections in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Brazil, and Guatemala). Furthermore, many states in Latin America implemented new regulations with the objective to control CSOs. General findings relevant to the methodological approach Some common f indings from the documentary review and interviews conducted, and which are relevant for this inception report are included below: A MTR was carried out from June to November 2019. The MTR used a mixed approach including survey questionnaires with 76% of t he grantees, KIIs with a sample of organisations selected utilised a purposeful (non -random) sampling strategy reaching 28% of the grantees. The KIIs and surveys were implemented between 15th July and 15th September, thus allowing for substantial time to m itigate possible lack of responsiveness from those grantees in more remote 91 locations. The methodology, including the survey questionnaire, was agreed upon with all four LFS leading women's funds. Each of the four leading women's funds developed an end lin e evaluation between October 2020 and May 2021. These assessments vary substantially in terms of methodology, with evaluation questions, tools used and sampling being substantially different. As a result, there is an internal asymmetry in the corpus of doc umentary evidence to assess, and thus the Methodology will have to adapt to the different characteristics of the regional fund and the information available. Despite the above, all four end line evaluations have a consistent focus on assessing outcomes/res ults and internal grant management and support. The information across the outcome/effectiveness assessments is in many cases comparable and this evaluation will thus not need to focus on collecting such information but rather on validating the main findin gs and providing evidence that will substantiate the validation ( i.e., substantiating the causal chain of effects, in accordance with IOB quality criteria). Furthermore, the KIIs with the four lead funds reveal that all grantees are currently facing a difficult context because of a new increase in the number of COVID -19 cases in most countries, related to new variants and delays in the vaccination in rural areas. In many cases grantees have redirected efforts to the support of local communities and/or are facing staff shortages either because of illness or as they respond to the public health limitations. The four lead fund representatives interviewed manifested that the time provided for data collection was very short and that the team should provide no le ss than 45 days for primary data collection (or at least 30 days for organisations to respond to the surveys). Accordingly, the evaluation team modified the activity plan within the deadlines provided by the MFA but have raised this limitation for further analysis during the validation of this inception report. In order to avoid a duplication of efforts and, more importantly, research fatigue between the grantee beneficiaries, our tools will need to be kept short and relevant. As a result of the above, the evaluation team requested the LFs and some of the researchers that implemented the end line assessments, to share with us what specific criteria/questions could add value to this evaluation. The list below presents other consistent findings from the inception phase: Evaluate how relevant the Fund was, and whether the funding and support provided responded to the needs of the organisations (relevance/adaptability). Investigate whether the funding enabled the grantees to better adapt to the changes in their context, particularly given the volatility within the past two years (relevance/adaptability). Provide a deeper knowledge of the biggest challenges to implementati on (e.g., security, internet access, lack of access to services, staffing) and how to improve support (effectiveness). Understanding the micro, meso and macro level outcomes/changes at the level of the four lead women's funds/organisations. The four organi sations manifested that the implementation of the LFS has created substantial changes within their organisations, including wider geographical scope, stronger networks, and managerial capacities. Previous assessments have not concentrated in this area, whi ch is as well an outcome of the FMS (effectiveness). Provide insights as to how the LFS Funds could serve as inspiration for a feminist foreign policy for the Netherlands. The four LFs have already made suggestions and recommendations during their dialogue s with the MFA, which could be consolidated within the recommendations. From the above analysis we consider that the below is available from the endline reports: 92 Analysis of Information Available Information available Information missing FMS Effectiveness: The Capacity Assessment tool seems to provides sufficient information on the grantees' capacities at the beginning and at the end of their projects. The Results Measurement Framework also provided detailed information on output and outcome indicators for each of the projects. Sustainability: The endline evaluation had specific focus on sustainability and exit strategies. Relevance: The endline assessment and MEL tools have no specific information on whether the objectives and design of inter ventions under the policy framework responded to beneficiaries, global, regional, country, and partner/ institution needs, policies, and priorities. Effectiveness: more information could be provided about the key challenges to implementation and how they a ffected delivery/outcomes. Efficiency: no specific assessment of VfM or results -based budgeting. Coherence: no specific assessment of coherence and coordination across the grants has been consolidated. WFA Effectiveness: The endline assessment used outc ome harvesting (OH) and identified specific outcomes and results across micro, meso and macro areas, for all grantees. The institutional strengthening and resilience was specifically assessed within the outcome harvesting assessment. Coherence: Dialogue, collaboration and alliance - building was assessed in the endline review and can provide specific information on this area. Sustainability: The endline evaluation had specific focus on sustainability. Effectiveness: attribution/contribution analy sis was not specifically included in the OH methodology. Relevance: The endline assessment and MEL tools have no specific information on whether the objectives and design of interventions under the policy framework responded to beneficiaries, global, regio nal, country, and partner/institution needs, policies, and priorities. Efficiency: no specific assessment of VfM or results -based budgeting. Sustainability: The endline evaluation did not include assessment of exit strategies and this is an area mentioned as key within the interview with the leading organisation. FIMI Relevance/Efficiency: the endline evaluation specifically focused on evaluating the relevance and efficiency of support provided by the LF. Effectiveness : The endline assessment ide ntified some specific outcomes in all three levels, but not much detail was provided and attribution/ contribution has not been properly assessed (low cause -effect level). Capacity assessments and outcomes were included, including leadership capacities and knowledge of the indigenous women. Efficiency: no specific assessment of VfM or results -based budgeting. Effectiveness: more information could be provided about the key challenges to implementation and how they affected delivery/outcomes. Coherence: no specific assessment of coherence and coordination across the grants has been consolidated. Sustainability: The endline eva luation included specific questions on sustainability but none on exit strategies. Both emerge as a key challenge (cf.p. 34) AWDF Effectiveness : The endline assessment used primary and documentary data collection about outcomes and results across micro, m eso and macro areas, for all grantees. Sustainability: The endline evaluation had some information on sustainability, but not on exist strategy. Relevance: The endline assessment and MEL tools have no specific information on whether the objectives and des ign of interventions under the policy framework responded to beneficiaries, global, regional, country, and partner/ institution needs, policies, and priorities. Effectiveness: more information could provide about the key challenges to implementation and ho w they affected delivery/outcomes; as well as a contribution/ attribution assessment. Coherence: no specific assessment of coherence and coordination across the grants has been consolidated. 93 ANNEX H.

SUMMARY OF RESPONSES TO OPEN QUESTIONS #15 AND #16 (ADDRESSED TO INDIGENOUS WOMEN) Consistent with the participatory and intersectional approach of this evaluation, and at the request of FIMI, two additional questions were added to the Google survey. The section below shows a summary of the responses by indigenous women from all four LFs. Two major findings from the responses are: a total of 50 (out of 183) respondents across the four LFs answered these two questions. This demonstrates the intersectional inclusiveness of the LFS. Secondly, questions related to spiritual ity are also important to feminist women's rights organisations, in the sense that they are part of a \"feminist theology,\" as illustrated by the responses from the women's organisation Cat\u00f3licas por el Derecho a Decidir (Catholics for the Right to Decide). Question 1. How have you, as Indigenous Women, influenced national and/or global processes through your initiatives and proposals? Political Advocacy We were able to work with feminists groups in four countries across the region; and developed advocacy briefs on VAW Prevention for their respective countries. Those briefs will be used in advocacy and influencing initiatives. The capacity -building suppor t to the WHRDs helped in, firstly, asserting our own spaces within the national indigenous peoples' alliances as they are mostly led by men. Now women have become members of the executive bodies, have a separate women's wing to set a national agenda for th e alliance, based on women's demands and some of the WHRDs have started taking an active role in mobilising and networking with indigenous women in different states in India. When the project started there was a lack of clarity on indigenous women's rights , especially land and inheritance rights issues, legal rights vis -a-vis development projects and how to amplify/articulate the violations locally to national and international platforms for advocacy linkages. During the FIMI/AYNI project, WHRDs were able to build strategic actions through cross learnings and collectively write to ministries concerned at the national level to represent their objections and comments on policy changes (such as the regressive policies related to minerals, forests, environment laws) that are directly affecting indigenous communities. Secondly, through the regional platforms that Dhaatri is facilitating/coordinating, such as the Women and Mining Alliance, the ReSISTERs dialogue, and as part of the GAGGA alliance, WHRDs of the FIM I project were able to travel in the region. This enabled them to connect with other indigenous sisters, participated in international representation like the UN Business and Human Rights Forum, regional mining networks and submit representations on demand s of indigenous women with respect to FPIC, development projects and environmental violations issues. Women are now able to conduct gender impact assessments of development projects and with some help, prepare evidence -based documents that can be submitted to national and international bodies/human rights commissions. We were able to attend a regional workshop with FIMI on the needs and injustices of indigenous women in Cambodia: \"I have been able to participate in the County government meetings particular ly the department of gender where indigenous women issues were considered. In partnership with other organisations, I have engaged Ogiek women in exchange learning programs on land and natural resource management where they learnt on the best practices; I have participated in various virtual meeting and ensure I present indigenous women voices.\" 104 The FIMI (LFS) Funds made a difference to our work and in the lives of women, girls and trans -people we work with as follows: In the project area of Godda (India), the Government installed and repaired water pumps for 1000 villages as a result of efforts by four project villages that demanded the water pumps following ICPRD training and mentoring. At the Santhali women's convention, women took an important decision t o campaign for drinking water supply and sanitary facilities in three project districts. Infections, TB, waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, high IMR, poor nutrition, poor sanitation, and dehydration are rampant due to lack of access to clean, potable w ater. ICPRD also tackled the issue of witch -hunting by building awareness on the fact that this is exploitation of women. A consensus was generated among Santhali women participants that they would protest against witchcraft in their respective villages. The Santhali women's convention has taken this up to campaign in the three districts. This issue is gender -based violence and is often undertaken to claim destitute women's property. Through our initiative, bonding among the women in the North Eastern regio n of India and Naga women in Myanmar, who are divided by international boundary, has improved and has advanced as a result of our advocacy work, leadership and project management. At the national level we facilitate indigenous women from different communit ies to advance our advocacy work. We are a LBTIQ organisation and have built a consortium with Indigenous women led organisation. We sent a joint UPR report through civil society forum. Further, we had the opportunity to learn and share to know each other' s issues during the project period. Indigenous women are moving freely and raising their voices at the local and national levels. We were able to develop links through national level networking. Through indigenous women's rights activist networking we deve loped hotline events and community discussions in Bangladesh. A new generation of indigenous WHRD and partners were developed to address the issues around access to public services in the northern part of Bangladesh. Our organisation successfully collabora ted with Asia Indigenous Peoples pack on various occasions to raise the voices of IP Women. Policy influence: local, national and multilateral level We have been able to influence government at local levels to benefit indigenous women and to hold governmen ts accountable. At the national level, CORDS was able to influence the government to review national land use guidelines that allowed the women's engagement section to be incorporated into the guidelines. We have also influenced policy with our examples an d proposals as indigenous women with disabilities. Through political participation spaces provided by FIMI/AYNI and Indigenous women leaders, we were able to contribute to global frameworks such as Beijing +25 African regional meeting that took place in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon (Dec. 2019). There, \"Fountain of Life Uganda\" was represented and made contributions towards the amendment of the global document. The goal was to benefit indigenous peoples especially women and girls. FOLU also participated in the global c onferences that took place in African Union headquarters on the Beijing +25 global conferences (Oct. 2019), and the global conferences that took place in Nairobi. A lot of knowledge was brought back home to help influence decision making at the national le vel on issues affecting indigenous women and girls in Uganda. Also, at the multilateral level, PACEP (Kenya) participated as a member in the FAO technical WG developing national climate strategy for REDD+/forest sector strategy and in the gender technical group where we are advocating for integration of indigenous women and peoples' issues. The organisation participates in a county and national level climate change multi -stakeholder working group. For recent climate 105 processes, we contributed to the country position on climate change from an indigenous perspective, and highlighted the role of indigenous women and traditional knowledge. We are also engaged in the national SDG multi stakeholder platform - Kenya SDGs Forum, where we contribute on indigenous wome n roles, issues on leadership and development, we have participated in UNFPA regional meeting and the Beijing process for Africa towards Beijing global platform. In Cameroon, the project supported the coordinator of MBOSCUDA's women empowerment programme t o participate in the High -Level Political Forum (HLPF) to review the implementation of the SDGs. During the forum, contact was made with Cameroon's Minister of Public Investment (MINEPAT) and the need to involve Mbororo people in general and Mbororo women in particular was discussed. This participation in the HLPF also raised her awareness and increased her skills to advocate for indigenous women at international level. For example, she is able to take the agenda to other forums such as the UN committee on food security and nutrition and the Network of African Indigenous Women, where we are Co -Coordinator of the Agroecology working group and were also involved in the FAO negotiations on the Policy recommendations on Agroecology. \" Being an indigenous woman, I got an opportunity to participate in the process at national and global level, shared my learning experiences. I was able to express the problems and possibilities for a social change at Women's Human Rights Institute, Canada. At National Level, was able to provide inputs based on the outcomes and challenges of the project to Combat Human Trafficking and Reduce Violence Against Women. Provided Inputs to TIP policy for the U.S Government as well\" (South Vihar Welfare Society for Tribal, India) Question 16: How have you used your spirituality and traditional knowledge 81 in the implementation of your proposals and projects? Research for advocacy/lobbying We use our spirituality and traditional knowledge in our cases studies, video, research and publications, webinars, media platforms and partnerships. We aim to make visible the knowledge of indigenous women/ peoples in connection with their rights, and also amplify indigenous women's voices and women's leadership mentoring at county, national lev el and international levels. Indigenous women's strengths, spiritual values, belief, practices are portrayed into our research, reports, video, publications, awareness building programs. We believe that this will certainly be transferred to the new generat ion (NIWF, Asia). Our research and studies are contributing to building on our position in the national and international level processes. In Bangladesh, indigenous women were able to use their study to gain support from national, UN and international agencies for the capacity building of women village leaders (Karbari). In Cambodia, Nepal and Thailand we were able to fill in the information gap about indigenous women's initiatives in climate change and submit proposal during the Asia Regi onal FCPF consultation. The consultation resulted in inclusion of specific indigenous women's recommendations not only on FCPF initiatives at the ground level but for more gender sensitive and appropriate mechanisms for their engagement. Other results from the studies and information gathered through the different activities informed statements/interventions, reports and other activities in different platforms: UNCSW, SDGs, 81 See also FIMI's compilation of women's indigenous knowledge and good practices in \" Global Study on the Situation of Indigenous Women and Girls\" (2020), available at: https://fimi -iiwf.org/wp -content/uploads/2020/09/GlobalStudyFIMI_20 - englishRGB -2.pdf 106 UNSR report on Asia, among others. We have also contributed to studies on biodiversi ty conservations through integrating indigenous knowledge. The influence that we have made is enabling country members to research and create action plans focused on the issues of indigenous women. This goal is also to build and capacitate our indigenous y oung women members on their rights. This can be further developed in the future for other engagements on indigenous women. Through our spiritual conviction, in the Philippines we pleaded for the well -being of indigenous peoples to be treated like all human beings by accepting our status, mobilise to defend our causes, develop and promote our endogenous knowledge, and our know -how. INNABUYOG actively lobbied for the passage of positive laws for women's rights and welfare, including indigenous women, alongsid e other women's organisations. We lobbied the Gabriela Women's Party list in the Philippine Government's House of Representatives. In Rwanda, within the project cycle, the HCDO Indigenous Women's Commission considers the traditional knowledge of the indige nous Batwa peoples in consultations with community leaders to know their needs. During implementation, we work in the mother tongue. HCDO respects the customary structures and leaders of indigenous Batwa peoples by respecting the rights and role of women i n indigenous families. In project implementation We involved indigenous women's groups in the programme throughout planning, implementation and monitoring. How indigenous women are trained to identify and document their spirituality and traditional knowled ge influence the results of the project and encourages women's self -confidence . Our knowledge and traditional values including song, dance, and rites have been used in the context of the implementation of the project. Spiritual and traditional leaders we re part of the project. We have also used spirituality and traditional knowledge through self -care to encourage project participants to reflect on their body/mind/soul wellbeing. The traditional knowledge of the original indigenous peoples are fundamental for the development of all activities, as they are part of life, part of the communities and their culture. Examples of this include through Akhulli (CDIMA, Bolivia), through traditional knowledge of the tribal communities of Chhattisgarh , India, or throu gh Cordillera indigenous knowledge/values such as Innabuyog, in the Philippines. Our ancestral knowledge greatly helped to achieve this, especially because we were faced with so many challenges as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. We use traditional indig enous knowledge in our projects on environmental conservation. For example, the project on energy -efficient cooking fireplaces was adapted based on IP's cultural way of cooking using the three -stone cooking fire. Through this project, we have been able to build international linkages on strengthening indigenous peoples' conservation consortium to advocate for the traditional conservation knowledge practices and sustainable solutions to climate change mitigation. This project supported the indigenous women's knowledge practices and engagement with nature, and indigenous women spiritual leaders, historians and knowledge keepers of their tribes. We have helped build collective agencies of indigenous women ritual practitioners, artists and oral historians, and a re helping them in patenting their knowledge as well as in promoting intergenerational transfer and practise of these spiritual forms (for example: the Dhavleri and Savasin women knowledge keepers of the Warli tribe; the Pejjenis of Khond tribe, the crafts women of Melghat tribes. We have also worked on preserving and exchanging native seeds, valuing spirituality and traditional knowledge in the execution process has been a success). 107 We have also used traditional music dance and drama to convey messages abo ut the dangers of early marriages, the dangers of grabbing widows land and how terrible it is to deprive women and girls of their human rights. CORDS (Tanzania) always welcome women to all engagements with traditional prayers, and traditional spiritual son gs. These songs could praise the nature and mother earth for support in accessing important needs. As indigenous peoples, intergenerational exchange among indigenous youth, women and elders was key in the passing of traditional knowledge and ensuring indig enous women land rights are protected and respected. We bear in mind spirituality and traditional knowledge as fundamental elements in all our processes. As Miskitu indigenous peoples, we maintain respect for our authorities, knowledge of traditional medi cine, forms of governance, the valuation of beliefs and myths, language and the incorporation of young people, adolescents and children in the different training spaces. To Mayan women and their families, spirituality means to be in communion with our ance stors, so that our daughters and our sons know the values of our culture, we also watch over, teach and ask for respect for women, which has always been our custom. We practice ancestral knowledge through the thought of duality, because man -woman go toge ther, as day and night go together, the moon and the sun go together, that's how our grandmothers and grandfathers thought and taught us. That is our culture, our roots, and we respect the peoples, and always with support for women is what we think and wha t we practice. We are indigenous Lenca women (Honduras) and the cosmovision and ancestral practices were strengthened. It is the only project of so many projects that has allowed us to incorporate actions for the recovery and strengthening of spirituality and ancestral knowledge. Today we are working from the worldview of indigenous peoples, since not all donors bet on these actions, now we feel identified and recognized. As Catholics for the Right to Decide, our spirituality has been very important for us from feminist theology to further strengthen and expand the capacity of our arguments and take advantage of syncretism based on the confluence of spiritualities among women. In the intergenerational spaces that we have developed we have incorporated moment s of spiritual healing, accompanying the difficult moments that the indigenous sisters have lived with COVID 19; also on the sharing of knowledge about medicine and health care practices, by way of prevention and in the care of women victims of violence, t herapeutic healing is used. We use our knowledge of medicinal plants, aromas, essences and others. And always respecting our spirituality and our traditional knowledge for the implementation. We share knowledge of the elderly experience with their traditio nal medicine and their traditional dance so that traditional knowledge does not disappear. Language has been essential for sourcing mainstream resources. ICPRD (India) would also like to ask the Government to translate these Government forms in Santhali language. ICPRD intends to translate them and distribute them in the area if considered for next phase.108 ANNEX J.
