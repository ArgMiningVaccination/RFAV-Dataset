Hormones are powerful substances that regulate a woman's entire reproductive life; they regulate menstruation, determine fertility, menopause, and libido. The pituitary gland in the brain as well as the ovaries produce most of the female hormones. When hormones are unbalanced or disrupted, there are many different disorders that may occur: - Amenorrhea - Infertility - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) - Anovulatory cycles or amenorrhea - Weight gain - Hirsutism (male pattern hair growth) - Metabolic syndrome - Acne - Pituitary dysfunction - Primary ovarian insufficiency Chronic stress as well as congenital factors may negatively affect the thyroid gland, leading to either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. The thyroid gland has a very strong effect on hormonal balance and can lead to issues, especially with fertility. Symptoms associated with thyroid include fatigue, weight gain, dry skin and hair, brain fog, intolerance to cold, as well as cold hands and feet. When a patient has adrenal dysfunction they may feel unusually fatigued with palpitations, lightheadedness, hypotension, craving for salt, fluctuations on weight, and brain fog. Furthermore, these imbalances have an impact of a patient's psychological health, manifesting as problems ranging from depression to panic disorders. Some symptoms of hormonal imbalances include: - Breast tenderness - Mood swings - Depression - Irregular periods - Food cravings - Skin changes - Monthly weight fluctuation - Bloating - Headaches - Fluid retention - Backaches - Frequent colds - Low stress tolerance - Fatigue - Low sex drive - Yeast infections - Breast cysts - Uterine fibroids Restoring hormonal balance at all stages of the female reproductive cycle (menstruation, pregnancy, postpartum and menopause) is an important issue that the practitioners at Denver Holistic Medicine deal with on a daily basis.
