CS involves trabecular bone damage in two thirds of cases with consecutive vertebral fractures that sometimes represent the first sign of both OP and CS but the previous exposure to glucocorticoids excess is found up to 2 years before [1]. 5% of secondary osteoporosis related vertebral fractures underline subclinical forms of hypercortisolism and the majority of them are caused by an adrenal tumour [2]. 10-15% of adrenal CS is related to bilateral forms of adrenal neoplasia [3]. We present a female case discovered with multiple diseases starting from a minor trauma.54-year female known with high blood pressure controlled under adequate therapy for the last 5 years suffered a minor fall while she was cleaning her house. Lumbar back pain (with some unspecific abdominal pain) persisted for 2 months when she decided to ask for a general practitioner control. The abdominal ultrasound found two bilateral large adrenal tumors that were confirmed by the computed tomography exam (Figure 1). Vertebral fractures at first and third lumbar vertebras were found and she was referred for an endocrine evaluation. Central Dual-energy X-Ray Absortiometry was non interpretable at lumbar spine because of the fractures and hip bone mineral density was of 0.827 g/cm 2, T-score of -1.4 and Z-score of morning plasma cortisol was high of 1046 nmol/L (normal levels between 171 and 536) with suppressed plasma morning ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone) of levels below 5 pg/mL (with normal ranges between 5 and 46 pg/mL) suggesting an adrenal CS. Adrenal surgery was recommended and she asked for a second endocrine opinion. Except for mild hypokaliemia of 3.26 mmol/L (normal between 3.5 and 5.1 mmol/L) and secondary osteoporosis the only anomaly was the re-confirmation of high endogen glucocorticoid exposure coming from adrenals (Table 1). Based on secretor aspects and large tumors volume one time bilateral adrenalectomy was performed and nodular hyperplasia was confirmed (with no malignancy features). Adrenal substitution was started together with oral bisphosphonate, vitamin D and calcium supplements.This case highlights the importance of primary health care in adequately selecting the subjects who need serial tests in order to confirm severe diagnosis.
