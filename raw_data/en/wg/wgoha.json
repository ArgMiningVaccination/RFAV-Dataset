Join the club. This is the time of year people living in this latitude start thinking about heading out for a break from the snow, cold, and grey skies. If you are fortunate enough to be one of those folks who can actually go, there are a few things to consider. Some of them involve changes as to \"how it has always been done\" so please read below. If this is not your year to travel, read on anyway because you may benefit from taking care of a few things this year in preparation for the future travel adventure of your dreams. \"Be wise...Immunize\" was a slogan a number of years ago encouraging people to get their influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccines are recommended regardless of if you are going to travel or stay at home. If you are going anywhere on a bus, train, or plane where you are exposed to many people in an enclosed space, this is one vaccine you are going to want to make sure you have! Check the last date of your Tetanus and make sure it was one that contained the Pertussis component. You do not need a booster unless it has been over 10 years since your last shot but you can get the booster with the Pertussis in it sooner if you have not had one before. Most students would have received a booster when they were 12-to 15-years-old, but you should check since there are many people who get off of the schedule for one reason or another. This vaccine is important especially if you are going to be working on farms or doing service learning type projects involving construction. Most students have received the three Hepatitis B vaccines as a child but you should verify this since it is possible that you either did not get any or did not receive all three. Hepatitis B is transmitted sexually and thru blood exposure and is much more common and contagious than HIV/AIDS. Most students have not received Hepatitis A vaccine. You might want to consider getting this vaccine, which is a two shot series spaced six months apart. You should only need the series once in your lifetime. Hepatitis A is now included in the standard immunization schedule for children but this was not the case when you were an infant. If you ever plan on traveling to Central or South America, Asia, Africa or any of the Eastern European countries you should be immunized against Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is transmitted through direct person-to-person contact and through exposure to contaminated food and water. It is here that we are going to make you do some work. Each country has its own risks for certain vaccine preventable diseases and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has a wonderful travel site where you can enter your country of travel and they will give a chart of what vaccines are recommended or required. They also talk about different health and safety issues specific to the area that you might be traveling. So go to the [CDC's Travelers' Health site](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/) and then come back to read about where you might get these recommended vaccines and an approximate cost. Some of these vaccines take 6 weeks to be effective so you will need to plan ahead. There have been some changes in health insurance over the past few years and whereas in the past most insurances covered the costs of travel vaccines very few cover them today. That being said, some insurance companies are still covering the cost of Hepatitis A, Polio, Hepatitis B, Meningococcal, and Tetanus since they are part of the childhood immunization schedule. You will need to take the initiative to find out which vaccines are covered and which ones you will be responsible to pay by calling your insurance company. The River Falls Medical Clinic has all vaccines but will require you to pay for the vaccines the same day you receive them. They offer a 20% discount when they collect the same day which is very generous, but it is not always easy coming up with the cash or putting it on your charge card. Below we have made a list of some different vaccinations with notes of where they are available and approximate costs. NOTE: The prices we quoted are approximate. Generally we rounded up to make even numbers. The prices at the River Falls Medical Clinic vary depending on how many immunizations you receive at each visit (the quotes were the higher charges). The prices at Pierce County Public health are currently in flux so it is best if you call first to check availability and pricing. You need an appointment for both the River Falls Medical Clinic and Pierce County Public health so make sure you call ahead. Most of all, whether you are going or just planning to go some day, enjoy yourself and be safe. Article written by [UWRF "}
