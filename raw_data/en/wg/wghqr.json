See www 2009-10 .immunize.org/vis. 1 Why get vaccinated? Infl uenza (\"fl u\") is a contagious disease. It is caused by the in fl uenza virus, which can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or nasal secretions. Other illnesses can have the same symptoms and are often mistaken for in fl uenza. But only an illness caused by the infl uenza virus is really in fluenza. Anyone can get in fl uenza, but rates of infection are highest among children. For most people, it lasts only a few days. It can cause: fever sore throat chills muscle aches cough headache fatigue Some people, such as infants, elderly, and those with certain health conditions, can get much sicker. Flu can cause high fever and pneumonia, and make existing medical conditions worse. It can cause diarrhea and seizures in children. On average, 226,000 people are hospitalized every year because of infl uenza and 36,000 die - mostly elderly. Infl uenza vaccine can prevent infl uenza. 2 Live, attenuated in fluenza vaccine - LAIV (nasal spray) There are two types of seasonal in uenza vaccine: 1. Live, attenuated infl but These \"seasonal\" in fluenza vaccines are formulated toattenuated (weakened) in fluenza prevent annual fl u. They do virus. It is sprayed into the nostrils. not protect against pandemic 2. Inactivated infl uenza vaccine, H1N1 infl uenza. sometimes called u shot,\" is given by injection. Inactivated in fluenza vaccine is described in a separate Vaccine Information Statement. Infl uenza viruses are always changing. Because of this, infl uenza vaccines are updated every year, and an annual vaccination is recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause fl u that year. When there is a close match the vaccine protects most people from serious in fluenza\u00ad related illness. But even when there is not a close match, the vaccine provides some protection. In fl uenza vaccine will not prevent \"in fl uenza-like\" illnesses caused by other viruses. It takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the vaccination. Protection lasts up to a year. LAIV does not contain thimerosal or other preservatives. 3 Who can get LAIV? LAIV is approved for people from 2 through 49 years of age, who are not pregnant and do not have certain health conditions (see #4, below). Infl uenza vaccination is recommended for people who can spread in fl uenza to others at high risk, such as: Household contacts and out-of-home caregivers of children up to 5 years of age, and people 50 and older. Physicians and nurses, and family members or anyone else in close contact with people at risk of serious infl uenza. Health care providers may also recommend a yearly in fluenza vaccination for: People who provide essential community services . People living in dormitories, correctional facilities , or under other crowded conditions, to prevent outbreaks. Infl uenza vaccine is also recommended for anyone who wants to reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with infl uenza or spreading infl uenza to others. 4 Some people should not get LAIV LAIV is not licensed for everyone. The following people should get the inactivated vaccine ( fl u shot) instead: Adults 50 years of age and older or children between 6 months and 2 years of age. (Children younger than 6 months should not get either in fl uenza vaccine.) Children younger than 5 with asthma or one or more episodes of wheezing within the past year. People who have long-term health problems with: - heart disease - kidney or liver disease - lung disease - metabolic disease, such as diabetes - asthma - anemia, and other blood disorders Anyone with certain muscle or nerve disorders (such as seizure disorders or cerebral palsy) that can lead to breathing or swallowing problems. Anyone with a weakened immune system. Children or adolescents on long-term aspirin treatment. Pregnant women. Tell your doctor if you ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (a severe paralytic illness also called GBS). You may be able to get the vaccine, but your doctor should help you make the decision. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Information Statement Live, Attenuated In fluenza Vaccine (8/11/09) U.S.C. \u00a7300aa-26 The fl u shot is preferred for people (including health-care workers, and family members) in close contact with anyone who has a severely weakened immune system (requiring care in a protected environment, such as a bone marrow transplant unit). People in close contact with those whose immune systems are less severely weakened (including those with HIV) may get LAIV . Anyone with a nasal condition serious enough to make breathing dif cult, such as a very stuffy nose, should get the fl u shot instead. Some people should talk with a doctor before getting either infl uenza vaccine: Anyone who has ever had a serious allergic reaction to eggs or another vaccine component, or to a previous dose of in fluenza vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting fl u vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your doctor or nurse about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. 5 When should I get in fluenza vaccine? You can get the vaccine as soon as it is available, usually in the fall, and for as long as illness is occurring in your community. Infl uenza can occur any time from November through May, but it most often peaks in January or February. Getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will still be bene cial in most years Most people need one dose of in fl uenza vaccine each year. Children younger than 9 years of age getting infl uenza vaccine for the rst time - or who got infl uenza vaccine for the rst time last season but got only one dose - should get 2 doses, at least 4 weeks apart, to be protected. Infl uenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 6 What are the risks from LAIV? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Live in fl uenza vaccine viruses rarely spread from person to person. Even if they do, they are not likely to cause illness. LAIV is made from weakened virus and does not cause infl uenza. The vaccine can cause mild symptoms in people who get it (see below). Mild problems: Some children and adolescents 2-17 years of age have reported mild reactions, including: runny nose, nasal congestion or cough fever headache and muscle aches wheezing abdominal pain or occasional vomiting or diarrhea Some adults 18-49 years of age have reported: runny nose or nasal congestion sore throat cough, chills, tiredness/weakness headache Severe problems: Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. If rare reactions occur with any product, they may not be identi ed until thousands, or millions, of people have used it. Millions of doses of LAIV have been distributed since it was licensed, and no serious problems have been identi ed. Like all vaccines, LAIV will continue to be monitored for unusual or severe problems. 7 What if there is a severe reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include dif culty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell the doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form. Or you can le this report through the V AERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice. 8 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program A federal program exists to help pay for the care of anyone who has a serious reaction to a vaccine. For more information about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, call 1-800-338-2382, or visit their website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. 9 How can I learn more? Ask your provider. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. Call your local or state health department.
