As cases of COVID -19 continue to rise daily, there are increasing concerns and controversies regarding the best methods to curb the coronavirus pandemic. Since there are no proven drugs that are completely effective for prevention or treatment of SARS -CoV -2, vaccines are considered to be the most favorable choice to control the spread of this di s- ease and reduce severe morbidity and mortality from COVID -19. Therefore, this evidence -based intensive literature review aims to further identify and tho- roughly understand the mechanisms of actions of the primary vaccines d e- veloped against th e SARS -CoV -2, aiming to provide the latest information available on current COVID -19 vac cines, touching on the viral characteristics of SARS -CoV -2, vaccine development and platforms which ma y be beneficial to the advancing research of novel SARS -CoV -2 vaccines.

This pandemic is caused by the emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS CoV -2, that is genetically similar to the SARS -CoV virus that was discovered in China , 2002, and also the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome co ronavirus (MERS -CoV) was discovered in Saudi Arabia , 2012. However, SARS -CoV -2 is particularly contagious compared to the other ep i- demic -causing coronaviruses. Even prior to the onset of clinical symptoms, it is easily transmitted and the high transmissibi lity of SARS -CoV -2 has caused signicant morbidity and mortality worldwide [1] . From epidemiological data, the discovery of SARS -CoV -2 links to the Wuhan Seafood Market in China, par- ticularly with the western part of the Huanan Seafood Market containing posi-tive samples of SARS -CoV -2 [2] [3]. Still, the transmission to humans is unclear and questions remain as to whether it originated from an animal source such as bats, which is the case for SARS- CoV and MERS -CoV [4]. Nonetheless, the transmission of viral particles from human- to-human is the biggest contributing factor to precipitating the spread of this disease. SARS -CoV -2 is a pneumotropic virus, mainly spread from individuals through airborne droplets, particularly in crowded settings where social distancing, usage of masks and appropriate hand hygiene is not observed [5] . Transmission can also occur via contaminated su r- faces or fomites as the SARS -CoV -2 virus remains viable for up to 6 days in n u- merous environmental conditions, drastically potentiating its ability to infect i n- dividuals [6]. Clinically, COVID -19 can manifest in many ways ranging from vague flu -like symptoms, benign respiratory or gastrointestinal problems [7] to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi -organ failure and even death [8]. On 11 January 2020, the genetic sequence of SARS -CoV -2 was published, i n- itiating an extensive global program to develop a vaccine against COVID -19 [9]. Since then, nume rous vaccines were produced or are in the production process and as of 11th February, WHO states that there are 337 vaccines in development against SARS -CoV -2, all in different stages of clinical development (142 in clini- cal development; 195 in pre -clinica l development) [10] . 2. SARS -Cov -2 Viral Structure and Virulence SARS -CoV -2 is a c oronavirus belonging to the c oronaviridae family with a size of ~30 kb genomes and a diameter of 50 - 200 nm [11] [12]. The virus is an e n- veloped, positive -sense single -stranded, non- segmented helical nucleocapsid with spike -like glycoprotein projections on its surface, which r e- sembles a crown- like or coronal appearance. SARS -CoV -2 has a double -layered lipid envelope which consists of spike (S) glycoproteins, glycoprotein membrane (M), helical nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E) proteins. The S protein is made up of 2 subunits; S1 and S2 and two key factors affect the entry of SARS -CoV -2 into host cells i.e. spike protein bin ding to host angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and priming of S protein by host cell protease: transmembrane L.-A. Wong et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108624 protease . The of the S1 subunit interacts and binds to the cellular ACE2 receptor on host cells, illustrated in Figure 1 [12] [14] [15]. Cryo spike protein's binding affinity i s 10 - 20\u00d7 more than that of SARS -CoV, making the transmissibility of SARS -CoV -2 much greater [16] , causing a massive public health concern worldwide. On the other hand , S2 contains the fusion peptide and transmembrane d o- main which mediates fusion with the host cell membrane [13] . Host proteases, primarily TMPRSS2, cleave the S2 subunit on the spike protein to make required conformational changes and S protein activation to facilitate membrane fusion and subsequent entry of viral RNA into target cells [17] [18]. By binding to the ACE2 receptors on the host cell, the virus enters the host through the S protein on its surface (Figure 2 ). Figure 1. The SARS -CoV -2 coronavirus particle structural diagram. The S protein is mainly divided into S1 (containing the -Terminal Domain. Created with BioRender.com. Figure 2. Mechanism of SARS -CoV -2 Viral Entry. SARS -CoV -2 S protein binds to the host ACE2 receptor and is subsequently cleaved at S1/S2 and S2' sites by TMPRSS2 protease. The S2 domain is activated and drives fusion of the viral and host membranes. Created with Bio Render.com. L.-A. Wong et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108624 4 Open Access Library Journal The most common approach for vaccine development is the use of the S pr o- tein as an antigen. The S protein which plays a major role in attachment and fu- sion is a major target antigen for many subunit vaccine candidates, in which not only the full -lengt h S protein is targeted but also its antigenic fragments, S1/S2 subunit, RBD, and N -terminal domain (NTD) [19] . When injected, most of these antigens can stimulate both humoral and cell -mediated immune responses in the body [20] [21] . 3. Development of the COVID -19 Vaccine Traditionally, vaccine development takes approximately 15 years as much time is needed for undergoing different phases of clinical trials and approval in a s e- quential process [22] , as shown in Figure 3 and to date, the fastest vaccine pr o- duced took roughly 4 years which was for mumps in the 1960s [23] , which is still double the time taken for the COVID -19 vaccine development. The sudden and unexpected COVID -19 pandemic prompted numerous developers to rapidly start developing a vaccine in a relatively short period of time, thus raising co n- cerns from the public and anti -vaccine people. Generally, due to t he high costs and risks of failure, developers tend to follow a sequential timeline, pausing in between stages for control and analysis [24] . Figure 3. SARS -CoV-2 development timeline vs. the traditional vaccine development timeline. Traditional vaccine development usually takes 15 years or more compared to the COVID- 19 vaccine development which takes less than 2 years. Created with Bi o- Render.com. L.-A. Wong et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108624 5 Open Access Library Journal In orde r to cope with the demand for a COVID -19 vaccine, developers have progressed to overlap various phases of clinical testing to accelerate the process and allocating most, if not all, of their funds towards it (something that has not been observed with other vaccines) [22] [23]. The same legal standards and safety assessment processes were still observed in the production of the vaccine [25] although some vaccines may be approved for emer gency use by vulnerable groups prior to obtaining the full approval process [26] . The stages of vaccine development and aspects entailed in each stage are outlined in Table 1 . Table 1. Stages of vaccine development. adapted from the history of vaccines: vaccine development, testing, and regulation [27]. Stages Processes Exploratory Stage Basic laboratory research ( ~2 - 4 years) Identify natural or synthetic antigens with possibility to prevent or treat a disease Examples of antigens: virus -like particles, weakened viruses or bacteria, weakened bacterial toxins, or other substances derived from pathogens Pre-clinical Stage Tissue -culture/cell -culture systems and animal testing (~1 - 2 years) Assess safety and immunogenicity, or ability to provoke an immune response IND Application Investigational New Drug (IND) submitted to the FDA Describes the manufacturing and testing processes, summarizes the laboratory reports and describes the proposed study Phase I Vaccine administered to healthy humans (small sample size <100) Assess vaccine safety & immunogenicity Phase II Vaccine administered to humans (moderate sample size 100 - 1000) \u2014effect of gender, age, and ethnicity assessed Assess vaccine's safety, immunogenicity, proposed doses, schedule of immunizations and method of delivery Phase III Vaccineadministered to humans (large sample size 1000 - 10,000) Randomized, double blind and involve the experimental vaccine being tested against a placebo Assess the efficacy and adverse reactions of the vaccine Approval and Licensure Submit Biologics License Application (BLA) to FDA Inspection of vaccine development factory and approve the labelling of vaccine After licensure, FDA cont inues to monitor the production of the vaccine: inspecting facilities and reviewing the manufacturer's tests for potency, safety and purity of vaccines Phase IV Optional studies by companies conducted after a vaccine is released Continue to test the vaccine for safety, efficacy, and other potential uses L.-A. Wong et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108624 6 Open Access Library Journal By far, vaccines are considered to be the most favorable option to manage the spread of COVID -19 producing herd -immunity that will decrease viral circul a- tion within the community. It may be argued that herd immunity can be ac- quired solely through natural infection without a need for a vaccine. Although it is theoretically possible, the consequences to society would definitely cause d e- vastation to any country [28] . This strategy that was observed in Sweden failed and resulted in almost three times more deaths per million people from COVID -19 compared to Germany [29] . 4. Overview of Vaccine Platforms Several vaccination platforms have been or are currently being used in the pr o- duction of a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine ( Figure 4 ). The se platforms can be divided into \"conventional\" approaches: inactivated or live -attenuated vaccines and newer vaccine platforms such as viral vectors and recombinant proteins. Some novel platforms such as Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) or Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) vac- cines have not been licensed before this [22] . 4.1. Live -Attenuated Vaccines Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) are produced by developing a genetically weaken ed form of the wild -type virus or using avirulent strain [30] [31]. Virus Figure 4. Vaccine platforms. (a) Live -attenuated virus. (b) Inactivated virus. (c) Viral vectors: Replicating or n on-replicating viral vector. (d) Protein subunits. (e) DNA or RNA. Created with BioRender.com . L.-A. Wong et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108624 7 Open Access Library Journal attenuation is generated by exposing the virus to adverse conditions such as low temperatures until it loses its pathogenic properties but maintaining its immu- nogenicity. The codon pair deoptimization strategy has also shown to be su c- cessful for viral attenuation [32] [33]. When injected, these viruses replicate in the host, eliciting an immune response, similar to when naturally infected, cau s- ing only a mild infection without actually causing the disease [34] . Some LAV currently used is chickenpox, MMR and polio vaccine. Nonetheless, LAV may still revert to their original form and cause disease, as seen in vaccine -assoc iated paralytic poliomyelitis associated with use of oral p o- liovirus vaccine (OPV) [35] . Additionally, possible errors may occur during the immunization process and due to their poor security and stability, the use of LAV is limited and those who are immunocompromised are advised against it [36]. Currently, LAV produced by Codagenix/Serum Institute of India and Meissa Vaccines, Inc are under Phase 3 and Phase 1 clinical trials respectively [10] . 4.2. Inactivated Vaccines Inactivated vaccines utilize a virus which inactivated thermally, chemically or by radiation. The preferred method is chemical inactivation (formaldehyde or alk y- lating agent based) as the integrity of the antigenic epitopes of the virus is better maintaine d and preserved when compared to the thermal inactivation [37] . The vaccine containing antigens from the inactivated viruses which are usually co m- bined with alumini um hydroxide or another adjuvant is then injected into the body, generating an immune response [38] [39] . Inactivated vaccines have been widely used against measles, polio, influenza and other viru ses in the past decades. Moreover, mass immunization programs have confirmed their safety profiles with development and evaluation stan- dards put in place based on experience on prior usage of these vaccines. Ther e- fore, large -scale production of inactivated vaccines is possible as manufacturing processes and methodology for development are well established [40] . However, inactivated vaccines only generate moderate immunogenicity, requiring adju-vants and several booster immunizations for an adequate immune response [41] . Moreover, many countries are still limited from performing research and ind e- pendently developing the vaccines due to the need of specialized facilities like biosafety level 3 laboratories (BSL -3) [40] . For this type of vac cine, Sinovac and Sinopharm are among the manufacturers which have advanced the most in vaccine development, clearing phase 3 trials and attaining international authorizations for use [42] . 4.3. Viral Vector Vaccines Viral vector -based vaccine uses viral vector backbone bioengineered to insert viral antigen- encoding gene(s) into the host organism and is generally classied into replicating or non -replicating vectors. Some examples of replicating vectors are: measles virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) ve c-L.-A. Wong et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108624 8 Open Access Library Journal tors: Adenoviruses (Ad) and poxviruses [43] . This platform has been well inve s- tigated and has a reputable track performance history considering its safety, g e- netic malleability, absence of an adjuvant requirement and strong potential to induce cell -mediated (T cell) immunity as well as being relatively easy to design and develop [44] . Replicating vector vaccines infect target cells stimulating antigen production as well as replicate and infect new cells to also produce the vaccine antigen, tri g- gering a more robust immune response. On the other hand, non -replicating vectors stimulate antigen production without forming new virus particles. Viral vector induces endogenous antigen production by the host, stimulating both humoral and cellular immune response [30] . Many vaccines use a non- replicating Ad vector as they are physically and genetically intact and do not integrate wit h the host genome. Some examples of authorized SARS -CoV -2 vaccines using viral vector platforms are AstraZeneca and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson. One concern is that pre -existing immunity may possibly lower the immun o- genicity of the vaccine [45] [46], but this issue can be avoided by using viral ve c- tors derived from animal viruses, such as a chimpanzee adenovirus as in the A s- tra Zeneca vaccine [47] or using a virus uncommon in the target population (Janssen and Cansino use vectors that do not propagate in Europe and Asia r e- spectively) [48] . 4.4. Protein Subunit Vaccines Protein subunit vaccines which include recombinant protein vaccines are based on synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins of the target pathogen, co n- taining specific antigenic fragments with out their pathogenic components which eliminates concerns of incomplete viral inactivation, virulence recovery, and pre -existing anti -vector immunity [34] . Therefore, protein subunit vaccines are regarded as relatively safe. Current notable recombinant protein vaccines in use are the HPV and Hep B vaccine. Different expression systems exist for the recombinant proteins, including insect and mammalian cells, yeast and plants [49]. Specific neutralizing antigenic epitopes can be targeted and improve immu- nogenicity and/or efficacy when combined with adjuvants which extends the b i- ological half -life of the antigenic material or increase the immunomodulatory cytokine response [50] [51]. Currently, many of the SARS -CoV -2 subunit va c- cines utilize the S protein and its fragments, such as the RBD as the antigen as it was shown to have numerous conformational neutralizing epitopes, which is suitable for vaccine development The RBD comprises major antigenic ep i- topes that elicit both neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses [43] and is demonstrated that most antibodies produced against the RBD can neutralize coronaviruses thus inhibiting its ability to attach to the host cells [53] . Some r e- combinant COVID -19 vaccines in development include recombinant S protein, recombinant RBD and virus -like particle (VLP) vaccines [22] and the Novavax L.-A. Wong et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108624 9 Open Access Library Journal vaccine is also developed using this platform. 4.5. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Vaccines Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) (nucleic acid -based) vaccines are novel platforms for vaccine development that offer great flexibility for antigen manipulation and rapid production. They are a cutting -edge vaccine development approach with huge therapeutic potential and are considered cost-effective as it eliminates the need to grow viruses or viral proteins insid e live cells in tissue culture laboratory, thus making it easier for large -scale manufac- turing [37] [54]. Nucleic acid vaccines are similar to viral vector vaccines in which they transmit genetic instructions (DNA or mRNA encoding disease -specific an- tigens), primarily for the expression of viral S protein (in COVID -19) into host cells to induce an immunogenic response [54] . DNA and RNA utilize the host cells' machinery to generate immunogens that stimulate both antibody and T-cell induction [55] . DNA vaccines use a recombinant plasmid that contains a mammalian expre s- sion promoter and a transgene encoding the antigen which undergoes a tran- scription -to-translational to produce the antigen. The production process is relatively simple and can produce a strong immunogenic response with a high safety margin [56] [57] [58]. Plasmid DNA vaccines have gained more at ten- tion than mRNA in the past decades due to the intrinsic stability of DNA double helixes compared to single strands of mRNA and the possible effect of degrading RNase [24]. DNA vaccines have been tested for efficacy in vitro and in vivo with some gaining approval for veterinary use [59] . Some DNA vaccines for SARS -CoV -2 currently in Phase 3 trials include ZyCoV -D (Zydus Cadila) and INO -4800 (I n- ovio) [10] . Similar to DNA vaccines, the mRNA vaccines are based on the induction of transient antigen (S -protein for COVID -19 vaccines) expression of host cells which can be divided into 2 categories: non -replicating mRNA and mRNA -based vac- cines encode the antigen of interest whereas the latter encodes both the antigen, as well as the viral replication machinery for intracellular mRNA amplication [60] [61]. Currently, only non- replicating mRNA vaccines are available for COVID -19. Once injected, the RNA is translated i nto the target protein to i n- duce an immune response. RNA vaccines do not integrate into the host genome as it does not enter the nucleus, instead , it remains in the cell cytoplasm [62] [63]. Moreover, mRNA is degraded by ribonucleases and natural cellular processes and by using various delivery methods and modifications, its in vivo half- life can be regulated [60] . However, mRNA vaccines are relatively less stable compared to DNA vaccines, in which well -managed handling and storage are necessary [64] [65]. RNA vaccines were amongst the first vaccines produced for SARS -CoV -2 and some of them are Pfizer ( Comirnaty/BNT162b2) and Mode r-L.-A. Wong et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108624 10 Open Access Library Journal na (mRNA -1273). 5. Mechanism of Action of Main Corona -19 Vaccines 5.1. Pfizer/BioNTech \u2014BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) The vaccine developed with Pfizer in collaboration with German company B i- oNTech is a nucleic acid vaccine with a nucleo side-modified taken from the spike (S) formulated (LNP). BNT162b2 RNA encodes a full -length S protein in which the perf u- sion configuration is stabilized by using proline to substitute amino acids K986 and V987 (S(P2)) [66] ion of the transmembrane -anchored S protein but still allowing for cleavage of the S1 and S2 subunits [68] . The delivery methods of the mRNA vaccine are important as the mRNA molecules must penetrate lipid membranes, localize in the cyto p- lasm and activate the translation- to-transcription process in cells. Pfizer uses utilizes LNP encapsulation in the manufacture of the BNT162b2 vaccine [66], which has been shown to efciently deliver mRNA in vivo and also p rotect it from degradation by nucleases [69] [70]. However, a disadvant age is that these vaccines need to be stored at 80C [71] making it difficult to distribute to low- and medium- income countries. After injection, internalization of mRNA occurs and is rapidly translated by antigen -presenting cells (APC) both at the injection site and in draining lymph nodes, where it is shown to initiate robust adaptive immune responses in vivo [72] [73], generating RBD u- mans [74]. A large placebo -controlled Phase III trial of over 37,000 participants showed that a two -dose regimen of BNT162b2 (30 g per dose, given 21 days apart) was found to be safe and had 95% effic acy (95% CI 90.3 - 97.6; 8 versus 162 cases in placebo) in preventing symptomatic COVID -19 infection [74]. It also proved to generate a greater immunogenic response in children and adole s- cents compared to young adults [75] . It is reported that most people only exp e- rience mild local and systemic side effects such as pain at t he injection site, fat i- gue, headache and fever which were more common after the second dose [76] . However, there have been several cases of anaphylaxis after vaccin ation, mostly attributed to patients with a prior history of allergies [77] [78] and rare cases of myocarditis [79]. Nonetheless, the benefits of the vaccine greatly outweigh the small increased risk of serious adverse effects. 5.2. AstraZeneca/Oxford \u2014ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 ChAdOx1 nCoV -19 is a recombinant non- replicating viral vector vaccine that expresses the S protein which is synthesized based using a chimpanzee adenov i- rus. The sequence coding amino acids (2 -1273) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence at the 5' end are encapsulated in a shuttle (plasmid) vector [80]. These modified adenoviruses cannot replicate in the human body because the gene which enables virion assembly has been deleted, making it a relatively L.-A. Wong et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108624 11 Open Access Library Journal safe way to introduce the antigenic component of SARS -CoV -2 into the host cell [54]. This strategy leads to host cells expressing the S protein thus stimulating a strong humoral and cell -mediated immune response [81] [82] [83]. Interim r e- sults from for ongoing, blinded, a multinational phase III randomized controlled trial showed 70.4% efficacy (95% CI 54.8 - in preventing asymptomatic COVID -19 infection [84] [85] . Other than the usual mild systemic side effects, there have been several co n- cerns regarding thrombotic events associated with thrombocytopenia [86] which some experts refer to as vaccine thrombotic thrombocyto- [88] [89]. A large proportion of these cases are associated with autoantibodies d i- rected against the platelet factor 4 (PF4) antigen [90] [91], as seen with autoimmune heparin -induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) [92] . A few r e- ported cases show that thrombosis usually occurred at uncommon sites such as the cerebral venous sinuses [93], splanchnic vein, pulmonary artery and other sites [89]. Therefore, all recipients of ChAdOx1 nCoV -19 vaccines should be counselled regarding the possible risks an d advised to seek immediate care for suggestive signs of thrombocytopenia. Unlike nucleic acid -based vaccines, ChAdOx1 nCoV -19 can be kept at refrigerator temperature (2 C - 8C), making it easier for storage and distribution [94] . 5.3. Sinovac \u2014CoronaVac CoronaVac (formerly called PiCoVacc) is based on a well -known traditional vaccine methodology, using an inactivated virus in Vero cell line culture. The SARS -CoV -2 virus (CZ02 Strain) is inoculated into African green monkey ki d- ney cells (Vero Cell), inactivated using -propiolactone and combined with al u- minium hydroxide as an adjunct [38] [95]. When injected, antigen (APC) presenting different antigenic dete r- minants which are recognised by the immune system, inducing the production of nAbs. CoronaVac can be stored at (2 C - 8C) for years, increasing its suit a- bility for countries with poor socioeconomic status and places with limited cold-storage capacity. Phase III trials have been conducted in several parts of the world with results of efficacy ranging from 50 .7% (Brazil), 65.30% (Indonesia) and 83.5% (Turkey) [95] [96] [97]. Common adverse effects were injection -site pain and mild systemic side effects. In contrast to viral vector or nucleic a c- id-based vaccines, fever occurred much less after vaccination with CoronaVac [98] and was much better tolerated in adults aged 60 and a bove [99]. Diminis h- ing nAbs production was noted with increased age, suggesting a need for a d o- sage increase for the elderly [100] . Moreover, these vaccines have a good safety profile and pose no risk of causing infection even for immunosuppressed ind i- viduals as they cannot replicate in the human body. However, they are known to be less effective compared to live- attenuated vaccines as they mainly stimulate humoral immune response with minimal cell -mediated immune response [54] [101] . Therefore, multiple doses are usually required to generate immunity. A l-L.-A. Wong et al. DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1108624 12 Open Access Library Journal though no human studies have shown to cau se antibody dependant enhanc e- ment (ADE) for CoronaVac, there is a theoretical risk that inactivated vaccines may increase the risk of developing non- neutralizing antibodies resulting in lung inflammation [102] [103] , which was seen in the (RSV) and measles vaccine [104] [105] . 6. Conclusion In a span of just 2 years since the discovery of SARS -CoV -2, there have been tremendous technological advances worldwide in the production of a COVID -19 vaccine. Vaccines for COVID -19 have been produced at a rate that has not been witnessed before in history, some using novel platforms not used in humans prior to this pandemic. However, despite the rapid production and distribution worldwide, several n ew variants of concern have emerged, with threats of vac- cines being ineffective in providing immunity to the population. Although this literature review highlights the different vaccination platforms, along with the mechanisms of action of some main COVID -19 vaccines, the effects of mixing different vaccines and emerging variants of concern were not addressed but it is hoped that understanding the mechanisms of action of vaccines, it can provide more insight into the advancement of research for new COVID -19 vaccines and with hopes to find more effective solutions to control this pandemic. It is pos t- ulated that around 70% of the world's population need to be vaccinated to achieve a desirable outcome of herd immunity. Each COVID -19 vaccine has its relative pros and cons with regard to its efficacy and side effects, which makes it difficult to conclude that vaccine is superior. Nonetheless, the accessibility and afford a- bility of vaccines will be of greater importance to curb this pandemic, especially in developi ng nations.
