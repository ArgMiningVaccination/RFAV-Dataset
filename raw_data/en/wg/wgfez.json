See page 32. [ FROM THE EDITOR The Paranormal's Creators . . . and Some of Its Present Promoters One of the intriguing things about pseudoscience and the paranormal is that each field has been initiated and championed by just a handful of propo-nents and promoters. Mainly through popular books and articles (today it would be blogs, infomercials, and cable TV shows), of varying credibility and quality, they've made their impassioned appeals for the public's attention. Sci-ence has its famous heroes, but it doesn't work the same way. Collegiality and cooperation (and peer competition) mark all science, and any new scientific field quickly expands to dozens or hundreds of people working on the problems and ferreting out errors. Advocates of pseudoscience and the paranormal work more in isolation, and so those who have been successful (popularly if not scientifically) become closely identified with their \"specialties.\" For this issue's cover article, \"Creators of the Paranormal,\" Joe Nickell aban- dons his usual case-by-case investigatory style to survey the people who created our modern concept of the paranormal and its main topics. Joe nimbly portrays such people as \"unexplained collector\" Charles Fort, first ghost hunter Harry Price, UFO \"inventor\" Raymond A. Palmer, ESP \"discoverer\" J.B. Rhine, cryp-tozoology father Bernard Heuvelmans, Bermuda \"Triangulator\" Vincent H. Gaddis, ancient astronaut huckster Erich von D\u00e4niken, and other famous/no-torious characters. Each, he says, took a concept\u2014a fantasy, myth, or specula-tion\u2014and transformed it into a kind of \"reality.\" Their motives varied. Some, Nickell notes, were credulous but principled. Some were out to make a buck. Others \"wished to stir things up and enjoy the fray.\" Their creations proved popular, some enormously so, but they have turned out to be, almost without exception, scientifically barren. That article is followed by a scholarly look at paranormal beliefs and the role subclinical psychological \"dissociation\" plays in their acceptance. In his third SI article on these subjects, psychology professor Matthew J. Sharps\u2014and two colleagues\u2014describes research showing that the tendency to believe in the para-normal is associated with a tendency toward subclinical (no, they're not crazy) dissociation. They also show that the best way to get believers to be more critical of claims about the unreal is to confront them with very specific, detail-centered questions. Then U.S. Air Force Academy psychology professor Craig Foster and two colleagues use a classroom experiment at the Academy to test one very spe-cific claim that might be considered paranormal: that so-called Phiten titani-um-treated necklaces improve the con-trolled experiments and . . . well, I'll let you read the outcome. \"SkepDoc\" Harriet Hall returns to our pages with a lively look into another specific area: ear acupuncture. (Yes, really!) Hall turns her pesky knowledge and irreverent wit to demolish a new published study that found ear acupuncture useful in treating sore throats. What was wrong with the study? \"Practically everything,\" Hall says, and she tells us why. There's much more in this issue. I think you'll enjoy it. \u2014K F Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 5[ SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT A year-long effort to find a successor to the Center for Inquiry's outgoing president and CEO, Ronald A. Lindsay, came to a successful conclusion earlier this year with a big double-whammy announcement: the new president and CEO of CFI will be Robyn Blumner, president and CEO of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science (RDFRS), and the RDFRS would be merging with CFI. The new organization will be the largest secularist and skeptic organization in the United States and will bear the name Center for Inquiry, with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science becom-ing a division of CFI. The Center for Inquiry, a nonprofit ed- ucational, advocacy, and research orga-nization, is home to our Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and S/K.sc/E.sc/P.sc/T.sc/I.sc/C.sc/A.sc/L.sc I/N.sc/Q.sc/U.sc/I.sc/R.sc/E.sc/R.sc magazine and the Council for Secular Hu-manism and Free Inquiry magazine. Now it will also be home to the RDFRS and its programs. Blumner became CEO of the combined entity on January 25, 2016. Lindsay re-tains the title of president until the merger is complete and will work closely with Blumner during the transition period. Before heading up the RDFRS, Blumner, a lawyer, had been a syndicated columnist for the Tampa Bay Times and the head of statewide affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida and Utah. Dawkins, the noted evolutionary biol- ogist and author, will become a member of the CFI Board of Directors, along with the two other directors of RDFRS, once the merger is complete. He has long been a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical In-quiry and a prominent advocate for good science and opponent of pseudoscience in all its forms. The January 21 announcement (http:// www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/ cfi_dawkins_merger/) said CFI and RDFRS planned to begin unified operations im-mediately, although the merger will not become final until later this spring after necessary legal and regulatory approval. The merged organization will be the larg- est in the United States with a mission of promoting secularism and science, with an annual budget in excess of $6 million and a staff of about forty-five employees. CFI will maintain its main headquarters in Amherst, New York. Both CFI and RDFRS have executive offices in Washington, D.C., and these will be combined. CFI branches in Los Angeles and other cities will be re-tained. \"I am absolutely delighted that I'm closing out my tenure at CFI by helping to bring about a merger between RDFRS and CFI,\" Lindsay said in the announcement. \"Both organizations share a vital common mission, and together we can accomplish much more. And, of course, CFI looks for-ward to the benefit of close collaboration with Richard Dawkins, indisputably one of the preeminent public intellectuals of our time.\" (Also see, \"Ronald A. Lindsay: 'A Mo-mentous Event,'\" next page.) \"Secularism is the United States and beyond,\" Robyn Blumner observed. \"Science has proven to be the engine of human progress. Bringing more resources and ambition to promoting these forces of reason is what this merger is about. I am thrilled to be tapped to lead this joint effort and expand on what Ron Lindsay has built.\" (Also see her note to SI readers, next page.) For his part, Richard Dawkins said this: I am very pleased that my foundation is about to join forces with the Center for Inquiry. CFI is the biggest player in the secular/nonreligious/skeptical world, and I like to hope that RDFRS will have something to add to its already flourishing enterprise. In turn, among our projects which will benefit from a larger team of professionals are Openly Secular and the Teacher Institute for Evolutionary Science (TIES). I look for-ward to adding my voice to CFI's focus on promoting secular humanism and fighting the proliferation of pseudosci-ence. I am also especially delighted that Robyn Blumner, the present CEO of RDFRS, is to become the President and CEO of the whole organization. Ron Lindsay is truly (forgive the clich\u00e9) a hard act to follow. If anyone can do it, Robyn can. Center for Inquiry, Richard Dawkins Foundation Merging; Robyn Blumner CFI's New CEO The merged organization will be the largest in the United States with a mission of promoting secularism and science.6 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerRonald A. Lindsay: 'A Momentous Event' Ron Lindsay posted this blog entry on the CFI website January 21, 2016: As you might recall, last year I announced that I would be stepping down as pres-ident and CEO of the Center for Inquiry, to make way for new leadership in 2016 [see \"The Future of CFI, \" S/K.sc/E.sc/P.sc/T.sc/I.sc/C.sc/A.sc/L.sc I/N.sc/Q.sc/U.sc/I.sc/R.sc/E.sc/R.sc, September/October 2015]. I said then that I wanted to give the CFI board of directors ample time to find a highly qualified new chief executive. Consistent with my hopes and expectations, the board has found a talented, experienced leader for CFI. What I could not have expected, but I am delighted to share with you now, is that in finding a wonderful new CEO, CFI has also made an unprecedented move to be-come stronger and more effective than ever. I am delighted to tell you today that the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science has agreed to merge with the Center for Inquiry and that their president and CEO, Robyn Blumner, will be the new CEO of the combined organizations, which will work under the name of the Center for Inquiry. CFI and RDFRS both seek to make the world a better place for all, religious and nonreligious alike, by untangling faith and pseudoscience from government, pro-moting critical thinking and skepticism, and advocating for science and reason in all areas of public life. Each organization brings unique strengths to the table, and given the similarity in their missions, these two organizations are an excellent match. This is a momentous event not only for our organization but for the entire secular and skeptic movement. This new Center for Inquiry is now the largest freethought organization in the United States, and the combined talents, resources, and passion of CFI and RDFRS will allow the Center for Inquiry to have a greater impact than ever. We begin working together as one unified organization beginning right now. And I can't wait for you to get to know Robyn Blumner. An extremely accom-plished and deeply respected lawyer, ac-tivist, journalist, and nonprofit executive, Robyn has lifted RDFRS to new heights. There is no one better at this time to lead the Center for Inquiry. She will formally be-come CFI's CEO on Monday, January 25. As for Richard Dawkins himself, CFI is thrilled to be associated with one of the preeminent public intellectuals of our time, and we're all eager to take full advantage of his wisdom, intelligence, and eloquence as perhaps the world's foremost communi-cator of science and secularism. For me, I will retain the title of president of CFI for a brief period during the transi-tion. I will do all I can to ensure that this new CFI gets off to a smooth and success-ful start. Surely you will have a lot of ques- tions, and we'll do our best to answer them. For now, you can get more in-formation about this merger at our F.A.Q. at this link (http://www.center forinquiry.net/pages/cfi_dawkins_faq/). And please join me in warmly welcom- ing Robyn Blumner, Richard Dawkins, and all at RDFRS to the Center for Inquiry. Each organization brings unique strengths to the table, and given the similarity in their missions, these two organizations are an excellent match.Note to SI Readers from New CEO Robyn Blumner I know what you must be thinking: An atheist, ACLU-loving lawyer, and writer known for legal and ideological battles with Mormons in Utah and evangelicals in Florida, what can she know about science and skepticism? And you would have a point. My chosen profession and, to be frank, my skill set lean toward the humanities. But science fills me with awe. I come from a family in which science was held in the highest esteem. My dad graduated from the Bronx High School of Science, and had his love for soccer not interfered\u2014he played semi-pro for a time\u2014he would have gone into biology as a career. Instead, he taught public school and shared his pas-sion for science (and soccer) with genera-tions of students. Even before my connection to the Rich- ard Dawkins Foundation, I was an avid reader of Richard Dawkins's books. Like Carl Sagan, Richard is a master commu - nicator of science to a lay audience. For me, these men provided a window into the workings of the evidence-based world. As to the work of the Center for Inquiry, some may see skepticism and secularism as distinct and separate endeavors. I see them as overlapping and reinforcing. They derive from the same source: a willingness to put truth claims to the test. And when that happens, humanity benefits in pro-found and tangible ways. I am thrilled and honored to be CEO of the Center for Inquiry, a place where evidence matters, and the truth gets puts through its paces for the good of us all. Thank you to everyone for the kind and generous welcome. \"I am thrilled and honored to be CEO of the Center for Inquiry, a place where evidence matters.\"Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 7[ NEWS AND COMMENT Lumosity Fined Over False 'Brain Game' Claims B R In early January the company behind Lumosity, the popular \"brain training\" program adver-tised as helping prevent cogni-tive impairment, \"agreed to set-tle Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charges alleging that they deceived consumers with unfounded claims that Lumosity games can help users perform better at work and in school, and reduce or delay cognitive impair-ment associated with age and other serious health conditions,\" according to a press release from the FTC. The company sold subscrip- tions to its \"brain building\" prod-ucts and services, with options ranging from monthly ($14.95) to lifetime ($299.95) memberships. \"Lumosity preyed on consumers' fears about age-related cognitive decline, suggesting their games could stave off memory loss, de-mentia, and even Alzheimer's disease,\" said Jessica Rich, direc-tor of the FTC's Bureau of Con-sumer Protection. \"But Lumosity simply did not have the science to back up its ads.\" Count II of the FTC's complaint states: Defendants have represented, directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that training with the Lumosity Program reduces cognitive impairment associated with health condi-tions, including Turner syn-drome, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, trau-matic brain injury, stroke, and side effects of chemotherapy. The representations . . . are false or were not substantiated at the time the representations were made. The FTC also accused Lu- mosity of misleading consumers by \"failing to disclose that some consumer testimonials featured on [its] website had been solic-ited through contests that prom-ised significant prizes, including a free iPad, a lifetime Lumosity subscription, and a round-trip to San Francisco.\" The company was also fined $50 million but will only have to pay $2 million in re-dress and notify its clients of the FTC action. Medical researchers have been skeptical for many years about the efficacy of \"brain training\" products such as those marketed under brand names including Lu-mosity and Brain Gym. In 2014, the Stanford Center on Longevity and the Berlin Max Planck Insti-tute for Human Development asked leading cognitive psychol-ogists and neuroscientists to ex-amine evidence for the efficacy of brain games and programs. They issued a statement saying in part that \"We object to the claim that brain games offer consumers a scientifically grounded avenue to reduce or reverse cognitive decline when there is no compelling sci-entific evidence to date that they do.\" The best medical research shows that simple\u2014and free\u2014physical exercise is the best way to maintain cognitive function throughout life and into old age.

In recognition of his \"extraordinary applica- tion of the skills honed as an actor to commu-nicating science on television and stage, and by teaching scientists innovative techniques that allow them to tell their stories to the public,\" the National Academy of Sciences is presenting its 2016 Public Welfare Medal to Alda, whom the Academy described as an actor, director, writer, and science communicator. The medal is the Academy's most prestigious award, established in 1914 and presented annually to honor extraordi-nary use of science for the public good. \"Through so many different venues, Alan Alda has been a tireless advocate for science, in-viting millions of people to engage in the thrills of scientific discovery,\" said Susan Wessler, home secretary of the Academy and chair of the selection committee for the award. \"His ability to help researchers find their own voices about their work is unparalleled.\" \"Alan Alda is a gifted communicator, but just as impressively, he has generously shared his tal- \"Lumosity preyed on consumers' fears about age-related cognitive FTC8 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirerents by training thousands of scientists to share their research with the public in ways that build lasting connections,\" said National Academy of Sciences President Ralph J. Cicerone. \"We are pleased to present him our highest award.\" Alda's acting career on television, film, and stage spans more than five de-cades. His role as science communicator is equally distinguished, noted the Acad-emy. As host of PBS's Scientific American Frontiers from 1993 to 2005, Alda in- terviewed hundreds of researchers about new discoveries in science, technology, and medicine. He also hosted two mini-series for PBS: The Human Spark , which explored what makes humans unique, and Brains on Trial , which examined how neuroscientific data from brain mapping technology could be used as evidence to inform the court system. On Broad-way, Alda appeared in QED as physicist Richard Feynman. He also wrote the play Radiance: The Passion of Marie Curie and Dear Albert , a reading for the stage of Einstein's letters. By the spring of 2016, Dear Albert will have been presented in New York City, Moscow, and Brisbane. Alda's passion for helping scientists communicate with the public led to the establishment in 2009 of the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University's School of Journalism, where he is also a visiting professor. Alda and the Center have trained thousands of scientists through workshops at universities and other sci-ence-oriented institutions around the country. Alda is a member of the board for the World Science Festival and has won numerous awards, including the 2010 Kavli Science Journalism Award, the National Science Board's Public Service Award, the Scientific American Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Ameri-can Chemical Society Award for Public Service. In 2014, he was named a fellow of the American Physical Society for his work in helping scientists improve their communication skills. The Public Welfare Medal will be presented to Alan Alda on May 1 during the Academy's 153rd annual meeting. Scientists Urge Supreme Court: Reject Pseudoscientific Testimony for Texas Abortion Case P F Eminent scientists and public intellectuals are backing the Center for Inquiry (CFI) in a brief to the Supreme Court criticizing the state of Texas's onerous restrictions on abortion providers. CFI's brief argues that the alleged expert scientific testimony used to justify the restrictions is flawed pseudoscience and the Court cannot con-stitutionally rely on it. In Whole Woman's Health v. Cole , plaintiffs argue that restrictions on abortion pro- viders passed in Texas in 2013 impose an undue burden on women's constitutionally protected right to end a pregnancy. Since only a few clinics are able to meet the law's strictures, it will result in mass clinic closures and sharply restricted access to abortion services in the state. The CFI brief argues that Texas's claim that the regulations protect women's health is contrary to the science and facts. As it explains, Vincent Rue, a long-discredited anti-abortion partisan with no relevant medical credentials, coordinated the testimony in support of the state's claim. Yet in every case in which Rue has coordinated testimony to defend regulations requiring abortion doctors to have hospital admitting privileges\u2014such as those at the heart of this case\u2014the evidence presented has been discounted by the trial court. Federal trial courts have found that the unqualified Rue substantially ghostwrote the testimony of alleged expert witnesses in a number of cases. His efforts are agen-da-driven pseudoscience that seeks to manufacture controversy, the CFI brief says. Nicholas Little, legal director of the Center for Inquiry, said: This case will affect the medical well-being of millions of women, and it is unthinkable that the Supreme Court of the United States might make such a monumental decision based on such flawed testimony, that offers only misrep-resentation and misdirection. While the Center for Inquiry as an organization wholeheartedly supports women's abortion rights, for this case we come to the Court purely as advocates of science and reason. Justice Kennedy, in the last abortion case to reach the Court, made clear that the Supreme Court has a duty to independently examine the facts of cases where constitutional rights are at issue. The Court has wisely rejected fabricated, pseudoscientific evidence in previous cases, and we strongly urge the justices to do the same here. \"We hope the Court is able to put abortion politics aside and focus on the illegiti- macy of the medical claims propping up the restrictions,\" said Robyn Blumner, president and CEO of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science and CEO of the Center for Inquiry. \"When science claims are used to infringe a constitutional right they had better be valid, but that's not the case here.\" The brief argues that the state's testimony, as coordinated by Rue, \"fails to demon- strate even a rational relation between the restrictions and the State's legitimate interest in women's health sufficient to overcome the burden that these restrictions create for women in Texas who are in need of essential and legally protected medical care.\" The amicus brief, filed by the Center for Inquiry, was signed by the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science, along with over forty individual scientists and experts in reason and critical thinking, including psychologist Steven Pinker, anthropologist Eug-enie C. Scott, physicist Lawrence Krauss, skeptic icon James Randi, social psychologist Carol Tavris, astrophysicist Jill Tarter, and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.

[ NEWS AND COMMENT Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 9Italian Court Acquits Six Convicted Seismologists B R In late November 2015, the Italian Supreme Court formally and finally overturned the convictions of six scientists who had been charged with manslaughter for failing to adequately warn of the dangers of an April 2009 earthquake that left 309 people dead. The seismologists had participated in a meeting a week before the earthquake to discuss the dangers of recent smaller tremors in the town of L'Aquila. The original judge had found that their risk assessment of the threat of a larger earthquake had been superficial and inadequate, resulting in townspeople being wrongly reassured that they would be safe in their homes when the earthquake struck. The complicated case began in 2010 when the six scientists were investigated and charged, resulting in six-year prison sentences handed down in 2012; the convictions were appealed and overturned in 2014. That appeal was itself appealed by prosecutors who asked that the convictions be reinstated. This final ruling by the Supreme Court puts an end to the mat-ter for all involved. The five-judge panel acquitted the scientists but upheld the conviction of Bernardo De Bernardinis, at the time an official in Italy's civil protection depart-ment. The judges determined that De Bernardinis had in fact wrongly reassured the public, while the six seismic scientists had simply stated that the chance of a major earthquake remained the same and thus had neither raised undue alarm nor downplayed the risk of the quake that soon followed. De Bernardinis's jail time was reduced to two years. The case was widely watched\u2014and condemned\u2014 by scientists around the world concerned about being criminally charged for not accurately predicting in - herently unpredictable natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes. The double tragedy of the earthquake and its fallout highlights the difficulty scientists have in trying to communicate absolute and relative risk to the general public. Mathematical Model Debunks Conspiracies B R One of the hallmarks of conspiracy theories is that those involved must keep silent about it. After all, it's not much of a conspiracy if people in the know share their knowledge. But this leads to a thorny problem for believers: How could these con-spiracies remain intact year after year and decade after decade? Is it plausible that the world's governments have successfully colluded over the past half-century (across multiple presidents and administrations) to hide evidence of alien contact? Is it rea-sonable to think that oil companies have successfully prevented the public from learning about engines that run on air or water? In this Internet age, could these secrets really remain hidden? A new study published January 26, 2016, in the online open-access journal PLoS ONE (see http://tinyurl.com/z5ps7ke) examined how likely it would be that a given con-spiracy of silence could be maintained over time. The study, by David Robert Grimes of the University of Oxford, notes: Historical examples of exposed conspiracies do exist and it may be difficult for people to differentiate between reasonable and dubious assertions. In this work, we establish a simple mathe-matical model for conspiracies involving multiple actors with time, which yields failure probability for any given conspiracy. Failure, in this case, means that the conspiracy is exposed and verified for all the world to see. Grimes examined four popular conspiracy theories (that un- safe vaccinations are being covered up; that the moon landings were faked; that Big Pharma is hiding a cure for cancer; and that climate change is a fraud), then estimated how many peo-ple would have to be involved to maintain a cover-up for each scenario, and finally calculated how long it would take for the truth to be made public\u2014in other words, for the conspiracy to be broken. Grimes calculated that all of these conspiracies would have been revealed in less than four years. For compari-son, Grimes examined three true, real-life conspiracies. Grimes concluded: The analysis here predicts that even with parameter estimates favorable to conspiratorial leanings that the conspiracies ana-lyzed tend rapidly towards collapse. Even if there was a con-certed effort, the sheer number of people required for the sheer Many conspiracy theories claim that those involved in the cover-up have gone out of their way to announce and describe their evil plans to the world.Take action with us.

For a conspiracy of even only a few thousand actors, intrinsic failure would arise within decades. For hundreds of thousands, such failure would be assured within less than half a decade. Think of all the people who would have to be involved (bribed, threatened, silenced, or even killed) to maintain a cover-up of an event on that scale. The 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting\u2014which some conspiracy theo-rists claim did not happen but was instead an elaborate hoax staged as a pretext to confiscate America's guns\u2014is a good example. As a practical matter, such an event would be essentially impossible to fake. Not only would dozens or hundreds of eyewitnesses, police officers, \"crisis actors,\" and others be involved (and somehow silenced), but there's the (presum-ably) undeniable deaths of real people. If the whole thing was faked, that means that the twenty students and six teachers killed in the event never really existed\u2014that all the employ-ment, school, medical, and other records dating back decades were faked, along with their friends and families pretending to have known them. Conspiracy theorists believe that this scenario is somehow more plausible than the unheard-of no-tion that one mentally ill kid with a gun attacked the school. Paradoxically, many conspiracy theories claim that those involved in the cover-up have gone out of their way to an- nounce and describe their evil plans to the world. They say all the signs are there; it's all laid out in front of you, if you just understand how to interpret the clues and signs. For ex-ample, the Denver airport is the center of several conspiracy theories, ranging from some Nazi connection to being over a labyrinth of top-secret underground bunkers for the world's 1 percenters to survive a nuclear war. As evidence of these claims, believers point to murals in the airport depicting World War II-era genocide and environmental degradation, along with a message of global unity, peace, and hope. All the clues you need to understand the conspiracy are right there in the artwork\u2014if you just know how to read the symbols. Similarly, those involved in the alleged conspiracy to hide the fact that Paul McCartney died in the 1960s cleverly left clues in various Beatles album cover art that revealed the truth to those who knew what to look for. There were dozens of references to McCartney's demise in photos and lyrics, all cited as proof and evidence of the conspiracy. It was convinc-ing to many people\u2014and, of course, wrong. Grimes's calculations confirm something known for cen- turies: Conspiracies are most effective when they involve a small number of people.

A former stage magician and private detective, he is author of numerous books, including The Science of Ghosts (2012). Gallows Ghosts? Mystery at Brisbane's Tower Mill According to The Ghost Guide to Australia (Davis 1998, 224), one or perhaps both of the ghosts of two Aborigines\u2014convicted of murder and hanged at Tower Mill in Brisbane in 1841\u2014may still be seen there. Residents in the neighborhood in the mid-twentieth century reported that \"sometimes when they looked up at the small window facing the street they could see a faint glow and a figure inside the tower, swinging gently from side to side.\" No sources are given, but vari-ous online sites repeat the claims (e.g., \"Tower Mill Ghost\" 2016), and Tower Mill is a stop\u2014sometimes even a point of origin\u2014for ghost tours. I became acquainted with the old tower (Figure 1) in October 2015 when I stayed for several days at a hotel just down the street from the historic site. (I was there to speak at the annual Austra-lian Skeptics National Convention, Oc-tober 16-18, 2015, spending some two weeks in Australia and New Zealand and conducting several investigations.) Here is my solution to the mystery of the ghosts in the tower. Background Tower Mill is the oldest remaining building in Brisbane. Constructed of sandstone blocks and brick in 1828, it was at that time encircled (about a third of the way up) by an exterior balcony. The tower was built as a windmill for grinding grain, especially corn. That was the main staple of the diet of convicts, who were transported from Britain to Australian penal colonies (beginning with Sydney in 1788). The mill was outfitted with wind-powered sails, but when these proved unreliable a treadmill, powered by convicts, was installed. When the convict settlement closed in 1842, the treadmill was dismantled. From its inception as a grist mill, the four-story structure became (at one time or another) a signal station, a fire tower, first home of the Queensland Museum, a radio-experiment site, a pioneer televi-sion broadcasting tower, and (presently) a weather observatory (\"Old Windmill\" 2015; Dawson 2009, 22). Once, of course, it briefly served as a gallows. Murder There had been conflicts between the Aborigines and British occupants of the penal colony of Moreton Bay since the 1800s. However, with the seizure of hundreds of square miles of Aboriginal land and the arrival of squatters in 1840, the native people began a coordi-nated response, largely involving attacks on livestock. To this powder keg, sur-veyors came waving firebrands. They were intruding on Aboriginal land filled with cultural sites (Dawson 2009, 4-6; Chambers 1999, 131-139). On Sunday, May 31, 1840, members of a survey party, including a number of convicts, awoke at their bush camp some thirty kilometers south of Mount Lindesay. Surveyor Granville Stapy-lton\u2014who exhibited a low regard for indigenous people\u2014sent five convicts to clear a passage over a creek while he remained at camp with several Aborig-inal men and two other convicts, Wil - liam Tuck and James Dunlop (Dawson 2009, 12). Soon three of the Aborigines left camp but returned with another, all now armed with spears. Two went to Sta- pylton's tent and two to Tuck's, while yet another knocked the observing Dunlop senseless with a waddy (a club). When the work party returned from the creek about noon, they found Stapylton and Tuck murdered. Abandoning the injured Dunlop, they fled back toward Brisbane. A group of thirty or so Ab-original men meanwhile returned to the scene to strip the bodies and loot the camp. One Aboriginal man came to Dunlop's aid, and he later managed to crawl into the bush. The next evening, exhausted and hungry, he ran into a search party that had been alerted by the fleeing convicts (Dunlop 1840). A gruesome scene awaited the search- ers. Tuck's body had been stripped and partially burned, while Stapylton's was found so \"torn and mangled\" (possibly by the marauders' dogs) that it could not be legally identified. Three of five iden-tified Aboriginal suspects were captured. One died before trial, but two others, named Mullan and Ningavil, faced the Sydney Supreme Court in May 1841. The prosecution focused on the murder of Tuck whose body had been identifi-able, but, since it was impossible to say who struck the death blow, the accused were tried as accessories. They pro-claimed their innocence, but\u2014although Figure 1. Brisbane's historic Tower Mill is reportedly haunted. (Sketch by Joe Nickell) 12 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerSkeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 13Dunlop swore they were not the at- tackers\u2014other convicts claimed to have seen them in the vicinity, and they were wearing clothes stolen from the camp. They were convicted and sentenced to death (Dawson 2009, 12-20, 27). Hanging The tower served as an improvised gal-lows for the men's hanging on Saturday morning, July 3, 1841. While ghost raconteurs more than a century later would claim people had seen through a window a hanged man swinging back and forth, it seemed to me unlikely the hanging was carried out inside the tower. That it stood on a hill suggested the hanging was to be a very public display, not one hidden from view. I investigated and found that this was indeed the case. The hanging was exterior to the tower, and a large crowd gathered, including a hundred or so Ab-origines. The Foreman of Works in the Brisbane settlement, Andrew Petrie, provided a strong round beam that he extended from an upper window. The rope was hung from this beam, its noose dangling to the balcony. Possibly a trap-door was put in the floor, or, more likely, the prisoners may have been dispatched by pushing them off the balcony (Knight 1892; Dawson 2009, 23). In any case, the drop was a short one, resulting in the condemned being slowly strangled to death. (In later executions a \"long drop\" was employed as a humane measure, allowing the body to fall far enough to create a force sufficient to break the per-son's neck.) A ten-year-old boy who watched the gruesome event was foremen Petrie's son, Tom. A convict led him by the hand to one of the dead men's coffins where he saw the man's face. As Tom Petrie's own daughter would later write (Petrie 1904, 245), \"The eyes were staring, and the open mouth had the tongue protruding from it. The horror of the ghastly sight so frightened the child that it set him crying, and he could not get over it nor forget it for long afterwards.\" Hanging Specter The dead man's features that so trauma-tized young Tom Petrie are consistent with a strangulation death. Such a vic-tim will often bite his tongue (Geberth 1993, 250) that \"frequently protrudes from the mouth\" (Spitz 1993, 463). This confirms reports of the \"short drop\" of the hanging. It also casts further doubt on the hanging-ghost story. Not only is that often-repeated tale effectively discred-ited by the historical error of placing the hanging inside the tower, but (and this is a more subtle point) there was no mention of the hanging ghost having grotesque features\u2014as did at least one of the two executed Aborigines. Moreover, the description of the ghost does not give any indication that it was Aboriginal, and only a single ghost is mentioned. I suspect that the ghost tale\u2014or someone's apparitional experience that inspired it\u2014was prompted by knowl-edge of the fact of a hanging at the tower, while, at the same time, that knowledge was factually limited. Thus, like many other apparitional experiences that have the ghost supposedly returning \"to reenact its death\" (Guiley 2000, 150), the Tower Mill tale is based on a false re-creation and is therefore itself obvi-ously false: apparently the work of some percipient's faulty imagination or the cre-ation of a writer of fakelore. Light in the Tower The other element of the alleged Tower Mill apparition, we recall, is the accompanying glow\u2014seen allegedly by unspecified eyewitnesses who had \"looked up at the small window facing the street.\" A light-in-the-window motif is common in ghostlore. The usual explanation for such lights is a simple illusion. While the glow or apparent light source (such as a supposed ghost lantern) does indeed appear to be located inside the structure, the source is typically not an interior one at all. Rather, as explained (with examples) in my The Science of Ghosts, it is a celestial or terrestrial light being reflected by the window glass (Nickell 2012, 113-114). This illusion has fooled many. I conducted experiments at Tower Mill on two successive nights. Various effects are possible, such as the glow ap-parently emanating from the window in question shown in Figure 2, but are actu-ally a reflection of a nearby light. These experiments, along with his- torical research on the execution of two convicted murderers at the site, indicate that the reported ghostly phenomena at Tower Mill are part of this\u2014and not some supernatural\u2014world. I Acknowledgments I am exceedingly grateful to John and Mary Frantz for their financial assistance, which helps make many of my investigations possible.

In a typi-cal episode, FBI Special Agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder trace down tantalizing evidence of extraterrestrial or other bizarre happenings but never quite secure proof. (As if the FBI would be on the outside of a conspiracy involving UFOs and such, trying to find out what is happening, instead of quietly pulling strings from the inside.) The new episodes follow closely the tried-and-true conspiracy themes of the original series; people obviously have not yet had their fill of UFO and conspiracy tales. So strong is the interest in the new series that on January 21 the CIA actu-ally announced a special package of re-leased documents pertaining to UFOs. The CIA Blog says: Take a Peek Into Our \"X-Files\" The CIA declassified hundreds of documents in 1978 detailing the Agency's investigations into Unidentified Fly ing Objects (UFOs). The documents date primarily from the late 1940s and 1950s. To help navigate the vast amount of data contained in our FOIA UFO collection, we've decided to high-light a few documents both skeptics and believers will find interesting. Below you will find five documents we think X-Files character Agent Fox Mulder would love to use to try and persuade others of the existence of extraterrestrial activity. We also pulled five documents we think his skeptical partner, Agent Dana Scully, could use to prove there is a scien-tific explanation for UFO sightings. (https://www.cia.gov/news-infor-mation/blog/2016/take-a-peek-in-to-our-x-files.html) While it was clearly stated that these files were first released back in 1978, that fact escaped many reporters who wrote that the CIA has \"just re-leased\" them. However, the fact of the announcement is being interpreted by some as highly significant. UFO author Grant Cameron wrote on the Facebook group UFO Updates: Obama seems to have asked for them to be highlighted in a positive light because of X-files, the same as he allowed Chase Brandon to come out with a book reviewed 8 times by the CIA security people to tell us Roswell was real and their [sic] were bodies which happened on the 65th anniversary of the Roswell crash. Podesta may have requested the favor. On the other hand, many skeptics feel that this kind of pandering to conspir-acy theorists is not appropriate for a government agency, especially for one with the gravitas of the CIA. \"Podesta\" is of course John Podesta, who was Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton and a counselor to President Obama. He is currently the chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 Presidential campaign. He is well known as a UFO proponent, and on February 13, 2015, Podesta tweeted, \"Finally, my biggest failure of 2014: Once again not secur-ing the #disclosure of the UFO files.\" At a campaign stop in Conway, New Hampshire, on December 29, 2015, Hillary Clinton was asked about UFOs by Daymond Steer, a reporter for the Conway Sun. She replied, \"I think we may have been (visited already). We don't know for sure.\" Clinton also said she would like to look into Area 51, a secret military base in Nevada that has long been rumored to contain aliens. At first, she called it Area 54 and then cor-rected herself. Hillary Clinton added that the chairman of her campaign, John Podesta, is a huge fan of UFO lore. She said he enjoys a sci-fi show on the FX network. \"He has made me personally pledge we are going to get the information out,\" said Clinton. \"One way or another. Maybe we could have, like, a task force to go to Area 51.\" However, her husband, the former president, was asked about Area 51 when he appeared on the late-night People obviously have not yet had their fill of UFO and conspiracy tales.

He said, \"There are no aliens there.\" Grant Cameron admits to prodding Steer to ask the UFO question of as many presidential candidates as possible. A few weeks later Steer had a chance to ask the question of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. Cameron wrote that Steer told him, \"Bernie had no inter-est in the UFO question and gave me a flippant response.\" On the Republican side, John Kasich told Steer that he did not believe in UFOs, while Ted Cruz answered that, if elected, he might check into Area 51. Cameron noted that can-didate Mike Huckabee already went on the record on the UFO question in the 2008 campaign: \"I believe in G.O.D. not U.F.O.\" (http://goo.gl/51hmjo) A closing note about The X-Files: series creator Chris Carter was the lun- cheon speaker at CSICOP's Twentieth Anniversary World Skeptics Confer-ence in 1996 in Amherst, New York. It turned out to be an extremely pop-ular event. A few months before that, Episode 20 of Season 3 of The X-Files aired on April 12, 1996. It took place in \"Klass County.\" The two fake alien pilots were named \"Jacques Sheaffer\" and \"Robert Vallee.\" The M.P. who later arrested them was Sgt. Hynek. I think most of our readers can figure out where those names come from! * * * Watch out: 2016 is claimed to be another year in which the supposed destructive planet Nibiru encounters Earth, threatening to wipe out civili-zation. Also known as \"Planet X,\" it is said to come into the inner solar system every 3,600 years or so, wreaking havoc in its wake. The last time we were threatened by Nibiru was May 2003, according to a woman named Nancy Lieder who supposedly channels extra-terrestrial messages from the Zetas and has acquired a lot of followers. Some people posted photos of pretty much anything in the sky and claimed it was Nibiru. When Nibiru did not show up and the predicted \"pole shift\" and other Earth changes did not occur, Leider promised it would be coming soon. Conspiracy theorists are now warn-ing us that this nonexistent object is \"on a crash course with the earth.\" A piece by an anonymous author (whose gram-mar could use some improvement) on Beforeitsnews.com (February 3, 2016) warns that \"NIBIRU will hit EARTH at MARCH 2016\u2014Important NASA Employee confirms the NIBIRU ex - istence.\" If this prediction is correct, then you won't be reading this, because you'll be dead. Survivalist David Hines, also known as \"Doomsday Dave,\" reminds us \"sim-ply surviving the Planet X flyby is key.\" He notes: What can we do to take shelter once Planet X arrives and it rains meteors? The only thing that I can suggest is, if you have a cold cellar, that would be the strongest part of your home, so you might be advised to make a shelter out of that. Those of you who live in high-rises or condominiums, I am sorry to say, you are screwed. The only suggestion is, if you have an underground parking spot, then that would offer some protection, but if your building takes a direct hit, then you stand the risk of being trapped under all the rubble, so it is a gamble, but what else can you do? Obviously, with the debris raining down from the tail of Planet X, there will be many properties that will catch fire, so what I did is purchase a couple of fire extinguishers, not expecting to put out a large house fire, but it may be enough to get you out of whatever building you reside. If I survive this apocalypse, I still have to eat, so I decided to buy a bunch of mason jars so I can pickle eggs and beets, etc.; they will last a long time. (http://goo.gl/tdndqP) These days Nibiru is turning up in the strangest places. On December 17, 2015, astronomer and UFO skep- tic James McGaha was surprised to receive an email from another astron-omer asking him if he was familiar with an alleged image of Nibiru taken on an all-sky camera at Grasslands Observatory, the private observatory in southern Arizona that McGaha operates along with Dr. Tim Hunter. He was not. Many observatories, even some very small ones, operate all-sky cameras that post an image to the Internet every few minutes. (This is another reason most astronomers are so skeptical about UFO sightings: the big, detailed UFOs that people keep reporting have an amazing ability to avoid these cameras.) A YouTube video (since removed) was posted on the channel of \"The Freak's Lair,\" pur-porting to show Nibiru on the sun was rising\u2014craters and all! What was it? That big, round white spot was just a patch of frost from dew that had frozen on the dome that covers the lens. As the sun rose, \"Nibiru\" melted away, which was interpreted as it fading away into the daylight sky. How Nibiru could be visible only at Grasslands\u2014and not to everybody else in the region\u2014was not explained. But Exopolitics guru Alfred Lam- bre ment Webre takes a positive view of the supposed impending encounter. He suggested in 2013, \"What if an up-coming flyby of Planet X/Nibiru that newly released data is suggesting will start in 2016 is in fact a catalyst for pos-itive change, rather than a 'Destroyer'?\" (http://goo.gl/pgE0GF). I 16 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerTheresa Caputo: The Fake Long Island Medium Theresa Caputo, a self-proclaimed psychic whose Italian origins are quite evident (she was born Theresa Brigandi), has been a celebrity for quite some time now thanks to her reality TV show Long Island Medium. However, all of her apparently para-normal demonstrations are perfectly explainable and, interestingly, most of them would not have been possible only a few years ago. Caputo, in fact, seems to be the next evolutionary step of contemporary mediums after the likes of Rosemary Altea, John Edward, Sylvia Browne, and James Van Praagh: performers who, from the stage, point to members of the audience and claim to receive communications from the dead on their behalf. In the cases of Altea, Edward, Browne, or Van Praagh, the use of old cold reading techniques is quite clear. These are techniques that undoubtedly require a quick mind, ready to grasp any information coming from the sitter and convincingly sell it back to believers as if it came from the spirits. Caputo, however, has taken a step forward. Instead of taking risks with straight cold reading\u2014guessing and in-evitably making mistakes\u2014she prefers to come well prepared to her shows. To begin with, Caputo places in [ NOTES ON A STRANGE WORLD MASSIMO POLIDORO Massimo Polidoro is an investigator of the paranormal, lecturer, and cofounder and head of CICAP, the Italian skeptics group.

PQ.Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 17the front rows those who she already knows, for whom she already has per-formed in the past and about whom she has already learned everything there is to know. But her great idea (or perhaps that of her staff) was to take full ad-vantage of what modernity has to offer. In particular, it is thanks to the infor-mation found on Facebook and other social media that she can astound her public. Thanks to an expos\u00e9 by magician and skeptical investigator Mark Ed-ward (2012), who worked on a \"sting operation\" on Caputo for Inside Edition, her methods are now quite clear. \"In combination with selling seats through Ticketmaster and the use of credit cards, Facebook, Foursquare, Twitter and all the rest of the latest places peo-ple post private information, our own egocentric fascination with ourselves makes it easy for the techie-smart agent or producer to make seeming miracles happen,\" explains Edward. \"Like the old days when the gypsy only needed to tell her sitters what they wanted to hear about themselves, we are now in an era when anyone can tell you more about yourself than you might ever want to know.\" Edward relates several such episodes, revealing how absurd this can get: \"At one point Theresa asked a woman, '. . . Why am I picking up baby clothes?' To which the woman replied, 'Oh, that's weird. I just put up a bunch of pictures of baby clothes on my Facebook page!' Not weird at all, really.\" It is enough for her to have a few similar bits of information placed be-forehand on a seating chart of the show. Her staff can then cue her to the right spots, since all seats are num-bered and far apart. She really can't miss. Even the casual encounters that she seems to have on the street during her \"reality\" program are carefully cho-reographed. \"In classic mentalist style,\" continues Edward, \"everyone must sign a pre-show waiver or agreement to have their image used on television. It's only a standard form to those folks. Why would they suspect anything? They should. All the staff needs is a laptop, a name, an address and a willing victim.\" Converting the 'Skeptics' Karen Stollznow, a linguist, author, and skeptical investigator, wrote about Caputo's exaggerated displays of emo-tion: There is rarely a scene where she isn't in tears or claiming empathetic abil-ities, such as, \"I could feel your tears running down my cheek.\" In one episode she announces that the spirit of a deceased six-year-old boy has become \"attached\" to her. Convinced that the only way to free the spirit is to meet with his mother, she tracks down the woman whose details she happens to have in an appointment book. Caputo appears to be greatly distraught by the little boy's con-stant presence, but she is strangely unavailable for a session until the following week. She spent this week in apparent spiritual agony, yet still had time to have lunch with friends, all the while complaining about her invisible friend. (Stollznow 2012) Another of her specialties is con- fronting and converting \"skeptics.\" As Stollznow notes: During a live interview for Long Island radio station KJOY a line of eight \"skeptics\" are pitted against her. Visibly stressed at first she asks the group, \"Who lost a sister?\" A woman acknowledges this question, and the medium quickly finds her stride, achieving perceived \"hits\" with her staple \"validations\" about clothing and personal letters. Caputo had emotionally disarmed the woman who was taken in by what a real skeptic would readily recognize as a classic cold reading. Skillful editing seems to have ironed out any misses and genuine skeptics. It is no surprise, then, that in 2012 Theresa Caputo received a Pigasus Award for Performance from the James Randi Educational Foundation. Today mediums really have an easy life. One wonders what Margery Cran-don, D.D. Home, Eusapia Palladino, and all of the famous mediums of the past would have given for a chance to amaze their clients in such an easy way, instead of risking every night to be proven wrong by tipping tables with their legs or exuding ectoplasm gauze. It all seems very silly, in the end, but it is quite distressing to look at the ef- fect that banalities of this kind can have on the grieving. People get emotional; they start to cry and seem to be willing to give Caputo everything they have in order to speak again with their loved ones. Instead of helping the grieving accept their loss and go on with life, such \"performers\" keep them stuck in their sad situation, preventing their healing. The only consolation is that she won't last long, as this is the fate that awaits all self-styled psychics. \"Ca - puto,\" admonishes James Randi, \"is just one more of the myriad faux seers who have stepped into the TV spotlight for their turn, and though her exuberant shtick rather outdoes the others, she'll do her number along with Van Praagh, John Edward and 'Psychic Sally' until someone with a newer novelty elbows her offstage\" (Randi 2012).

From 1997 to 1999, he was public relations director for CSI. Don't Fear a Franken Public The Surprising Reasons Why We Should Label Genetically Modified Food In January 2016, Campbell Soup gen-erated headlines by announcing that it would voluntarily label its products containing genetically modified (GM) corn, soy, beets, and other crops. Like most food industry leaders, about three quarters of Campbell Soup products contain such ingredients. The company's announcement came in advance of a summer deadline set by Vermont requiring the labeling of GM foods sold in the state. Legislatures in more than twenty states have consid - ered similar requirements. Food industry groups have lobbied for congressional legislation preempting any state require-ments, encouraging voluntary disclosure. But Campbell Soup is notable for break-ing with this strategy, calling instead for mandatory labeling (Strom 2016). Contrary to the claims of \"Franken - food\" opponents, research shows that Americans have not turned against the promising technology. Most remain un-aware of the debate. If asked directly, Americans voice support for labeling, but these opinions are neither deeply held nor top of mind. In this context, Campbell Soup's strategy is a shrewd gamble that could lead to several counterintuitive yet wel-come outcomes. If Americans were to encounter GM labels on almost all pro- cessed foods, the ubiquity and apparent safety of such foods may actually bolster public trust and confidence, quelling controversy and opening the door to a next generation of GM food products that offer enormous benefits. Science vs. Movement Politics According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other expert orga-nizations, GM foods in comparison to other food products do not pose sub-stantial risks to human health. Thus, federal regulators, experts, and industry members argue that there is no sci-entific or legal justification for special labeling. Yet a few discredited studies provide just enough rhetorical fodder for activ-ists to falsely claim that the technology poses a health threat. In the face of such Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 19uncertainty, they argue that precaution should be the rule. Therefore, consum-ers have a \"right to know\" if they are consuming GM ingredients. For these activists, the debate over the scientific justification for labeling is a smokescreen that clouds deep-er-rooted grievances. In this sense, no amount of scientific evidence will soften their opposition. The origin of these grievances can be traced to the rise of America's local food movement. During the early 2000s, looking across survey findings, researchers concluded that most Americans were unaware of GM food products, lacked basic knowledge of the science or policy specifics involved, and had yet to form strong opinions about the issue (Shana-han et al. 2001). But among a smaller segment of consumers, the issue was emerging as a chief concern, correlated with a cluster of other food-related attitudes. Those few Americans who said they actively looked to buy GM-free food also said that they preferred their food to be organic, vegetarian, natural, locally produced, not processed, and without artificial colors or flavors (Bellows et al. 2010). These consumers were early adopt- ers of many of the beliefs and pref-erences that constitute today's local food movement. The origins of the movement date back to the 1980s and a series of food safety controversies. Since then influential activists, food writers, and documentary filmmakers have argued the connections between industrial food production, agricultural policy, and problems such as obesity, income inequality, food-borne illness, and the decline of community life (Pol-lan 2010). In doing so, they have con-tributed to a new food politics, help-ing a diversity of groups unify behind a movement pushing for food system reforms. From Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, many regions have rebuilt their economies and identities around locally owned, mostly organic farms, restaurants, and artisanal foods. These local efforts are complemented by the popularity of well-known national or-ganic brands such as Stonyfield Farms and Horizon. In 2014, U.S. consump- tion of organic fruits, vegetables, dairy, breads, meat, and other foods gener-ated an estimated $35 billion in sales, more than triple the amount from a decade ago (USDA n.d.). The growth in the organics industry and local food economies has created a formidable alliance of farmers, entre-preneurs, and activists who bring con-siderable money, influence, and voice to the debate over labeling. For this alliance, corporate controlled, \"unnat-urally\" produced GM food is perceived as a direct threat to their livelihood and preferred way of life. Labeling: Not a Big Deal? Simmering at the grassroots level for years, in 2012 the labeling of GM food exploded into prominence as a hotly debated political issue. In successive years, California, Washington, Oregon, and Colorado residents considered and eventually voted down proposals to label GM food products. In these bat-tles, the food industry is estimated to have spent more than $100 million to block labeling efforts, while activists and organic industry members spent tens of millions promoting the mea-sures. These battles across Western states generated considerable national media coverage. Yet despite the attention, carefully designed survey research sug-gests that broader public awareness remains remarkably low. For at least a decade, the great majority of processed foods sold in grocery stores have con-tained ingredients from GM crops. But when asked in a 2013 Rutgers Univer- sity survey about the matter, only 44 percent of Americans said they were aware of such foods, and only 26 per-cent believed that they had ever eaten any food with GM ingredients (Hall - man et al. 2013). A majority of Americans in 2013 said they know very little or noth-ing at all about GM foods, and 25 percent said they had never heard of them. Even among those who an-swered they were aware of the issue, a majority mistakenly believed that GM tomatoes, wheat, and chicken prod-ucts were being sold in supermarkets (Hallman et al. 2013). Specific to la-beling, if asked directly, 80 percent of the public said that it was either \"very important\" or \"somewhat important\" to know whether a product contains GM food. Yet these labeling preferences are weakly held. In the 2013 Rutgers sur-vey, when respondents were asked in an unprompted way \"What information Simmering at the grassroots level for years, in 2012 the labeling of GM food exploded into prominence as a hotly debated political issue.20 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirer[ THE SCIENCE OF COMMUNICATION MATTHEW NISBET would you like to see on food labels that is not already on there?\" only 7 percent said GM food labeling. Moreover, only one in four Americans knew that fed-eral regulations do not currently require such labels (Hallman et al. 2013). Given the public's ambivalence about labeling, economists have long questioned claims that labeling would deter the great majority of consumers from purchasing GM food products. For most Americans, cost and brand preference rather than labeling drives their food choices. To the extent that most organic foods today cost 50 to 100 percent more than their GM counter-parts, this price difference is likely to override any impact of labels. To test these assumptions, econ- omists Marco Costanigro and Jayson Lusk designed a series of experiments that asked a sample of American adults to choose among apples and Cheerios that were either labeled as genetically modified or were unlabeled. To sim-ulate the price differences for these products, those marked as genetically modified were priced at half the cost of their unlabeled counterparts. Across conditions, the economists did not ob-serve any significant impact of labeling on risk perceptions or concern. Subjects rated GM apples and Cheerios just as safe as their non-modified counterparts. The economists, however, did find that a GM label made consumers somewhat more willing to pay a premium for un- labeled apples and Cheerios. In other words, though GM labels are unlikely to raise undue alarm among consumers, such labels may indirectly help boost sales of organic food products (Costan-igro and Lusk 2014). Citing this research and other evi- dence that labels are not likely to scare the public, some experts have argued that if the food industry were to follow the lead of Campbell Soup and support a mandatory labeling law, the strategy would help to restore public trust in the food industry while defusing contro-versy. \"People are getting increasingly scared of [GM food] precisely because the industry is fighting a rearguard bat-tle not to tell people which foodstuffs contain them,\" argues author and writer Mark Lynas (2013). \"This has to be the worst PR strategy ever: can you think of a single analogy where an industry uses every media tool, every electoral and legal avenue possible to stop peo-ple knowing where their own products are used?\" As David Ropeik (2013), a risk communication consultant, argued in an open letter to the food industry: Even if you win the vote, you will lose the war . . . because the war isn't about labeling. It's about the public's lack of trust in you, and therefore their opposition to the technology that is so important to your suc-cess. Your company's opposition to labeling is hurting you far more than it's helping. It is time for a new approach. Defusing Controversy Certainly if the food industry were to support mandatory GM labeling, the precise impact on consumers remains unkown. But to continue to battle against labeling rules is also risky busi-ness, lending credibility to claims by activists that the industry has an undue, corrupting influence on the political process. In contrast, the labeling of GM food may have only a limited impact on consumer buying habits, while doing little to alarm the public about the safety of the technology. Putting an end to the labeling controversy is also likely To continue to battle against labeling rules is also risky business, lending credibility to claims by activists that the industry has an undue, corrupting influence on the political process. Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 21to benefit public debate over the next generation of genetically engineered foods, ensuring that scientists, univer-sities, and companies have the freedom to pursue breakthrough technologies. These innovations are aimed directly at helping the world meet a 70 percent increase in food demand by 2050. Some crops have been engineered to counter deficiencies in vitamin A and iron among populations in developing countries. Other GM crops are able to survive under conditions of drought, extreme heat, or unfavorable soil condi-tions (Wohlers 2013). After many years of evaluation, in 2015 a genetically engineered salmon became the first modified animal approved for human consumption by the U.S. government. The small company that pioneered the high-tech salmon says that they can be grown in half the time and using 25 percent less small wild fish as feed. The system recycles 95 percent of the water used and reduces harmful waste. The all-female sterile fish are raised in landlocked tanks, making escape into the wild unlikely. Currently produced in Panama, the plan is for the fish to be grown close to large U.S. urban areas, reducing the energy costs associated with transportation (Saletan 2015). Activists have moved quickly to oppose such \"Frankenfish,\" pressur- ing major grocery store chains and restaurants to refuse to sell the sus-tainability-friendly product. Apart from unsupported claims about envi - ronmental and health risks, their chief complaint is that the fish would not be labeled. As the case of engineered salmon suggests, as important high-tech crops and farming practices are brought to market in coming years, the chief strategy of GM food oppo-nents to appeal to the public's \"right to know\" can be removed from the table by pushing for a smart, mandatory la-beling policy.

A \"ghost photo\" taken by a British woman named Natasha Oliver circulated in the news media and social media in late July 2015. It de-picted about a dozen friends on a lawn and what appears to be a human head and torso in an un-finished building in the background. The form is too dark and fuzzy to be identified, but some have claimed it looks like a ghostly mother and baby. Oliver's photo was taken in 2010 but recently got widespread attention after she commented on a Facebook post about a ghost picture she thought was fake\u2014and offered her own. The story was featured on Good Morning America on July 30 under the headline \"'Ghost Woman and Her Baby': Photo Shows Mysterious Fig-ure in Window\" (at http://tinyurl.com/p5rv8r6). According to the story by Avianne Tan: Oliver said she and her friends \"freaked out\" after they saw the photo on her digital camera back in 2010, taken when they were hang-ing out on the lawn in front of the unfinished home still being built at the time. \"When we saw the ghostly figure, the boys climbed up the scaffolding to see what was up there thinking maybe someone was watching us,\" Oliver said. \"But there was nothing up there. There were no floorboards or anything there. The house wasn't finished being built yet at the time.\" While everyone loves a good ghost story, I immediately detected several reasons to be skeptical that a phan-tom photobombed their party picture. Though there was some speculation that the photo was faked\u2014partly be- cause a famous ghost photo from the same town claimed to be of a little girl killed in a fire was revealed to be a hoax\u2014a misunderstanding seems more likely in this case. I noticed that there were only two, nearly identical, photographs provided by Oliver, taken two minutes apart (at 21:20 and 21:22). If, as she claimed, the group immediately noticed that an odd figure seemed to be in the window Have you seen this latest ghost photo from England? There seems to be some sort of mysterious figure in a window, and it was even on Good Morning America. \u2014D. MarksU.K. Viral 'Ghost Photo' Explained A:Q: Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 23behind them and a few friends were dispatched to investigate, it seems odd that there aren't more photos of it from a closer point of view. Instead it seems that no one in the group even tried to get a better photo of it. A surprised ex-clamation of \"Look! Is that a ghost?\" during a review of a digital photograph taken moments before might be ex-pected to result in a dozen cell phone cameras being produced to get their own photographic \"proof\" of the para-normal, but that did not happen. In fact, the additional photographic evidence provided by Oliver casts doubt on her explanation; because the photos are time-stamped, and because she uploaded dozens of photographs from that June 18, 2010, event to Facebook, there is a photographic record of what the group did after the \"ghost photos\" were taken. The last image that shows the \"ghost\" was taken at 21:22, and is followed by twenty-six other photos depicting what the group did between that time and 21:52 that evening. There is not a single photograph that shows Oliver or any of her friends searching for a ghost\u2014or even reacting to the dis-covery that they may have been in the presence of an undead spirit. Instead the two dozen photos show the group laughing, acting goofy, and enjoying an alcohol-fueled footballer party. That part of the mystery was solved by a closer look at the photos, which reveals that four months had elapsed before anyone noticed the ghostly fig-ure. I discovered that the photo was first noted on October 4, 2010, by one of Oliver's friends commenting on her Facebook photo. Therefore her quoted claim that \"When we saw the ghostly figure, the boys climbed up the scaf-folding to see what was up there think-ing maybe someone was watching us\" could not be true, since no one in her group saw the figure at the time, which explains why her photos show no inves-tigation. Since there was no investiga-tion at the time\u2014and therefore no one trying to figure out what the strange form might be\u2014the claim that looking for the ghost yielded the creepy revela-tion that \"there was nothing up there\" also could not be accurate. There are two second-story win- dows visible in the ghostly photograph; in another photo later in the series, one of Oliver's friends can be seen on scaf-folding in front of one of the windows. Since the ghost wasn't discovered until months later, he was not (and could not have been) searching for the ghostly in- truder; instead he is posing and hold-ing a beer about half an hour after the \"ghost\" photo was taken. He may have looked in the window and saw nothing\u2014but a closer look re-veals he is at the wrong window. The ghost was photographed in the other window, on the right of the photo-graph. What may have happened is that he told Oliver (months later) that when he had been up there he hadn't seen anything odd and that there was nothing in that window, and he (or she) misunderstood which window he was referring to. There's no evidence that anyone even looked in the window where the \"ghost\" was photographed to see what was there. Perhaps Oliver was misquoted and meant to suggest that, four months after the photo was taken, they re-turned to search for a cause of the fig-ure. But by then the construction would have likely been completed, the scene changed dramatically, and the scaffold-ing removed. Either way, the story as it was presented on Good Morning Amer-ica and other news media could not be accurate. A more likely explanation is that Oliver simply misremembered the circumstances of that photo five years after it was taken, and that mistake spawned a ghost mystery. So what is the light gray, vaguely humanlike figure? It could have been a trick of light, a piece of plastic or tarp from the construction site behind the group, wooden planks propped up in the window, or any number of other things.

KENNETH W. KRAUSE Is it possible to overstate the potential of a new technology that efficiently and cheaply permits deliberate, specific, and multiple genomic modifications to almost anything biological? What if that technology was also capable of altering untold future generations of nearly any given species\u2014including the one responsible for creating it? And what if it could be used, for better or worse, to rapidly exterminate an entire species? Certain experts have no intention of veiling their enthusiasm\u2014or their unease. Consider, for example, biologist David Baltimore, who recently chaired an inter-national summit dedicated primarily to the technology's much-disputed ethical implications. \"The unthinkable has become conceivable,\" he warned his audience in early December. Powerful new gene-editing techniques, he added, have placed us \"on the cusp of a new era in human history.\" If so, it might seem somewhat anti- climactic to note that Science magazine dubbed this technology its \"Break-through of the Year\" for 2015, or that its primary developers are widely con-sidered shoo-ins for a Nobel Prize\u2014in addition, that is, to the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences already earned by two such research - ers. All of which might sound trifling compared to the billions up for grabs following imminent resolution of a now-vicious patent dispute. Although no gene-editing tool has ever inspired so much drama, the new technology's promise as a practical remedy for a host of dreadful diseases, including cancer, remains foremost in researchers' minds. Eager to move be-yond in vitro and animal model applica-tions to the clinical setting, geneticists across the globe are quickly developing improved molecular components and methods to increase the technology's accuracy. In case you haven't heard, a truly profound scientific insurrection is well underway. Adapting CRISPR-Cas9 \"Think about a film strip. You see a partic-ular segment of the film that you want to replace. And if you had a film splicer, you would go in and literally cut it out and piece it back together\u2014maybe with a new clip. Imagine being able to do that in the genetic code, the code of life.\"\u2014Biochemist Jennifer Doudna (CBS News 2015) Genetic manipulation is nothing new, of course. Classic gene therapy, for example, typically employs a vector, often a virus, to somewhat haphazardly deliver a healthy allele somewhere in the patient's genome, hopefully to per-form its desired function wherever it settles. Alternatively, RNA interference selects specific messenger RNA mol-ecules for destruction, thus changing the way one's DNA is transcribed. Interference occurs, however, only so long as the damaging agent remains within the cell. Contemporary editing techniques, on the other hand, allow biologists to actually alter DNA\u2014the \"code of life,\" as Doudna suggests\u2014and to do so with specific target sequences in mind. The three major techniques have much in common. Each involves an enzyme called a \"programmable nuclease,\" for Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 25example, which is guided to a particular nucleotide sequence to cleave it. Then, in each case, the cell's machin- ery quickly repairs the double-stranded break in one of two ways. Non-homol-ogous end joining for gene \"knock out\" results when reconstruction\u2014usually involving small, random nucleotide deletions or insertions\u2014is performed only by the cell. Here, the gene's func-tion is typically undermined. By con-trast, homology-directed repair for gene \"knock in\" occurs when the cell copies a researcher's DNA repair template de-livered along with the nuclease. In this case, the cleaved gene can be corrected, or a new gene or genes can be inserted (Corbyn 2015). But in other ways, the three editing techniques are very distinct. Devel - oped in the late 1990s and first used in human cells in 2005, zinc-finger nu-cleases (ZFN) attach cutting domains derived from the - terium okeanokoites to proteins called \"zinc fingers\" that can be customized to recognize certain three-base-pair DNA codes. Devised in 2010, transcrip-tion activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) fuse the same cutting do-mains to different proteins called TAL effectors. For both ZFN and TALENs, two cutting domains are necessary to cleave double-stranded DNA (Max-men 2015). The third and most revolutionary editing technique, and subject of this article, consists of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and a CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9). Introduced as an exceptionally precise editing tech-nique in 2012 by Doudna at the Uni-versity of California, Berkeley, and mi- crobiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier at the Max Planck Institute for Infec-tion Biology in Berlin, CRISPR-Cas9 is actually the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes' adaptive immune system that confers resistance to foreign elements, such as phages and plasmids. CRISPR thus refers to short bits of DNA seized from invading viruses and stored in the bacterium's own ge-nome for future reference, and Cas9 is the enzyme S. pyogenes uses to cleave a subsequent invader's double helix. In other words, in its native setting, CRISPR-Cas9 is the system a certain bacterium uses to recognize and dis-able common biological threats. Unlike ZFN and TALENs, CRISPR-Cas9 does not rely on the F. okeanoites cut-ting domain and, as such, can cleave both strands of an interloper's double helix simultaneously with a single Cas9 enzyme. But what makes the CRISPR system so special, in part, and so adaptable to the important task of gene-editing, is its relative simplicity. Only three com-ponents are required to achieve site-spe-cific DNA recognition and cleavage. Both a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) are needed to guide the Cas9 enzyme to its target sequence. What Doudna and Charpentier revealed four years ago, however, were the seminal facts that an even simpler, two-component sys - tem could be developed by combining the crRNA and tracrRNA into a syn-thetic single guide RNA (sgRNA), and that researchers could readily modify a sgRNA's code to redirect the Cas9 en-zyme to almost any preferred sequence (Jinek et al. 2012). Today, a biologist wanting to edit a specific sequence in an organism's genome can quickly and cheaply design an sgRNA to match that sequence, order it from a competitive manufacturer for $65 or less, and have it delivered in the mail (Petherick 2015). But what makes the CRISPR system so special, in part, and so adaptable to the important task of gene-editing, is its relative simplicity.26 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerNone of which is to suggest that a CRISPR system is always the best tool for the gene-editing job, at least not yet. Critically, CRISPR-Cas9 is relatively easy to program and remains the only technique allowing researchers to \"mul-tiplex,\" or edit several genomic sites si-multaneously. But TALENs have the longest DNA recognition domains and, thus, tend so far to result in the fewest \"off-target effects,\" which occur when nucleotide sequences identical or sim-ilar to the target are cut unintention-ally. And ZFNs are much smaller than either TALENs or CRISPR-Cas9, especially the most popular version de-rived from S. pyogenes, and are therefore more likely to fit into the tight confines of an adeno-associated virus (AAV)\u2014currently the most promising vector for the delivery of gene-editing therapies. Even so, CRISPR research con- tinues to progress at breakneck speed. In 2014, the number of gene-editing kits ordered from Addgene, a supplier based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for research using ZFN and TALENs totaled less than 1,000 and less than 2,000, respectively. During that same year\u2014only two years after the new technology was introduced\u2014the num-ber of kits ordered for CRISPR re-search totaled almost 20,000 (Corbyn 2015). More important, rapidly in-creasing orders seem to have translated into significant results. As 2015 ended and a new year began, new studies an-nouncing the creation of smaller guide RNAs and, especially, the reduction of off-target effects began to dominate science headlines. Breaking Barriers \"This is now the most powerful system we have in biology. Any biological pro-cess we care about now, we can get the comprehensive set of genes that underlie that process. That was just not possible before.\" \u2014Biochemist David Sabatini (Yong 2015) CRISPR-Cas9, of course, is only one among many prokaryotic CRISPR sys-tems that could, at some point, prove useful for any number of human pur-poses. Use of Cas9 variations, however, has already resulted in successes far too numerous to review liberally here. Even so, two recent applications in particular reveal the extraordinary, yet strikingly simple, means by which researchers have achieved previously unattainable outcomes. In the first application, three dif- ferent teams confronted Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a terri-fying disease that affects about one in every 3,500 boys in the United States alone (Long et al. 2015; Nelson et al. 2015; Tabebordbar et al. 2015). DMD typically stems from defects in a gene containing seventy-nine protein-cod-ing exons. If even a single exon suffers a debilitating mutation, the gene can be rendered incapable of producing dystrophin, a vital protein that protects muscle fibers. Absent sufficient dystro-phin, both skeletal and heart muscle will deteriorate. Patients usually end up confined to wheelchairs and dead be-fore the age of thirty. Traditional gene therapy, stem cell treatments, and drugs have proven mostly ineffective against DMD. Sci-entists have corrected diseased cells in vitro , or in a single organ\u2014the liver. But treating muscle cells throughout the body, including the heart, is a far more daunting task, because they can't all be removed, treated in isolation, and then replaced. And given current ethical concerns, most researchers are prohibited from even considering the possibility of editing human embryos for clinical purposes. As such, researchers here decided to employ CRISPR-Cas9 technology to excise faulty dystrophin gene exons in both adult and neonatal mice by deliv-ering it directly into their muscles and bloodstreams using non-pathogenic adeno-associated viruses. AAVs, how-ever, are too small to accommodate the relatively large S. pyogenes Cas9, so each team opted instead to deploy a more petite Cas9 enzyme found in Staphylo-coccus aureus. Neither group's interventions re- sulted in complete cures. But dystro-phin production and muscle strength were restored, and little evidence of off-target effects was observed, in treated mice. One lead researcher later suggested that although clinical trials could be years away, up to 80 percent of human DMD victims could benefit from defective exon removal (Kaiser 2015). Remarkably, each of the three teams obtained results comparable to those of the others. Perhaps most impressively, however, these experiments marked the very first instances of using CRISPR to successfully treat genetic disorders in fully developed living mammals. But an ever-growing population needs to protect its agricultural prod-ucts too. Plant DNA viruses, for exam- These experiments marked the very first instances of using CRISPR to successfully treat genetic disorders in fully developed living mammals.Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 27ple, can cause devastating crop damage and economic crises worldwide, but especially in underdeveloped regions including sub-Saharan Africa. More specifically, the tomato yellow leaf curl virus (tomato virus) is known to rav-age a variety of tomato breeds, causing stunted growth, abnormal leaf develop ment, and fruit death. Like DMD, the tomato virus has proven an especially intractable prob - lem. Despite previous efforts to control it through breeding, insecticides target-ing the vector, and other engineering techniques, we currently know of no effective means of managing the virus. Undeterred, another group of biologists decided to give CRISPR-Cas9-medi-ated viral interference a try (Ali et al. 2015). In this study, the investigators chose to manipulate a species of tobacco plant, well-understood as a model or-ganism, that is similarly vulnerable to tomato virus infection. The experiment was completed in two fairly predict-able stages. First, the group designed sgRNAs to target certain tomato virus coding and non-coding sequences and inserted them into different, harm-less viruses of the tobacco rattle vari-ety. Second, they delivered the newly loaded rattle viruses into their tobacco plants. After seven days, the plants were exposed to the tomato virus and, after ten more days, they were analyzed for symptoms of infection. The group agreed that the CRIS- PR-Cas9 system had reliably cleaved and introduced mutations to the to-mato viruses' genomes. Fortuitously, every plant expressing the system had either abolished or significantly atten-uated all symptoms of infection. The investigators concluded further that the technique was capable of simultane-ously targeting multiple DNA viruses with a lone sgRNA, and that other transformable plant species, including tomatoes, of course, would be similarly affected. One can only guess, at this point, how certain interests might receive these and other types of genome-ed-ited crops. Will nations eventually clas- sify them as GMOs or, alternatively, as organisms capable of developing in na-ture? Will applicable regulations focus on the processes or products of mod-ification? Regardless, one can hardly ignore these commodities' potential windfalls, especially for those in dire need. Given recent innovations in speci- ficity, for example, CRISPR-based dis-ease research will likely continue to ad-vance quickly toward clinical and other more practical applications. So long as it affects only non-reproductive somatic cells, such interventions should remain largely uncontroversial. Human gam-etes and embryos, on the other hand, have once again inspired abundant de-bate and bitter division among experts. Moralizing Over Science \"Genome editing in human embryos using current technologies could have unpredictable effects on future genera-tions. This makes it dangerous and ethi-cally unacceptable.\" \u2014Edward Lanphier et al. (2015) \"To intentionally refrain from engaging in life-saving research is to be morally respon - sible for the foreseeable, avoidable deaths of those who could have benefitted.\" \u2014Bioethicist Julian Savulescu et al. (2015) The results of the first (and, so far, only) attempt to edit human embryos using CRISPR-Cas9 was published by a team of Chinese scientists on April 18 of last year (Liang et al. 2015). Led by Junjiu Huang, the group chose to experiment on donated tripronuclear zygotes\u2014nonviable early embryos con-taining one egg and two sperm nuclei\u2014neither intended nor suitable for clinical use. Their goal was to successfully edit endogenous -globin genes that, when mutated, can cause a fatal blood disorder known as -thalassemia. By his own admission, Huang's outcomes were less than spectacu-lar. Eighty-six embryos were injected with the Cas9 system and a molecular template designed to affect the inser- tion of new DNA. Of the seventy-one that survived, fifty-four embryos were tested. A mere twenty-eight were suc-cessfully spliced and, of those, only four exhibited the desired additions. Rates of off-target mutations were much higher than expected too, and the group would likely have discovered additional unin-tended cuts had they examined more than the protein-coding exome, which represents less than 2 percent of the en-tire human genome. In all fairness, however, the em- bryos' abnormality might have been re-sponsible for much of the total off-tar-get effect. And, of course, Huang was unable to take advantage of many specificity-enhancing upgrades to the CRISPR system yet to be designed at the time of his investigations. In any case, his team acknowledged that their results \"highlight the pressing need to further improve the fidelity and speci-ficity\" of the new technology, which in their opinions remained immature and unready for clinical applications. Nevertheless, the Chinese experi- ment ignited a brawl among both sci-entists and bioethicists over the pros-pect of human germline modification with the most powerful and accessible gene-editing machinery ever conceived. Similar quarrels had accompanied the proliferation of technologies involv-ing recombinant DNA, in vitro fertil- SPECIAL REPORT] Edward Lanphier28 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirerization, gene therapy, and stem cells, for example. But never had the need to address our capacity to reroute the evolution of societies\u2014indeed, of the entire species\u2014seemed so real and im-mediate. Leading experts, including Balti- more and Doudna, had previously met in Napa, California, on January 24, 2015, to discuss the bioethical implica-tions of rapidly emerging technologies. In the end, they \"strongly discouraged . . . any attempts at germline genome modification for clinical application in humans,\" urged informed discussion and transparent research, and called for a prompt global summit to recommend international policies (Baltimore et al. 2015). A surge of impassioned litera-ture ensued. A small group led by Sangamo Bio- Sciences president Edward Lanphier was one of the first to weigh in (Lan-phier et al. 2015). Calling for a \"volun- tary moratorium\" on all human germ-line research, Lanphier first expressed concerns over potential off-target ef-fects and the genetic mosaicism that could result, for instance, if a fertilized egg began dividing before all intended corrections had occurred. He also found it difficult to \"imagine a situation in which use of human embryos would offer therapeutic benefits over existing and developing methods,\" suggesting as well that pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and in vitro fertiliza-tion (IVF) were far better options than CRISPR for parents carrying the same mutation for a genetic disease. In any case, he said, with so many unanswered questions, clinicians remained unable to obtain truly risk-informed consent from either parents looking to modify their germlines or from affected fu - ture generations. Finally, Lanphier implied that even the best intentions could eventually lead societies down a \"slippery slope\" toward nontherapeu-tic genetic enhancement and so-called \"designer babies.\" Francis Collins, evangelical Chris- tian and director of the National Insti-tutes of Health (which currently refuses to fund human germline research), expressed similar views regarding the sufficiency of PGD and IVF, the im-possibility of informed consent, and nontherapeutic enhancement (Skerrett 2015). In addition, Collins worries that access to the technology would be de-nied to the economically disadvantaged and that parents might begin to con-ceive of their children \"more like com-modities than precious gifts.\" For the director, given the \"paucity of compel-ling cases\" in favor of such research, and the significance of the ethical counter-arguments, \"the balance of the debate leans overwhelmingly against human germline engineering.\" On the other hand, Harvard Med - ical School geneticist George Church urges us to ignore pleas for artificially imposed bans, \"encourage the inno-vators,\" and focus more on what he deems the obvious benefits of germline research (Church 2015). Responding to Lanphier and Collins, he argues as well that, without obtaining consent, parents have long exposed future gen-erations to mutagenic forces\u2014through chemotherapy, residence in high-alti-tudes, and alcohol intake, for example. We have also consistently chosen to enhance our offspring and future gen-erations through mate choice, among many other things. Church also points out that PGD during the IVF proce-dure is incapable of offering solutions to individuals possessing two copies of a detrimental, dominant allele, or to prospective parents who both carry two copies of a harmful, recessive al-lele. Moreover, in most instances, PGD cannot be used to avoid more complex polygenic diseases, including schizo-phrenia. Nor can we presume that new technology costs will al ways create treatment or enhancement inequities. In fact, according to Church, the price of DNA sequencing, for example, has already plummeted more than three million fold. Finally, germline editing is probably not irreversible, Church con-tends, and certainly not as error-prone at this point as many have suggested. \"Senseless\" bans, he concludes, would only \"put a damper on the best medical research and instead drive the practice underground to black markets and un-controlled medical tourism.\" Taking a slightly different tack, Har- vard cognitive scientist Steven Pinker censures bioethicists generally for get-ting bogged down in \"red-tape, mor-atoria, or threats of prosecution based on nebulous but sweeping principles such as 'dignity,' 'sacredness,' or (Pinker 2015a). of the way\" of CRISPR, Pinker reminds them that, once decried as morally unaccept-able, vaccinations, transfusions, arti-ficial insemination, organ transplants, and IVF have all proven \"unexceptional boons to human well-being.\" Further, the specific harms of which morato-rium proponents warn, including can - cer, mutations, and birth defects, \"are already ruled out by a plethora of ex- Once decried as morally unacceptable, vacci-nations, transfusions, artificial insemination, organ transplants, and IVF have all proven \"unexceptional boons to human well-being.\" Harvard Medical School geneticist George Churchisting regulations and norms\" (Pinker 2015b). In the end, he advises, both scientists and everyday people need and deserve a well-diversified research portfolio. \"If you ban something, the probability that people will benefit is zero. If you don't ban it, the probability is greater than zero.\" Such were among the arguments considered by a committee of twelve biologists, physicians, and ethicists during the December 2015 Interna-tional Summit on Human Genome Editing, organized by the U.S. Na-tional Academies of Sciences and Med - icine, the Royal Society in London, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Summit was chaired by David Balti-more. Doudna and Charpentier, win-ners of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, attended with synthetic biologist Feng Zhang\u2014a now much-celebrated trio considered front runners for a Nobel Prize, though also entangled through their institutions in a CRISPR patent dispute potentially worth billions of dollars. After three days of discussion, the Summit's organizing committee issued a general statement rejecting calls for a comprehensive moratorium on germline research (National Academies of Science 2015). The members did, however, ad-vise without exception against the use of edited embryos to establish pregnancy. \"It would be irresponsible to proceed,\" they added, \"with any clinical use of germline editing\" until safety and effi-cacy issues are resolved and there exists \"a broad societal consensus about the appropriateness of the proposed appli-cation.\" In conclusion, the committee called for an \"ongoing forum\" to har - monize the current global patchwork of relevant regulations and guidelines and to \"discourage unacceptable activi-ties.\" This forum, the members judged, should consist not only of experts and policymakers but of \"faith leaders,\" \"public interest advocates,\" and \"mem-bers of the general public\" as well. Wasting little time, the UK's Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority approved on February 1, 2016, the first attempt to edit healthy human embryos with the CRIS- PR-Cas9 system. The application was filed last September by developmental biologist Kathy Niakan of the Fran-cis Crick Institute in London. Niakan intends to use CRISPR to knock out one of four different genes in a total of 120-day-old, IVF-donated embryos to investigate the roles such genes play in early development. Her research could help identify genes crucial to early human growth and cell differentiation and, thus, lead to more productive IVF cultures and more informed selection practices. It could also reveal mutations that lead to miscarriages and, one day, allow parents to correct these problems through gene therapy. Following careful observation, Niakan intends to destroy her embryos by the time they reach the blastocyst stage on the seventh day. Under British law, experimental embryos cannot be used to establish pregnancy. But the human germline is not the only, or even most pressing, subject of CRISPR controversy. Some, for ex- ample, warn of the creation of danger-ous pathogens and biological warfare (Greely 2016). But many others, in-cluding Doudna, urge that we quickly address \"other potentially harmful ap-plications . . . in non-human systems, such as the alteration of insect DNA to 'drive' certain genes into a population\" (Doudna 2015). Driving DNA \"Clearly, the technology described here is not to be used lightly. Given the suffering caused by some species, neither is it obvi-ously one to be ignored.\" \u2014Evolutionary geneticist Austin Burt (2003) In broad terms, a \"gene drive\" can be characterized as a targeted contagion intended to spread through a population with exceptional haste. Burt pioneered the technology through his study of transposable elements\u2014\"selfish\" and often parasitic DNA sequences that exist merely to propagate themselves. Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 29SPECIAL REPORT]30 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerIf you care about your safety and the safety of your loved ones, get rid of your guns. Importantly, transposons can circum- vent the normal Mendelian rules of inheritance dictating that any given gene has a 50 percent chance of being passed from parent to offspring. Thirteen years ago, Burt envisioned the use of a microbial transposon-like element called a \"homing endonu-clease\" for humanity's benefit. When inserted into one chromosome, the endonuclease would cut the matching chromosome inherited from the other parent. The cell would then quickly repair the cut, often using the first chromosome as a template. As such, the assailed sequence in the second chromosome would be converted to the sequence of the selfish element. In a newly fertilized egg, the endonuclease would likewise convert the other par-ent's DNA and, eventually, drive itself into the genomes of nearly 100 percent of the population. Burt believes we can use gene drives to weaken or even eradicate mosqui-to-transmitted diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. If scientists engi-neered just 1 percent of a mosquito population to carry such a drive, he cal-culates, about 99 percent would possess it in only twenty generations. In fact, Burt announced five years ago that he had created a homing endonuclease capable of locating and cutting a mos-quito gene (Windbichler et al. 2011). However, his elements were difficult to program for precise application. Enter CRISPR-Cas9. As we've seen, Cas9 is an eager endonuclease, and guide RNAs are easy to program and can be quickly synthesized. In April of last year, biologists Valentonio Gantz and Ethan Bier revealed that they had used CRISPR-Cas9 to drive color vari-ation into Drosophila fruit flies (Gantz and Bier 2015). Though they labeled it a \"mutagenic chain reaction\" at the time, it was the first gene drive ever deployed in a multicellular organism. Today, researchers sort potential gene drives into two major groups. Re- placement drives seek only to displace natural with modified populations. Suppression drives, by contrast, attempt to reduce or even eradicate populations. At this point, no drives have been re-leased into the wild. Nevertheless, re-searchers have lately designed one of each type to affect mosquitos carrying the deadly human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The first study was led by microbiol - ogist Anthony James, who collaborated on the project with Gantz and Bier (Gantz et al. 2015). Focusing on the prevention of disease transmission, this group engineered Anopheles stephensi mosquitos, highly active in urban India, to carry two transgenes producing an-tibodies against the malaria parasite, a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene drive and a marker gene. Because the very lengthy payload rendered insertion a challenging process, James was able to isolate only two drive-bearing males among 25,000 larvae. But when mated with wild-type females, these and sub-sequent transgenic males spread their anti-malaria genes at an impressive rate of 99.5 percent. Transgenic females, on the other hand, processed the drive quite differently and passed it on at near-normal Mendelian ratios. Despite its overall success, James doesn't imagine that his team's replace-ment drive could eliminate the malaria parasite independently. Instead, he en-visions its use to reduce the risk of in-fection and to complement other strat-egies already being employed. Even so, because such drives would not ex-terminate P. falciparum or its mosquito vector, they would potentially allow the parasite to one day evolve resistance to their transgene components. The second study's goal was quite different. Here, molecular biologist Tony Nolan, along with Burt and oth-ers, first identified three genes in the Anopheles gambiae mosquito, active in sub-Saharan Africa, that when mutated Evolutionary geneticist Burt Austin believes we can use gene drives to weaken or even eradicate mosquito- transmitted diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 31cause recessive infertility in females (Hammond et al. 2016). Second, they designed a CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive to target and edit each gene. Follow-ing insertion, they bred their transgenic mosquitos with wild-types and found that nearly all female offspring were born infertile. In a subsequent experi-ment, Nolan released 600 vectors\u2014half transgenic, half wild-type\u2014into a cage. After only four generations, 75 percent of the population carried the mutations, exactly what one would expect from an effective gene drive. A suppression drive like Hammond's could, in theory, eliminate a parasite's primary vector. In such a scenario, the parasite might find another means of conveying the disease to humans; more than 800 species of mosquito inhabit Africa alone, for example. But it might not. The loss would also substantially alter the relevant ecosystem. But despite other methods of controlling the disease, malaria still claims more than a half mil-lion lives every year, mostly among chil-dren under five. Even in theory, no gene drive is a panacea. They function only in sexually reproducing species, and best in species that reproduce very rapidly. Nor would their effects be permanent\u2014most trans-genes would prove especially vulnerable to evolutionary deselection, for example. But neither would they turn out as prob-lematic as some might imagine. They can be easily detected through genome sequencing, for instance, and are un - likely to spread accidentally into domes-ticated species. And if scientists sought for whatever reason to reverse the effects of a previously released drive, they could probably do so with the release of a sub-sequent drive. As Church and others have recently suggested, it \"doesn't really make sense to ask whether we should use gene drives. Rather, we'll need to ask whether it's a good idea to consider driving this particular change through this particular population\" (Esvelt et al. 2014). I References Ali, Z., A.

SPECIAL REPORT] In the early twentieth century, Charles Fort (1874- 1932) began the work that led one biographer to call him the \"Prophet of the Unexplained\" (Knight 1970). Having come into an inheritance that permitted him to engage in armchair endeavors, Fort spent his last twenty-six years scouring old periodicals for reports of alleged occurrences that science was supposedly unable to explain: UFOs (be-fore there was such a term), archaeological oddities, mystery creatures, ghosts, rains of fish, and other anomalies\u2014what would come to be called \"fortean phe-nomena.\" Fort was not himself an investigator, and his anecdotal evidence left much to be desired (Nickell 2004, 335-337). Nevertheless, Fort was a major innovator. In an excellent biography of him, Jim Steinmeyer (2008, xv) states, \"What Fort invented was our modern view of the paranormal.\" Others had pointed out strange occurrences and asked why they happened, but Charles Fort championed their significance and accused science of being too conventional to care. Many of today's paranormal claims can be traced to Fort's writings. 32 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerMuch of what is called \"the paranormal\" today has intrigued mankind since the most ancient times. The term refers to those things that are supposedly beyond the normal range of science and human experience\u2014ghosts, strange lights in the sky, psychic phenomena, and the like. It includes the super-natural but also things such as monsters that\u2014if they exist\u2014might be quite natural. With the advent of modern spiritualism in 1848, launched by the Fox Sisters' hoaxed messages from the ghost of a murdered peddler (Nickell 2004, 31-32), the paranormal began to proliferate and to attract advocacy groups such as the British Society for Psychical Research. Founded in London in 1882, it was concerned with alleged psychic phenomena and the supposed survival of consciousness following bodily death (Guiley 2000, 304). The paranormal grew increasingly throughout the twentieth century with various \"new\" (either substantially new or newly refocused-on) topics being expanded by individual gurus and groups of enthusiasts, and many cross-correspondences developing (say, between UFOs and Bigfoot). This article is a discussion of the \"creation\" of the paranormal by a series of major figures, each of whom took a concept\u2014some fantasy, myth, or specula-tion\u2014and transformed it into \"reality\" (Keel 2001b). (I have, of course, excluded a long list of topics\u2014from astrol-ogy to zombies\u2014whose origins are ancient.) A handful of twentieth-century figures \"created\" the modern concept of the paranormal and its leading topics, transporting fantasy, myth, or speculation into a kind of believable \"reality.\" Most proved to be a chimera. JOE NICKELL CHARLES FORT: PROPHET OF THE UNEXPLAINED Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 33 Supposed communication with spirits of the dead is at least as old as the Biblical \"Witch of Endor\" who, at the behest of King Saul, al-legedly conjured up the ghost of Samuel (I Sam-uel 28). From the first century CE came a proto- typical chain-rattling ghost at a house in Athens investigated by one Athenodorus who allegedly observed the specter and laid it to rest (Nickell 2012a, 17-18). This is an early example of what folklorists call a \"legend trip\": a visit to a site to test a legend there (Brunvand 1996, 437-440). As spiritualism developed in the mid-nine-teenth century, photography was soon adopted to make \"spirit photos\"\u2014first faked by William Mumler in Boston in 1862 (Nickell 2012a, 298-300). The instigator of today's ghost-hunting craze was England's Harry Price (1881-1948), who was among the first to use \"modern technology\" to detect spirits of the dead and for that purpose famously had a \"ghost-hunting\" kit (see Price 1936, photo facing p. 32). He employed such devices as a camera with infrared filter and film (for photographing in the dark), \"an electronic signaling instrument\" (for detecting an object's movement from anywhere in a house), and \"a sensitive transmitting thermograph\" (to measure temperature variations). Along with a notebook, flashlight, and other utility items, he included a flask of brandy in case anyone fainted (Price 1940, 107). Having married an heiress, Price could indulge his interests in psychical re- search beginning in the 1920s. Although he was a member of the Society for Psychical Research, the organization's skepticism of much physical phenomena led him to found his own lab. He combined the use of gadgetry with mediums and s\u00e9ances but was never able to prove the reality of ghosts. Worse, he re-mains suspected of trickery in some of his own investigations, including that of the Borley Rectory, the subject of his The Most Haunted House in England (1940). Although he posed as a scientist, Price was a school dropout whose use of sci-entific methods was an act, and he sought only to prove his ideas\u2014not rigorously test them (Morris 2006, xv; Guiley 2000, 299; Nickell 2012a, by huckster Hans Holzer (1920-2009), who cranked out books about his visits to supposedly haunted houses with psychics in tow\u2014in one instance earning him a scathing assessment from the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research . More recently, television's Ghost Hunters and their countless imitators have taken mystery mongering to new lows. Besides the dubious legends and pseudoscience, it appears they are often merely de-tecting themselves (Nickell 2012a, 263-264, 275-280). Whether or not the label is \"exagger- ated,\" as UFO historian Jerome Clark (1998, 2: 695) finds, many knowledge-able persons regard Ray Palmer as \"the man who invented flying saucers\" (Keel 2001a, 536). Certainly, the idea of air-ships was a much earlier one stemming from science-fiction writers, such as Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. Expectations aroused by science fiction no doubt helped spark the \"Airship Wave\"\u2014the aerial-phenomena hysteria that plagued the United States between November 1896 and May 1897, preceding the modern wave of reports that began half a century later. After World War I, Charles Fort, the previously mentioned \"Prophet of the Unexplained,\" included unidentified objects in the sky among his discussions of mysterious phenomena, earning him the further appellation \"the world's first UFOlogist\" (Clark 1992, 21-23), by suggesting the objects indicated visits from space aliens. Enter Raymond A. Palmer (1910-1977). Although a childhood accident left him a hunchback of short stature, Palmer's runaway imagination and audac- Along with a notebook, flashlight, and other utility items, Harry Priceincluded a flask of brandy in case anyone fainted. HARRY PRICE: THE ORIGINAL GHOST HUNTER RAYMOND A. PALMER: THE MAN WHO 'INVENTED' UFOS 34 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirerity\u2014including his unrelenting self-promotion\u2014made him \"something of a giant,\" says Clark (1998, 2: 695). Obsessed with science fiction, Palmer created in 1933 the Jules Verne Prize Club. In 1938, he became editor of the first science-fiction magazine, Amazing Stories (founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1926), its wild action tales prompting critics to label it \"space opera.\" He was cofounder of Fate in 1948 and publisher of other magazines, including Other Worlds, which evolved into Fly- ing Saucers, during the 1950s. He also published other writers' books on flying saucers, so-called \"contactees\" (those supposedly chosen to receive the wisdom of the \"Space Brothers\"), and other topics (Clark 1998, 2: 694-696; see also the biography of Palmer [Nadis 2013]). Today largely forgotten, Palmer played a huge role in UFOlogy. He filled Amazing Stories with tales and articles hyping the \"Shaver Mystery.\" Based on one Richard S. Shaver, this featured a race of freakish creatures called \"Deros\" who lived in the hollow Earth. Palmer bought reams of material from Shaver, rewrote it, and added stories he penned himself under various pseudonyms. Responses poured in from readers who told of seeing strange objects in the sky and encountering alien beings (Keel 2001b). On the back cover of Amazing Stories' August 1946 issue were depicted flying discs that, less than a year later, would launch the era of \"flying saucers\" (Clark 1998, 2: 695; Nickell 2014). On June 24, 1947, private pilot Ken-neth Arnold saw nine objects in a five-mile-long formation moving like \"a saucer skipped across water\"\u2014probably a phenomenon called \"mountain-top mirages\" (McGaha and Nickell 2014). In any case, Ray Palmer latched onto the \"flying saucer\" witness. About a month after Arnold's sighting, Palmer hired him to investigate another saucer case in Washington State, though unfortunately the credulous Arnold was taken in by what is now known as the Maury Island Hoax (Sachs 1980, 191-192; Clark 1998, 2: 612-614). When the premier issue of Palmer's Fate magazine first appeared in the spring of 1948, its cover story was by Kenneth Arnold, and it gained national attention. In 1952, Arnold wrote, with Palmer, a book titled The Coming of the Sau-cers. By then UFOs\u2014that is, meteors, stars and planets, balloons, various aircraft, and other mundane phenomena, sometimes seen under unusual conditions such as temperature inversions\u2014were beginning to become \"real\" presumed extrater-restrial craft. While Jerome Clark (1998, 2: 695) insists, \"The UFO phenomenon is the creation not of one man but of tens of thousands of UFO sightings,\" this is rather like observing that the Wright Brothers did not create the aircraft industry. To the extent that one man \"invented\" UFOs\u2014that is, more than any other single person transformed them from fiction to seeming reality\u2014that man was Raymond A. Palmer. Once in 1965, my late friend James W. Moseley (himself a saucer sati-rist) asked Palmer what he thought about flying saucers. Palmer answered, \"What would you say if I told you the whole thing was a joke?\" (Sachs 1980, 238). The term extrasensory perception (ESP) re-fers to the alleged ability to acquire informa-tion by means other than through the known senses, and it would include telepathy (mind reading), clairvoyance (remote viewing), precognition (future knowledge), and retro- cognition (paranormal knowledge of past events). Together with psychokinesis (PK, mind over matter), it constitutes what parapsychologists refer to as \"psi\" to describe two seemingly closely related phenomena. In fact, however, \"psi\" has never been proven, and, despite extensive research over many decades, there is still a lack of both scientific evidence and theory for its existence (Alcock 1996). Although there were ancient seers and psychics, the modern interests in such phenomena paralleled rapid developments in science (such as the discoveries of X-rays and radio waves) and scientific reasoning (such as Darwin's theory of evolu-tion). Interest was also stimulated by the mid-nineteenth century spiritualist craze. When, in 1882, in London, a small band of scientists and spiritualists founded the Palmer answered, \"What would you say if I told you the whole thing was a joke?\" DR. J.B. RHINE: THE 'DISCOVERER' OF ESP Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 35Society for Psychical Research (SPR), unfortunately, their credulity, even outright gullibility, did not serve them well\u2014and some members such as Harry Price, the ghost hunter, found the society too skeptical (Alcock 1996; Nickell 2012a, 21-22, 195-199, 261). Despite fell to a botanist, Dr. J.B. Rhine (1895-1980), to attempt to establish psi as a scientific reality. He and his wife, Louisa, wished to establish that the soul existed and hoped to use psychical research (soon called \"parapsychology\") to link religion and science. Unfortunately, in 1929, the credulous Rhines were taken in by a \"mind-reading\" horse named Lady Wonder. Lady appeared to be telepathic, nudging levers to activate alphabet cards and spell out answers to queries, but she was in fact responding to subtle cues from her trainer (Nickell 2004, 279-280). Nevertheless, Rhine's parapsychology laboratory at Duke University\u2014founded in 1940\u2014pioneered in ESP research. His card tests\u2014involving a subject's guessing the sequence of symbols on a special deck of cards\u2014seemed to begin to offer proof of a phenomenon for which he had coined the term Extra-Sensory Perception (as the title of a monograph in 1934). However, the tests were plagued with criticisms that subjects were allowed to handle the cards, that cheating was possible and not adequately guarded against, that the statistical analyses were flawed, and so on. Moreover, when Rhine tightened the controls, the scores went down. Rhine died having never convinced mainstream science that either ESP or psychokinesis was real (Alcock 1996; Hansel 1966). Even so, Rhine became the most famous parapsychologist in America, his name almost synonymous with ESP. He dominated the field until his death, and even then left an indelible mark on it. The term cryptozoology\u2014the study of unknown or \"hidden\" creatures (i.e., cryptids)\u2014has been found in use as early as 1941 (Loxton and Prothero 2013, 16). It applies to such purported creatures as sea serpents, the Loch Ness mon-ster, the Yeti, Bigfoot (each discussed here in turn), and many others. Although sea serpents are reported from ancient times, it was British hydrog- rapher and author Rupert T. Gould (1890-1948) who presented them seriously to readers, beginning in 1930 with his book The Case for the Sea-Serpent. (This was followed by Bernard Heuvelmans's In the Wake of the Sea-Serpents in 1968.) Gould went on to also promote river and lake creatures in articles, radio broadcasts, and his 1934 book, The Loch Ness Monster and Others (Keel 2001b). Such creatures typically prove to be the misidentification of known creatures (such as otters swim - ming in a line), or other mundane phenomena, or hoaxes (Nickell 1995, 238-243; 2013a). Another cryptozoologist was Ivan T. Sanderson (1911-1973), whose important writings on the subject included There Could Be Dinosaurs (1948) and Investigating the Unexplained: A Compendium of Disquieting Mysteries of the Natural World (1972). His 1961 Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life helped turn the Yeti into sup-posed evidence for Bigfoot. For example, a footprint many believed to be that of a Himalayan Yeti (but more likely an animal track altered and enlarged by melting snow) helped set the stage for the appearance of giant footprints in 1958 at Bluff Creek in northern California, leading to the creature being dubbed \"Bigfoot.\" In 2002, the tracks were revealed as a hoax by Ray Wallace (Nickell 2011, 68). In 1967, Bigfoot enthusiast Roger Patterson set out to film the creature at Bluff Creek and returned with footage showing what was more recently revealed as Pat - terson acquaintance Bob Heironimus wearing a gorilla suit bought from costumer Phil Morris and modified (Nickell 2011, 68-72). Meanwhile, books on the man-beast had begun to proliferate, including Patterson's Do Abominable Snowmen of Amer- ican Really Exist? (1966) and John Green's Sasquatch: The Apes Among Us (1978). Many Bigfoot sightings are attributable to what I call the \"Bigfoot Bear\"\u2014that is, any bear standing upright and even walking on its hind legs\u2014such lookalikes Sasquatch or a Neanderthal man frozen in ice.36 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirercally being found in bear country and engaging in bearlike activity (Nickell 2013b). Despite all these paranormal claims, the man usually designated the \"Father of Cryptozoology\" is Bernard Heuvelmans (1916-2001) (Coleman and Clark 1999, 161). Another claimant for the title would be his friend, the previously mentioned Ivan T. Sanderson; both were taken in by the \"Minnesota Iceman\" hoax\u2014suppos-edly a Sasquatch or a Neanderthal man frozen in ice but actually the work of a Disneyland model maker (Nickell 2011, 87-90). However, it was actually Heuvel-mans who did the most to create the field of cryptozoology, first with his serious 1955 book, Sur la Piste des B\u00eates Ignor\u00e9es (republished in English, On the Track of Unknown Animals, 1958, 1962), then with his many additional books, his founding a Center for Cryptozoology in 1975 and being elected first president of the Inter-national Society of Cryptozoology at its founding in 1982 (Coleman and Clark 1999, 105-108). The concept of an area of the Atlantic where ships and planes mysteriously disappear can be traced to a Miami Associated Press (AP) writer, E(dward) V(an) W(inkle) Jones. His article appeared in the Miami Herald, September 17, 1950, and was accompanied by an AP map showing Bermuda, Miami, and Puerto Rico partially connected by dashed lines approximating a triangle. Jones (1950) vaguely referred to a \"misty limbo of the lost.\" Two years later, writing in Fate magazine, George X. Sands (1952) expanded Jones's article (without citing him or other sources), and added the word triangle and a heavy dose of mystifi-cation. Others also began to get onto the little bandwagon started by E.V.W. Jones, and soon there was a caravan. The flying saucer hucksters fell in behind (e.g., Morris Jessup with The Case for the UFO, 1955, and Donald Keyhoe with The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, 1957), as did writers of the \"strange\" genre (including Frank Edwards with Stranger Than Science, 1959) and others. It remained for Vincent Gaddis (1913-1997)\u2014a writer who once made up \"filler\" stories for Raymond Palmer as \"a matter of livelihood\" (Gaddis 1991, 16-17)\u2014to get out in front and lead the burgeoning effort. His article in the February 1964 Argosy landed on major American newsstands and gave the mystery area a de- finitive name and ominous tone: \"The Deadly Bermuda Triangle.\" Gad-dis followed a year later with a book on sea mysteries, Invisible Horizons (1965), in which a chapter gave an alternate, even more ominous name for the area, \"The Triangle of Death.\" Many joined Gaddis with books of their own. John Wallace Spencer's 1969 self-published book borrowed its title from E.V.W. Jones but pretended otherwise, referring to an area \"that I call the 'Limbo of the Lost.'\" (Spencer loaded his auto with books that he then promoted on talk shows, until Bantam Books transformed the work into a bestselling paperback in 1973 [Kusche 1996, 104].) In fact there was no clear \"triangle,\" and writers proposed greatly varying sizes and even different shapes, including a rough square called \"The Hoodoo Sea\" and another very large configuration, \"Devil's Trape-zium\" (Nickell 2007, 5). Worse, reports authority Lawrence David Kusche (1996, 102), \"Many of the losses that are credited to the Bermuda Triangle actually occurred nowhere near it, but near Ireland, Newfoundland, in the Pacific Ocean!\" Ivan Sanderson took things further into the ridiculous, discovering there to be not just one jinx area but a dozen, his article for the pulp Saga (October 1972) being titled \"The 12 Devil's Graveyards Around the World.\" (Reprinted in Ebon 1975.) Some were over land, Sanderson opined, and he called their shapes \"Lozanges\" (Sanderson 1975, 15-25). Much of the information on which these \"Vile Vortices\" were based was false or imaginary (Kusche 1996, 114). Still other writers VINCENT H. GADDIS: THE BERMUDA TRIANGULATOR Map of the \"Bermuda Triangle\" and some other such alleged regions. (Map by Joe Nickell)Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 37followed, notably Richard Winer with his The Devil's Triangle and Charles Berlitz with his The Bermuda Triangle\u2014both bestsellers published in 1974. Meanwhile, the impressive investigation by Kusche\u2014The Bermuda Triangle Mys- tery\u2014Solved (1975)\u2014used original records and detective work to take the mys-tery from the mystery mongers. Kusche provided prosaic explanations\u2014severe weather, human error, and equipment failure among them\u2014to case after misrep-resented case. For example, the 1963 \"disappearance\" of the S.S. Marine Sulphur Queen was instead an accident caused by structural weakening due to the removal of bulkheads to accommodate vats containing tons of molten sulfur; wreckage was found, including the name board reading \"ARINE SULPH\" between its shattered ends (Kusche 1975, 206-216). Still, of course, the claims continued. (I have myself responded to some of them, including for an episode of National Geographic Tele-vision's Is It Real? [2006; see also Nickell 2007]. Kusche revisited the subject in his recent S KEPTICAL INQUIRER cover article on the fortieth anniversary of his book, calling the \"mystery\" of the Bermuda Triangle \"one of the most widespread frauds that has ever been perpetrated\" (Kusche 2015, 36). The modern ancient-astronauts craze was sparked in 1968 with the publication of Erich von D\u00e4niken's Chariots of the Gods?\u2014a book that consistently underestimates the abil-ities of ancient peoples and assigns many of their impressive works to visiting extra-terrestrials. Von D\u00e4niken (b. 1935) wrote several other books capitalizing on the worldwide success of his first\u2014works that scholars and scientists label pseudo-history and pseudoarchaeology\u2014and other writers followed suit. Von D\u00e4niken did not invent the idea of ancient astronauts; it has its beginnings as far back as the nineteenth century. Also, in 1919, Charles Fort speculated in his Book of the Damned about archaeological indications for early extraterrestrial visitation. Such speculation was also common to pre-von D\u00e4niken saucer writers such as Morris K. Jessup (Clark 1998, 1: 75-86). Nevertheless, von D\u00e4niken did create modern worldwide interest in the notion in his books. Again and again, however, he misrepresents the archaeological facts. For example, he suggests that the Egyptians could not have built the pyramids, that they lacked the means of quarrying the stones, transporting them (having neither rope nor wood for rollers), or lifting them in place (von D\u00e4niken 1971, 74-80). In fact, the quarries are still extant (one of them being the hollow area in which the Sphinx stands); the \"nonexistent\" rope is displayed in quantities in museums; the Egyptians left a drawing showing how they transported a colossal statue of many times greater weight than any pyramid stone using rope and a wooden sledge; and traces still exist of the great earthen ramps (progressively lengthened as neces-sary to lessen the steepness) that were used to raise the stones (Nickell 1995, 187-188). Von D\u00e4niken again overstates the difficulty of making the famous Nazca lines and giant ground drawings that are etched across thirty miles of Peruvian desert. Lines and figures, he opines, could have been \"built according to instructions from an aircraft\" (von D\u00e4niken 1971, 17). In fact, using sticks and knotted cord, I twice recreated Nazca geoglyphs: the giant condor (in 1982 on a Kentucky landfill) and the great spider (in 2006 on a California ranch for filming by National Geographic Television). No flying saucer was required to make the figures, whose lines are believed to be used for ritual processions (Nickell 1983; 2012b, 121-125; Aveni 2000, 212-222). As to the \"chariots\" in the title of von D\u00e4niken's first book, they refer to the fiery spaceships he imagines had landed anciently, witnessed by awed primitives. He sees the large drawings as \"signals\" and the longer and wider lines as \"landing strips\" (von D\u00e4niken 1971, 17; 1972, 105). the German-born mathe- ERICH VON D\u00c4NIKEN: CHARIOTEER OF THE GODS 38 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirermatician who mapped and studied the markings, had a ready rejoinder. Noting that the earth there is quite soft, she quipped, \"I'm afraid the spacemen would have got-ten stuck\" (quoted in McIntyre 1975, 718). As early as 1978, mysterious, swirled pat-terns began to appear in southern English fields\u2014most often in wheat and other cereal crops, or \"corn\" as the British say. They inspired countless articles and a spate of books, no fewer than three in 1989. Circles- mystery enthusiasts were now called \"cereologists\" (after Ceres, the Roman goddess of vegetation), and \"circlemania\" was in full bloom (Nickell with Fischer 1992, 177-178). The phenomenon was essentially new. An attempt to link it with a circle that had appeared in a field of oats in Hertfordshire in 1678\u2014then attributed to witchcraft\u2014fails because that circle was cut, not bent down in a swirled pattern. Although reports of such circles have surfaced in modern times, such as those of reeds in Australia in 1966 and a burned circle of grass in Connecticut in 1970, few had the flattened swirl feature and few were well documented at the time. All were sup-posedly suggestive of flying-saucer landing spots, such as circles shown in tall grass in a Swiss village by a man claiming to be regularly visited by extraterrestri-als (Nickell with Fischer 1992, 183-184). As investigation showed, several factors pointed to hoaxing as the most likely explanation: Suspiciously, crop circles were more prevalent in southern England, had proliferated as media reports increased, were becoming more complex each season, and exhibited a \"shyness\" effect (that is, the mechanism avoided being seen in operation). Then two retired artists\u2014Doug Bower and Dave Chorley\u2014con-fessed they had pioneered in the making of the patterns using planks and cord. They proved their ability by fooling cereologist Pat Delgado, who had declared a pattern they had produced for a British tabloid to be genuine. Soon, others came forward to admit that they too had made circles, helping it become a copycat phe-nomenon (Nickell with Fischer 1992, 177-210). \"Doug and Dave,\" as they became known, were not only the originators of the modern phenomenon, they kept at it and were responsible for many of the giant grain-field patterns made over the years. Although they wrote no articles or books, they demonstrated their circle-making technique for television crews\u2014for exam-ple, for ABC-TV's Good Morning America (September 10, 1991)\u2014and their pro-claimed hoax gained worldwide publicity. Those who did write the articles and books\u2014and who therefore certainly helped promote the mystery of the phenomenon\u2014were much less the \"creators\" of crop circles than they were its victims. Among them were Terence Meaden (author of The Circles Effect and Its Mystery, 1989), who had postulated that the crop circles were due to wind vortexes, but, as he kept modifying his theories to fit the evidence on the ground, the patterns continuously changed to keep one step ahead. Pat Del-gado and Colin Andrews (authors of Circular Evidence, 1989, and other books) were major promoters, but they were fooled by Doug and Dave and their imitators, and, as other hoaxes were revealed, they were left foolishly holding their dowsing rods. Many other circles promoters were likewise fooled, but there were die-hards such as Eltjo H. Haselhoff, PhD (2001), who were undaunted by \"self-proclaimed\" hoax-ers and soldiered on, as the circles became ever more elaborate, morphing into mathematical formations, pictograms, and even rectilinear designs that seemed a spoof of the very term \"crop circles.\" * * * DOUG BOWER AND DAVE CHORLEY: CROP CIRCLE MAKERSSkeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 39 One wonders what these several \"creators of the paranormal\" would today think of what they had wrought. No doubt most felt their cause important. Some were credulous but principled (Bernard Heuvelmans and J.B. Rhine); some were out to make a buck (Harry Price, Vincent Gaddis, and Erich von D\u00e4niken); and still others wished to stir things up and enjoy the fray (Charles Fort, Raymond Palmer, and Doug Bower and Dave Chorley). Perhaps each was rewarded in his own way. Despite some side benefits (our learning more about such things as waking dreams, misperceptions, the will to believe, etc.) the paranormal has proved largely a chimera\u2014that fire-breathing, lion-headed, goat-bod-ied, serpent-tailed monster of ancient mythology. Nevertheless, it still lurks at the com-mon boundary of superstition and science, endlessly chasing its scorched tail. I References Alcock, James E. 1996. Extrasensory perception.

Psychological dissociation, even at a subclinical level, is an important factor in the cognitive processing that leads to belief in the unreal. MATTHEW J. SHARPS, SCHUYLER W. LIAO, AND MEGAN R. HERRERA V irtually all known human cultures possess beliefs in the paranormal. This may at first seem maladap-tive\u2014how could belief in the unreal be sufficiently advantageous that it would have survived the rigors of human evolution in the all-too-real world of past ages? Such beliefs may have yielded evolu- tionary advantages. Although the inter- action of culture and human evolution is complex, it is certainly possible that shared paranormal beliefs within any given culture, such as shared venera-tion of ancestral spirits or god-kings, might have yielded a coalescent group loyalty that would be useful, physically and politically, in dealings with other competing cultures. This might very well have resulted in a selective bias to-ward dissociative processes, leading to success in those cultures that indulge in such beliefs. But even if this is the case, a signifi- cant psychological question arises\u2014one especially true for the modern world, in which access to scientific information is effectively unparalleled historically\u2014How are such beliefs maintained in the minds of individuals , within any given culture? Why do individual people har-bor bizarre beliefs? Experimental Psychology and the Paranormal Previous laboratory research has demon-strated the importance of psychological characteristics that predispose individ -uals to paranormal thinking. In earlier research (Sharps et al. 2006; 2010), we showed that subclinical levels of depression were important for belief in ghosts and extraterrestrial aliens. This is presumably because the depressed would prefer to be in an environment where things might be better; and things might be better in the afterlife represented by ghosts, or perhaps on another, nicer planet where extraterres-trials might live. Subclinical tendencies toward at- tention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) predisposed people to belief in extraterrestrial aliens and cryptids such as Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster. Why? Aliens and monsters are cool, and finding them in the woods and bodies of water takes us away from the mundane reality that those with ADHD tendencies frequently find ex-cruciatingly dull. However, in these studies, the most important of the characteristics predis-posing us to paranormal thinking was dissociation. Not only did subclinical levels of dissociation predispose peo-ple to beliefs in everything paranormal (whether UFOs, aliens, cryptids, or ghosts), but it also predisposed them to see these things. In a study in which we used Internet pictures of \"paranormal\" creatures and objects (Sharps 2012), the dissociated tended to see them as real. Where everybody else saw a teenager in a Halloween gorilla suit with extra monkey hair, those with subclinical dissociation saw Bigfoot. Odd lights in the sky (a helicopter with a broken landing light, for example) readily be-came UFOs for the dissociated. In short, those with subclinical dissoci - ation tended to see the prosaic as real evidence of the paranormal. It is crucial to emphasize the word subclinical. People with dissociative characteristics are emphatically not \"crazy.\" All human beings experience some levels of dissociation in their ev-eryday life without clinical significance. But those with more of these tenden-cies tend to see their world in vastly more paranormal terms. They not only believe in these things; they see them in stimuli that other people would imme-diately perceive as nonparanormal in nature. Subclinical dissociation was also important in the 2012 Mayan \"end of the world\" fiasco, in which an ancient Mayan god was (depending on which interpretation you believed) literally ex-pected to surf ashore on a raft of very old (but presumably waterproof) sacred snakes and establish a New Order of peace and so forth. Not terribly likely, right? Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 41We were privileged to publish two articles in the S I (Sharps et al. 2013; 2014) concerning the psychological factors that made it possible for modern human beings to believe in this type of baseless nonsense. We found that disturbingly high num-bers of university students held very in-coherent, but very positive, beliefs in the \"Mayan end of the world.\" Almost half of our research respondents thought it might happen; 10 percent were effec-tively certain that it was going to hap-pen, and 10 percent thought it was still inevitable even after it didn't happen. When one considers the requisite phys-ical details (Mayan god, waterproof snakes, etc.), one rather wonders what these students, exposed on a daily basis to modern science, were majoring in. Yet they bought it, and the number one factor producing this deeply bizarre set of beliefs was subclinical dissociation.What Exactly Is Dissociation? Unfortunately, the term dissociation has many uses and definitions. In our usage, we emphatically do not refer to psychiatric concepts of dissociative identity disorder, or to a psychotic level of dissociation. We refer to sub-clinical dissociative tendencies, of the sort probably experienced from time to time by most people. Those with subclinical dissociative tendencies see prosaic reality as potentially fraught with supernatural meaning. For the dissociated, the facades of buildings, seen in everyday context on the street, might hide vast conspiracies or alien autopsies or Bigfoot. This type of dissociation may lead to a diminished critical assessment of reality; as discussed in earlier S- I articles (Sharps 2012; Sharps et al. 2013; 2014), there may be anomalous perceptions of individual experience. The world may appear to be \"not quite real or . . . diffuse\" (Cardena 1997, This is emphatically not \"mental illness.\" However, the discon-nection with immediate physical reality that occurs with subclinical dissociation might incline many normal people to view highly improbable things with more credulity (see DePrince and Freyd 1999; also Sharps et al. 2013; 2014). Compulsory education does not cure this sort of thing. College students frequently engage in superstitious or \"lucky\" behaviors when approaching examinations and tests in their classes, especially when the consequences are perceived as particularly important (Rudski and Edwards 2007). Almost half of our college students (Sharps et al. 2013; 2014) thought that the Mayan apocalypse might happen, and 10 per-cent were sure that it would. So, we know that dissociation con- 42 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirertributes to paranormal beliefs and per- ceptions. But how pervasive is it? What types of paranormal thinking and per-ception are associated with dissociative tendencies? This was the focus of our present study, which used standardized instru-ments to address the question. Experimental Framework Forty-one male respondents (mean age 19.37 years, SD = 1.73) and sixty-three female respondents (mean age 19.21 years, SD = 1.37) participated in this study. These respondents completed the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES; Carlson and Putnam 1986). This is a standard instrument for the assessment of dissociative tendencies, used previously in a number of our experiments, including those published in the S I (e.g., Sharps 2012; Sharps et al. 2013; 2014). The DES deals with empirically ver-ified everyday experiences that relate strongly to dissociation, the focus of the current research. The respondents also completed the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale (RPBS; Tobacyk 2004). This scale addresses paranormal beliefs of various types, ad-dressing beliefs in such areas as the soul, magic, and cryptids. This standardized instrument addresses, on an empirical basis, many of the paranormal beliefs current in Western culture. Finally, respondents completed the standard Duke University Religion Index (e.g., Koenig and Bussing 2010), which deals with religious behaviors re-lated to the supernatural (e.g., church attendance). The items of the RPBS were sorted according to their subject areas. The twenty-six items of this scale were sorted into the following indices: be-liefs in Religiosity, Magic, Luck, Fu-ture Prediction, Cryptids (i.e., the Loch Ness monster), Fate of the Soul, and Supernatural Powers. The overall score on the RPBS, and the score of each respondent on each of these beliefs, was computed and com-pared with scores on the DES, and then on the Duke Index, by means of linear regression. The results were quite revealing. Results The relationship of overall scores on the RPBS to dissociation in this non-di-agnosed, normal population was sig-nificant (linear regression), R 2 = .171, F(1,101) = 21.70, p < .001, = .423. Especially interesting is the fact that all factors identified as paranormal were significantly (p < .05) related to dissoci- ation as measured by the DES. In other words, tendencies toward subclinical dissociation, in this normal, non-diag-nosed population, were strongly related to all forms of paranormal beliefs. In terms of relationship to subclin- ical dissociation, Religiosity was most strongly related by beliefs in heaven and hell ( = .281). Magic was most strongly endorsed by beliefs in witch - craft ( = .167), although beliefs in specific cases of witchcraft was an-other matter; see below. Luck was most strongly endorsed by a fear of black cats ( = .268). Future Prediction was most strongly endorsed by a belief in astrol-ogy ( = .270). (Belief in cryptids, for this scale, dealt only with the Abom-inable Snowman and the Loch Ness monster; Bigfoot and his allies were conspicuously absent from this instru-ment). Nessie was strongly endorsed, = .420, while the Snowman was not. We address this important dichotomy below. Fate of the Soul was most strongly supported by belief in the possibil-ity of communication with the dead ( = .185), with belief in reincarnation a close second ( = .164). Belief in astral projection fell a distant third, = .064. Finally, psychic powers were endorsed most strongly in mental \"object mov-ing,\" = .224, although psychokinesis, effectively a synonym, was endorsed less strongly ( = .109; see below). Two additional items of the RPBS tested DES scores against modern scientific perspectives. The first, a be-lief that \"mind reading cannot occur,\" was nonsignificant against dissociative tendencies. However, the second, that there may be life on other planets, was endorsed more strongly and signifi-cantly by the dissociated, = .231. Interestingly, no significant relation- ship was found between dissociation and the scales of the Duke University Religion Index, which at first appears to conflict with the significant relation-ship of the DES to the Religiosity scale of the RPBS; but wait. Discussion Dissociation, as measured in this sub- clinical population by the DES, was significantly associated with every index of paranormal thinking measured. Those with dissociative tendencies were more likely to believe in heaven/hell, witch-craft, the danger of black cats, astrol-ogy, the Loch Ness monster, commu-nication with the dead, reincarnation, and psychic powers. However, belief in the Abominable Snowman, specific instances of witch - craft, and psychokinesis were not as strongly related to dissociative tenden-cies. Why not? Gestalt and Feature-Intensive Processes Previously 2010; Sharps et al. 2013; Sharps and Nunes 2002), we presented a continuum in human information processing, in what is called the Gestalt/Feature-Intensive Processing theory. This continuum ranges from feature-intensive process- ing, in which the specific details of a concept are given specific consideration in depth, to gestalt processing, in which a given concept is considered without detailed analysis, with relatively uncrit- So, we know that dissociation contributes to paranormal beliefs and perceptions. But how pervasive is it? What types of paranormal thinking and perception are associated with dissociative tendencies?Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 43ical acceptance of the given idea as a whole. We suggest here a relationship be- tween dissociative tendencies and gestalt processing, the relatively uncritical, de-tail-free consideration of given phe - nomena. In 2012, enormous attention was given to the Maya prophecies in media and in other sources. This, ac-cording to the availability heuristic of Tversky and Kahneman (1973), made these prophecies relatively salient to the entire population. These proph-ecies were relatively available, to ev-erybody, in various media sources and were therefore immediately salient for people thinking about these issues. However, for most people, there would have been some feature-inten- sive consideration of these prophecies; feature-intensive analysis tells us that ancient societies, such as the Mayans, lacked modern scientific understand - ing, and so their prophecies might not be right. Also, a serious, feature-in-tensive consideration of an ancient Mayan god surfing ashore on a raft of long-suffering, six-hundred-year-old waterproof snakes becomes immedi-ately ridiculous. However, those exhibiting sub- clinical levels of dissociation, with consequent gestalt processing tendencies, would not engage in the necessary fea-ture-intensive thinking; they would not think about the time involved, or the snakes, and would thereby credulously entertain the Mayan \"prophecies.\" In our previous research (Sharps et al. 2013; 2014), that's exactly what they did. The ludicrous, feature-intensive details would be lost in favor of a ge-stalt, an idea something like \"the god will return.\" This gestalt processing would necessarily result in a consequent strength of belief in a god-ridden \"New Age,\" without the bothersome concerns engendered by feature-intensive, scien-tific, appropriately skeptical analysis. These considerations are under- scored by the exceptions to this pat-tern we noted earlier. More dissoci-ated individuals believed in the Loch Ness monster than in the Abominable Snowman. Why? The Snowman is little seen today in televised and Internet accounts, taking a decided backseat to Bigfoot and his cronies. The Abominable Snowman is historically an earlier concept, less \"available\" to modern thinking in Tver-sky and Kahneman's terms. Thinking about this older concept would require more feature-intensive concepts to con-sider, more in-depth thinking about a relatively unfamiliar idea. The Loch Ness monster, on the other hand, is seen in TV \"documen-taries\" all the time. Even with its his-torical provenance, it is therefore a modern concept, relatively \"available\" in Tversky and Kahneman's terms, more amenable to modern thinkers, and hence more readily processed in ge-stalt, feature-free terms. Therefore, the dissociated tend to endorse Nessie rela-tively freely. The Snowman takes more work, more feature-intensive analysis, and is therefore less readily endorsed. We saw the same effect with astrol- ogy and astral projection. Astrology is a still-current, relatively available con-cept, requiring little feature-intensive analysis. Astral projection, a concept whose televised and Internet popu-larity has waned, would require more feature-intensive analysis, and would require less detail-free gestalt consider-ation for easy acceptance. The same effect applies to \"object moving\" and \"psychokinesis.\" Mental object moving requires no analysis at a feature-intensive level; it is eponymous. \"Psychokinesis,\" although effectively a synonym for \"mental object moving,\" is an earlier, currently less available concept, which requires additional thought, activating feature-intensive processing. Thus, mental \"object mov-ing\" was endorsed with its automatized, eponymously gestalt characteristics, whereas the more feature-intensive, but synonymous, concept of psychokinesis was not. Finally, the same phenomenon was observed in the endorsement of \"witch-craft\" as a general, gestalt phenomenon, but in the absence of statistically signif-icant endorsement of specific instances of witchcraft, which would require more feature-intensive thinking. The general phenomenon was endorsed; the specific instances were not. From all of these instances, the pat-tern is clear: when broad, noncritical gestalt processes are involved, the dis-sociated tend more toward paranormal beliefs. When analytical, skeptical, fea-ture-intensive processes are required, paranormal beliefs recede, at least to some degree. What about the Duke Religion Index? No significant relationships were found between dissociative tendencies and the scales of the Duke Index. Is this an exception to the considerations discussed above? The answer is no, although this sit- uation opens important avenues for fu-ture research. The Duke scales predom-inantly assess religious activities, not beliefs. This index addresses tendencies to engage in church attendance and re-lated activities rather than specific ideas about theological phenomena. Church attendance and such are pre- cisely the activities that would have al-lowed one to adhere to local standards in the vastly more religious ancient world. Whether you believe or not, these activ-ities allow you to insert yourself more firmly into a religious community, a crucial factor in the tribal societies of the ancient world. Human evolution has fostered the tendency to fit into society. Ancient so-cieties, those in existence through the majority of human evolutionary time, tended to hold specific sets of beliefs. If you demonstrated your beliefs accord-ingly, you were accepted; if not, you were ostracized, frequently with fatal consequences. When broad, noncritical gestalt processes are involved, the dissoci-ated tend more toward paranormal beliefs. When analytical, skep-tical, feature-intensive processes are required, paranormal beliefs recede, at least to some degree.44 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerThe potential adaptive significance, the evolutionary advantage, is obvious. In any given ancient society, as long as you demonstrated your beliefs, re-gardless of internal cognitive processes, you were an acceptable member of the society. If you did not do so, you were ostracized or killed. Thus, we see a potentially important dichotomy between actual gestalt and feature-intensive beliefs, and a demon-stration of the importance of apparent conformation to these beliefs in socially acceptable venues. Those who engaged in the appropriate religious rituals were most likely to succeed in most of the societies that preceded the modern era. Those who did not were ostracized or killed. This was true regardless of the internal cognitive processes of thinking or belief. Therefore, religious activities, as opposed to beliefs and as measured by the Duke Index, would not be expected to be influenced, substantially or sig - nificantly, by subclinical dissociative tendencies. The more successful, less dissociative individuals would histori-cally be suggested to have engaged in religious activities to the same degree as everybody else, and we would antic-ipate this tendency to have continued into the modern world. However, the beliefs involved would be more likely to be endorsed by the dissociated; that is exactly what was demonstrated by the present results. In summary, our present results in- dicate: 1. Subclinical dissociative tenden-cies predispose people to paranormal beliefs. 2. Those paranormal systems that require only gestalt cognition are more likely to result in the endorse-ment of such beliefs, as opposed to those that require more intense, feature-intensive thinking, which do not. 3. These dynamics are more likely to be observed in the realm of para-normal or religious thinking rather than in the realm of locally approved activities (e.g., church attendance). The best way to counter such para- normal beliefs is to make use of ed - ucational interventions that involve feature-intensive analysis and think- ing. Potential believers in paranormal phenomena are most likely to question these erroneous beliefs if provided with solid, feature-intensive educational en-vironments in which they must con-front such supposed phenomena as ex-traterrestrial aliens, cryptids, and ghosts in very specific terms. Summary Our latest research shows that those who exhibit subclinical tendencies toward paranormal beliefs also tend toward subclinical dissociation. These tendencies may best be countered by detail-specific, feature-intensive, scien-tific education. Hopefully, these con-siderations may inform education at the primary, secondary, and collegiate levels to reduce paranormal beliefs in favor of scientifically legitimate think-ing needed to develop realistic science and technology.

Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 45Scientific Reasoning at the USAF Academy: An Examination into Titanium-Treated Necklaces We used a classroom experiment at the United States Air Force Academy to examine whether necklaces infused with microscopic-particle titanium, such as those sold by Phiten Corporation, improve emotional well-being. CRAIG A. FOSTER, CHRISTOPHER K. MCCLERNON, AND RICHARD F. REICH Wedding bands typically feature a particular metal such as gold, silver, platinum, or in some cases, titanium. There is no scientific reason to believe that the substance of the metal (e.g., the titanium) has any direct influence on a person's physical health or emotional well-being. Now, imagine dissolving that same metal in water so the resulting microscopic-sized particles could be infused into an item that could be worn or kept in close proximity. Would the resulting item provide a health ben-efit where the solid mass could not? That is the essence of the claim made by Phiten Corporation (Phiten), a Japanese company that distributes products worldwide. Phiten offered the following summary on the English ver-sion of its corporate webpage (see www.phiten.com): All Phiten products incorporate a novel form of technology that involves metals broken down into microscopic particles dispersed in water. This process underlines [sic] the technologies of a variety of unique materials we possess. By uti-lizing the property of each material to a maximum extent, we are able to realize customers' potentials in a variety of extents that leads to restore normal relaxation status of custom-ers. This is the technology that sup-ports more comfortable daily life. These \"Aqua Metals\" include ti- tanium, silver, platinum, palladium, and gold. They are incorporated into several products such as necklaces, bracelets, tape, lotions, athletic sup-ports, garments, sleeping goods, and \"relaxation equipment.\" Phiten also offers a \"Phiten Room\" where micro-scopic-particle titanium (MPT) can be permeated into wall surfaces to enhance relaxation. Those who are not familiar with Phiten might be surprised at the pop-ularity of its products. The Phiten webpage currently offers a robust list of global contacts that, at present, includes locations in Europe, Asia, Australia, North America, and South America. The United States subsidiary, Phiten USA (www.phitenUSA.com), notes that there are over 130 Phiten re- tail locations in Japan and that Phiten started officially in Southern California in 1998. The Phiten USA timeline also refers to several well-known athletes who have served as Phiten representa-tives (including Jennie Finch, Carmelo Anthony, Josh Hamilton, and Hideki Matsuyama). Phiten was a corporate partner of University of Hawaii Ath-letics for several years and has had for-mal relationships with Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basket-ball Association (NBA), and the Na-tional Hockey League (NHL). Phiten recently developed a baseball cleat with New Balance, a well-known athletic ap-parel company. Phiten's products usually incorporate MPT, which sometimes called \"Aqua Titan\" or \"Aqua-Tita-nium.\" Phiten's titanium-treated neck-laces seem to be particularly popular in baseball. 46 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerClaims and Evidence Surrounding MPT We were interested in the claim that MPT, even when located externally to a person, can influence emotional well-be-ing (e.g., wearing an MPT-infused necklace). The presence of MPT could influence well-being through a placebo effect, and MPT, when infused in a tape or garment, could exert some influ-ence simply by keeping people warmer (see Rowlands et al. 2014). However, Phiten has clearly cultivated the notion that being in the presence of MPT can directly improve emotional well-be-ing through some mysterious process. Consider Phiten's description regarding its necklaces and bracelets: Simply by wearing these prod- ucts, your body can feel relaxed and refreshed. Our necklaces are an indispensable item for relieving stress and fatigue in our modern lives. . . . In all aspects of life\u2014from everyday activities to athletics\u2014our products can help maximize your potential energy and strength. This is why so many top athletes use Phiten products. (http://www.phiten.com/english/products/index.html) Support for the theory that exter- nally located MPT influences emo- tional well-being can be linked to two sources. The first is people who claim that MPT-treated products provide this benefit; if at least some of the re- views on Amazon.com are to be trusted, many people believe that Phiten neck-laces alleviate pain or influence emo-tional well-being. The second source of support comes from a small number of publications promoting the potential health benefits of MPT. The Aoi et al. (2012) examination into the influence of MPT-treated surroundings pro-vides the clearest implication that the external presence of MPT somehow influences emotional well-being. Aoi et al. randomly assigned office work - ers to sleep for five nights in quarters where the walls and floors were or were not infused with MPT. According to Aoi et al., their results \"suggest that sleeping in a room containing titanium lowers physiological and psychological stress\" (2012, p. 13). There are several reasons to be skep- tical of this type of claim. One cause for concern is that research supporting the potential benefits of MPT is typically funded by Phiten, has an author who lists Phiten as the institutional affilia-tion, or both. The only exception was one article where the authors declared that there was no conflict of interest. This type of collaboration is not by it-self improper, but it is possible that this corporate-research synergy could gen-erate collectively biased results. Phit-en-supported researchers might be less aggressive in publishing unflattering results, possibly creating a \"file drawer problem.\" They might also knowingly or unknowingly overlook potential problems in their research methodolo-gies. At the very least, it seems fair to suggest that the scientific community will have difficulty embracing the pur-ported benefits of MPT without sup-port from researchers who are clearly independent from Phiten. Another concern is that Phiten's promotion of MPT and other Aqua Metals simply sounds like pseudosci-ence. The term pseudoscience can be used unfairly, so let us offer specific examples. First, support for Phiten's products is largely anecdotal (Shermer 2002). Second, there is no clear mecha-nism to explain how one variable influ-ences another (see Thagard 1993), and even Phiten-funded researchers report that the mechanism between MPT and improved health \"remains unclear\" (Aoi et al. 2012, p. 17). Third, the variety of purported benefits associated with MPT might resemble pseudoscience in terms of sounding extraordinary (e.g., Hines 2003). Even the single impli-cation that MPT can diminish the ever-present problem of stress would likely be the psychological discovery of the decade. Fourth, the theory that externally located MPT provides ben-efits appears to be constructed so that it can only be confirmed (e.g., Hans-son 2013). This seems evident in the small necklace packaging disclaimer that states, \"Not all users will experi-ence the intended benefits of Phiten products, and individuals must try it for themselves to see whether it works for them.\" This disclaimer suggests that positive results can be attributed to the necklaces while negative results cannot. Fifth, MPT appears similar to other externally worn accessories with health-related claims that science gen-erally deems as pseudoscientific: crys-tals, copper bracelets, and magnetic bracelets. Classroom Experiment: Phiten Necklaces versus All-Purpose Clothesline We examined the potential influ - ence of Phiten necklaces in a United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) classroom experiment. We needed an experiment with two groups to create a subsequent demonstration of inferen - tial statistics for pedagogical purposes. Our deeper motive was to support the USAFA Officer Development mission by reinforcing the intertwined values of empiricism and scientific reasoning. Military professionals should value empiricism to prevent the military from investing in products and ser - vices that do not provide any real ben - efit. Military professionals should also learn to supplement intuition, when possible, with well-reasoned evidence. This is seen perhaps most dramatically among pilots. When the experience of in-cockpit flight disrupts the ves-tibular system, pilots can experience Microscopic-particle titanium appears similar to other exter-nally worn accessories with health-related claims that science generally deems as pseudoscientific: crystals, copper bracelets, and magnetic bracelets. Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 47a psychologically powerful motivation to navigate based on their dysfunc-tional perception, possibly resulting in fatal impact. Pilots are therefore trained to rely on decades of accumu-lated evidence demonstrating that they should at these moments \"trust their instruments\" and navigate in a man-ner that feels tremendously danger-ous. This interplay between intuition and science also occurs in other areas. Officers can manage in ways that feel correct but stand in contrast to empir-ically supported theories. Officers presumably benefit from considering evidenced-based theories regarding effective peace support or wartime operations to facilitate their own sit-uation-based judgment. Our impres-sion was that cadets value empiricism and scientific reasoning as textbook definitions but overlook these values in everyday application. We therefore designed a classroom experiment that would allow cadets to experience an examination into a seemingly outland-ish claim rather than just read about it. We asked cadets who were in the second semester of a year-long course sequence about statistics and research methods in the behavioral sciences to participate. These cadets were typi - cally in their third year at the USAFA. Cadets were not required to partici-pate, and a small percentage of cadets declined participating. Forty-eight USAFA cadets (thirty-three female, fifteen male) chose to participate. An instructor (Foster) told partic- ipating and non-participating cadets that we wanted to examine prod-ucts that reportedly improve personal well-being. He explained that the re-search involved wearing necklaces that were covered in tape to conceal their nature. Cadets were asked to wear the necklaces until the next class meet-ing, which occurred forty-eight hours later. Cadets were instructed, for safety purposes, not to wear their respective necklaces when sleeping but to instead wrap them around a wrist, put them under a pillow, or place them next to their person. The instructor also ac-knowledged that some of them might need to remove the necklaces tempo -rarily (e.g., for athletic practices or showering) and, if this were the case, to document when this was necessary. Finally, the instructor encouraged ca-dets to participate fully and seriously in order to support the scientific process and overall learning experience. Cadets were then presented sequen- tially with a large bin from which they could remove a tape-covered necklace. The bin contained a mixed assortment of two different necklaces. Half of the included necklaces were Phiten's Clas-sic Titanium Necklaces (in orange or burnt orange) purchased using the Phiten USA webpage (Phiten Condi-tion). The other necklaces were seg-ments of Everbilt's 3/16 Inch All-Pur-pose Clothesline in White (Clothesline Condition) purchased from The Home Depot. We chose the clothesline be-cause it closely approximated the size and weight of the Phiten necklaces. We removed the clasps from the Phiten necklaces to create straight twenty-six-inch segments. We cut the pieces of clothesline to be the same length. We then wrapped all necklaces in masking tape and connected the ends by wrap -ping that portion of the necklace with white Duct Tape (see Figure 1 where one cadet is wearing a Phiten necklace and the other a \"Clothesline\" necklace). It is quite unlikely that any cadet would attempt to identify a necklace due to concerns about honor and simply being busy. The uncommon white duct tape was nonetheless used as an additional safeguard to discourage any cadet who might be tempted to remove it to iden- tify his or her necklace. Finally, it is important to note that we judged the necklaces to be exceptionally simi-lar in appearance and feel, and we are certain that they created an effective double-blind study\u2014the cadets did not know what kind of necklace they were wearing, and the class instructors could not tell either. Some cadets might have suspected that there was more than one kind of necklace, but we doubt they were overly concerned in this regard. Cadets completed a survey at the next class meeting, which created an experimental trial of approximately for-ty-eight hours. The survey began with three questions: Do you feel relaxed? Do you feel angry? Do you feel ener - Figure 1. Two cadets wearing the necklaces used in the experiment. It is impossible to tell which one is sporting the Phiten necklace.48 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirergetic? We used these three dependent variables based on the claims associated with necklaces and bracelets on the Phiten webpage as well as the results provided by Aoi et al. (2012). Each item was followed by a scale ranging from 1 (No) to 9 (Yes). The survey also solicited which class section cadets were in (there were three sections), their sex, and whether they knew what type of necklace they were wearing (none re-ported knowing). Finally, the survey asked cadets to document any time that they had removed the necklaces other than when showering or when sleeping (at which time it should have been next to their person). We revealed the nature of the experiment and a corresponding laboratory assignment after the survey responses were collected. 1 Results Cadets in the Phiten Condition reported feeling trivially less Relaxed (M=5.62, SD=2.02) than did cadets in the Clothesline Condition (M =5.67; SD=1.99). Cadets in the Phiten Condition reported feeling less Angry (M=2.12; SD=1.42) than did cadets in the Clothesline Condition ( M=2.71; SD=1.88). Cadets in the Phiten Condition reported feeling less Energetic (M=4.96; SD=2.05) than did cadets in the Clothesline Condition ( M=5.46; SD=1.59). We conducted indepen - dent samples t tests comparing the Phiten Condition and the Clothesline Condition for each dependent variable. None of the three results revealed dif - ferences between the conditions that would be deemed as statistically sig - nificant at the standard expected in the behavioral sciences (i.e., all three tests had corresponding probability values greater than 0.05). To be additionally mindful, we identified three subsets of participating cadets based on their survey responses: (a) three cadets who wrote that they had been ill during the trial (one in the Phiten Condition); (b) one cadet who forgot to wear the necklace on the final morning and therefore completed the survey with - out it (Clothesline Condition); and (c) six other cadets who appeared to have spent more than eight hours without wearing their necklace or having it next to them while sleeping (one in the Phiten Condition). We repeated the comparisons between the Phiten and Clothesline Conditions after omitting all possible combinations of these three subjects. The obtained results again did not reveal any statistically significant differences between conditions. Implications The results of our classroom-based experiment do not by themselves fun-damentally disprove the notion that externally located MPT puzzlingly promotes emotional well-being. Failing to detect a relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable does not mean the relation-ship does not exist; it just means the researcher was unable to detect it. After all, USAFA cadets, like all peo-ple, experience situational factors that could influence their levels of relax-ation, anger, and energy (e.g., academic responsibilities, required or voluntary exercise, interpersonal concerns, sleep deprivation, and so forth). This type of random error is omnipresent in research with human participants, so it does not invalidate our research. Nevertheless, in the spirit of good sci-ence, we do need to acknowledge that if MPT necklaces were to influence emotional well-being, it is possible that these extraneous influences could have hidden that effect. Those who believe in the power of externally located MPT might examine the tangible differences between our experiment and the Aoi et al. (2012) experiment. The MPT-treated sur-roundings surely contained greater amounts of MPT, but our necklaces were presumably in closer proximity to the participants' bodies. We assume that MPT proponents would agree that proximity must matter; otherwise MPT-treated necklaces would exhibit their alleged benefits whether worn or remaining unpurchased in a distri-bution center. The Aoi et al. trial oc-curred over five days, but the treatment was suspended during the day. Our trial lasted only two days but the treatment was generally continuous. The Aoi et al. experiment used twenty-four par-ticipants, whereas our experiment had forty-eight. Finally, Phiten adherents might be tempted to argue that we re-duced the MPT effect by covering the necklaces with tape. If so, we do not understand why masking tape and a lit-tle duct tape would reduce an effect that in the case of the Aoi et al. experiment somehow passes through rubber (or flooring material), air, and the exterior of the human body. In sum, we believe In sum, we believe that our classroom experiment provided a legitimate conceptual replication of the research provided by Aoi et al. Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 49that our classroom experiment provided a legitimate conceptual replication of the research provided by Aoi et al. This leads to a nagging question. Why would Aoi et al. (2012) obtain sig-nificant findings when we failed to do so? The Aoi et al. results might appear legitimate on the surface, but they can also be explained in another way. Aoi et al. point to improvements that were significant in the Titanium Condition but not in the Placebo Condition. This is improper because two effects can be similar even though one effect crosses the threshold of statistical significance whereas the other effect falls short of doing so. When the Aoi et al. results are examined with this in mind, one can see that there is no compelling evidence that participants in the Titanium Con-dition exhibited emotional well-being improvements above and beyond those in the Placebo Condition from the be-ginning to the end of the experiment. One final issue involves the amount of titanium that exists naturally. We are reluctant to develop this point be-cause we do not believe that externally located titanium in any form exerts an influence on well-being. We neverthe-less looked for titanium in four \"field\" samples obtained from Security Service Field in Colorado Springs, home of the Colorado Springs Sky Sox Triple A baseball team. We pulled samples from (a) the warning track, (b) the soil (with a little grass) in centerfield, (c) the infield mix approximately where the second baseman would stand, and (d) the pitcher's mound (see Figure 2). The head groundskeeper explained that each of these samples would have a fundamentally different composition. We conducted a variety of steps to dis-solve our four field samples. We then analyzed the resulting solutions for titanium using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. We used these processes to estimate the mass weight percent of the titanium for each sample (i.e., elemental titanium mass/total mass). The estimated tita-nium mass weight percents were as fol-lows: Centerfield = .000652%; Warning Track = .000242%; Pitcher's Mound = .0000907%; Second Base = .0000694%. (A detailed technical report is available upon request.) We asked Phiten for the mass weight percent of titanium in their necklaces, but they politely re-sponded that it was a corporate secret. The results demonstrate a remark- able irony. It seems that many baseball players are purchasing Phiten necklaces to receive the purported benefits of MPT when they are routinely performing, pre-sumably unbeknownst to them, on playing fields that contain titanium . Titanium might be perceived as rare because it is costly and associated with highly tech-nological products. Titanium is actually the ninth most-abundant element on the planet (Donachie Jr. 2000), mak-ing the Earth, conceptually speaking, a titanic ball of titanium. Titanium is so common in soil that researchers can examine titanium in animal feces to estimate soil ingestion. This procedure was used, for example, by researchers examining mule deer soil ingestion near Denver, Colorado (Arthur III and Alldredge 1979). This suggests that if titanium were to exert positive influences on emotional well-being as Phiten claims, it might be possible to gain those benefits by sleeping next to a sufficiently large bag of Colorado deer poop. Phiten fans could argue that the ti- tanium in soil or deer feces is different than the MPT provided in a Phiten necklace. We do not know what per-centage of titanium in our field sam-ples existed as elemental titanium (Ti), if any, or in a different form such as titanium dioxide (TiO2). Also, tita- nium, in any form, might not resemble the nanoscopic-sized particles Phiten claims go into their necklaces. Such arguments raise more puzzling ques-tions: Why would titanium dioxide work differently than titanium? Why do the titanium particles need to be nanoscopic? From our viewpoint, these questions, such as potential questions about proximity and the covering of necklaces with masking tape, are puz-zling because the relationship between externally located MPT and well-be-ing is theoretically vacuous and the evidence supporting this extraordinary claim remains unconvincing. The most straightforward answer, based on the existing evidence, is that titanium in any form, when located externally to the human body, does not exert any direct influence on personal well-being outside of more sensible explanations (e.g., a placebo effect). Conclusion Science and technology thrive on new ideas, and seemingly radical theories occasionally end up appearing to be true. We therefore do not take issue This suggests that if titanium were to exert positive influences on emotional well-being as Phiten claims, it might be possible to gain those benefits by sleep-ing next to a sufficiently large bag of Colorado deer poop. Figure 2. Coauthor Craig Foster and Security Ser- vice Field's head groundskeeper taking soil sam-ples from the field to test the amount of titanium occurring naturally in the soil.50 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirerwith peculiar claims. Our concern is that such claims should be supported by strong scientific evidence before consumers purchase corresponding products and journal editors publish corresponding research. A willingness to accept poorly substantiated claims can cause consumers to waste resources and scientists to waste valuable time. In this case, the externally located MPT theory is inconsistent with the known laws of physical science, the common natural presence of titanium, and now, the results associated with a classroom experiment that removed the potential placebo effect associated with Phiten necklaces. The claims surrounding MPT are at least, for the most part, benign. An MLB player taking a chance on a $20 necklace is not likely to cause any harm. Besides, the placebo effect might cause the necklaces to \"work\" due to their psychological power rather than their magical power. The obvious problem is that this type of pseudoscience can be genuinely harmful in other contexts. For many individuals, $20 is a consid-erable sum, and Phiten offers a variety of products that are far more expensive. Individuals frequently invest in simi-larly dubious products or services, such as faith healing or clairvoyance, which can cause physical, emotional, or finan-cial challenges. Thus, our classroom ex - periment should reinforce lessons that are broader than MPT. We hope that our cadets and others learn to be ef-fective in detecting scientifically ques-tionable claims, and they evaluate such claims with a healthy consideration for the existing evidence.

Note 1. The survey also included an open-ended item that provided cadets the option of writing a testimonial about how the necklaces made them feel. This item followed the three dependent variables. This item did not reveal any themes that were inconsistent with the quantitative results. Thus, we only used this item to help identify participants who reported having an illness during the experimental trial. References Aoi, W., T. Kamata, Y. Ishiura, et al. 2012.

Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 51Stick It In Your Ear! How Not To Do Science Ear acupuncture claims to relieve sore throats. A new study seeming to support that idea is so poorly done that it provides a textbook example of how to distinguish between good and bad science. HARRIET HALL Have a sore throat? No worries! No need for lozenges, medicines, or home remedies. All you need to do is let someone stick needles in your ear! According to a recent study, ear acupuncture relieves sore throats. Do you believe that? I don't. That's one of those extraordi- nary claims that would require extraordinary evidence, but the researchers didn't even provide ordinary evidence. The study is a great example of how not to do science. Acupuncture theory is based on a prescientific vitalistic concept: an un- measurable, undetectable energy called \"qi\" supposedly flows through meridi-ans and can be accessed at acupoints, where needle stimulation is supposed to somehow unblock the flow of qi, which is somehow supposed to relieve pain and improve health. Qi, meridians, and acupoints are imaginary, but that doesn't necessarily mean acupuncture can't possibly work. It's not implausi- ble that sticking needles into the skin might have some physiologic effects, so it is reasonable to do scientific stud-ies\u2014and thousands of studies have been done, some better than others. The results have been disappointing. It is not reasonable to conclude from the existing published studies that acu-puncture works. Some people believe acupuncture is an effective way to relieve pain, but the evidence from scientific studies and systematic reviews is mixed. Any posi- tive effects can be attributed to sugges-tion and the surrounding rituals, and the effects are too small in magnitude to have any clinical importance. The most rigorous studies have shown that sham acupuncture works just as well as \"real\" acupuncture. It doesn't matter where you put the needles, and in fact it doesn't matter whether you use needles at all. In one study, simply touching the skin surface with a toothpick worked just as well as penetrating the skin with a needle (Cherkin et al. 2009). There was even a study where subjects were given a \"phantom limb\" illusion that a rubber hand was their own hand, and they got similar results from acupunc-turing the rubber hand! (Chae et al. 2015). The main thing that seems to matter is whether the patients believe acupuncture will work. If they get a sham procedure but think they got the real thing, they will think it worked. If they get the real thing but think they got a sham procedure, they will think it didn't work. It has been pretty well established that acupuncture is nothing more than a theatrical placebo (Col-quhoun and Novella 2013). The Center for Inquiry issued a po- sition paper on acupuncture that con-cludes: It is becoming increasingly clear that the placebo effect accounts for much of the optimistic research on acupuncture published between the 1970s and 1990s. With the devel-opment of sham needles during the past decade\u2014needles which retract like stage knives\u2014researchers have since been able to more accurately assess the therapeutic effects of acupuncture. The result has been a complete unraveling of nearly all acupuncture claims. . . . The bulk of recent research strongly tends towards the hypothesis that acu-puncture's positive effects are mainly 52 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirerdue to a built-in expectation. . . . (Slack 2010) When The Medical Letter reviewed acupuncture in 2006, it concluded \"Acupuncture alone has not been shown in rigorous, duplicated studies to bene-fit any defined medical condition.\" Our own CSI fellow, Steven Novella, coau-thored the paper that concluded acu-puncture was nothing more than a the-atrical placebo (Colquhoun and Novella 2013). Medical ethicists unanimously agree that doctors should not prescribe placebos. So why are some doctors still recommending acupuncture? Unfortunately, there are many doc - tors who lack critical thinking skills and don't really understand science or the psychology of cognitive errors. They don't all read S I or the Science-Based Medicine blog. They should. The history of acupuncture research is revealing. There were never any con-trolled studies to verify the alleged loca-tion of meridians and acupoints or their alleged connections to other parts of the anatomy. They transposed human dia- grams onto animals without any testing for validity; the acupuncture diagram for horses, for example, shows gallblad-der meridians. Horses don't have gall-bladders. There are many different systems of acupuncture, some involving needles and some involving various kinds of stimulation of acupoints through in - tact skin (with electricity, light, heat, and other modalities). The number of meridians and acupoints varies among the different systems. In traditional acupuncture, there were originally 365 acupoints to symbolically correspond to the days of the year; now there are over 2,000. In Korean acupuncture, there are 300 acupoints, all on the hand. In other systems, they are found only on the ear, scalp, tongue, or foot. With all those different acupoints in all those different systems, is there any spot on the body that isn't an acupoint in some system? Yes, there is: no system uses points on the male genitalia. Draw your own conclusions! A variant called \"tong ren\" doesn't use acupoints at all; the patient rhythmically taps an acupuncture doll with a metal hammer. The online video of tong ren (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I4r3FrzFBc) has to be seen to be believed: Is there no limit to human gullibility? As far as I know, no one has ever thought to try testing one system of acupuncture against another to find out which one is superior. For that matter, no one has ever thought to test homeopathy, chiropractic, acu-puncture, and Reiki against each other. Alternative medicine simply doesn't think that way. Anything goes. The sore throat study didn't use tra- ditional acupuncture. It used ear acu - puncture\u2014and not even standard ear acupuncture but a simplified version. Why? Because the researchers were Air Force doctors, and the Air Force has been teaching ear acupuncture as \"battlefield acupuncture\" to its doctors under the guidance of Col. Richard Niemtzow. They clearly have drunk the Kool-Aid, because they allege that points on the ear correspond to areas on the body and stimulating them \"bal-ances the flow of the body's energy or qi.\" Their modified procedure involves five short needles that are left in place to eventually fall out on their own; the method is taught to non-acupuncturists in a four-hour workshop. The authors claim that there is research supporting ear acupuncture, but they admit that there is only \"limited data\" regarding the modified technique. You'd think that before they forged ahead to use it on wounded soldiers on the battlefield, they'd want convincing evidence that it worked. There isn't any. Ear acupuncture isn't as silly as tong ren, but it's still pretty silly. It was in - vented by a Frenchman, Dr. Paul No-gier, in 1957. He invented it all by him-self\u2014not through science but through intuition and epiphany. He looked at the external ear, the pinna, and imag-ined that it looked sort of like a fetus curled up in its mother's womb. I can tell you he had a much better imagina-tion than I do; I can't see the resem-blance. He arbitrarily assigned a spot on the ear to correspond to the part of the imagined fetus, tried inserting needles in ears, and confirmation bias kicked in to convince him that it worked on the corresponding part of the body. He originally used thirty points; now ear acupuncturists claim to have identified 120. The ear is pretty small to accom-modate 120 acupoints, and anyway there are no connections between the ear and those other parts of the body. The study, \"Ear Acupuncture for Acute Sore Throat: A Randomized Controlled Trial,\" (Moss and Craw-ford 2015) was published in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medi-cine. The fact that the editors did not reject the study is both surprising and disappointing. Moss and Crawford studied fif- ty-four patients who presented to an Air Force family medicine clinic with pain from sore throat. They were random-ized into two groups: one got standard treatment (ibuprofen, plus antibiotics when indicated); the other got standard treatment plus ear acupuncture. There was no blinding and no sham acupunc-ture control group. They didn't even standardize the treatment: they placed \"up to 10\" needles. Unblinded research associates assessed the results by phone interview. Patients in the acupuncture The Air Force doctors clearly have drunk the Kool-Aid, because they allege that points on the ear correspond to areas on the body and stimu-lating them \"balances the flow of the body's energy or qi.\" Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 53group reported significantly less pain at fifteen minutes and twenty-four hours after the procedure, although at for-ty-eight hours there was no difference from the control group. Acupuncture patients reported taking fewer ibupro-fen pills. There was no difference be-tween the groups in time missed from work. What's wrong with this study? Prac- tically everything. It is a typical exam-ple of the \"pragmatic trial\" favored by alternative medicine. Instead of asking whether acupuncture works better than placebo to relieve pain, they gave ev-eryone standard treatment and added acupuncture to one group. When you add anything to the usual treatment, you are practically guaranteed to get positive results. Patients respond to the extra attention and to suggestion. They expect to feel better, so they do. In this case, the needles were left in the ear as a continuing reminder that they had received special treatment. Pain is subjective, and suggestion is powerful; that's why we kiss our children's minor injuries. Of course the acupuncture sub- jects reported less pain; that's exactly what we could have predicted. Pragmatic studies test the real-world practical performance of treatments. They have their place. A treatment that has been proven to work in a research setting with a select group of subjects and carefully controlled methods might not work as well in a real-world setting with patients who might have other ill-nesses or be on other medications, or where the providers might not be as rigorous in following treatment guide-lines. Pragmatic studies can't establish whether a treatment works better than placebo, and they were never intended to be done on treatments that had not already been proven to work. That's why studies must have a convincing control group. These re-searchers could have used a sham acu-puncture control where they used re - tractable needles or put the needles in the \"wrong\" spots, in the ear or in other parts of the body. But they rejected the whole idea of a sham acupuncture control. Their amazing rationale: sham acupuncture can stimulate \"C\" fibers and produce analgesia too, so sham acupuncture wouldn't be a placebo, it would actually be a treatment! If that were true, it would mean that acu-puncture's whole treatment rigmarole is unnecessary. There would be no rea-son to specify acupoints: you might as well just stick needles anywhere, and no training would be needed to administer the treatment. The authors didn't even think of comparing a usual treatment group to an acupuncture group; both groups got the usual treatment. And why on Earth didn't they blind the re-search assistants who did the telephone interviews? That would have been so simple to do, and it would have elim-inated any suspicion that they might have subtly influenced the results in some way. They got positive results, but they would have gotten positive results if they had added any other intervention to the usual treatment for sore throat. What if they'd offered massages, or training in meditation or relaxation exercises, or a warm scarf to wrap around the neck, or therapeutic touch to \"balance their human energy fields,\" or funny movies to take their mind off the pain? Or even a gift certificate for a shopping spree at the local mall to boost their spirits? We can predict that those would have \"worked\" too, maybe equally well or better. That's why prag-matic studies such as this are useless. It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good. This study is astonishingly poor science. It should not have been done, and it should not have been published; it didn't give us any useful information about acupuncture. But it can serve as a bad example to help us learn to distinguish between good and bad science. I References Chae, Y., I.S. Lee, W.M. Jung, et al. 2015.

Francis S. Collins thinks not, but his \"evidence for belief\" disintegrates under scrutiny, revealing instead a personal testament of belief. MICHAEL J. REYNOLDS In a recent study funded by the John Templeton Founda- tion and published in the journal Public Understanding of Science, researchers found: Zoologist Richard Dawkins's [author of The God as a public intellectual . . . does not persuade new read-ers that science religion are in conflict, [while] . . . biolo-gist Francis Collins [author of The A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief] . . . could persuade audiences that science and faith can be compatible. (Fahy 2015, 5) How does Collins's assertion of compatibility stand up to scrutiny? Francis S. Collins's The Language of God offers a wealth of excellent science, but does the book do what it says on the cover and present \"evidence for be-lief?\" Or is Archbishop Desmond Tutu closer to the mark when he writes in his review, \"Francis Collins, eminent scientist, tells us why he is also a be-liever\"? In short, not \"evidence\" but a personal testimony of faith. Collins is careful to couch his concept of God in conjectural terms, but one is left in no doubt about what sort of deity lies at the heart of his belief. For Collins, it seems, the universe serves one primary purpose: to satisfy God's desire for personal fellowship with humankind. \"If God is the creator of the universe, if God had a specific plan for the ar-rival of humankind on the scene, and if He had a desire for personal fellowship with humans . . .\" (Collins 2007, 230). Collins, a prominent biologist (a Nobel laureate and director of the National Institutes of Health) and an evangelical Christian, accepts the cur-rent consensus concerning the age of the universe\u2014approximately fourteen billion years. So, if God created the universe in order that he might have fellowship with human beings, why didn't he cut to the chase? Current an- thropological evidence indicates that humankind, in its modern anatomical form, arrived on the scene no more than 200,000 years ago. Thus, for 99.998 percent of the life of the universe, Col-lins's God has had to do without his desired fellowship with human beings. \"The Moral Law still stands out for me as the strongest signpost to God\" (Collins 2007, 218), writes Collins after twenty-eight years as a believer. For Collins, this concept, deriving from the writings of Christian apologist C.S. Lewis, is key \"evidence for belief.\" Al-though Lewis was a man of significant accomplishments, the many arenas in which he made his reputation did not extend to science. Nor was Lewis with-out his critics. Philosopher John Bev-erslui writes in the introduction to his critique of Lewis's work: The apparent cogency of [Lewis's] arguments depends on his rhetoric rather than on his logic... Once his arguments are stripped of their pow-erful rhetorical content, their appar-ent cogency largely vanishes and their apparent persuasiveness largely evaporates. The reason is clear: it is not the logic, but the rhetoric that is doing most of the work. (Beversluis 2008, 20) Collins writes that \". . . the concept of right and wrong appears to be uni- versal among all members of the human species . . .\" and, \"it thus seems to be a phenomenon approaching that of a law, like the law of gravitation or of special relativity\" (Collins 2007, 22). To support this startling assertion, Collins offers an extensive quote from Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 55Lewis\u2014but little more\u2014asserting that a thorough reading of The Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics will find demon-strated a common acceptance, across a wide array of cultures and communi-ties, of what constitutes moral \"rights and wrongs\" (24). Thereafter, Collins treats the existence of the Moral Law pretty much as a given. The problem for the Moral Law is that differences in moralizations, across cultures and com-munities and over the course of human history, have been and are real. If Collins is right, however, it would seem reasonable to expect the exercise of the Moral Law to engage some spe-cific aspect or aspects of human physi-ology. The cerebrum\u2014the cerebral cor-tex with its various subdivisions\u2014is the most likely arena in which the Moral Law would play out. As Steven Pinker puts it, \"The neuroanatomy suggests that in Homo sapiens primitive impulses of rage, fear, and craving must contend with the cerebral restraints of prudence, moralization, and self-control\" (Pinker 2011, 502). Whether these \"restraints\" constitute the workings of Collins's Moral Law is open to question. Pinker goes on to describe the work of psy-chologist Adriane Raine: In one experiment, Raine com- pared the brains of prisoners who had committed an impulsive mur-der with those who had killed with premeditation. Only the impulsive murderers showed a malfunction in their orbital cortex, suggesting that the self-control implemented by this part of the brain is a major inhibitor of violence. (Pinker 2011, 505) In Raine's studies of the brains of prisoners convicted of premeditated murder, the lack of shrinkage in the orbital cortex would seem to indicate that these individuals may have turned a deaf ear to the Moral Law's prompt-ings, whereas, for the impulsive mur-derers, a malfunction in the orbital cortex would seem to indicate that they were denied full access to the Moral Law from the outset. Why would a \"loving, logical and consistent\" (Collins 2007, 177) god allow some individuals with whom he desires fellowship to suf-fer a deficiency the effects of which are likely to reduce or nullify access to the operations of the Moral Law by which the deity wishes them to be guided? In his chapter \"The Origins of the Universe,\" Collins sets out his argu- ments for God as the creator of the uni-verse, writing \"The Big Bang cries out for a divine explanation. It forces the conclusion that nature had a defined be-ginning. I cannot see how nature could have created itself. Only a supernatu-ral force that is outside space and time could have done that\" (67). In support of this view, Collins zeroes in on the \"fine-tuned universe\"\u2014the proposition that \"the existence of the universe as we know it rests upon a knife-edge of im-probability\" (73). The \"improbability\" derives from the fact that, according to cosmologists, there are six (Collins asserts fifteen) dimensionless physical constants that, if varied by infinitesimal amounts, would preclude the formation of our sort of universe. So how did the universe come to be \"fine-tuned\" as it is? Collins consid-ers three scenarios: 1) the existence of an infinite number of diverse, parallel universes giving rise to the likelihood of one like ours (the multiverse hypoth-esis); 2) pure, blind luck; and 3) the agency of a supernatural entity. Collins then goes on to assess the probability of each scenario. Collins dismisses Scenario 2 as the least plausible of the three, although, apart from stating that it is \"wildly improbable\" (Collins 2007, 74), he ad-vances no reasons for so doing. Scenario 1 he views as straining credulity (76). Not unexpectedly, he opts for Scenario 3: \"The Big Bang itself seems to point strongly toward a Creator, otherwise the question of what came before is left hanging in the air\" (77). This assertion prompts the question, \"What came be-fore the Creator?\" As implausible as Collins may find Scenario 2, according to renowned the-oretical physicist Lawrence Krauss: Given everything we know and every measure we made about the universe, it's plausible that the universe came from nothing: no time, no space, no particles and no radiation. A universe that did come from noth-ing, by known laws of physics and some reasonable extrapolations from them, would have the characteristics of our universe. (Nogueira 2015, 13) In concluding that \"the God hypothe- sis solves some of the deeply troubling questions about what came before the Big Bang, and why the universe seems to be so exquisitely tuned for us to be here\" (Collins 2007, 81), Collins goes a long way out on a limb with little or no evidential support. Collins goes on to marshal an array of scientific notables, quoting them in support of his God-hypothesis. For example, he quotes Arno Penzias: \"The best data we have are exactly what I would have pre-dicted had I nothing to go on but the five books of Moses, the Psalms, and the Bible as a whole\" (Collins 2007, 76). Collins's context implies Penzias's support for Scenario 3, i.e., that the universe is the work of a supernatural creator. Recourse to the full New York Times article tells a different story, however. In the interview, Penzias is discuss-ing whether the universe is \"open\" or \"closed.\" Given that Genesis describes a beginning for the universe but is silent on its ultimate fate, Penzias's remark clearly relates to the \"closed vs. open\" debate, and not at all to the matter of how the universe came into being in the first instance. The problem with Collins's use of this and other quotes is that the reader is left with the mistaken impression that Penzias and other scientists offer support for Collins's God-hypothesis\u2014support that, when the quotes are examined in context, ap-pears weak or nonexistent. When arguing for the possibility of The problem with Collins's use of this and other quotes isthat the reader is left with the mistakenimpression that Penzias and other scientists offer support for Collins'sGod-hypothesis.56 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirer 56 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirermiracles and defending his preference for the Creator Scenario, Collins puts forward illustrative parables: one his own\u2014the 52-Ace-of-Spades deck of cards (49); and one from philosopher John Leslie\u2014the firing squad that misses its target (77). The difficulty with such parables lies in the fact that the parable spinner can set the initial conditions so as to weight the parable in favor of a preferred conclusion. In both these instances, the initial condi-tions are set in such terms that the like-lihood of the outcome in each situation being due to chance appears highly im- probable, thus directing the reader to-ward the conclusion that the outcomes are a result of agency. Consider another parable (not of Collins's devising): A man is arrested for hiring a hit man to kill his neigh-bor's devoted wife. At his trial, he en-ters a plea of \"not guilty\" due to exten-uating circumstances. He tells the court that, over many years, he has watched his neighbor take the murdered woman more and more for granted. Day after day, he has seen her evident devotion to her husband go unacknowledged. He has spoken to the neighbor, but his interventions have been met with indifference. What better way, then, to bring the neighbor to a realization of how the poor woman's devotion has enhanced his life than to deprive him of her. Although the accused man admits to being aware of the shock, anguish, and pain that the neighbor might expe-rience as a result of his wife's murder, he tells the court that the contract-killing, undertaken as it was in the interest of teaching the neighbor a much-needed lesson, should be considered justifiable. Rare indeed would be the jury that would acquit on the grounds of such a defense, yet this scenario, in its essence, is what Collins advances to exculpate his deity in the light of a horrific cir-cumstance visited upon a member of his family. Commenting upon Collins's response to such a tragic personal event runs a serious risk of causing offense. Yet Collins himself uses this deeply regrettable incident to illustrate his an-swer to the question \"Why would a lov-ing God allow suffering in the world?\" (Collins 2007, 42) Collins distinguishes \"moral evil\"\u2014 that inflicted by mankind upon man-kind\u2014from \"physical evil\" (44)\u2014that which arises from natural phenomena beyond mankind's control. Collins at-tributes the \"moral evil\" to human be - ings, in the exercise of their free will, choosing to ignore the promptings of the Moral Law. Collins writes concern-ing \"physical evil\": \"If at the beginning of time God chose to use these forces [i.e., natural phenomena] to create human beings then the inevitability of these other painful consequences was also assured\" (45). As with the parable of the man who sought, through murder, to teach his neighbor a lesson, one is prompted to ask, could not an all-powerful god have found less drastic ways to lead his chil-dren to grace? Collins acknowledges the difficulty this conundrum poses but writes: \". . . if God is loving and wishes the best for us, then perhaps His plan is not our plan\" (Collins 2007, 45)\u2014a \"fudge\" behind which the evangeli-cal community retreats when circum-stances, moral or physical, visit suffer-ing upon the innocent. What of the suffering inflicted on mankind in the name of religion and morality? Collins's view can only be de-scribed as \"coy\"\u2014laying responsibility on the frailty of human beings\u2014those \"rusty containers\" into which is poured the \"pure, clean water of spiritual truth\" (40, 164). Historically, much of the re-ligiously inspired suffering visited upon mankind has arisen from conflicting interpretations of what constitutes the \"pure, clean water of spiritual truth.\" And what of Genesis 1: 26-27 \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness . . .\" and \" So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him . . .\"? No mention there of \"rusty containers.\" In his chapter \"Option 4: BioLo- gos,\" Collins sets out, in six stages, his preferred version of events from the big bang to the advent of Homo sapiens (200). Although it is generally known as Theistic Evolution (TE), Collins, finding the label unsatisfactory, re-christens the concept \"BioLogos.\" He writes, \"It [BioLogos] is intellectually rigorous; it provides answers to many otherwise puzzling questions and it allows science and faith to fortify each other like two unshakeable pillars hold-ing up a building called Truth\" (210). Stages 1 through 5 of Theistic Evo- lution/BioLogos more or less follow the path of the mainstream scientific consensus. Stage 6, however, makes a significant departure. Collins writes: 6. But humans are also unique in ways that defy evolutionary explana-tion and point to our spiritual nature. This includes the existence of the Moral Law (the knowledge of right and wrong) and the search for God that characterizes all human culture throughout history. (200) Collins rests this claim on two previ- ous arguments, only weakly established if at all. Collins's robust endorsement of Dar- winian evolution poses a conundrum for BioLogos, which Collins rather strains to address. The conundrum arises from the inherently \"random, potentially heartless and inefficient\" (Collins 2007, 204) na-ture of the evolutionary process. In the face of such randomness, what certainty could God have had that Homo sapiens's evolutionary pathway would not have been expunged by some random extinc-tion event? Collins holds that the solution to this conundrum is \"readily at hand,\" writing: \"If God is outside of nature, then He is outside of space and time. In that context, God could in the moment of creation of the universe also know every detail of the future.\" And, \"In that context, evolution could appear to us to be driven by chance, but from God's perspective the outcome would be entirely specified\" (205). But this \"solution\" opens up yet another co-What of the suffering inflicted on mankind in the name of religion and morality? Collins's view can only be described as \"coy\" \u2014laying responsibility on the frailty of human beings.Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 57nundrum. If Collins's deity is capable of knowing \"every detail of the future\" and the outcome of his creation is \"entirely specified,\" where then fits free will? It becomes hard to resist the conclu- sion that Collins's \"ready at hand\" solu-tion to the unpredictability of Darwinian evolution suggests that free will is little more than an illusion\u2014a sleight-of-hand practiced upon unwitting humankind by a Cosmological Trickster who, as Collins claims in an earlier chapter, knows \"in advance the thoughts and actions\" (87) of the creatures with whom he supposedly seeks fellowship. To account for the \"unique\" human attributes that BioLogos asserts \"defy evolutionary explanation,\" Collins turns to the biblical story of Adam and Eve. The scientist in him inclines Collins toward the view that Genesis 2, rather than being a literal render-ing of prehistoric events, is \"a symbolic allegory of the entrance of the human soul into a previously soulless animal kingdom\" (207). Collins apparently considers what he calls \"the entrance of the spiritual nature (the soul) and the Moral Law into humanity\" to have been a literal event that took place at some specific point along Homo sapi - ens's evolutionary journey. In support of this assertion, Collins turns again to C.S. Lewis. Lewis spins his own fanciful ren- dering of Genesis 2 with a casual nod in the direction of Darwinian evo-lution but climaxing thus: \"Then, in the fullness of time, God caused to descend upon this organism both on its psychology and physiology, a new kind of consciousness which could say 'I' and 'me' which could look upon it-self as an object\" (Collins 2007, 208). This reads suspiciously like the advent of self-recognition: a characteristic that may emerge in an organism once a given threshold of neurological com-plexity is crossed. Research using the Mirror Self-Recognition Test (MSR) suggests that, as well as humans, some elephants, dolphins, orcas, the Eur - asian magpie, and, of course, other great apes (the gorilla excepted) appear to have crossed this threshold. While this finding is not without controversy, and self-awareness may be weakly ex-pressed in other species, it would ap-pear that such a faculty might not be as unique to humans as Collins would have us believe. While this possibility has emerged since Lewis wrote, Lewis remains true to form in failing to ad-vance any supporting evidence for his whimsical suppositions. Collins acknowledges that \"BioLo- gos is not intended as a scientific the-ory. Its truth can be tested only by the spiritual logic of the heart, the mind, and the soul\" (204). One is led to won-der, therefore, what the concept\u2014and Collins's attendant arguments for it\u2014is doing in a book subtitled \"A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief.\" Collins writes: \"The theistic evo- lution perspective cannot, of course, prove that God is real, as no logical ar-gument can fully achieve that. Belief in God will always require a leap of faith\" (45). As a believer, Collins displays great grace in making this admission. In science, most paradigm-break- ing propositions require a leap of faith when initially advanced. The key word in Collins's admission about \"belief in God,\" however, is \"always.\" To science a belief that \"always requires a leap of faith\" is anathema. Science is about building structures of empirical evi-dence that inexorably reduce the leap required to reach belief. Francis S. Collins enjoys a well- earned and much-deserved reputation as a distinguished scientist and re-searcher. Further, he emerges from the pages of The Language of God as a thor-oughly decent, sincere, and compas-sionate individual. Regrettably, how - ever, his effort is unlikely to contribute greatly to his desire to bring about peace between the \"warring\" camps of faith and science. Despite his explicit intention to present \"evidence for be-lief,\" both Collins's God-hypothesis and his BioLogos (Stage 6) are, by his own admission, untestable hypotheses and cannot, therefore, be considered scientific. While applicable perhaps to faith, Collins's metaphor \". . . two unshake- able pillars holding up a building called Truth\" cannot not be applicable to sci-ence, as science does not seek \"Truth.\" Rather, science seeks, through occa-sionally giant but typically small, in-cremental steps to expand humankind's understanding of nature and its works; and, through empirical evidence, aug-ment confidence (but never certainty) in that understanding. It would not be unreasonable to view archaic attempts to understand and to define nature\u2014attempts most of which long predate scientific methodology (as imperfectly begun by Aristotle and his fellow Greeks)\u2014as \"hypotheses\" founded on observation and deduction valid for the time of their devising. Difficulties arise, however, when such \"hypotheses\" don the mantle of sanctity, rendering them impervious to any challenge from fresh observation and deduction. Where faith consistently rides to the defense of its \"hypotheses,\" science ever seeks opportunities to tear down its own edi-fices as new evidence emerges. One is left wishing that Collins had, from the outset, acknowledged that The Language of God is, in the end, a personal testament of faith to which he is fully entitled but which, with his claim that it presents \"evidence for belief,\" risks diminishing his standing in the eyes of much of the scientific community.

Reynolds, a Canadian living in Somerset in the United Kingdom, is an actor by profession and an avid reader of scientific and skepti- cal literature. His early life experiences gave him an intimate acquaintance with the evangelical mind-set. So just what is the nature of nature? Andrea Wulf's book is a spright ly scientific and personal biography of Alexander von Hum boldt, a sadly forgotten giant of the Enlightenment. He was a man who traveled widely, measured rigorously, partied hard, thought deeply, influenced almost ev-eryone, and stumbled onto a highly original and enduring way of thinking about that introductory question. Von Humboldt's story should ap- peal to skeptics and humanists firstly because it is intrinsically interesting. Wulf's book tells the absorbing tale of a major Enlightenment figure: someone who charmed artists and poets such as Goethe and Schiller; set an alpine ascent record; rubbed shoulders with political leaders Simon Bolivar, Napo-leon, and Thomas Jefferson; discovered an ocean current (and not even the one named after him!); collaborated with scientists such as Joseph Banks, Henry Cavendish, and Pierre-Simon Laplace; organized a global program for geomagnetic variations; lionized the literary salon's of Paris; and still had time to publish prolifically. Wulf's book is also fascinating for the story it tells about the early develop-ment of what today are loosely grouped into the \"earth sciences\"\u2014geology, bot-any, meteorology, oceanography, ecol-ogy, a \"von\" by birth\u2014he was ennobled later) lived a long, extraordinary life. Born in Berlin in 1769, he came of age in the artistic and diplomatic hurly-burly of the court of Prussia's Frederick the Great. From the bare facts of his story, it's apparent that the ambitions his mother and her society constructed for young Alex-ander weren't ones he shared. He was compelled to attend schools of account-ing and mining. He chose to wander his family's estate collecting and cataloging leaves and insects. Alexander's emancipation came with his mother's death. She passed, he inherited, and our suddenly wealthy young man's fancy turned to . . . a sci - entific expedition to South America! So he roamed over what is now Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Cuba for four years, with a side trip to Wash - ington to meet Thomas Jefferson just as Jefferson's Corps of Discovery departed St. Louis for all points west. Along the way he foraged the world's best collec-tion of South American plants and ani-mals, drew detailed and accurate maps, filled log books with meteorological measurements, acquired contempt for the institution of slavery, and developed his enormously insightful ideas about how all of nature's many and varied life-forms fit together. That's no small scientific break- through, though. Our original ques-tion, writ very large, is \"What is the nature of all of nature?\" Prior to the adventuresome Alexander, questions such as this in the West had been dis - missed with\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014reli - gious bromide or else sentimentality. The Greeks, of course, cared about what was what but their thinking im - bued the natural world with human values to the extent that books such as Plato's Timeas read like an extended indulgence in the naturalistic fallacy. The Universe was \"obviously\" good, \"obviously\" all designed and put there for the benefit of just one species. So \"obviously\" to study the natural world was to particularize each aspect of its goodness. Everywhere, human beings occupied the central position in nature. In China, botany was framed as an herbalist ques - tions about how plants contributed to human health, while zoology was all about animal husbandry. The Western mind was enthralled to the Bible's in- 58 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerThe Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World. By Andrea Wulf. Alfred A.

The Nature of 'Nature' PAUL BROWN [ REVIEWSSkeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 59junction to \"go forth and multiply\" and God's word that all of nature was there for us to name and to exploit. As Alex-ander began his scrabbling in the dust, mud, and blood, the dominant ratio - nalist model of how the world worked was Descartes's, who held that plants and animals were mere machines; each individual independent in its operation, each constructed of divisible sub-mech - anisms, each species unconnected to others. Alexander's new understanding of the natural world was so obvious, yet so profound, that it swept all that came before it aside. He inverted the human-centered view of nature and emphasized instead the interconnect-edness of organisms, species, and geog-raphy. Today, von Humboldt's holistic and integrated view of nature is thor-oughly conventional. His genius was to establish it as fact through careful ob-servation. Even the fundamental tenet of the conservation movement, some-thing we think of as very modern, was something von Humboldt established with his observations of rainfall, water levels, and soil fertility on colonial plan-tations. Human activity, von Humboldt determined, measurably changes the natural world. It was Alexander von Humboldt who first articulated self-evident ideas such as \"the web of life\" and \"climate,\" and pointed out that human beings are embedded within the natural world, for good or ill. Details about how, where, and why Alexander came to his revelation are well explained in Wulf's book, as is his extensive catalogue of lesser yet still scientifically important insights. For example, von Humboldt came up with the concept of the lines of equal barometric pressure (called isobars) and temperature (called isotherms) that today decorate nightly TV weather maps. Only in von Humboldt's fertile mind they see additional service as a means of organizing the entire globe into climate zones, which he saw as intertwined with the geographic dis-tribution of plants and animals, which in turn led him to a description of the world in terms of its biogeography. How influential was von Humboldt? It's telling that fully a third of Wulf's book is devoted to descriptions of what others made of his writing, not all of it scientific. Von Humboldt's new vision of nature had a certain moral and aes-thetic appeal, especially to generations born into the wilder landscape of the new world. The impact of von Hum-boldt's writings underlines how true it is that the past is another country. During the early nineteenth century, scientific advances had the potential to alter the way entire societies viewed their world. Much of what von Humboldt inspired was pretty inchoate, of course. For every John Muir, who opened his travel journals boldly \"asserting his place in Humboldt's cosmos\" and dedicated his life to protecting at least some of it from the impact of humanity, there's a Henry David Thoreau and the incoher-ent mysticism of his transcendentalism. Of special interest to many readers will be the extensive parallels between the lives and work of von Humboldt and Charles Darwin. Both were born into upper middle-class privilege. Each opted initially into an unsuitable occu-pation. Both lives were shaped by ex-peditions in and around South Amer-ica, where their assumptions about the placidity of the Earth and the benefi-cence of nature were upended by earth-quakes. Both made enormous (indeed, seminal) contributions in a broad va-riety of fields. Indeed, reading Hum-boldt today, it's possible that he came very close to an evolutionary explana-tion for the diversity of life. Many of his observations about bio geography pre-dated Wallace's. Darwin repeat-edly brought Humboldt's writing and scientific thought up in his diaries and cited him in his published works. Dar-win's famous \"tangled bank\" paragraph at the end of On the Origin of Species is a succinct reiteration of von Humboldt's core ideas. So why no evolutionary theory from Alexander von Humboldt? Wulf's book invites a reader's speculation. Was von Humboldt so much of a polymath, with his thought leaping from idea to idea, that his ability to bear down with inten-sity on any one problem was compro-mised? Did von Humboldt's gregarious and sociable nature embroil him in too many soirees, in contrast to Darwin's post-Beagle retreat into a rural, hearth-and-home-centered life? Or did von Humboldt's lifelong commitment to a tolerant deism and creationism blind him to deeper truths about the natural world implicit in his science? Our hero died in May 1859, aged ninety. He never had the chance to read Darwin's book, which was pub-lished in England in November of that year. This was a pity. What Andrea Wulf's remarkable book makes clear is how much Darwin owed this Prussian giant, and the intellectual relationship between them reminds us that sci-ence, like nature, is a \"tangled bank\" of interleaving observation and theory. Hopefully her book will help resurrect the reputation of Alexander von Hum-boldt, to whose singular efforts we owe so much of the wallpaper of how we think about the natural world and our place in it. n Paul Brown is a computer scientist spe-cializing in building data management programs for very large-scale science projects.

Then one day God spoke to him. He was in the throes of new love with the woman who is now his sec- ond wife, and he was so ecstatically happy he suddenly felt the need to give thanks in prayer. When he prayed for the third time and asked for guidance, a fountain appeared. Then a voice spoke. It sounded like his own voice. His wife was sitting next to him at the time, but she heard nothing and saw nothing. In other words, he experienced visual and auditory hallucinations. He kept hearing the voice. At first it gave him trivial commands like \"Don't eat yet\" or \"Sit in a different chair.\" This progressed to an ongoing dialogue in which the voice identified itself as God, directed him to read books about philosophy and religion, answered his questions, explained away apparent contradictions in the Bible and between different religions, and asked him to write God's autobiography. He ques-tioned whether the voice was divine, but he thought of Pascal's wager and made the conscious choice to believe. Eventually, he also talked to Jesus. Jesus first appeared to him as a nebu - lous image through the windshield of his car when he was stopped at a traffic light. At one point he asked Jesus if the crucifixion hurt. Jesus answered, \"Of course.\" One day Jesus appeared to him and kissed him on the lips; it was erotic, as if Jesus were making love to him. He worried about whether to tell his Jewish wife about his experiences with Jesus, but the voice said not to worry: \"Ab-igail is a special friend of mine. She understands me as few do.\" How very flattering! He is special because God talks to him, and he has a wife who is special too. At one point, Martin decided to contact Jesus's mother, Mary, to ask her advice about what present to give his wife for Valentine's Day. He prayed, and she spoke to him. Her presence was accompanied by fragrances and soft pastel lights and an intense feeling of love and joy. They had a conversation, but in his excitement he forgot to ask her about the present. He doesn't say whether he ever tried praying to her again. He ended up getting his gift ad-vice from a terrestrial friend. The voice consistently comes to him whenever he prays, and he converses with it without speaking out loud. The voice explains that God is not exactly omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevo-lent, or unchanging. It describes how God felt as he created (and was him - self created by) the big bang; he had no plans at that point. God is still primi-tive and undeveloped today (after four-teen billion years?) and he is still trying to learn \"how to be effective in bringing man forward.\" God is slowly evolving, and he suffers and needs people for companionship. He needs to be wor- shipped. Why? Because \"that is the ap-propriate response to Me.\" Reincarnation is true, Martin is told, but it's not what we think it is. Each of the different religions has part of the truth; each has insight into an aspect of God's nature. The voice has him read about Christianity, Judaism, Islam, polytheism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, ancient Egyptian be-liefs, ancient Chinese beliefs, and the Tao, as well as the works of many phi-losophers; and they have long, involved discussions about the details of what he has read. The voice tells him that there is to be a new project to develop a holistic world theology, fitting all the separate religious traditions together in a meaningful way. And guess who has been chosen to start on that project as soon as he finishes writing God's auto-biography? The voice tells him that his doubts about the voice's identity are only nat-ural but that he mustn't let doubts in-terfere with faith. He is confused by a number of apparently irreconcilable discrepancies; for instance, one time the voice tells him God loves all humans, and another time it tells him God only 60 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirer[ REVIEWS God: An Autobiography.

Edited by Michael Dylan Foster and Jeffrey A. Tolbert. Foster and Tolbert, both folklorists at Indiana State University, discuss the product created when popular culture appropri-ates or reinvents folkloric themes, characters, and images. \"Folkloresque,\" as described in the book, is \"popular culture's own (emic) perception and performance of folklore. That is, it refers to creative, often commercial products or texts that give the impression to the consumer that they derive directly from existing folkloric traditions\" (p. 5). Chapters include folkloric representations in a variety of popular culture media includ- ing video games (such as the ghost-themed Fatal Frame series), Neil Gaiman's books, films, comic books, anime, and even popular science writing, all of which commonly draw on basic folklore genres. With many paranormal subjects imbued with folklore (urban legends, ghost stories, UFO lore, etc.), this book provides insight into how folk-lore is used in these commercial and mass-market contexts.

Originally published in 1908, this book by pioneering Rus-sian neurologist, psychiatrist, and psychologist Vladimir Bekhterev reviews and explains the many conflicting posi-tions in the social and scientific thought concerning the na-ture and power of suggestion. He differentiates the process from persuasion and hypnosis and discusses suggestion and autosuggestion in the waking state, examining their ef-fectiveness on feeling, thought, and behavior. Perhaps the book's most relevant chapters to skeptics are \"Suggestion in the Hypnotic State\" (chapter 4), \"Collective or Mass Illusions and Hallucinations\" (chapter 10), and \"Witchcraft and Dev- il-Possession Epidemics\" (chapter 15). Though some sections of the book show undue credulity (toward telepathy, for instance, perhaps partly because the discussion is over a century old), the book provides an interesting look at the topic from an earlier perspective.

Laboratory research on human attention has often been conducted under conditions that bear little resemblance to the complexity of our everyday lives. Although this research has yielded interesting discover-ies, few scholars have truly connected these findings to nat-ural experiences. This book bridges the gap between labora-tory and life by bringing together cutting-edge research using traditional methodologies with research that focuses on at-tention in everyday contexts. Attention, of course, lies at the heart of eyewitness perception and reliability and is therefore an important factor in understanding the psychology of anomalous experiences and skeptical investigation. Heavily referenced, much of the book is technical and aimed at cognitive psychologists. Several chapters are of special interest to skeptics, including those on everyday visual attention, eyewitness memory, attention and misdirection, and the link between stress and attention. All chapters present their topics in the same overall format: historical context, current research, the possible integration of labora-tory and real-world approaches, future directions, and key and outstanding issues.

When he asks for clarifica- tion, the voice tells him not to get hung up on details, to stop thinking, and stop asking rational questions. It reminds him that he already believes in things he can't see. He believes that other people have minds, so he argues it is just as reasonable to believe that God exists. It struck me as strange that Martin's interactions with the voice were inter-rupted at least twice. He stopped praying for a year when he was ill and again for six months when some of the voice's ideas began to distress him. I also found it in-teresting that the voice was not politically correct; it used \"man\" in the older sense inclusive of men and women. The language Martin uses often sounds vague, mystical, Deepak-Chopra-ish and New Agey, and sometimes even incoher-ent. Just a few examples: \"Being facing Being, not necessarily speaking but simply facing, is what personhood is.\" Gravity is a kind of love. The universe is one great act of love. Subjectivity desires to objectify itself. God says, through Martin, that some diseases have a spiritual cause, and virtu-ally all diseases have a mental or spiritual component that can be healed with the right relation to God. Miracles happen all the time. They are dismissed because they are outside the scientific paradigm, even when there are reputable witnesses. They happen within the laws of nature; we just don't yet understand those laws. The voice tells him it's possible to talk to the dead, and he is impressed when his dead brother appears to him in a dream to apologize for the suffering his death caused. I'm not clear on when the dead stay around to talk to the living rather than being immedi-ately recycled into reincarnations. Martin's story can help us better under- stand the psychology of religious prophets throughout history. What it can't do is establish that God is real or that Martin actually had conversations with him. He admits to a fear that he is just somehow making all this up, but he chooses to ig-nore that possibility and just believe. NEW AND NOTABLE] Listing does not preclude future review.62 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical Inquirer[ REVIEWS The book is just what you might expect from a highly intelligent be- liever who was raised as a Christian and trained to argue as a philosopher. It is a tour de force of imagination and rationalization. His experiences require no supernatural explanations; we know enough about neurology and psychology to have at least a gen-eral understanding of how a person can hallucinate, deceive himself, and succumb to an elaborate delusion. There is no reason to attribute to God the words that could very well have come from Martin's own brain. Hallucinations are not necessarily a sign of mental illness; Oliver Sacks wrote a whole book about that. Hal-lucinations can be very convincing and very powerful. They have led people to commit crimes and even kill their own children. How could anyone ever know for sure that they were hearing a true message from God rather than a hallucination produced by their own brain? I don't think the individ-ual has any reliable way to tell. But others can use critical thinking skills to reject stories such as Martin's for lack of evidence. The human brain is inexhaustibly inventive, and there have always been people able to fool themselves into believing six im-possible things before breakfast just like Lewis Carroll's White Queen in Through the Looking Glass. Hallucination or divine revela- tion? I think hallucination is much more likely. And I don't think there is any evidence that would prove me wrong. n Harriet Hall, MD, a retired physician and Air Force flight surgeon, writes and educates about pseudoscientific and so-called alternative medicine.

LILIENFELD The Confidence Game: Why We Fall for It...Every Time. By Maria Konnikova. York: Viking, 2016. ISBN: 978-0525427414. 352 pp. Hardcover, $28. We're all suckers. Well, to be more precise, we're all suckers at least some of the time. Research con- ducted in 1996 by social psychologist Bella DePaulo, then at the University of Virginia, demonstrates that decep-tion is part-and-parcel of everyday life. She asked participants to keep a diary of their fibs and discovered that most people lie about twice a day; they lie in about one-fifth of brief interpersonal interactions (of course, one might be tempted to ask whether some of them were lying about their lying, but that's another matter). No wonder the English language con-tains an estimated 112 words refer-ring to lies or variants thereof: bluff, deceit, deception, exaggeration, fib, fiction, jive, mendacity, misrepre-sentation, prevarication, spin, untruth, whopper, and so on. We lie, and lie frequently, for two prime reasons. First, we lie because we have something to hide, some - thing to gain, or someone to impress. Second, we believe that we can get away with it. This belief is usually justified. Classic laboratory research by University of California, San Fran - cisco, psychologist Paul Ekman in - dicates that most of us don't perform much better than chance at detecting falsehoods, even though we're sure we do. Other research shows that we are often sorely mistaken about potential cues to lying. For example, surveys of laypersons suggest that most people regard shifty eyes as a bellwether of dishonesty, even though research indi - cates that this cue is well-nigh useless as a deception indicator (psychopaths, for example, tend to stare their vic - tims straight in the eyes while duping them). As a consequence, pathological liars can run roughshod over the rest of us. Of course, most lies are innocu - ous, as when we tell our friend that we adore his hideously ugly new haircut. But some lies can lead us to fall prey to dangerous fads, even blatant pseu - doscience. In her engaging and eminently readable new book, The Confidence Game: Why We Fall for It Every Time, New Yorker magazine science journalist Maria Konnikova explores the science underlying one particularly malignant species of lie: the con. As she reminds us, the term con is short for confidence, and probably originated in 1849 during the New York City trial of William Thompson, who became the prototype of the con artist in film and literature (Herman Melville apparently modeled the central character in his 1857 novel Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 63The Confidence-Man after Thompson). The charming Thompson would rou-tinely approach passersby in Manhat-tan and unnerve them with a request: \"Have you confidence in me to trust me with your watch (or ten dollars, or whatever) until tomorrow?\" Many strangers, taken aback by Thompson's earnestness and prepossessing nature, would part ways with their possessions, only never to see them\u2014or Thomp-son\u2014again. Konnikova's book should be of in- terest to readers of the S I- for one key reason: gullibility can be dangerous, even disastrous. In several chapters, Konnikova describes the brazen exploits of fortune-tellers and other psychics who capitalize on the good will of vulnerable victims to deprive them of their hopes and re-sources. In Chapter 2 (\"The Put-Up\"), she tells the tale of Debra Saalfield, a professional dancer and dance instruc-tor who sought out a psychic, Sylvia Mitchell, in Greenwich Village after losing her job and boyfriend in a matter of two days. Desperate to understand what befell her and why, Saalfield un-derwent a palm-reading, costing her $1,000. Soon after, Mitchell persuaded Saalfield that she had been a beautiful and rich Egyptian princess in a previ-ous life, accounting for her excessive materialism in her present life. To con-quer her undue attachment to money, Mitchell informed her, Saalfield would need to deposit $27,000 into Mitchell's bank account. She could of course have the money back whenever she wanted, but it would be a good psychological exercise nonetheless. In a moment of weakness, Saalfield went along with the scheme, even though she could barely afford it. When she returned to New York City to reclaim her money, Mitchell was nowhere to be found, and her repeated calls to Mitchell went un-answered. Elsewhere, Konnikova offers a brief history of mysticism and efforts to de-bunk it, introducing us to Harry Hou-dini's skeptical exploits and James Ran-di's famous psychic financial challenge. In many respects, her book is a mani-festo for skepticism in everyday life and a cautionary tale regarding the perils of excessive trust. It is also something of a \"how to\" instructional manual on how to fool others\u2014and how to avoid being fooled. In other chapters, Konnikova takes us on a tour of the techniques of con artists, linking their tricks of the trade to well-established psychological tools of persuasion. Among other methods, she describes the well-known \"foot-in-the door\" technique, whereby we are more likely to agree to a large request after agreeing to a small one, and the \"mere exposure effect,\" whereby we prefer stimuli that we've experienced many times to those that are novel. She also recounts a variety of well-es-tablished pitfalls in thinking, such as confirmation bias (the tendency to seek out information that supports our beliefs and to ignore or distort the in-formation that doesn't) and positivity bias (the tendency to assume that our futures will turn out well), that pre-dispose most or all of us to fall prey to scams from time to time. Needless to say, both biases\u2014and a host of others discussed in the book\u2014can lead people desperate for simple answers to com-plex life problems to embrace astrolo-gers, fortune-tellers, and other peddlers of the paranormal. Each chapter follows a similar tem- plate. It begins with a remarkable and often disconcerting case of a real-world swindle and then uses the case to illus-trate distinct components of the con. Although the narrative eventually be - comes slightly repetitive (toward the end of the book, I had a difficult time keeping all the villains straight, because their modus operandi all bore a strong family resemblance), it lends the book a powerful coherence. The result is a vivid portrait of how con artists ply their trade. At the same time, the book is marked by a few noteworthy omis-sions. First, in her discussion of psy-chics in particular, Konnikova focuses almost exclusively on scam artists. To be sure, the world is chock full of bla-tantly dishonest fortune-tellers, crystal ball readers, and tarot card readers. Yet Konnikova accords short shrift to the possibility that many purveyors of the paranormal are sincerely self-deceived. The Peter Popoffs of the world may be a distinct minority. Behaviorists have long recognized that a great deal of our psychological repertoire is acquired by means of progressive \"shaping\" of be-haviors using repeated reinforcement. Many psychics have surely learned that their tried-and-true techniques of cold reading \"work\" in that they persuade customers that they have remarkable capacities of insight and precognition. After a while, the psychics themselves may become convinced too. An in-triguing hypothesis that has yet to be adequately explored is that self-de- ceived psychics may actually be more persuasive than outright charlatans, because they are genuinely convinced of their extrasensory powers. Second, Konnikova's focus is over- whelmingly on the psychology of the victims, rather than the perpetrators, of swindles. In an early chapter, she touches briefly on the scientific litera-ture concerning psychopathic personal-ity (psychopathy), a condition marked by extreme dishonesty and shallowness of conscience. Nevertheless, her cover-age is rather superficial and, like many Behaviorists have long recognized that a great deal of our psychological repertoire is acquired by means of progressive \"shaping\" of behaviors using repeated reinforcement.64 Volume 40 Issue 3 | Skeptical InquirerPolygraphs as Junk Science Dr. Morton Tavel has done the scientific community a great service with his highly readable review of polygraph junk science (January/February 2016). I'd like to add three observations. First, neither law enforce- ment nor national security agencies have shared even their very old data that might pro-vide some insight into the actual utility of the polygraph. After millions of tests in both crimi-nal and employment-screening settings, there surely is enough information to inform on the polygraph's sensitivity and spec-ificity. Taxpayers have shelled out billions of dollars to pay for polygraph tests, and researchers ought to have access to that data. Perhaps it is easy to surmise why these agencies haven't released any of it. Second, fine civil servants lose their security clearances and thus their careers every year to the vagaries of \"the box.\" I get several calls a year from high-ranking federal govern-ment employees who have failed their polygraphs and are looking to redress the horrific personal impacts (let alone the waste in discarding of experienced in-dividuals). I know of no case where a security clearance was restored once lost to the stochas-tic judgment of polygraphers. Finally, it is striking that even at the DOE national laboratories scientific evidence impacted the behavior of senior administrators not at all. When I aided a fellow scientist threatened with un-employment after a failed poly - graph, my supervisor (obviously at the behest of the then-Sandia president) forced me out of my job. My father taught me that you can't reason someone out of a position they haven't been rea-soned into in the first place. In the case of Sandia's manager-sci-entists, they manifested no rea-son a priori. Only the political interventions of then-Senators Domenici and Bingaman led to a dramatic reduction in poly-graph testing. Alan P. Zelicoff, MD Professor of Environmental and Occupational Health and Epidemiology, Institute for BiosecurityCollege for Public Health and Social JusticeSt. Louis UniversitySt. Louis, Missouri The Science of Meaning Tsipursky asks in \"The Science of Meaning\" (January/February 2016), can one create a personal and rich sense of purpose in life without belonging to a faith-based community? For me, the most profound answer to the questions \"What is the meaning of life? Why are we here?\" did indeed come from a faith-based community, but not of the kind you'd expect! Matthew Inman, creator of the Internet comic series \"The Oatmeal,\" wrote a semi-auto-biographical book The Terrible and Wonderful Reasons Why I Run Long Distances. In one panel of cartoons, Inman recounts a training run in the bamboo for-ests of Japan, where he is hunted by deadly giant hornets, dehy-drated from running without water (eventually quenched with a vending machine purple sports drink), and driven to hypother-mia by a sudden weather change from hot and humid to dark with violent lightening. During this run, Inman finds the an-swer to the questions \"Why am I alive? Why am I here? What's the point of me?\": \"Forget the why. You are in a raging forest full of beauty and agony and magical grapey bev-erages and lightning storms and demon bees. This is better than the why.\" Welcome to the Church of the Ultramarathon! Paul Drumheller Flagstaff, Arizona I found Gleb Tsipursky's article on the importance of finding \"meaning and purpose\" in life lacking in insight. I regard at-taining meaning and purpose solely as a means to an end based on reason, tolerance, and com - passion, and not, as Tsipursky implies, as an end in itself. There are all too many examples of people throughout history who authors, she treats psychopathy as a largely monolithic condition. As a con-sequence, she misses the opportunity to discuss recent research suggesting that psychopathy, rather than being a uniform entity, is a paradoxical config-uration of diverse attributes comprising superficial charm, poise, and affability on the one hand and guiltlessness, cal-lousness, and poor impulse control on the other. The psychopath is thus a hybrid creature, appealing on the out-side yet malevolent on the inside. This deceptive cocktail of traits is precisely what makes the prototypical psycho-path such an effective con artist. He or she is the human equivalent of the Venus flytrap. There are also a few major slip-ups with respect to the history of psycholog-ical thinking. Konnikova describes Will-helm Wundt as \"one of the founders of the Gestalt movement\" in psychology when in fact Wundt was a structuralist, not a Gestaltist. (If anything, the Ge-stalt movement originated in response to Wundt's emphasis on decomposing human experience into basic elements.) In addition, she contends that early be-haviorists, such as John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner, maintained that behavior \"could largely be accounted for by almost purely cognitive reactions to discrete, identifiable environmental stimuli.\" This could hardly be further from the truth. Watson disowned thinking entirely and Skinner, while not denying the existence of cognitive reactions, viewed them as nothing more than covert behaviors. These criticisms aside, The Confi-dence Game is a great read. It is an eye-opening and fascinating glimpse into a dark underworld that most of us only dimly grasp. Skeptics will appre - ciate the book's penetrating analysis of the psychology of the trickster and of the hazards of maladaptive gullibility. And I'm not pulling one over on you\u2014really.

[ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Skeptical Inquirer | May/June 2016 65have found meaning and purpose through abhorrent theocratic and secular ideologies. Think of the exultant homicidal members of the Khmer Rouge, ISIS, and Boko Haram, the populations who cheerfully embraced Na-tional Socialism and Fascism, and the clerics of the Inquisi-tion, to cite just a few examples. Should we envy them for having found \"meaning and purpose\"? In a world being ravaged by war, climate change, superstition, and overpopulation, we need people whose meaning and purpose in life consists of recognizing, con-fronting, and solving these crit-ical issues. Dennis Middlebrooks Brooklyn, New York Gleb Tsipursky responds: I agree with Dennis Middlebrooks that it would be wonderful if peo-ple found their meaning and pur-pose in dealing with war, climate change, superstition, and overpop-ulation. However, this article sim-ply looked at the science of meaning and purpose and conveyed what the science suggested. While we may wish for science to provide us with the kind of answer we desire, this is not what the research sug-gests. When we talk about science, we need to be vigilant about stick-ing only to the answers provided by the science. Scientific Knowledge Charles S. Reichardt wrote an informative and pertinent scien-tific article \"Trends in Scientific Knowledge, Edu cation, and Re- ligion,\" in the January/February 2016 issue. I have been an ER doctor for thiry-five years, and I'm no astronomer; Dr. Reichardt says, \"Educational attainment in America has increased ... knowl-edge of many standard scientific facts has not.\" Truthfully yet ironically, he then goes on to expose our more scientifically ignorant Americans as \"unaware of the fundamental Copernican reality that the Earth rotates around the sun . . . etc.\" I and many others know that the Earth revolves around the Sun, not rotates. The Earth ro-tates on its axis. Perhaps this can be forgiven of a psychologist, but I would hope that this fundamental error would be discovered and reme-died prior to publication. That would be best for your journal's credibility, and our cause. Steve Mimnaugh mims_84093@yahoo.com Charles Reichardt replies: The common-place, dictionary definition of \"rotate\" fits perfectly well, it seems to me (with \"re-volve\" listed as a synonym), al-though I believe the letter writer is correct that \"revolve\" is the more common usage among astronomers. It certainly would have been wiser of me to have used \"revolve,\" but I'm not sure \"rotate\" counts as a literal error. Whatever one might think about the state of scientific knowledge among our general population, the state of religious literacy is much worse. After all, children have had up to twelve years of science lessons using textbooks approved by some panel of sci-ence readers. Churches have en-ergetically refused to teach any historical-critical information about the scriptures or church history, and have often blocked such teaching from taking place in our public schools. I propose that in giving sur- vey exams at the level of the fol- lowing would result in massive numbers of wrong choices: Jesus was a: (a) Christian, (b) Pharisee, (c) Jew, (d) Ebionite Islam is divided into two main socio-cultural groups, the Sunni and the: (a) Sufi, (b) Alevi, (c) Druze, (d) Shia. Sharon Scholl Atlantic Beach, Florida Negative Evidence Just a quibble about Joe Nickell and James McGaha's excellent article \"The Search for Negative Evidence\" (November/Decem-ber 2015): Although the use of negative evidence is disparaged throughout the article, there is little mention of what positive evidence might look like. It is not until the first paragraph of the conclusion that it is implied that an \"actual flying saucer or extraterrestrial pilot\" would con-stitute positive evidence of extra-terrestrial beings having visited Earth. But would it? You would still need to somehow show that the object did in fact have ex-traterrestrial origins. Since the characteristics of extraterrestrial spaceships are unknown, you cannot test the object against any known properties. The only procedure we can use in trying to determine the likely origin of the object would be to test it against hypotheses of all known terrestrial origins. It's only neg- ative evidence, but it's the only type of evidence at our disposal when we try to validate a hitherto unknown phenomenon. The criticism against support- ers of UFOs and other such \"un- explained\" phenomena should not be that they tend to use nega - tive evidence to try to prove their existence. It's that the quality of that evidence is so poor. When you rely on unsubstantiated and conflicting accounts, it's rela-tively easy to dismiss all known rational explanations for a partic-ular phenomenon and conclude that it's unexplainable and there-fore of unearthly origin. The conclusion that is based on such evidence is extremely weak to the point of being entirely dismissi-ble. But it's not simply because negative evidence was used\u2014it's because it was bad negative evi - dence. Tom Gasbarro Brooklyn, New York Joe Nickell and James McGaha respond: We thank Tom Gasbarro for his compliment even though he goes on to suggest our entire concern was misplaced. We did not wish only to discuss evidence that is \"bad\" (a smudged fingerprint for instance) but to provide much-needed insight into how paranormal claimants oper-ate. We insisted on pointing out the qualitative differences between the scientific approach and para- normalists' reliance on \"evidence\" that is essentially nonexistent, non-verifiable, non-testable, and non-admissible. Not only that, but it is used to promote the para-normal by suggesting (in a mys-tery-mongering way) that because something is unexplained it must therefore be paranormal (the illogic of an \"argument from ignorance\"). We wisely avoided the snare of trying to say what positive evi-dence would look like, since para-normal claims are widely diverse, variously defined, and rife with imagination and even fantasy. We note that Mr. Gasbarro, more sympathetic to the plight of para-normalists than we, also has diffi-culty trying to offer a simple guide to authenticating unknowns. We are confident that if, for example, an alien spacecraft or bigfoot carcass actually presents itself for examination, scientists will be able to verify its authentic - ity. (Some miracle claims, alleged spontaneous human combustion cases, and others are more problem-atic.) Meanwhile, proponents not only have \" bad\" evidence, but they attempt to make negative evidence seem positive, and they attempt to switch the burden of proof. We wanted to expose this pseudoscien - tific approach for what it is. [FEEDBACK The letters column is a forum on mat ters raised in previous issues. Letters should be no longer than 225 words.
