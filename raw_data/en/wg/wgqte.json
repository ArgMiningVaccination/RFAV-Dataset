NCH Hospital Visitation Policy PATIENT VISITING GUIDELINES The following guidelines are intended to be flexible in order to respond to the diverse, individual needs and preferences of each patient and unanticipated and unique circumstances, as well as to assure the safety of patients, families and staff. - Daytime visitation hours vary per unit specific guidelines. Evening and nighttime hours are generally limited to promote rest and healing of patients. Therefore, typical visiting hours are limited to 8:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m. Exceptions to posted visitation hours are encouraged; examples, for compassionate or end of life care, patient safety, medical or psychological well-being which may arise from change of environment or emotional distress and in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) when family/partner in care is needed for support of a medical or physical impairment. The individual department director is responsible for ensuring staff adhere to the visitation guidelines. - All hospital staff and clinicians encourage families and other partners in care to be involved and supportive of the patient according to patient preference. They recognize that families are integral to patient safety, comfort, medical and psychological well-being and the healing process. In-person visitation of family members supports patients in making major medical decisions, adjusting to change of environment, providing comfort during times of emotional distress, encouragement to participate in daily activities such as eating and drinking. - At the beginning of an ambulatory care experience, inpatient stay, or emergency room visit, patients are asked to discuss their \"family\" and other \"partners-in-care\" and how they will be involved in care and decision-making. They may also inquire whether a patient has a designated representative, such as a power of attorney for health care or a health care proxy. Coronavirus Florida Department of Health Hotline COVID Update Due to the recent decline of COVID cases and positivity rate, NCH will report COVID statistics as needed. COVID Information Vaccine Resources - Patients may modify their preferences during their hospital experience. - Patients and their families are encouraged to designate a family spokesperson to facilitate effective communication among extended family members and hospital staff. - The health care team can ask to reevaluate or modify the presence and participation of families and care partners based on the clinical needs of the patient. Nurses and other team members provide guidance to patients, families and other partners in care about: - Infection control guidelines and personal protective equipment; - Timing and frequency of in-person visits (of at least two hours daily) based on hospital activities and individual patient needs; - How to partner for patient's safety during hospital stay and transition to home and community care; - How to honor privacy of other patients and families in close proximity or who share the same patient room. - The number of people welcomed at the bedside at any one time will be determined in collaboration with the patient and family. In situations where there are shared rooms, this negotiation may include the other patient, his or her family, and other partners-in-care. - Children supervised by an adult are welcomed. Clinical concerns may require limits based on age. Children are expected to remain with the adult who is supervising them. Children's behavior is monitored to ensure a safe and restful environment for the patient(s) and a positive and developmentally appropriate experience - Disruptive behavior and unsafe practices are not acceptable; these situations, while usually rare, will be addressed directly and promptly by a member of the NCH team. - All partners-in-care, and any guest of a patient, must be free of communicable diseases and must respect the hospital's infection control policies. - If an outbreak of infection requires some restrictions for public health, the staff will collaborate with the patient and family to support the patient in alternative or modified visiting. Visitors are typically required to follow the same reasonable infection prevention requirements/restrictions as staff.
