I always prefer to see patients prior to vaccination to be able to help address their particular constitutional needs , so this guide is me ant only as a sta rting point. This guide is me ant to cover the general measures I'd recommend for (almost) all patients. These remedies are g enerally safe, but anyone with a chronic illness , or a need for a daily medication , should check with a holistic health provider before starting . Clicking on any remedy will show you where to get it online. Before the vaccination Diet-particularly in the week before and after the vaccination, it is best to eat the healthiest possible diet. Many books have been written on that subject so I can't do it justice here. Most important is minimal processed food (especially sugar), minimal red meat, and as organic as possible. Burdock -1 drop per year of age, maximum 10 drops. Take this for a month before and a month after the vaccination. This should not be taken if pregnant (breastfeeding is ok). The best source is Avena Botanicals, which is in most Maine health food stores and online. Astragalus , \u00bd drop per year of age, maximum 5 drops. Take this for a month before and a month after the vaccination. Skip the day of vaccination and t wo days after. If they have an y reaction, hold this until they are feeling better. This should not be taken during any active illness. The best source here is also Avena Botanicals. Thuja Thymus , \u00bd drop p er year of age, maximum 5 drops. Take this the day of a vaccine, and for a week after. This must be ordered online from Uriel Pharmacy and you need set up a (free) account with them for the above link to work. During the Vaccination Calm -The most important thing during a vaccination is to keep a calm atmosphere. This allows the child to take the vaccine in as medicine and also allows for a better -balanced immune response to the vaccine. The tricky issue here is that most children will cue their stress from their parents, and it is hard not to be stressed if you child is getting a vaccine against your wishes. I am hap py to help discuss this in detail in a visit, but generally I would recommend parents try doing some meditation. This meditation should include some visualizations of your child as strong and healthy and easily able to manage the stress of an immunization . Another strategy is to have the parent most comfortable with vaccines accompany the child to their appointment. 5-Flower Formula -2 drops under the tongue . If, despite your best efforts, you or your child feel at all panicky, this is a great remedy to have on hand. It can be given as often as every 5 minutes in acute stress. This is less helpful for a general background anxiety so please talk to me if th at is a concern .

After the Vaccination Rest -Treat your child as if they're a little sick, because that is exactly how their body is ex periencing a vaccine . Plan to stay home and have a quiet day for the day after a vaccine. For this reason, planning for a Friday afternoon vaccination can be a good choice. If your child has lots of energy you don't need to force rest, but it can be good to plan so me quiet activities (reading, board games, cooking). Avoiding screens is also a must. Foot rub -After a vaccine, children can feel uncomfortable in their bodies, and a foot rub is a great way to keep them comfortable. Keeping this comfort helps the body a nd mind working together . Reactions -It is especially important to avoid unnecessary medications at this time (fever reducers, antibiotics etc) as this increases the load of toxins. Generally, I would ask a patient to call me if their child is having a rea ction, but some mild irritability and fever can be treated with Apis Belladonna (from Uriel Pharmacy) 1 pellet per year of age, 3 times daily. I will have additional remedies o n hand if further treatment is needed. Next Vaccine Before getting the next vaccine, please observe your child and come to me with any concerns. If they've felt out of sorts since getting the previous vaccine, it may be worth delaying the next one. On th e other hand, immune challenges can also make kids feel stronger in their bodies, so the changes may also be positive. Big Picture I also want parents to feel confident going through this process. All the good work you do in giving your child a healthy li festyle will pay off in their resilience to stress like this.
