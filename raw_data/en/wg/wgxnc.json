Course Information Quest 2 IDS2935 -2PF1 ] Fall 2022 Meeting MWF : 4 Location: MCAA and on -UF Zoom via Canvas for some group project activities General Education Designation: [ Physical Sciences , Diversity ] * A minimum grade of C is required for general education credit This class is scheduled as a face -to-face course. I will utilize Zoom during each class lecture period so that if you are out of class because of being withheld from campus, i.e.; due to an active COVID -19 infection or have been exposed you can participate without missing the lecture. Our class sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer and for enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un -mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the \"chat\" feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live. The chat will not be recorded or shared. As in all courses, unauthorized recording and unauthorized sharing of recorded materials is prohibited. Instructor Gail E Fanucci - fanucci@chem.ufl.edu ; and Canvas email Office location: 311F Chemistry Lab Building (CLB) Office hours: TBD (and by appointment) Phone: (352) 352 -219-5201 2 Teaching Assistant : Alle Wolfer , contact and office hours TBD Course Description This cross -disciplinary Quest 2 course examines \"Why Chemistry Matters\" through analysis and discussion of topics (e.g. agriculture, materials, energy, medicine, human health, nature and the environment) represented in two popular public -facing science novels \"The Disappearing Spoon\" and \"Napoleon's Buttons\" - all focused on aspects of chemical innovations used to tackle problems in society in the past. The course extends these examples to social and poli tical problems of today and the future; asking \"How can novel approaches/innovations in chemistry help alleviate or answer current and arising challenges in our world today , such as our food supply and pollution, novel medicines to combat resistance and ad diction, and our water supply and the built environment ?\", and \"How has chemical innovation been motivated by and impacted diverse groups of people ?\" The answers to these questions will also reveal to students how perv asive chemistry is in their daily live s. One can say, \"It is everywhere!\" The course is designed in a modular format with three -hour periods each week. Typically, t he first session of each module will be used to explain the chemical concepts and principals required to have a deep understanding of the p rocesses and products that humans have used in diverse groups of people throughout history related to that module's topic (medicine, toxins, pollution, weapons, dyes, sugars, radioactivity, soaps etc). The chemical concepts presented span across general/ph ysical /inorganic/organic/nuclear/ biochemistry . An overarching theme throughout the semester is the isolation, characterization or creation of atoms/molecules required for life, extending to those that impact our quality of life. Examples include primary me tabolites (sugars, proteins, lipids) and secondary metabolites (toxins and medicines), as well as energy and processes needed for a modern society (such as agriculture and water quality, dyes, chemical weapons, bombs and controlled chemical explosions for infrastructure). Hence, demonstrating how chemistry is \"everywhere\". Typically, t he second lecture in each module emphasizes the social context of chemistry in the particular applications being examined that week, with emphasis placed upon how scientific development s arise from or impact diverse societies or groups of people (e.g. health disparities, dual -use technologies and regulations, indigenous medicine versus modern pharmaceuticals, gender identity, gender and color, contagion panic and ethnicity/social class , cleanliness and race, set and setting related to drug abuse). Guest lecturers from various non -STEM departments have helped to develop course content and some may be available to participate with the lectures and lead/develop in -class activities that emph asize the merging of chemistry and society, with emphasis on how diversity motivated some chemical innovations and how chemical developments inadvertently effect diverse groups of people. Typically t he third hour of each module involves an experiential learning act ivity; e.g. in class activities, discussions and reflections, lab demonstrations, laboratory experiments , tours of facilities on UF campus (e.g. Ethnobiology gardens, AMRIS facility) or workshop activities to help develop stud ent skills for their public -facing writing pitch assignment. Regarding assignments there typically will be a quiz each week (MC, T/F, short answers) to assess that students have read /watched the assigned materials and to demonstrate SLOs related to content for chemical and social concept s. For most weeks there will also be a discussion post to meet the critical thinking, communication and connection SLOs for Quest 2, Gen Ed -P and Gen Ed -D. Exams will be delivered intake home essay and short answer format, and exams will be designed to meet the merging concept SLOs for Quest 2. In class activities (depending on student enrollment can be group or individual) and the corresponding assignments will be designed to assess reflection and data analysis aspects of SLOs. 3 This course is expected to be of interest to STEM majors who wish to seek a deeper understanding of how \"what we do \" is motivated by and impacts social aspects, including diversity, in our lives. By describing and analyzing how chemical innovations and the scientific method arise from or have impacted various societal groups within the United States and across the globe, sessions 2 and 3 each week; along with their corresponding assignments and assessments, this course will meet the SLOs for Diversity. This course will also appeal to non -STEM m ajors who seek to have a deeper understanding of where and how chemistry is essential to their daily lives and impacts life's perceived quality. The SLO requirements for the Physical Sciences will be met by activities of sessions 1 and 3 of each module (al ong with corresponding assignments), where descriptions of chemical concepts and analysis of experimental methods and results will be performed. It is not required that you have any college level science course as a prerequisite for this course as the chem istry and scientific concepts within Disappearing Spoon and Napoleon's Buttons will be addressed. High -school level understanding of chemistry/physics is expected.

The percentages will be recorded in Canvas as two separate assignments and will be averaged to total 5% of your final gr ade. 21 b. Discussion Posts (20% total grade) : Approximately e ach week there will be an on -line discussion in Canvas that evaluates critical thinking and reflective components related to the integration of the chemical and social concepts of that module. Students will be either given (1) additional information to read and asked questions related to self - reflection or (2) asked to identify, describe, discuss and provide references to a curren t political or societal situation that is analogous to the lessons of that week. Discussion posts will be graded based upon how well students provide responses that are informed, thoughtful, reflective and complete. Discussion post length will typically in volve 4 -5 paragraphs of response. General Discussion Grading Rubric: High Quality Average Needs Improvement Unacceptable Informed: Shows evidence of having done the assigned reading and in -class work. 100 % 75 % 50 % 0 % Thoughtful: Shows evidence of having understood and considered issues raised. 100 % 75 % 50 % 0 % Reflective: Provides a component of self-reflection that is sincere. 100 % 75 % 50 % 0 % Complete : Responses are complete and/or consistent with the instructions . Responses also utilize appropriate grammar 100 % 75 % 50 % 0 % c. Weekly In -Class Activities (20% total grade) : Almost every week there will be an in-class activity or tour that will have a grad ed assessment that may contain the following: (A) questions with short answers to assess the content of the demonstration/tour etc, (B) short responses asking students to reflect on how integration of concepts in the module impacts or alters their views on that week's topic (graded with a scale similar to reflecti ve component of discussion posts), or (C) possible problems to be solved or data to be analyzed. Grading of problem sets/data analysis/short answers will evaluate completeness and correctness according to the percentages of 100%=high quality, 75% = averag e quality, 50% = needs improvement, 0% =unacceptable . 22 d. Public Facing Pitch and related assignment s (20% total grade) : There are four graded assessments related to the pitch development and submission. A) The first of these is an on -line assignment that will introduce you to select public -facing essays from Rebecca Altman such as \"Object Lessons\" in The Atlantic and essays from Aeon Magazine . An important aspect of writing a pitch is having appropriate refe rences and you will be given the source documents for the essays. This assignment will also expose you to the resource \"OpenNotebook.com\", showing you various components to develop a pitch to an editor. After digesting the reading material, students will p ost in the Pitch Discussion Post three questions they would like to ask Rebecca (or another public facing science writer) . This assignment will be due prior to the in -class interview with either Rebecca Altman or Dr. Sean Trainer. Grading will be done in accordance with the rubric for Discussion Posts described above. During the In -class interview, students will be evaluated based upon their participation. B) The second component to the pitch assignment will be students reporting in The Pitch Ideas and Refere nces on -line Discussion Post their identified topic for the pitch and 5 sources. This documentation will be reviewed and feedback will be given. Grading will be done to in accordance with the rubric for Discussion Posts described above. C) The third compone nt is the development of the pitch. Prior to the due date, we will have another in - class workshop (a Friday activity) where students will be asked to participate and share the development of their pitch and to provide peer evaluations/discussion regarding how well it is meeting the guidelines provided by Dr. Sean Trainor. This assignment will be graded according to the Participation rubric provided above as well as students turning in written answers to the 7 concepts given in the guide to writing a pitch after obtaining peer review feedback . Students are expected to have active participation and give feedback to other students/groups. This activity may vary depending upon class size as groups of 5 students should be set to help facilitate the effective comm unication and feedback among the group. The written document will be reviewed by Faculty/TA and feedback will be given. The written document will be graded according to rubrics for correctness and completeness given above. D) The final and last component is the grading of the pitch. Pitches will be submitted on -line. Students will be asked to peer review TWO other pitches addressing how well the pitch matched the guidelines given by Dr. Trainer . The final grade will be the average of the faculty/TA grading an d TWO peer reviews. Each of the pitches will be evaluated based upon the 7 concepts outlined in the guide to writing a pitch along with evaluating grammar and organization. Scores for these 9 criteria will range from of 100%, 85%, 70%, 50%, 0%; reflective of excellent, very good, average, below average and unacceptable; respectively. 4. Grading Scale For information on how UF grade points, visit: https://cata log.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic - regulations/grades -grading -policies/ 23 I will round to the appropriate unit percentage. IV. Quest Learning Experiences 5. Course Delivery and Engagement This course has traditional lecture periods on Monday to examine the chemistry concepts of the modules. On-line quizzes need to be completed each week that evaluate materials presented on -line and within the Monday/Wednesday lectures. Wednesday periods have been developed in conjunction with UF Faculty across campus who are experts in the social/humanities topics that connect a social lesson with our chemistry concepts and solutions to technical/social problems. There are readings /videos for each Monday and Wednesday lecture and sometimes worksheets to be completed beforehand. After the completion of Wednesday's lectures, we will engage with a new problem that intersects the chemistry and social lesson of the module through Discussion posts , which also may have a short reading/video component . Friday's sessions are group activities , facilities tours, demonstrations or lab experiments to enhance our experience of the content being discussed each week. Many of these activities have post -experience surveys, questionnaires or data analysis assignments. 6. Details of Experiential Learning Component Friday period s are typically allocated for tours, demonstrations and experiments will be posted in Canvas or announced in class. Please consult Canvas for the most up to date activities and assignments. These can change due to COVID -19 impacts/restrictions. Campus visits include tours of Field an d Fork, campus food pantry ( and Experiments Include: Explosive Molecules and Reactions Making and Evaluating Dyes Corrosion and Corrosion Protection Superhyd rophobic Coatings A 94 - 100% of possible points C 75 - 80% A- 90 - 94% C- 70 - 75% B+ 86 - 90% D+ 65 - 70% B 83 - 86% D 60 - 65% B- 80 - 83% F <60 24 7. Details of Self -Reflection Component Throughout the semester, the on -line Discussion Posts and Post -lab/tour assignments will contain a reflective component where you evaluate your views on a topic pre - and post - module interactions. For example, you may be asked to describe and evaluate your biases/views on essential oils as medicines prior to an after grappling with the week's module content and activities. 8. What is the essential/pressing question your course explores? This course shows how Chemistry and Society are intertwined; how societal needs motivate chemical innovation and how chemical innovation impacts our lives in a multitude of ways , making Chemistry and chemical innovation present \"everywhere\" . This course also explores why \" Chemistry\" as a field sometimes has a negative public relations view through the dual -use aspect of many chemical innovations that can be utilized for benefit - or harm; intended or unintended. This course aims to broaden the soc ial consciousness of STEM majors to get a deeper understanding of where Chemistry is involved in our daily lives, as well as how chemical innovation is motivated by and impacts social disparities. This course will also provide a basic General Education of chemical concepts and principles within our everyday lives; thus educating non -STEM majors on how it is impossible to separate chemistry from our social world - past present and future.
