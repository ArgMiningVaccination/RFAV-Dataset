European Journal of Integrative Medicine 2009 Chiropractic & osteopathy 2007 To conduct a descriptive review of the scientific literature examining use rates of modalities and procedures used by CAM clinicians to manage chronic LBP and other conditions A literature of PubMed and MANTIS was performed using the key terms Chiropractic; Low Back Pain; Utilization Rate; Use Rate; Complementary and Alternative Medicine; and Health Services in various combinations. A total of 137 papers were selected, based upon including information about chiropractic utilization, CAM utilization and low back pain and other conditions. Information was extracted from each paper addressing use of chiropractic and CAM, and is summarized in tabular form. Thematic analysis of the paper topics indicated that there were 5 functional areas covered by the literature: back pain papers, general chiropractic papers, insurance-related papers, general CAM-related papers; and worker's compensation papers.

Our objective was to investigate the distribution and patterns of alternative medicine use by children diagnosed with cancer in Washington State. Pediatric cancer patients (&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; or =18 years) with first primary neoplasms were identified from the Cancer Surveillance System of western Washington. Telephone interviews were conducted with parents of 75 patients to obtain data on the prevalence and types of alternative medicine used, satisfaction with conventional and alternative medicine, motivations for use of alternative medicine, adverse effects, and costs. Seventy-three percent of patients used at least one alternative treatment or therapy. Twenty-one percent of patients consulted an alternative provider (e.g., acupuncturist, naturopathic doctor), and insurance companies covered 75% of these costs. Twenty-eight percent used high-dose dietary supplements such as vitamins C or E, and 35% used herbal preparations. Although use of alternative medicine was associated with parental dissatisfaction with their child&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;s physician (P = 0.02), no patient used alternative medicine as a substitute for standard medical care. Most patients used alternative medicine to cope with disease symptoms or the side effects of the medical treatments. Pediatric oncology patients use alternative treatments as adjuncts to conventional care. Both researchers and health care providers should remain informed about the benefits and adverse effects of alternative therapies in order to discuss treatment options with patients and their families and to monitor treatment efficacy.
