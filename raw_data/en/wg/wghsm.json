Afacan, Amy T.Y. Yeung, Olga M. Pena and Robert E.W. Hancock* Centre for Microbial Diseases and Immunity Research, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Abstract: The emergence of infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens pose a major burden to modern healthcare. Ex- acerbating this issue is the substantial decline in development of new classes of antibiotics by pharmaceutical companies. This has led to renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of natural anti-infective agents such as host defense peptides (HDPs). The broad antimicro- bial and immunomodulatory activities of HDPs and their synthetic derivatives, c oupled with the fact that they do not readily induce mi- crobial resistance, makes them extremely valuable leads in the development of new treatment strategies for MDR infections. This review examines our knowledge of the mechanisms behind multi-drug resistance as well as the properties of HDPs and their therapeutic p oten- tial, especially in the case of MDR infections. Challenges to their development as new therapeutics are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION Major medical advances in prevention and treatment of infec- tious diseases have vastly improved quality of life and significantly increased life expectancy. This is largely due to the discovery and development of antibiotics. The discovery of penicillin in 1928 ushered in the golden age of antibiotic innovation (1940s-1960s), during which the majority of antibiotic families in use today were identified [1]. Widespread and often inappropriate exploitation of these antibiotics has resulted in the emergence of multi-drug resis-tant (MDR) pathogens. Infections caused by MDR pathogens are a major burden to modern healthcare as a result of high morbid- ity/mortality rates, and the higher treatment cost of MDR infections [2]. Compounding this issue is the fact that the current rate of anti- biotic development has declined substantially, with only six new antibiotics, none of which were truly innovative, approved since 2003 [3]. Pharmaceutical drug discovery and development is a lengthy (8-12 years) and expensive ($400-$800 m illion per ap- proved agent) process, with many regulatory hurdles and low suc- cess rates [1, 4-7]. Anti-infective agents are generally used in short- course treatment of acute infections and there are significant market restrictions placed on newly developed anti-infectives. Thus, phar-maceutical companies looking for the greatest return on investment have shifted their focus to the development of drugs for chronic conditions such as hypertension, depression and arthritis [4]. Recent antibiotic research, especially target-based research, utilizing genomics, combinatorial chemistry and high-thr oughput screening, has not been as productive as expected. This led to a push to re-examine the therapeutic potential of natural compounds and their derivatives and to explore new concepts and approaches. Cationic host defense peptides (HDPs) and their synthetic deriva- tives constitute one such class of compounds, exhibiting broad- range anti-infective activity through both direct and adjunctive (immunomodulatory) action. HDPs are produced by virtually all forms of life and are an evolutionarily ancient and apparently essential component of the host innate immune response to infectious agents. There have been more than 1200 HDPs identified or predicted, approximately 940 of which are found in eukaryotic organisms. A comprehensive list of HDPs can be found at http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/main.php [8, 9]. The broad range anti-infective activity of HDPs stems from the diversity *Address correspondence to this author at the Centre for Microbial Diseases and Immunity Research, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Tel: 1-604-822-2682; Fax: cell differentiation; and enhancement of adap- tive immune responses, cell survival, wound healing and angio-genesis. Interestingly, antimicrobial HDPs have retained their anti- infective activities over millions of years with few pathogens de- veloping resistance mechanisms to them, while the broad immuno-modulatory activities are not liable to resistance development, mak- ing them extremely attractive candidates for novel therapeutics targeting MDR pathogens. This review explores our current knowl-edge of HDPs and their synthetic derivatives as well as their poten- tial use as novel therapeutics to combat MDR pathogens. Chal- lenges facing their development are also discussed. MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA Until the 1960's, numerous classes of antibiotics (both natural and synthetic) were introduced into clinical practice, including sulfa drugs, /g1-lactams, phenyl propaniods, polyketides, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and quinolones. However, the rapid development of resistance to these drugs upon their introduction was under appreci- ated. Less than a year after the first-generation penicillin was used to treat Staphylococcus infections, penicillin-resistant Staphylococ- cus aureus strains were discovered. With few exceptions, the intro- duction of each new antibiotic has been followed, within a few years, by the first cases of resistance. Over the last two decades, an alarming number of MDR patho- gens have been identified [10]. For example, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is not only resistant to methicillin a major source of hospital-acquired infections associated with significant morbidity and mor- tality [12]. Although MRSA infections are treatable with vancomy- cin, vancomycin resistant-MRSA strains have been reported [13]. Strains of several other pathogens exhibit resistance to multiple or essentially all available Data published in 2004 by the US Na-tional Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) System reported a substantial increase, from 1992to 2004, in the resistance rate and prevalence of multidrug resistant Gram-negative pathogens among healthcare-associated infections, especially ICUs. The NNIS also reported that 5.8% and nearly 21% of Escherichia coli and K. 808 Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2012, Vol. 18, No. 6 Afacan et al. pneumoniae isolates, respectively, were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins [14]. Multidrug resistance in bacteria is generated by various mecha- nisms, including acquisition of resistance plasmids, transposons or integrons with genes encoding for resistance to specific antimicro- bial agents, and/or induction due to mutation of regulatory loci controlling for example increased expression of multidrug efflux pumps that extrude a wide range of drugs [11]. Owing to the target specificity of each antibiotic, bacteria can become resistant through mutations that make the target less susceptible. For example, muta- tions in target enzymes, such as DNA topoisomerases, have been frequently identified in fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria [15]. Resistance can also develop for non-proteinaceous targets, whereby an altered substrate structure is found in the resistant strain. For example, vancomycin binds to the lipid-linked disaccharide-pentapeptide, which is a precursor of cell wall peptidoglycan and consequently inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. In some van- comycin-resistant bacteria the substrate for vancomycin (the termi-nal two amino acids of the stem pentapeptide), D-Ala- D-Ala, is changed to D-Ala- D-lactic acid, reducing the binding affinity of vancomycin to its substrate [16]. In addition, bacteria may acquire, from other species, genes that encode less susceptible target pro- teins [17]. For example, MRSA expresses an alternative methicil- lin-resistant penicillin binding protein called PBP-2A. The gene for PBP-2A is located in the chromosome on a so-called genomic is- land that may have originated from Staphylococcus sciuri [18]. Bacteria may also acquire plasmids with genes encoding inactivating enzymes; /g2-lactams such [19] Additional resistance mechanisms in-clude reduced drug access to the target by acquiring genes encoding for drug-specific active efflux pumps [20]. As well, porin defi- ciency has been identified in some Gram-negative bacteria and appears to prevent influx of many antibiotics [21]. Multidrug resistance is not limited to bacteria, but can also be observed in other pathogens including parasites, viruses, and fungi. There are reports of widespread resistance to earlier generation anti- malarial drugs, such as chloroquine and sulfadoxin-pyrimethamine in most malaria-endemic countries [22]. The emergence of resis- tance is also an increasing concern for treatment of HIV infections [23]; and due to acquired resistance to antifungal therapies, higher mortality and/or morbidity rates from invasive mycosis have been observed [24, 25]. The return to the pre-antibiotic era is rapidly becoming a reality in many parts of the world [26] and new strategies to prevent the spread of potentially lethal multi-drug resistant pathogens are ur- gently needed. One strategy garnering a lot of attention is the de- velopment of enhanced derivatives of the natural anti-infective molecules, HDPs, as novel therapeutics. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF HOST DEFENSE PEPTIDES Structure Essentially all species of life produce HDPs, with individual organisms producing not only different classes of peptides but also a number of variants within each class. These peptides exhibit enormous diversity in sequence, size and secondary structures, however there are some common physical characteristics that de- fine HDPs. They are generally between 12 and 50 amino acids in length with a predominance of basic over acidic amino acids, con-ferring a net positive charge of +2 to +9 [27]. In addition, approxi- mately 50% of the amino acids are hydrophobic. The presence of basic and hydrophobic amino acids promotes folding of linear HDPs into amphipathic secondary structures upon contact with lipid bilayers [28].The secondary structures adopted by HDPs are used as the basis of their classification with four structural classes having been established. The two most common classes are /g2-sheet (e.g. defensins) and /g1-helical (eg. cathelicidins, magainin) peptides. Less common are looped peptides and extended structures rich suggest that certain biological properties of HDPs are dependent on specific structural characteristics. The biological activities of HDPs are initiated through their interaction with cellular membranes. In their antibacterial action, first, they bind to the negatively charged surface of bacterial mem- branes then, through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, insert into the membrane. Thus the charge, hydrophobicity and amphipathicity are important to HDP function and explain why initial HDP structure-function studies focused on these characteris-tics in relation to in vitro antimicrobial activity [30-34]. In addition, the disulfide bonds found in the /g2-sheet and /g2-hairpin classes are essential for biological activity through stabilization of secondary structure [30, 35, 36]. For example the chemotactic and antimicro- bial activity of the human /g2-defensin 3 (HBD-3) appears to be de- pendent on correct disulfide bond formation and peptide folding [30, 35]. It should be stated that the in vitro antimicrobial activity examined in these studies is likely to often have a limited physio-logical role due to the high inhibitory mono- and di- valent cation concentrations and polyanionic mucins found in biological fluids in vivo [37-39]. Nevertheless in circum- stances in which these peptides are present in very high concentra- tions such as in phagocytic granules, in the immediate vicinity of degranulating phagocytes, and in the crypts of the intestine it seems likely that their direct antimicrobial activity could influence the outcome of infections. At lower concentrations the immunomodula- tory activities might predominate as these are less affected by physiological salt concentrations. To gain greater insight into the structure-function relationships behind HDP antimicrobial activity, Cherkasov et al. used the bo- vine cathelicidin bactenecin as the initial template to iteratively generate two large 9-amino acid peptide libraries with enhanced biological activity [40]. Experimental data generated from these two libraries was used in conjunction with machine learning quanti- tative structure activity (QSAR) approaches (discussed below), to relate atomic-resolution physical-chemical descriptors of HDPs to antimicrobial activity. Using this approach, the antimicrobial activi- ties of 100,000 virtual peptides were effectively identified. Based on this study it is clear that the structure-function relationship is far more complex than once thought as the peptides predicted to be the most active were nearly identical in charge, hyrdophobicity and amphipathicity to the inactive peptides. There have been far fewer in vitro studies into the structural requirements for immunomodulation, likely owing to the large number of immunomodulatory activities each HDP possesses. One in vitro study identified the N-terminal portion of the human cathelicidin LL-37 (residues 1-13) as associated with its chemotac- ti c activity and ability to oligomerize [41, 42]. QSAR methodology has also been exploited to generate synthetic HDPs with enhanced immunomodulatory activities, known as Innate Defense Regulators (IDRs). For example, IDR-1, IDR-1002 and IDR-1018 were loose derivatives of Bac2A, a linear derivative of bactenecin that pos-sesses both antimicrobial immunomodulatory activities such as IDR- 1018 adopt different conformations, depending the makeup of the membrane of target cells. In the presence of bacterial model mem- branes and mammalian model membranes, IDR-1018 adopts a /g2- turn and an /g1 -helical conformation, respectively. In the presence of mammalian model membranes Bac2A also adopts an /g1-helical con- formation however, its mean residue ellipticity differs from IDR-1018, suggesting that IDR-1018 is capable of stronger membrane interactions and is therefore likely to be more effective at translo- cating into cells [44, 45]. This may explain why IDRs are better immunomodulators, since many immunomodulatory activities de-pend on the ability of HDPs to traverse the plasma membrane and Therapeutic Potential of Host Defense Peptides Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2012, Vol. 18, No. 6 809 interact with specific intracellular targets and receptors such as sequestosome-1, a key intracellular receptor of IDR-1 [46]. Further structural studies are required to determine if the ability to adopt /g1- helical conformations is a major factor in immunomodulatory activ-ity and to identify other physical characteristics that regulate the immunomodulatory properties of peptides. Expression HDPs are encoded as individual genes, with HDP families often clustered together within the genome. For example the human /g1- and /g2-defensin genes co-localize to chromosome 8p21-23, while the sole cathelicidin LL-37 is found on chromosome 3p21.3 [9]. Regulation of gene expression varies by individual peptides, spe- cies, tissue, cell type, and differentiation state of a cell. Their ex-pression is coordinately regulated at the transcriptional and post- translational levels and can be constitutive or up-regulated by in- flammatory/immune stimuli such as immune mediators (e.g. components synthesized as inactive pro-forms, likely for intracellular storage purposes. During or after secretion they are proteolytically cleaved, releasing the biologically active peptide; thus the activity of HDPs is not only dependent on gene expression but also on the presence of specific proteases at the site of HDP secretion [9]. Despite substantial variation in HDP expression patterns, se- quence, size, secondary structures, and anatomical site of produc- tion, all HDPs possess one or both of the two major functions dis- cussed below, immunomodulation or direct microbicidal activity,. Mechanisms of Action I. Antimicrobial Activities When investigating the direct antimicrobial activity of HDPs it is appropriate to refer to them as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs); which represent a promising lead for new, effective treatments for microbial diseases. AMPs initially attracted attention as alternative antibiotic candidates due to their ability to destabilize bacterial, fungal and possibly viral membranes [27], but the complexity of these molecules and their heterogeneity of action are now increas- ingly appreciated Fig. ( 1). Thus AMPs have been called 'dirty drugs' since they disrupt many biological processes in the target microbe with modest potency rather than acting on a specific target with high-affinity, reducing the selective pressure for de novo resis- tance development [47]. Virtually all AMPs are directly antimicro- bial in vitro under appropriate cond itions (e.g. in buffer or dilute medium). However, under physiological conditions, the direct bac- tericidal activity is often antagonized, as discussed above[48]. For example, LL-37 is protective against bacterial infections in vivo and exhibits direct bactericidal activity in phosphate buffer but does not reduce the bacterial load in physiologically relevant tissue culture medium [49]. Despite identification of an ever-growing number of AMPs (both natural and synthetic), their mode of action is only slowly being elucidated. The direct antimicrobial activity of HDPs is largely attributed to their ability to fold into structures that have both cationic and hydrophobic domains [47], although studies with synthetic peptides have revealed that the physical determinants of activity are very complex [40]. The overall net positive charge en- sures initial attraction with and accumulation at the polyanionic microbial cell surface and insertion into anionic membranes of and Gram-positive bacteria [47]. To reach the cyto- plasmic membrane of bacterial cells, HDPs must cross the outer membrane and peptidoglycan of Gram-negative bacteria or the thicker peptidoglycan that contains associated anionic polymers such as lipoteichoic acid in Gram-positive bacteria. Since the inter- action of cationic peptides with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is better understood, it will be described here. Following the initial binding of HDPs to the outer membrane, the peptides initiate their own passage across the outer membrane via the 'self-promoted uptake' mechanism [50]. The peptides possess greater affinity for the negatively charged surface LPS than native divalent cations, such as Ca 2+ and Mg2+, and as a result, the divalent cations are displaced, causing areas of disruption in the outer mem- brane. This enables the translocation across the outer membrane of the peptides, which can then associate with the phospholipids of the cytoplasmic membrane. Initially, the peptides insert at the interface between phospholipid head groups of the outer leaflet and the fatty acyl tails in parallel to the plane of the membrane [51]. Once the number of interacting peptides reaches a critical level, the peptides are proposed to aggregate or associate, and perturb the membrane bilayer. There is substantial disagreement as to what happens next; several hypotheses, including the barrel stave, torroidal pore, carpet and aggregate models (see refs [52-54] for an overview of these mechanisms), aim to explain peptide action on bacterial membranes in terms of lysis or membrane busting. However there is an increas- ing appreciation that although membrane busting does occur in model systems at high enough peptide concentrations, it is unlikely to be the actual mechanism in many cases [47]. Indeed we propose that membrane perturbation likely leads to one of (at least) three possible fates: (a) perturbation of membrane associated functions such as peptidoglycan biosynthesis, [55] en- ergy generation, [56] cell division etc, (b) disruption of the physical integrity of the bilayer, through membrane thinning, transient pora- tion and/or disruption of the barrier function [57] and/or (c) translo- cation across the cytoplasmic membrane to act on various cyto- Fig. (1). Antimicrobial activity of host defence peptides (HDPs). The figure represents the different antimicrobial mechanisms of action exhibited by HDPs, such as disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane (1) or interaction with intracellular targets and disruption of cellular process es including DNA/RNA synthesis (2), interfering with protein synthesis (3), protein folding (4) and cell wall synthesis. 1 2 3 4 5810 Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2012, Vol. 18, No. 6 Afacan et al. plasmic targets [47]. While the various models can explain the abil- ity of cationic peptides to disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane, the aggregate model further describes how the peptides can cross the membrane to act on cytoplasmic targets [47]. It is worth mentioning that many peptides are also able to freely translocate across the membranes of eukaryotic cells and have properties that strongly resemble cell penetrating peptides [58]. An increasing number of HDPs have been suggested to act on internal targets, either as their major mechanism of action or in addition to membrane perturbation [47]. For example, HBD-3 and plectasin, a fungal defensin, act by binding to the bacterial cell-wall precursor Lipid II to inhibit cell wall biosynthesis [55, 59]. Other proposed cytoplasmic and/or membrane targets of peptides include DNA/RNA synthesis, condensation of intracellular DNA, protein synthesis/folding, cell wall synthesis/integrity and cell division [47, 60]. Pyrrhocoricin and its analogues interact with DnaK, a shock protein involved in chaperone-assisted protein folding, inhib- iting its ATPase activity, which results in accumulation of mis-folded proteins and cell death [61]. Additionally, certain cationic HDPs at sub-inhibitory concentra- tions can also prevent bacterial biofilm formation, which is strongly implicated in the development of chronic infections. Established biofilms protect bacteria from host defense mechanisms and antibi-otic therapy [62, 63]. Studies by Overhage et al . and Hell et al. demonstrated that at concentrations well below its minimum inhibi-tory concentration, LL-37 strongly inhibited biofilm formation and had an effect on existing P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis biofilms [64, 65] .Overhage et al. tested a range of peptides and found this selective action against biofilms occurred only with certain pep-tides, e.g. with bovine indolicidin but not polymyxin B or bovine bactenecin. HDPs have also been studied for their antiviral activity against a wide spectrum of viruses. Peptides can inhibit viruses through a wide variety of mechanisms involving almost every part of the viral life cycle [66]. For example, Dermaseptin directly interacts with the HIV virion, disrupting its membrane [67]. Antiviral peptides such as bovine and human lactoferricin can block viral entry by interact- ing with glycosaminoglycans on mammalian cell surfaces, specifi- cally heparin sulfate, which are important for viral attachment [68, 69]. The spread of virions from one cell to a neighboring cell across tight junctions can also be inhibited by antiviral peptides such as the rabbit /g1-defensin NP-1, which inhibits cell-to-cell spread of HSV [70]. Antiviral peptides have also been demonstrated to block viral entry or attachment by interacting directly with specific viral recep- tors on the host cell and glycoproteins in the viral envelope. For example, the polyphemusin analogue T22 binds to the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, the T-cell surface protein CD4 and the viral en- velope protein gp120 to inhibit binding and fusion of the HIV enve-lope with the host cell membrane [71, 72]. Antiviral peptides may also interact with and permeabilize the host cell membrane to inter- fere with viral entry. For instance, an eight-residue cyclic DL-/g1- peptide lowers the pH in endocytic vesicles, which inhibits entry of adenovirus particles through this pathway [73]. One major mecha- nism for the action of such peptides was revealed by studies that showed that antiviral peptides, such as LL-37 and human and bo- vine lactoferricin, can translocate across the plasma and nuclear membranes of host cells [74, 75]. Consequently, the internalized peptides could enhance host cell antiviral mechanisms [49]or block viral gene/protein expression. Magainins and cecropins were among the first HDPs reported to display anti-parasitic activities [76], with magainin-2 causing swelling and eventual rupture of Paramecium caudatum [77]. Since then, anti-parasitic activities have been reported for numerous natu- ral and synthetic HDPs [78, 79]. The underlying mechanism ap- pears to be membrane disruption [80]. Due to differences in mem-brane composition, anti-parasitic peptides can exhibit a higher af- finity for the membranes of infected erythrocytes than for normal erythrocytes [81, 82]. Hemolytic peptides induce hemoglobin leak- age and parasite starvation while non-hemolytic peptides enter in-fected host cells and bind to the parasitic membrane [22]. Once bound, the peptides can disrupt the plasma membrane of the para- site modifying the parasite's membrane properties (e.g. charge and fluidity of lipid and protein components) to interfere with their normal functions and following internalization, disrupt essential biological processes [80, 82, 83]. An increasing number of antifungal peptides have been reported that induce cell lysis, interfere with cell wall synthesis, inhibit depolymerize demonstrated that /g1-helical pore-forming peptides isolated from scorpion venom exhibited antifungal activities of activ-ity of the glycine-rich peptide tenecin-3 is not a result of membrane permeabilization or depolarization but involves peptide entry into the cytoplasm [86]. II. Immunomodulatory Activities The innate immune system is the first line of defense against microorganisms and is evolutionarily quite conserved among inver- tebrate and vertebrate animals. It is recognized as the most ancient arm of the immune system and its effectiveness is characterized by a rapid and effective response, intended to quickly eliminate threats. HDPs are an important component of the innate immune system. They are produced by many cells including epithelial and immune cells [87-89], acting at the site of infection in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. HDPs can exhibit robust immunomodulatory activities and/or have direct antimicrobial activity Fig. ( 2). How- ever as mentioned above, under physiological cond itions their an- timicrobial activities are considerably dampened which is not the case for their selective immunomodulatory activities, suggesting that these are the more likely explanation for their protective effects against microbes in vivo [37, 49]. These selective immunomodula- tory capabilities make HDP the starting point for novel therapies against multi-drug resistant infections, acting on the host to boost protective immunity while modulating excessive inflammation [90] . Some of the most relevant immunomodulatory functions displayed by HDP are described below. Chemotactic Activity The presence of microorganisms, induces the local production and/or release of chemo-attractant (chemotactic) agents such as chemokines and HDPs, which are capable, with varying efficiency, of recruiting immune cells to the site of infection. HDPs also induce the expression of a broad range of chemokines such as CXCL8/IL8, CCL2/MCP1by neutrophils, monocytes and other immune cells [91, 92].These direct and indirect chemotactic activities are a con-served ability among HDPs, making this a strategic tool for screen- ing and selecting for improved synthetic immunomodulatory HDPs (IDRs). This method was recently used to select three IDRs devel-oped in our laboratory, IDR-1, IDR-1002 and IDR-1018 [93], which demonstrated and enhanced ability to induce chemokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). These activi-ties also appear to underlie their protective effects in bacterial infec- tions including those caused by MDR strains [94, 95]. Anti-endotoxin Activity Lipopolysacharide (LPS), the outer membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria also known as endotoxin, is a classical inducer of systemic inflammation and deadly syndromes like sepsis [96]. Many antibiotics stimulate the release of endotoxin, enhancing the occurrence of systemic inflammation and consequent sepsis [97]. HDPs possess the capacity to dampen production of endo-toxin-induced pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- /g1) by blocking or modulating toll like receptor Therapeutic Potential of Host Defense Peptides Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2012, Vol. 18, No. 6 811 (TLR) signaling pathways, and in some cases partly by direct LPS binding [98-100]. These activities may underlie the profound anti-inflammatory activity evident in infection models treated with IDR peptides [43, 94], as well as in sterile inflammation models. Immune Cell Differentiation Immune cell differentiation is essential to the proper develop- ment of immune responses. HDPs appear to have a direct link with this event as well. For example, LL-37 induces dendritic cell (DC) and bone forming-like cell differentiation [34, 101]. Similarly, hLF11, a in vivo protec- tive effects on MDR infections, promotes the differentiation of a macrophage subset with pro and anti-inflammatory capabilities that are highly effective against bacterial pathogens [102]. Peptides also have very distinct activities when interacting with classical (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages [103]. Wound Healing and Angiogenesis Wound healing involves the re-growth of epithelial layers and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), which is neces-sary for the wounded site to return to homeostasis. HDPs play an important role in this process by acting directly on epithelial and endothelial cells, inducing promoting re-epithelialization and angi-ogenesis, effects that have been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro [104]. HDPs also induce wound healing indirectly through their chemotactic effects on epithelial cells and the induction of metalloproteinases [105, 106] . In fact, a lack of HDPs is linked to impaired re-epithelialization of chronic wounds [107, 108] . Other Functions Enhancing cell survival and polarization of the adaptive im-mune system (adjuvant activity) are among other immunomodula-tory activities attributed to HDPs [109, 110]. The molecular mecha- nisms by which these and other HDPs functions occur are complex and slowly being discovered. Mounting evidence suggests that HDPs target multiple processes within a given cell, with the re- sponses depending on the nature of the peptide and the target cell type. In the case of LL-37, it appears to engage multiple receptors including the P2X 7receptor, formyl peptide receptor like-1 (FPRL- 1) and other Gi-protein coupled receptors, as well as GAPDH, an intracellular receptor [111-113] .Some of the key sig- naling pathways that play a role displayed by HDPs have been demonstrated in animal models and appear to be important for pathogen clearance. Their role has been highlighted in models where the lack of HDPs leads to a reduced ability to clear infec- tions, such as in transgenic mice lacking /g1-defensin 1 and catheli- cidin-related antimicrobial peptide Immunomodulatory activ ities of HDPs: In addition to their direct antimicrobial activity (1), HDPs possess a variety of imm unomodulatory functions, acting at different locations within the affected micro-environment. These include the direct or indirect recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection (2) and inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-a (3). HDPs also induce dendr itic cell differentiation and activation thus connecting the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system (4).

The reduced pathogen clearance is likely due to dysregulation of the immune response and/or de- creased peptide mediated-killing leading to increased susceptibility to infections [115-118]. The immunomodulatory and antimicrobial properties of HDPs make them excellent candidates to treat infec-tions; especially those caused by MDR pathogens, particularly in combination with other antimicrobial therapies. THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF HDPS Infectious diseases, particularly those caused by MDR bacteria and parasites, are a leading cause of death, accounting for approxi-mately one third of deaths worldwide [119]. HDPs and their syn- thetic derivatives possess several attributes that make them attrac- tive candidates for novel anti-infectives targeted to MDR patho-gens. Variants with enhanced antimicrobial activity can kill a broad range of pathogens acting on components of several essential path- ways, which makes the development of effective resistance to them much less likely. As outlined a bove, most HDPs favorably modu- late the innate immune response, which responds to and counteracts a broad range of infectious agents. Thus the anti-infective activity of immunomodulatory HDPs is very broad and not limited to a single class of pathogen [120, 121]. Furthermore, the abi lity to tar- get the immune response rather than the pathogen also limits the selective pressure on the pathogen. The following sections explore HDPs in preclinical development or clinical trials, as well as pep- tides recently identified as potential lead compounds Table 1. HDPs in Clinical Trials I. Directly Antimicrobial Peptides Direct antimicrobial activity has been characterized for numer- ous synthetic peptides, several of which were introduced into clini-cal trials as topical anti-infectives. Migenix (www.migenix.com; now renamed BioWest Therapeutics) completed two III clinical trials with Omiganan (MX- 226/CSL-001), demonstrat- ing safety in more than 3,000 patients and for the first time statisti- cally significant efficacy in decreasing catheter colonization and reducing microbiologically confirmed tunnel infections (p<0.02). However, Omiganan is a first generation peptide of modest activity derived from bovine indolicidin, and likely for this reason missed its primary endpoint of physician-called infections (p<0.08). Never-theless it was also statistically significantly effective in Phase II clinical trials against severe acne and Rosacea, but as an anti- inflammatory agent rather than a direct antimicrobial and should go into Phase III trials for Rosacea within the next 12 months. Pexiganan acetate (MSI-78), a synthetic magainin derivative was tested in Phase III trials as an anti-infective for diabetic foot ulcers. Pexiganan completed Phase III clinical trials but in 1999 was denied approval by the food and drug administration because it did not prove more efficacious than standard fluoroquinolone ther- apy [122]. It was recently announced, by a new company Dipexium, that Pexiganan would re-enter Phase III trials to enable resubmission of a new drug application (http://www.dipexium pharmaceuticals.com/newsrel.html). In addition, it has been re- ported that second generation antimicrobial peptides based on Pexi-ganan have been developed that exhibit greater efficacy in vitro and hold the promise of greater efficacy in vivo . Only a small number of HDPs with direct antimicrobial activity are in clinical trials for systemic use. Novozyme Inc.'s lead com-pound, currently in preclinical development, is a derivative of plec- tasin (NZ2114), a fungal defensin exhibits broad spectrum antimi- crobial activity, especially against systemic, drug-resistant Gram positive infections including MRSA. Unlike many of the antimicro- bial HDPs that cause pore formation, plectasin inhibits cell wall synthesis via interaction with Lipid II [59]. It has excellent activity both in vitro and in vivo , minimal toxicity, is recombinantly pro- duced by fermentation thus reducing cost of goods, and as a disul-phide bonded defensin molecule is quite protease resistant. PMX-30063 (Polymedix), a defensin mimetic made up of /g2-amino acids, was developed for the treatment of MRSA infections. PMX-30063 has shown potent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram positive and negative bacteria in vitro and in vivo and in Phase I trials demonstrated ex vivo antibacterial activity and that it was well tolerated systemically (www.polymedix.com/pdf/PMX-30063_fact_sheet.pdf). II.Immunomodulatory Peptides There have been a number of peptides developed that exhibit immunomodulatory activity. Some are solely immunomodulatory, like IMX942, while others possess a certain degree of antimicrobial activity, like hLF1-11 and talactoferrin. Inimex Pharmaceuticals has focused its research on the development of IDRs. Their lead peptide is IMX942, a 5-amino acid derivative of a bovine indolicidin, which was developed for the treatment of infections, especially in neutropenic patients, and displays efficacy in animal models against infections by a number of antibiotic resistant bacteria [94]. IMX942 has completed Phase IA clinical trials. The hormone peptide /g1- melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( /g1-MSH) has become a lead for therapeutic development at Action Pharma owing to its extensive modulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory responses [123]. A de- rivative, AP214 is undergoing Phase IIB clinical trials for ti on of sepsis-induced kidney failure (http://www.actionpharma. com/index.dsp?page=73). by AM-Pharma intended to prevent bacteremia and fungal infections in immunocompromised individuals. It enhances macrophage-media- ted phagocytosis and killing of C. albicans and S. aureus [102]. hLF1-11 has completed Phase I trials and the side effects were found to be much milder than many of the marketedantibiotics with no serious adverse events; however currently development is sus- pended. Talactoferrin, developed by Agennix (www. agennix.com/) is derivative recombinant form of human lactoferrin that possesses broad immunomodulatory activity including immune cell recruit- ment, activation of dendritic cells and enhancement of adaptive immune responses [124-126]. A double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial evaluated talactoferrin versus placebo in 190 adult patients with severe sepsis enrolled at 24 leading centers across the U.S. The Phase II trial was reported at the American Thoracic Soci-ety International Conference to have achieved its primary endpoint of a reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality (12.5% absolute reduc- tion, 46.5% relative reduction). Apparently exploratory analyses suggested that talactoferrin might be effective in reducing the levels of certain cytokines and chemokines that are important in the initia- tion and propagation of the inflammatory response in severe sepsis. New Developments in Potential Lead HDPs and Alternative Design Methods Many research groups continue to focus on identifying novel HDPs from natural sources that are already effective against MDR pathogens, several of which are listed in Table I. Many of these HDPs were discovered in phylogenetically old organisms such as the cnidarian, Hydra magnipapillata ,which rely on rudimentary immune systems to survive infections [127, 128]. Although many of the novel HDPs are reported to have potent antimicrobial activ-ity, these are often demonstrated under non-physiological condi- tions, therefore more in vitro and in vivo studies are required to assess their potential as leads compounds in the development of therapeutics. New tools such as robotics and machine learning are being developed to facilitate rational design of peptides, minimizing the number and amount of peptides synthesized and tested. Natural and synthetic HDPs with desirable biological activities are used as tem- plates to generate novel peptide libraries consisting of thousands of synthetic peptides through random amino-acid substitution, scram-bling and truncation. These novel peptides are then tested in vitro to identify those with enhanced antimicrobial activity, which go on to Therapeutic Potential of Host Defense Peptides Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2012, Vol. 18, No. 6 813 Table 1.

(Table 1) Contd..... Drug/peptide Description Intended use Activity against MDRs Progress ) [155] [156] the synthesis of new libraries. Machine learn- ing tools are used in conjunction with the experimental data gener-ated from these libraries to generate predictive models of peptide activity. One example is QSAR analysis, which relates a series of quantifiable chemical and physical characteristics to a specific bio-logical activity; thus the biological activity of a compound can be predicted based on its physical properties [129]. This approach facilitates rational large-scale design of novel therapeutic candi-dates because it allows for rapid and efficient virtual interrogation of large compound libraries. The pharmaceutical industry already utilizes QSAR during the small com pound screening phase of drug discovery and in toxicological studies. QSAR analysis, relating the atomic-resolution physical-chemical descriptors to antimicrobial activity, combined with artificial intelligence/neural network ap-proaches was recently employed, based on a large training dataset to predict the activity of 100 000 virtual 9-mer peptides [40]. In vitro, the peptides predicted to have the greatest antimicrobial activ- ity were equally or more effective against a wide array of MDR bacteria than conventional antibiotics and were also protective in a murine S. aureus infection model. This demonstrates that unbiased computational approaches such as QSAR analysis coupled to artifi- cial neural networks are viable, inexpensive and rapid methods for the discovery and development of novel HDPs with greater thera-peutic potential. Rational design of immunomodulatory peptides is more diffi- cult largely because of their pleiotropic targets and effects and the relative novelty of the field. Thus rational design studies utilize specific immunomodulatory functions as markers of overall activ-ity, such as suppression of TLR agonist mediated TNF- /g1 production and induction of PBMCs. Using this approach, in-nate defense regulator (IDR)-1, also called IMX-942, the first pep-tide designed to be purely immunomodulatory, was generated in our laboratory and proved protective in animal models of infection despite lacking direct antimicrobial activity [94]. The first genera-tion synthetic immunomodulatory peptides are now being used as templates in an iterative design process, much like the one used for antimicrobial peptides, to generate new immunomodulatory pep- tides such as IDR-1002 with greater anti-infective activity [95]. In addition, a great deal of research now involves the develop- ment of alternative HDP design methods that improve efficacy while reducing cost, including ultrashort peptides, lipopeptides, peptides containing unnatural amino acids nanoparticles [130-133]. Lipopeptides are potent antimicro- bials of action is similar to directly antimicrobial HDPs) that are active against MDR bacteria. They are about 6 or 7 amino acids in length and can be linear or cyclic with a fatty acid moiety covalently linked to the N-terminus. N-terminal acylation a of natural and synthetic HDPs with C8-C18 long fatty acid moieties also enhances their antimicrobial activity, largely as a result of alterations to their hydrophobicity, oligomerization in solu-tion and ability to interact with cellular membranes [134-136]. Makovitzki et al. have exploited these properties by engineering ultrashort cationic lipopeptides (USLiP), peptides of two to four amino acids conjugated to a fatty acid (12-16 carbon) chain [137]. They are potent antimicrobials, with MICs similar to that of native HDPs, and unlike many native lipopeptides and HDPs they exhibit low or no hemolytic activity. The structure of these USLiPs is unique in that the amino acid sequence seems to determine target cell specificity, while the fatty acid chain compensates for the lack of hydrophobic amino acids in the peptide and promotes oligomeri- zation. The potent antimicrobial activity of USLiPs coupled with their simple composition make them economically viable leads for therapeutic development. Liu et al designed self-assembling nanoparticle micelles consisting of multiple HIV-1 TAT-derived peptides linked to cholesterol moieties. This design enhances the local density of cationic charge and peptide mass, thus improving the overall antimicrobial activity. The nanoparticles were effective against MRSA and VRE and in a rabbit model of S. aureus -induced Therapeutic Potential of Host Defense Peptides Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2012, Vol. 18, No. 6 815 meningitis, crossed the blood-brain barrier, suppressed bacterial growth and limited the severity of infection [133]. Challenges Facing Therapeutic use of HDPs and Potential Solu- tions Considering the numerous advantages of HDPs as novel thera- peutics it may seem quite surprising that so few peptides have made it into clinical trials and none as yet into the clinic. To further de-velop HDPs into novel therapeutics several issues must first be addressed. Cost of Manufacturing Ideally therapeutic peptides should have a low production cost to ensure affordability. Unfortunately, the current method of solid- phase synthesis using fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC) chemis-try synthesis of HDPs is prohibitively expensive for large-scale production, although solution phase synthesis offers considerable promise. One approach to reducing cost is designing biologically active peptides with minimal length such as the 9-mer peptides of Cherkasov et al. or the USLiPs of Makovitzki et al. , thus reducing the amount of costly chemical precursors required [40, 137]. A new platform, designed specifically for commercial-scale peptide pro- duction is also required. A number of groups are attempting to ad- dress this through recombinant synthesis. Novozyme Inc. uses a high-yield fungal expression system in order to mass-produce a highly pure form of its lead peptide, NZ2114 [138]. Recently, a method involving recombinant synthesis and easily cleavable fusion protein partners was utilized for high yield production of several HDPs including LL-37, IDR-1 and MX-226 [139]. process, a naturally occurring protease, sumoase, which is cloned upstream of the target peptide, cleaves immediately down- stream of the sumoase sequence freeing the pure peptide. Because this method utilizes an intrinsic cleavage system and a simple two-step purification process, it can easily be scaled up for industrial use while maintaining a low manufacturing cost [139]. Stability and Toxicity In vivo Peptides are sensitive to proteolytic degradation, which substan- tially decreases their half-life. Our own, as-yet unpublished, phar- macokinetic studies have revealed half lives in the blood of as little as 2 minutes. Methods developed to enhance peptide resistance to proteases generally involve altering peptide structure to improve in vivo stability, although the down side to these approaches is that almost all of these substantially increase the cost of goods and are incompatible with recombinant synthesis. One approach is synthe- sis of peptide complexes such as tetrabranched structures (four peptides linked by acids are replaced D-amino acids in the reverse sequence order, have also been devel-oped. Because human proteases cannot metabolize the D-amino acid peptides, these isomers have significantly enhanced stability but maintain the spatial positioning and biological activity of the original peptide [141, 142]. This method has been successfully used to generate a biologically active Bac2A isomer (RI-Bac2A) that was more resistant to proteolytic degradation and exhibited reduced toxicity [142]. A number of HDPs exhibit some degree of systemic toxicity, which may explain why most peptides in clinical trials are used topically. The toxicity may be because HDPs interact with numer- ous cell types in different ways resulting in a complex mode of action however, little research has actually been done to address this issue. Although toxicity was initially thought to be a result of membrane disruption leading to cytolysis, many HDPs interact with and translocate across eukaryotic membranes [75, 94, 113] without disrupting them. This is probably because eukaryotic membranes lack negatively charged lipids and the strong membrane potential gradient found in prokaryotic membranes, and contain cholesterol [57]. Anti-infective HDPs can and have been designed that are pro-tective in animal models of infection with little or no associated toxicity as is the case for IDR-1 [94]. Toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies must be carried out for HDPs in ex vivo human tissue mod- els and relevant animal models to determine the mechanism behind the toxicity during systemic administration as well as identify other potential side effects, the appropriate formulations and alternate routes of administration. Development of Resistance There was concern as to whether widespread use of directly antimicrobial HDPs would promote the development of peptide- resistance by pathogens to both the therapeutic and endogenous HDPs. Several bacterial species already possess HDP-resistance mechanisms such as secretion of peptidases and proteases and al- teration of surface charge [143].However, considering the broad target range exhibited by peptides it seems unlikely that the selec- tive pressure placed on the pathogens would be great enough to incur resistance. Furthermore, there is no evidence that resistance mechanisms are easily acquired [143, 144]. Nisin a well recognized HDP has been used as food preservative for years with no effect on an individual's ability to fight infections [144, 145]. Finally, the use of immunomodulatory peptides could circumvent this issue com- pletely as they target the immune response rather than the pathogen [94, 95]. CONCLUSION The emergence of MDR pathogens has resulted in an urgent need to develop novel antimicrobial therapies. As anti-infective agents, HDPs can be directly antimicrobial and/or immunomodula- tory. Thus, HDPs are unlikely to promote microbial resistance be-cause they disrupt multiple biological processes in the pathogen or target the host immune system rather than the pathogen. Further- more, HDPs can suppress the potentially harmful inflammation associated with infection. These properties make HDPs an attractive alternative in the treatment of MDR infections. Thousands of natu- ral and synthetic HDPs have been identified however, only a hand- fu l of HDPs have made into clinical trials and none approved for clinical use in part because of issues regarding cost of manufactur-ing, peptide stability and toxicity. Although more work is needed, substantial strides have been made in recent years to overcome these setbacks, and the future looks promising for the development and widespread use of peptides as therapeutics targeted to MDR pathogens.
