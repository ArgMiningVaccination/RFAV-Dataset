Regardless of whether an individual is authorized to telework or perform remote work, all DOD civilian employees and DOD contractor personnel with CRA must attest to their vaccination status by completing DD Form 3150. Civilian employees and contractor personnel who are unvaccinated for COVID-19 or who decline to attest to their COVID-19 vaccination status will be subject to COVID-19 screening testing weekly. Such civilian employees and contractor personnel who refuse required screening testing will be denied access to DOD facilities. Individuals other than visitors seeking access to facilities located on DOD installations but operated by other Federal Departments and Agencies will follow the policies and procedures of that other Department or Agency. Visitors will follow applicable policies and procedures of both DOD and the Department or Agency they are visiting.
