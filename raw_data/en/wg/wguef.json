New research has proven that by stimulating the pituitary gland to produce more HGH through natural HGH releasers, the signs of aging may be positively addressed! Benefits of youthful HGH levels: Enhanced fat loss Increased muscle mass * Higher energy levels * Enhanced sexual performance Greater cardiac function = Increased exercise performance Improved blood pressure * Younger-looking, thicker skin = Hair regrowth * Reduction in wrinkle appearance * Sharper vision Numerous studies corroborate the many benefits of increased HGH levels in the body.

To induce consumers to purchase Super HGH, defendants PCI, Teplitsky, and Karian have widely disseminated, or caused to be disseminated, advertisements, including but not limited to the attached Exhibits G, H, and I. These advertisements contain, among other things, the following statements and depictions: a. Radio Infomercial (Exhibit G, transcript, and Exhibit H, tape): NARRATOR: Welcome to the American Health Radio Show. Here's your host, Ron Turner. TURNER: Well, welcome to the show, Ron Turner with you. We have been hearing a lot lately about HGH but what do we actually know about it? . . . My guest today is Dr. Michael Teplisky, he's a medical doctor and nutritionist and he is a practicing physician in New York City. Dr. Teplisky, thanks for being with us on the program. TEPLITSKY: Well, it's always a pleasure to be a guest on your program. TWR: . . . HGH, very important it seems and maybe you can help us understand a little bit about what it is just by defining it for us, let's start there. TEPLITSKY: Sure, HGH stands for human growth hormone. The human growth hormone happens to be produced by the pituitary gland which is in control of practically all the other glands that make hormones . . TEPLITSKY: There are literally thousands of studies that have shown the positive effects of the human growth hormone on supplementation. . . . if we were to summarize the findings of those studies it truly sounds something out of a science fantasy. Because, for instance, most people who take growth hormone find that there is an increase, a 9 to 10 percent increase in muscle mass and muscle strength, something that normally doesn't happen as we get older, the reverse is true. There is a loss of fat, 14, 15 percent of fat loss without dieting, without doing anything- TURNER: Wow! TEPLITSKY: -- increased energy level, increased immune system function, improved healing, enhanced sexual performance, improved size and function of various internal organs, blood flow, memory, emotional stability, LDLBiDL, better looking skin, I mean, you name it, it seems like the whole body gets better and the reason for that is very simple, it turns out that growth hormone is not just important for growth, its main function is repair and maintenance of the cell . . . as we get older and growth hormone levels go down, many things remain unrepaired which leads, which leads to the process that we call normal aging. . . TURNER: Now, as we are youths, we know that there is obviously an abundance of this human growth hormone in our systems that is being produced. But at what point does it actually start declining in numbers that speed up that process? TEPLITSKY: . . . So the natural decline in the growth hormone production leads to the situation where you see 40, 50 year olds whose levels are way older what they should be, according to their age group. TURNER: What are the other symptoms that we would see to show that we have the lower HGH levels, or are not as high as they should be? TEPLITSKY: If you look at the symptoms of the human growth hormone deficiency, you find that they mimic exactly those symptoms of the normal aging, declining muscle mass, increasing fat, reduced circulation, reduced brain function, reduced immune system, reduced healing, hair loss, all the things that we associate with the aging process have been attributed to the declining levels of the human growth hormone, and that's why it's very interesting that replacing human growth hormone will reverse all those symptoms. TURNER: If you're just joining us, we're speaking with Dr. Michael Teplisky. Dr. Teplisky is a medical doctor and nutritionist and practicing physician in New York City. . . Doctor, there are some folks who are on human growth hormone therapy, very expensive for them because they're getting ilijections. You explain that a little bit? TEPLITSKY: Well, I happen to have some experience in that because I've been using injectable growth hormones too, in my practice. The reason for that is growth hormone is a protein in nature, it's a combination of 196 amino acids, which makes it a big molecule, and as such it cannot be taken orally. So the only way, up until recently, that a person could get extra growth hormone was by taking an injection. And, its pretty expensive, a little over a hundred dollars a week and that does put it effectively out of the range of most people and that's why I'm pretty excited about other opportunities to increase the level of growth hormone but that do not require the injections and of course the expenditure . . . TURNEiR: Doctor, you've used a particular formula in your practice called Super HGH, and your patients have had some experiences with that. Would you tell us a little bit about what you have found, in your own practice? TEPLITSKY: With both injectable with the homeopathic Super HGH I have found that the levels went up. The first thing that happened in most people is that they just feel better. And then if he or she is overweight there is invariably some weight loss, more in some people less in others, there is always, there is always an improvement in the muscle strength, especially if they also do any kind of physical activity. . . Energy level improves, and almost invariably there was an increase in libido, sexual performance, the skin gets better. You know the problem as you become older your skin becomes thinner, and wrinkled, and the reason is, the skin no longer retains the water. Growth hormone, and one of the actions of the growth hormone is to bring the water back into the skin and keep it nice and soft and young looking. And the result is that the skin just looks better. TURNER: Am I hearing kind of like a face lift in a bottle? TEPLITSKY: That's right, that's exactly right. In fact, a couple of people who come to me, they want to get younger, they want to look better, and they come to get the growth hormone replacement and the patient will have the sugery and I always tell them to wait for the surgery, because you may find that you do not need it and very often that is exactly right. TURNER: Lily, hang in there, we're going gonna get to you. Ed stay there. We're going to get to Eric right now, Eric's on a cell phone. Hi, Eric, thanks for calling into the program. * * * ERIC: How do I order it? TURNER: Okay, I was going to give you the number, here it is, 888 454 3224. And if you mention this broadcast they'll give you a very special offer if you order 2 bottles of Super HGH they'll give you a third one absolutely free, that's about $33 bucks a month, savings compared to the typical cost, there's some out there for $80 to $100 a month.

Plus make sure that you ask them for the book, \"Ten Weeks to a Younger You,\" you'll get that absolutely free with your order as well but do mention this broadcast. LILY: Hi, I was calling, I had the same question as Eric about where to get the product, I'm 48 and I've usually a lot of energy, but I want more mental energy. TEPLITSKY: Well, it helps too, any kind of mental energy, that gets definitely better also. People say their memory improves, their retention improves, mood becomes better, even sleep becomes better, even vision improves, you know, anything has to do with the brain gets better. TURNER: Doctor, through the use of the homeopathic spray, the Super HGH, what other types of benefits have you seen, through your practice? TEPLITSKY: All sorts sf benefits, and most of them, along the lines of the benefits that we have discussed previously, such as improved muscle tone, improved body shape because there is a loss of fat, loss of cellulite, you know, that cellulite that everyone is trying to do something about, this gets better, mental clarity, improved memory, improved retention, concentration, mood is better, sleep is better, vision improves, some people say there is regrowth of hair, didn't work for me- TLTRNER: [chuckles] TEPLITSKY: --I've been hylng. Healing. Healing gets so much better, if you cut yourself, older people don't usually heal as fast as the younger one, it definitely gets better, I have so many people, well, not so many, close to 50, who got chronic bruises who got so much better, using the growth hormone, the function of internal organs, there are many studies showing let's say that people with congestive heart failure will benefit from growth hormone supplementation, heart gets better, heart muscle gets stronger, it pumps the blood better, a lot better, circulation improves, many people who are trying or struggling to keep their cholesterol normal find that it is a lot easier when they take the HGH. So these are the findings that are pretty typical if you look at the studies of human growth hormone, you find that pretty much every aspect of human body, every function gets better when you supplement human growth hormone, and this is basically what I've seen in my practice as well. TURNER: Doctor, thanks so much for all of your research, for being on with us today. We look forward to having you on again in another program. TEPLITSKY: Thank you, Ron, always a pleasure.

Upselling by GAP 24. In numerous instances, GAP and Karian, through their telemarketing staff, have attempted to \"upsell\" consumers. \"Upselling\" is a telemarketing technique whereby the seller solicits the purchase of additional goods or services following an initial transaction during a single telephone call. The telemarketer submits charges for upsold products to the credit card provided during the initial transaction. 25. Advertising for GAP products provides a telephone number where consumers can place orders. In many instances, when a consumer calls to place an order for an advertised product, such as Ultimate HGH or Fat Blaster, GAP'S telemarketing staff immediately asks for the consumer's name, address, and credit card number and expiration date. Once it has acquired the consumer's account information and completed this initial sales transaction, GAP'S telemarketing staff attempts to upsell two separate products. 26. First, the telemarketing staff announces that it has placed the consumer on GAP'S \"prefened customer program.\" The telemarketing staff member advises that the program is free and simply guarantees that the consumer will obtain the lowest price on the product just purchased; that he/she will receive a free quarterly newsletter; and that - 23 - the product guarantee will be extended from 30 to 90 days. The telemarketer states that the program is \"designed to have the product shipped out to you every 90 days,\" or \"designed to have the product shipped and billed to the credit card every 90 days.\" It states that if the consumer does not want that, they can call the customer service number, which is provided, to cancel. 27. The telemarketer does not identify what account will be charged for continuity shipments with sufficient specificity for the consumer to understand. It does not disclose material terrns and conditions of the negative option feature; for example, although it states that shipments will occur and sometimes states that charges will be submitted for payment \"every 90 days,\" it does not identify the date fkorn which the initial 90-day period will start to run. Finaliy, it neither seeks nor obtains the consumer's consent to be billed for the continuity shipments. Thus, although the telemarketing staff provides a customer service number to cancel the program, defendants fail to make clear that it is essential for the consumer to write down the number because the defendants will make further charges to the account unless the customer calls that number to cancel. Instead, unless the consumer affirmatively refuses the offer, the telemarketer enrolls hidher into an automatic shipment program whereby helshe is charged for an additional 90-day supply of product every 90 days. 28. Billing statements demonstrate that unless the consumer calls to cancel the continuity program, the defendants place a charge on the consumer's credit accounts for a continuity shipment approximately 90 days after the initial shipment. - 24 - 29. Thereafter, the telemarketing staff momces that it is sending the consumer an \"absolutely free\" one-month supply of a separate product, the Liquid Master Multi dietary supplement. The telemarketer then says that if the consumer likes the product, \"within one month of the day you receive this package,\" GAP can send out a full supply of the product. It explains that if the consumer does not like the Liquid Master Multi, the consumer can call and so advise them, but if the customer likes Liquid Master Multi, GAP \"could\" send out a full supply every three months or every 90 days. In some instances, the telemarketer states that the price for future Liquid Multi shipments will be $59.90; in other instances, it does not identi@ a price. In fact, bills show that it charges $59.90 for the prod~~ct plus $5.95 for shipping and handling. 30. The telemarketer does not disclose truthfully the total costs to purchase Liquid Master Multi. It does not disclose all material terms and conditions of the free-to- pay conversion feature of the Liquid Master Multi program, specifically, the dates that charges will be submitted for payment and the specific steps the consumer must take to avoid those charges. It does not seek or obtain the consumer's consent to this free-to-pay conversion transaction. The telemarketer does not obtain from the consumer the last four digits of the card to be charged. Instead, unless the consumer affirmatively refuses the offer, the telemarketer enrolls the consumer in the free-to-pay conversion program. 3 1. Billing statements demonstrate that unless the consumer calls to cancel future shipments of Liquid Master Multi, the defendants placed charges for the product approximately one month after the initial shipment and 90 days thereafter. - 25 - SECTIONS 5 AND 12 OF THE FTC ACT 32.

In 1994, Congress directed the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe rules prohibiting abusive and deceptive telemarketing acts or practices pursuant to the Telemarketing Act, 15 U.S.C. $5 6101-6108. On August 16, 1995, the FTC adopted the Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 3 10, which became effective on December 3 1, 1995 (\"'Original TSR). Commencing in 1999, the Commission conducted a rule review to evaluate the effectiveness of the Original TSR in protecting consumers fi-om deceptive and abusive telernarketing practices. 68 Fed. Reg. 4580,4581. The rule review identified marketplace changes, including an increase in preacquired account telemarketing and upselling, that gave rise to a need for additional provisions to curtail abusive or deceptive practices.

Youth :28 (GA99D114) ULTIMATE HGH Exhibit 4, p. 1 PROCEEDINGS - - - - - CD-ROM - ULTIMATE HGH MALE ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the American Health Radio Show. Here's your host, Ron Turner. RON TTJRNER: Well, welcome to another great program. Ron Turner with you. We have an exciting show for you today. You ready for this? What if you could live to be 100 years of age in as healthy and vigorous condition as you are now? Or if you already suffer from the ill effeccs of aging, you could turn back the clock 20 to 30 years. Well, according to my guest, it's absolutely possible, incredible though it may seerh. We're going to be discussing groundbreaking research proving that aging cannot only be stopped but can actually be reversed, and one of the solutions may be as simple as taking a supplement that can cause your body to lose unwanted fat and cellulite, build muscle, remove wrinkles, improve skin elasticity, increase memory retention, cardio output, immune function and improve vision. Well, if you're just joining us, you certainly don't want to touch that dial because today's show could literally change your life. My guess is Stephan Karian, Senior Editor of Great American Health and Nutrition and Director of Research at Great American Products. Stephan, thanks for being with us on the STEPHAN KARIAN: Ron, it's a pleasure. * * * RON TURNER: Okay. Now, there has been a lot 5 of press on HGH. You mentioned that earlier, too, and 6 just now. Let's talk about exactly what that is, what it 7 does. STEPHAN KARIAN: Well, HGH stands for human growth hormone. * * * This is a hormone that's responsible for growing the body. * * * STEPHAN KARIAN: Yeah. You know, if we can increase our life span, but the quality of our life span, 10, 20, 30 years, then this is something we definitely need to look at. And I read that one of the world- leading experts who was on the Oprah Winfrey Show was quoted as saying that, you're going to reach a stage of adulthdod at about 45 and stay there for another 50 to 60 years, and this is the next technology, the next paradigm of health care. And HGH, along with the 28,000 studies that back it up, has been shown to be the most pronounced. I'm talking the most distinctive where you can see the different results in anywhere from six to eight weeks -- RON TURXiEi.: Waw, that's a -- STEPM KARIAN: -- for people. RON TURNER: -- very, very short period of time. How do the higher levels of HGH actually reverse the aging process? What signs can we see? STEPHAN KARIAN: HGH stimulates the growth, the rejuvenation of a cell. As a matter of fact, Dr. Hertoag (phonetic) -- he's a physician. RON TURNER: Um-hum. STEPHAN KARIAN: Out of 48 adults in his study taking HGH, he showed that 75 percent of adults'had the sagging of the cheeks, the sagging got denser. Less wrinkles 71 percent of the time. People that had pouches under the eyes were less visible 65 percent of the time. Loose skin folds under the chin tightened -- RON TURNER: WOW. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- 62 percent of the time. You have a strengthening of your muscle, the fat decreases significantly, improving cardio output. Sexual performance is significantly enhanced. RON TURNER: Wow. STEPKTLN KARIAN: You rejuvenate the body. RON' TURNER: Um-hum. STEPKAN KARIAN: Restoring of the hair and the hair color. These are some of the anecdotal -- RON TURNER: Um-hum.

RON TURNER: memory. RON TURNER: Urn-hum. STEPHAIT And wound healing enhancement. RON TURXER: Yeah. STEPHAN KARIAN: Improving of bone mass. Now, there are over 28,000 studies, Ron, that support this. This is not some, you know, hocus pocus science over here. RON TURXER: Right, right. STEPW I(ARIAPJ: We're talking about naturally stimulating the release of HGH in the body. RON TURNER: Urn-hum. STEPHAN KARIAN: And if we can naturally increase the levels of HGH in the body, we can see a whole turnaround -- distinctive turnaround for people in their appearance, in the way that they feel -- RON TURNER: Urn-hum. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- in their quality of life and their step-to-it-ness. RON TURNER: Yeah, yeah. STEPHAN KARIAN: Their punch in life. RON TURNER: Urn-hum. Exhibit A, p. 5 1 STEP-mu' wIIii,j : You iiteraiiy issk younger, in 2 some cases 10, 20, 30 years younger. 3 RON TURNER: Wow. 4 STEPHAN KARIAN: HGH is almost like having 5 plastic surgery for your body -- 6 RON TURNER: Yeah, yeah. 7 STEPHAN KARIAN: -- without getting an incision. RON TURNER: WOW. STEPHAN KARIAN: According to Daniel Rudman, or Dr. Rudman, in the New England Journal of Medicine, and he reported this in 1990, he showed that there was an 8.8 percent increase in muscle mass on average after six months without exercise. And in addition to that -- RON TUFLNER: Wow. STEPKFN KARIAN: -- a 14 -4 percent loss of fat -- RON TURNER: Um-hum. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- on average after six months without dieting. RON TURNER: Wow. STEPHAN KARIAN: In addition to that, the muscles in your face get stronger -- RON TURNER: Yeah. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- so thus, it looks like you had a face lift. RON TURNER: WOW, look Out, girls. Exhibit A, p. 6 STEPW- --KARIAN: If you' re just joining us, once again, I'm speaking with Stephan Karian, Senior Editor of Great American Health and Nutrition and Director of Research at Great American Products. We're calking about aging and anti-aging medicine. * * * HGH can be taken with injections, but I heard they're very, very expensive. Let's talk about that for a moment. * * * Is that it's very expensive and you're looking at about $1,000 a month -- \\RON TURNER: Wow. STEPHAN TURNER: Urn-hum. STEPHAN KARIAN: And it's an effective means of increasing your HGH levels. RON TURNER: Yeah. STEP- KARIAN: And if you look at the -- actually, in 1990, it was about $50,000 a year. So, the prices are coming down if you could afford $1,000 a month, which many people cannot. The good news is is that you don't have to rely on the injection to increase the HGH levels in the body. RON TURNER : Right . RON TURNER: There are nutrients that we can take that can stimulate the release of HGH in the body. Now, by taking amino peptides and amino acid supplements, specifically glutamine, along with the other amino acids, we can stimulate the release of HZH from the pituitary and actually increase the levels of HGH in the bloodstream. And by doing that, people are seeing some dramatic results. You literally see and feel a difference. * * * STEPHAN KARIAN: When I started taking this HGH formulation that I want to talk to you about called Ultimate HGH, it's made a huge difference for me. RON TURNER: Now, you've seen results relatively wick then, is what you're saying? STEPHAN KARIAN: Absolutely. RON TURNER: Okay. STEPKAN KAXIAN: This is really a breakthrough, and I'm talking about the results of wrinkling -- RON TURNER: Urn-hum. STEPM KARIAN: -- and aging. RON TURNER : Yeah . STEPKAN KARIAN: Feeling better and having that stamina. RON TURNER: Urn-hum. STEPHAN KARIAN: Having that pep in your step that you had when -- RON TURNER: Right, right. STEPKAN KARIAN: -- you were in your younger years. RON TURNER: Um-hum. STEF'm TmIJJg: I'm talking about making a noticeably considerable difference, and not only that, but also reducing body fat -- mass. Okay. RON TURNER: Yeah.

When you order two, you get the three. You get a three-month supply. When you order two bottles, you get the third one free. JEAN: Right. STEPW KARIAN: I wanted to make this where this was affordable to everyone. RON TURNER: Mmm, yeah. STEPKAN KARIAN: Because there's some comparable products out there that are costing people $100 a month. J: Um-hum. RON TURNER: . . .Hi, Mark, thanks for calling. Exhibit A, p. 9 XA-RX: Yes, I would like to know, does this also help to lower your cholesterol levels? STEPHAN WIAN: There actually have been studies with heart disease and cholesterol levels, and in addition to that, blood pressure levels. We're seeing people's cholesterol levels going down, the increasing of the good HGL cholesterols. Blood pressure, for those people with hypertension, are getting better readings. RON TUF.?XER : Um-hum. STEPHAN KARIAN: So, yes, for those people not just concerned about their cholesterol but also for cardio vascular benefits. RON TURNER: Urn-hum. STEPHAN KARIAN: And think about this, the hearc is a muscle and if we can rejuvenate the muscles and make them stronger -- RON TURNER: Yeah. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- what do you think that's going to do to the level of circulation in our body -- RON TURNER: Exactly. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- and making sure that our heart doesn ' t give away.

KAREN EDWARDS: Welcome to American Health. My guest is Stephan Karian, Senior Editor of Great American Health and Nutrition, and Director of: Research of Great American Products. Stefan, thanks for joining us today. STEPHAN KARIAN: Karen, thanks for having me. KAREN EDWARDS : We have a veFy fascinating subject today, HGH. Why don't you explain a little bit about what it is? STEPHAN KARIAN: Well, even before we go into that, Karen, let's look at anti-aging medicine. Let's take a contextual look at where anti-aging as a whole generation, where we're going. Anti-aging medicine is Exhibit B, p. 2 used in nutriceutics or nutritional therapies, using exercise, using hormones to slow down the effects of aging, to help us to live longer. And if you look at it, anti-aging medicine -- medical technology has been doubling every three-and-a-half years. KAREN EDWARDS : Wow. - -- - - Stephan- Kaz-iax- So- -t-hat--neans ir,- the sex*- 14 - years, we'll know 16 times more the medical technology than we will today. KAREN EDWARDS: Now, there's been a lot of press lately on HGH. Why don't you explain what it is and what it does? STEP= KARIAN: Sure. HGH is'getting a lot of attention. As a matter of fact, thousands of studies, articles and abstracts have been written on HGH. What HGH really is, it stands for Human Growth Homone. Human Growth Hormone is produced from the time we're born and it helps our body to grow our bones, to grow our muscles, to build itself up so that we can mature. In about our teens, we start peaking out in our HGH levels. Let me show you this charge over here and this gives us an idea. ON SCREEN: HGH Levels Decline chart Stephan Karian: At the time when we reach our teens, we find that our levels of HGH start to peak. At that point, your HGH levels drop dramatically -- Exhibit 3, p KAREN EDWARDS: Wow. Stephan Karian: -- over the next 10, 12 years. And from there on, it levels out 'ti1 about you're in your 60s, 70s and 80s. And we find that the first signs of aging are really symptoms of lowered HGH levels. KAREN EDWARDS: That's amazing. So, higher levels of HGH, then, actually can reverse the aging process or the effects of the aging process? What kind of signs do we see, then, other than some of the ones you've mentioned? Stephan Karian: Maybe your skin is more supple, the wrinkling is less. Your short-term memory is better. Your mental acuity and concentration is better. Your sexual energy is better; cardiac output is better; self-esteem is better; muscle tone is better; fat reduction is better without exercising. And I'm -- this is not just some highfalutin science here, Karen. I'm talking about study upon study upon study have shown and proved that RGH helps to reverse the effects of aging. ON SCREEN: American Health -NOTE Studies show higher levels of HGH help decrease body fat, reduce appearance of wrinkles, increase energy and more. STEPIiAN MIAN: And it wasn't until Dr. Daniel Rudrnan in 1990 showed in his groundbreaking article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine that we can reduce body fat by 14.4 percent after 6 months; we Exhibit B, p. 4 can increase muscle mass 8.8 percent after 6 months; we can increase cardio output, sexual output. We have anecdotal reports that hair regrowth was betcer. But even more important, when you see the signs of the aging of someone, what happens? They're a little gray. Maybe you see that they don't have that youthful spark -- KAREN EDWARDS: Right. In their eye. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- in their eye. What we found in that study by Dr. Daniel Rudman is that the participants in their 60s -- ON SCREEN: American Health NOTE Rudman, Daniel, M. D., New England Journal of Medicine, July, 1990. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- which at that point 80 percent of us are truly deficient in youthful levels of HGH, they stood upright. They had that punch in the eye. When you shook their hand, they had that vigor. And actually in a study he wrote that the effects of increasing the HGH levels to youthful levels was equivalent to reversing the aging process 10 to 20 years. KAREN EDWARL3S: Wow. Now, HGH can be taken with injections. Is that expensive? STEPKAN KARIAN: It's very expensive. It was about $50,000 a year. Exhibit B, p. 5 KAREN EDWARDS: Wow. STEPHAN KARIAN: And that's a lot of -- KAREN EDWARDS: That's a lot of money. S,TEPHAN KARIAN: It's a lot of money. And so, as a result, many people really weren't able to get the benefits of it. However, now it's only $12,000 a year, which is still expensive. KAREN EDWARDS: Oh, that sure is expensive. STEPHAN KTLRIAN: I mean, an extra $12,000 a year is a lot. But fortunately we're finding now that there's some other -- there's alternatives that we can use that can naturally increase the HGH levels and that's why I'm real excited to be on with you today because these are ways that we can do it and ways instead of the conventional facelifts and cosmetics and so forth. That really does not get to the root of the problem. All it does is mask the aging process. KAREN EDWARDS: Now, Stephen, you developed a product called Ultimate HGH. Why don't you explain a little bit about what makes this different from the other products? STEPW KARIAN: Gladly. Ultimate HGH is a secretagogue and that's a fancy term for a substance or nutrients that help to stimulate the release of HGH. And to give you a little history on it, aside from doing the injections where you're injecting the synthetic hormones, the other strategy to increase the HGH level is to Exhibit B, p. 6 1 stimulate the release of HGH that's already produced in 2 the body. 3 If you look at this chart over here, at the 4 base of the brain, right behind our nose, we have a gland 5 called the pituitary. By increasing the HGH output at 6 the base of the brain, it's released into the circulatory 7 system, picked up by the liver and then the liver 8 converts that into what's called Insulin Growth Factor 1 9 or IGF-1. That Insulin Growth Factor 1 is so importat 10 in rejuvenating the cells and Ultimate HGH is naturally 11 designed to support the increased levels of HGH without 12 hormones. So, just incredible what we're seeing by using 13 HGH or increasing the HGH levels in the body. 1 4 KAREN EDWARDS: Amazing. 15 ON SCREEN: Paragraph from letter I lost 125 pounds.

Choice Transcript of Radio Ad: Super HGH NARRATOR: Welcome to the American Health Radio Show. Here's your host, Ron Turner. TURNER: Well, welcome to the show, Ron Turner with you. We have been hearing a lot lately about HGH but what do we actually know about it? . . . My guest today is Dr. Michael Teplisky, he's a medical doctor and nutritionist and he is a practicing physician in New York City. Dr. Teplisly, thanks for being with us on the program. TEPLITSKY: Well, it's always a pleasure to be a guest on your program. TURNER: . . . HGH, very important it seems and maybe you can help us understand a little bit about what it is just by defining it for us, let's start there. TEPLITSKY: Sure, HGH stands for human growth hormone. The human growth hormone happens to be produced by the pituitary gland which is in control of practicaily ail the other glands that make hormones . . . TEPLITSKY: There are literally thousands of studies that have shown the positive effects of the human growth hormone on supplementation. . . . if we were to s~mmarize the findings of those studies it truly sounds something out of a science fantasy. Because, for instance, rnost people who take growth hormone find that there is an increase, a 9 to 10 percent increase in muscle mass and muscle strength, something that normally doesn't happen as we get older, the reverse is true. There is a loss of fat, 14, 15 percent of fat loss without dieting, without doing anything- TURNER: Wow! TEPLITSKY: -- increased energy level, increased immune system function, improved healing, enhanced sexual performance, improved size and function of various internal organs, blood flow, memory, emotional stability, LDL/HDL, Exhibit G, p. I better looking skin, I mean, you name it, it seems like the whole body gets better and the reason for that is very simple, it turns out that growth hormone is not just important for growth, its main function is repair and maintenance of the cell . . . . as we get older and growth hormone levels go down, many things remain unrepaired which leads, which leads to the process that we call normal aging. . . TURNER: Now, as we are youths, we know that there is obviously an abundance of this human growth hormone in our systems that is being produced. But at what point does it actually start declining in numbers that speed up that process? TEPLITSKY: . . . So the natural decline in the growth hormone production leads to the situation where you see 40, 50 year olds whose levels are way older what they should be, according to their age group. TUEWER: What are the other symptoms that we would see to show that we have the lower HGH levels, or are not as high as they should be? TEPLITSKY: If you look at the symptoms of the human growth hormone deficiency, you find that they mimic exactly those symptoms of the normal aging, declining muscle mass, increasing fat, reduced circulation, reduced brain function, reduced immune system, reduced healing, hair loss, all the things that we associate with the aging process have been attributed to the declining levels of the human growth hormone, ad that's why it's vepy interesting that replacing human growth hormone will reverse all those symptoms. TURNER: If you're just joining us, we're speaking with Dr. Michael Teplisky. Dr. Teplisky is a medical doctor and nutritionist and practicing physician in New York City. . . Doctor, there are some folks who are on human growth hormone therapy, very expensive for them because they're getting injections. You explain that a little bit? TEPLITSKY: Well, I happen to have some experience in that because I've been using injectable growth hormones too, in my practice. The reason for that is growth hormone is a protein in nature, it's a combination of 196 amino acids, which makes it a big molecule, and as such it cannot be taken orally. So the only way, up until recently, that a person could get extra growth hormone was by taking an injection. And, its pretty expensive, a little over a hundred dollars a week and that does put it effectively out of the range of most people and that's why I'm pretty excited about other opportunities to increase the level of growth Exhibit G, p. 2 hormone but that do not require the injections and of course the expenditure . . TTJRNEIP: Doctor, you've used a particular formula in your practice called Super HGH, and your patients have had some experiences with that. Would you tell us a little bit about what you have found, in your own practice? TEPLITSKY: With both injectable with the homeopathic Super HGH I have found that the levels went up. The first thing that happened in most people is that they just feel better. And then if he or she is overweight there is invariably some weight loss, more in some people less in others, there is always, there is always an improvement in the muscle strength, especially if they also do any lund of physical activity. . . Energy level improves, and almost invariably there was an increase in libido, sexual perfomance, the skin gets better. You know the problem as you become older your skin becomes thinner, and wrinkled, and the reason is, the skin no longer retains the water. Growth hormone, and one of the actions of the growth hormone is to bring the water back into the slun and keep it nice and soft and young looking. And the result is that the skin just looks better. TURNER: Am I hearing kind of like a face lift in a bottle? TEPLITSKY: That's right, that's exactly right. In fact, a couple of people who come to me, they want to get younger, they want to look better, and they come to get the growth hormone replacement and the patient will have the surgery and I always tell them to wait for the surgery, because you may find that you do not need it and very often that is exactly right. TURNER: Lily, hang in there, we're going gonna get to you. Ed stay there. We're going to get to Eric right now, Eric's on a cell phone. Hi, Eric, thanks for calling into the program. ERIC: How do I order it? TURNER: Okay, I was going to give you the number, here it is, 888 454 3224. And if you mention this broadcast they'll give you a very special offer if you order 2 bottles of Super HGH they'll give you a third one absolutely free, that's about Exhibit G, p. 3 $33 bucks a month, savings compared to the typical cost, there's some out there for $80 to $100 a month. There is 100% money back guarantee so at the end of 90 days, if you don't feel this has worked for you, send it back and get your money back.

LILY: Hi, I was calling, I had the same question as Eric about where to get the product, I'm 48 and I've usually a lot of energy, but I want more mental energy. TEPLITSKY: Well, it helps too, any kind of mental energy, that gets definitely better also. People say their memory improves; their retention improves, mood becomes better, even sleep becomes better, even vision improves, you know, anything has to do with the brain gets better. TmR: Doctor, through the use of the homeopathic spray, the Super HGH, what other types of benefits have you seen, through your practice? TEPLITSKY: All sorts of benefits, and most of them, along the lines of the benefits that we have discussed previously, such as improved muscle tone, improved body shape because there is a loss of fzt, loss of cellulite, you know, that cellulite that everyone is trying to do something about, this gets better, mental clarity, improved memory, improved retention, concentration, mood is better, sleep is better, vision improves, some people say there is regrowth of hair, didn't work for me- TURNER: [chuckles] TEPLITSKY: --I've been trying. Healing. Healing gets so much better, if you cut yourself, older people don't usually heal as fast as the younger one, it definitely gets better, I have so many people, well, not so many, close to 50, who got chronic bruises who got so much better, using the growth hormone, the function of internal organs, there are many studies showing let's say that people with congestive heart failure will benefit from growth hormone supplementation, heart gets better, heart muscle gets stronger, it pumps the blood better, a lot better, circulation improves, many people who are trying or struggling to keep their cholesterol normal find that it is a lot easier when they take the HGH. So these Exhibit G, p. 4 are the findings that are pretty typical if you look at the studies of human growth hormone, you find that pretty much every aspect of human body, every function gets better when you supplement human growth hormone, and this is basically what I've seen in my practice as well. TWR: Doctor, thanks so mch for all of your research, for being on with us today. We look forward to having you on again in another program. TEPLITSKY: Thank you, Ron, always a pleasure.

Ahysician's Choice E-Newsletter A FREE publication by b~o:llwww.PhvsiciansChoice.net From the Desk of Michael Teplisky, M.D. ........................................................................ Hello my friend, I hope this finds you in good health. Human Growth Hormones is getting a great deal of attention lately. Can it really do all it promises? Read on to find out just what the benefits to you can be! Yours in wished to rum back he? To feel stronger, lose that middle-aged spread, have fewer aches and pains, or just look a few years younger. For most of us, the ever-elusive fountain of youth remains a mystery, a myth. We find temporary ways to have these youth-restoring advantages for our outward appearance, but still search for ways to have that youthful exuberance inside. +. Why not have it all? You can regain that energy and zest for life you once had and at an age when you em appreciate and make the most of it. As we get older we experience those pesky changes in appearance that we most hope to avoid. Our hair starts to thin out and our waist starts to thicken. We find our memory, concentration and libido (sex drive) subsiding and our aches, pains and wrinkled skin taking over our bodies. It is possible to grow older without aging. Growing older simply means that you have lived more years. Aging means a slow deterioration of function, appearance and body composition. Aging is a process of Exhibit 9: p. 1 - --BL- -. becoming frail, sick, weak and unable to take care of yourself, with death as the final - \"- outcome. .---- Well, let me share with you something so revolutionary that most people initially refuse to accept it: \"getting older does not equal aging.\" What if I toid you that you could grow older and not lose your present vitality, appearance and function? Or, if you are no longer young, that you could feel the way you did 10 to 20 years ago. As Hormone Levels Decline, Health Can Too One of the major contributing factors to the process of aging is the declining level of certain key hormones. Latest scientific research shows that the body's maintenance, repair and regulating systems are damaged as these hormones drop to low levels. According to Vladimir Dilman, Ph-D., \"hormones are vital for repairing and regulating our bodily functions. 14s we age.. . the body produces lower levels of hormones, which can result in disastrous effect, inciuding the decline of self-repair and self-regulation\" and also that increased hormonal levels \"help to reset the body's hormonal clock and thus can reverse or delay the effects of aging.\" By far the most important among these hormones is the Hurnan Gro~Homone - - (HGH), whkh is produced naturally by the pituitary gland. This hormone was named \"growth hormone\" because the highest levels of production come during adolescence when our bodies grow at their fastest rate. Because of this link, HGH was initially used as a treatment for children who were failing to grow properly because of a hormone. Later it was discovered that HG'H affected more than normal growth patterns, it also regulated other body hctions such as tissue repair, injury recover, cell replacement, organ health, bone stren_@h, brain function and the overall health of nails, hair and skin. The single most abundant hormone produced in the body, HGH literally affects almost every cell in our bodies. It is effective preventing and eliminating many common conditions resulting from aging such as decreases in flexibility, bone strength, and skin elasticity; hair loss and thinning; and decreases in the irmnune system and mental function, and sexual dysfunction. HGH is responsible for the health and vitality associated with our youth. ~bu Can Regain Your Youth When we are teenagers our levels of HGH are at their highest - reaching 1,000 to 1,100 ndml between the ages of 13 and 16 years. By the age of 18 those levels can drop to 700, while those of 40-year-olds can sink to 400-500. By the time we reach the age of 55, HGH levels have fallen to an alarming 90-225. I have seen many 40 and 50 year olds whose levels were under 1 OO! In most studies concerning HGH, the goal was to achieve a level that is consistent with a healthy 40-year-old or somewhere around 400-500 ng,/rnl. 1 is safe to say that most people over 40 need some help in raising their HGH levels and if you are over 50, YOU definitely require supplementation. One clinical study showed that 75% of those tested experienced an increase In potency and libido when HGH levels were effectively raised. HGH has come to be known as an aphrodisiac; restoring sexual potency and improving overall sexual function and greater ability to attain and enjoy orgasms. Women have reportedly experienced a marked Exhibit I, p.2 increase in arousal, enjo)?nent of sexual intercourse and the ability to achieve multiple orgasms. Men also experience increased arousal and libido. In addition, they have been able to attain more frequent, successful erections. Numerous studies have shown that HGH promotes a feeling of wellness and vigor; many older couples who have successfully raised their HGH levels often report feeling like newlyweds again! Plus, this feeling of well-being is not limited to only physical qualities. Incredibly, even the symptoms of depression improve once HGH levels are successfully elevated. HGH helps uplift mood and improve mental focus, concentration and brings relief from stress. Raising your body's HGH levels may also help to reduce the frequency of illnesses requiring hospitalization and increase immune system function and longevity. The decline of HGH, fortunately, is neither irreparable, nor permanent. We can now control our hormonal levels. Lireraiiy thousands of medical studies have shown that HGH may actually reverse the symptoms of what we think of as \"nomal aging.\" Edmmd Chein, h4D has said that HGH is \"the only hormone that can actually reverse all the parameters of biological aging.\" After six months of HGH supplements, HGH-deficient adults involved in a Swedish study, lost 20% body fat. Most of this fat loss occurred in the abdomen. Large amounts of abdominal fat are stiongly correiated'with increased incidences of heart attack, hypertension @gh blood pressure) and diabetes. HGH increases the process of fat burning, utilizing fat as fuel for energy production. This helps speed up your metabolism, giving you more energy and helps to naturally slim down the hips, thighs, waist, buns and abdomen. Thousands of studies confirm that HGH can prevent and even reverse the aging process. According to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, taking growth hormone for just six months produced the equivalent of 10 to 20 years of a*g reversal. Dr. Julian Whitaker of California prescribes HGH for his elderly patients and even takes it himself. \"I have not seen anythrng that even comes close to the restorative power of HGH supplementation,\" Dr. Wbitaker said. He fuirher states that HGH is mosr effective in combatki~ the effects of.chronic diseases that involve muscle wasting: stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and even AIDS. A study performed at the Palm Springs Life Extension Insitute reported that signi5cant improvements in new hair gowth, skin appearance, muscle strength and mass, wound healing, joint flexibility, and arthritis symptoms were seen in participants after taking HGH supplements for as little as one month. What Can HGE Actually Do for You? Some established benefits of HGH: 14.4% average fat loss after only 6 month -without dieting 8 .S% average increase in muscle lass after only 6 month - without exercising Younger, more elastic, thicker skin Re-growth and thickening of hair ., Disappearance of winkles : - --r Increase in energy levels -=- Enhanced sexual performance Y- Re-growth of heart, liver, spleen, kidneys and other organs that naturally shrink with age Greater cardiac output Superior immune function Increased ability to perform exercises Better function of the kidneys Lowered blood pressure Improved cholesterol profile - hi@er HDL (good) and lower LDL (bad) levels Stronger bones Faster healing of wounds Elimination of cellulite Sharper vision and hearing Faster wound repair Mood elevation and stability Improved sleep patterns and quality Increased memory retention The word ''hornone\" may have negative connotations for many people. We've all - heard too many stories about people using hormones indiscriminately and developing ail kinds of problems as a result. However, there is a reason why the body goes to a great , deal of trouble to produce various hormones. Hormones are essential to good health and longevity. It is not a coincidence that when we have the highest levels of hormones, usually in our 205, we are also in the best of health. Speciai organs, called endocrine glands, produce hornones in our Sodies. Each hormone has a number of functions. Some hormones you may be more familiar with include estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, thyroid hormone and others. By far, the most important is HGH. It is produced by the pituitary gland and has such a wide range of beneficial effects on the body that some experts refer to it as \"the fountain of youth.\" How Can You Boost Your EGR Levels? A nutritional, low-fat and low-starch diet along with regular aerobic exercise will help promote HGH production. However, this is not enough to experience the age- reversing effects of HGH. The body must be stimulated into producing HGH levels similar to those when we were younger. Until now, the only reliable way to increase your HGH levels was to take daily injections. Besides the incredible inconvenience, it was also quite expensive, costing as much as $12,000 annually. Now, you can take advantage of a remarkable product that comes in an easy-to-swallow spray. Super HGH TM W omeopathic Orai Spray cootaim a special blend of nutrients that support your pituitary gland to naturally produce higher amounts of HGH.

Here's your host, Ron Turner. RON TURNER: Well, welcome to the program. We've got a great show lined up for you today. Stay tuned, especially if you're interested in losing those extra pounds. Well, today, we're going to discuss ways that you can rid yourself of those love handles once and for all. In fact, by the end of this show, you're going to learn of a metabolic advantage that will allow you to lose weight -- are you ready for this -- regardless of your caloric intake. Eow, you' 11 succeed even though you may have always been hungry, tired, depressed, even unsuccessful in other diets, and you won't need willpower. Wow, sounds pretty amazing. My guest today is Stephan Karian, Senior Editor of Great Fmerican Health and Nutrition, and Director of Research at rea at American Products. Stephan, thanks for being with us on the program. STEPHAN K.?JlIAN: Ron, it's a pleasure. RON TURNER: Why is it so difficult for Americans to lose weight? Exhibit J, p. STEPHAN KARIIIN: Well, I think the conventional notion that we intake a greater amount of calories than what we burn off is somewhat true, and I think there's, you know, a lot of applications in that consideration as far as weight loss is concerned. But you know what, Ron, there is some breakthrough information for people that have just been frustrated, even though they've tried all these diets, they've tried some of these low-calorie diets -- RON TURNER: Right. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- and they found it just has not worked. * * * STEPHAN KARIAN: . . . You need to reduce the carbohydrate intake. And one of the ways that you can do that, there's a specific nutrient called garcinia cambogia. Are you I'm not. KARIAN: Garcinia cambogia is a very key component in helping to reduce this process. The extract of the garcinia cambogia fruit is hydroxy citric acid, HCA. JULIO: Okay. STEPm KARIAN: HCA has been studied since the early 1970s in reducing the conversion of glucose to triglycerides, and if we can do that, we can reduce fat And significant studies -- Dr. Pontay (phonetic) out in Hilton Head did a study with participants that showed simply by supplementing with the garcinia extract with some chromium, which also is a key to unlocking the insulin resistance, at one point, when people get really obese, what happens is the insulin is not even able to convert your glucose into fat. * * * RON TURNER: Now, I can tell you, Julio, that there is a product out there that Stephan has developed and put together, actually, that includes this garcinia carnbogia -- JULIO: Uh-huh. RON TURNER: -- and it's called Fat Blaster, very simple. And you can pick that up. Let me give you this 800 number. JULIO: Sure. RON TURNER: Do you -- you ready? Write this down. JULIO: Yes. RON TURNER: It's 800 -- JULIO: 800. RON TURNER: -- 242 -- 1223. JULIO: 1223. STEPHAN KAFLIAN: And another aspect about that, Exhibit J, p. 3 in the Fat Blaster that Ron was talking about, not only do you get your garcinia cambogia, but you aLso get citrus aurantium. Studies have shown that it can help increase your metabolism, the rate at which you burn off calories -- RON TURNER: Um-hum. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- metabolically without making you jittery, without giving you any side effects or any of that other stuff. RON TUWR: Well, that's key. STEP- KARIAN: That's very key. RON TUXNER: Yeah. STEPHAN KARIAN: With the Fat Blaster, you can eat the typical foods that you would not be able to eat and you'll effectively be eating a lower carbohydrate diet -- RON TURNER: Mrnm. STEPKAN XARIAN: -- because your body is taking more of that glucose -- RON TURNER: Yeah. STEPHAN KARIAN: -- converting it into glycogen, which your body, over the years, has been more resistant to dc so. RON TURNER: Yeah, yeah. STEPKAN KF-RIAN: The results are fast. Now, I'm not saying unhealthy fast, but dramatically fast. Exhibit J, p RON TURNER: Wow. Let's go to Serine. Hi, Serine, thanks for calling in. You have some amazing testimony here. Let's talk about your experience with Fat Blaster. SERINE: Oh, Fat Blaster is awesome. RON TURNER: Um-hum. SERINE: It is -- I have tried everything, done everything. After I had my two children, I just could not seem to lose weight. And after trying the Fat Blaster, I have been on it going on two weeks now and I've almost lost 10 pounds. RON TURNER: Wow. STEPHAT5J KARIAN: That's amazing. SERINE: Yeah. RON TURNER: In how many weeks? SERINE: Less than two weeks. RON TURNER: WOW. STEPHAN KARIAW: HOW fast did you notice results? When did you -- I mean, when did you start noticing it? SERINE: Well, I actually started taking it religiously on a Wednesday. RON TURNER: Um-hum. SERINE: And by that Friday, I had lost four pounds. RON TURNER: Wow. Exhibit J, p. STEPHAN KARIAN: It's significant, Ron. SERINE: Oh, yes. RON TURNER: KARIAN: This is significant. RON TURNER: Um-hum. STEPHAN KARIAN: Not only will you help stop -- stop the production of fat in the body -- RON TURNER : Right. STEPHAN MIAN: -- but you'll have more energy as well. RON TURNER: What has it done for your energy? Do you feel more perked up? SERINE: Oh, definitely. RON TURNER: Really? SERINE: By the time I get home, I had been dead to the world and couldn't do anything. But with this, I actually -- can actually wash the clothes, feed the kids. RON TURNER: Oh, wow. So, after a full day's work, you're still up and ready to go. SERINE: Definitely. RON TURNER: That's incredible, that's wonderful. Now, so, you've been on it just less than two weeks, you 've lost. 10 pounds. Have you changed what you're eating? SERINE: To tell you the truth, not really. RON TURNER: Really? 1 SERINE: I still go to lunch with my friends at 2 work and we eat what we want and I just don't eat as much 3 of it. I'm just not as hungry. RON TURNER: Urn-hum. SERINE: After taking it about 30 minutes 6 before IT@ meals -- 7 RON TURNER: Um-hum. 8 STEPHAN KARIAN: -- I might take about four or 9 five bites and I'm like, I really could do without that. RON TURNER: Wow. SERINE: But after a while. you just don't want 12 it anymore. 13 RON TURNER: So, it has, indeed, suppressed 14 your appetite? 15 SERINE: Oh, yeah, definitely.

When our body digests carbohydrates they are converted first to sugar and then to energy and fat. Even though YOU may eat a low-fat diet, if the foods are high in carbohydrates, you may still actually gain fat rapidly. Hydroxycitric Acid (HCA), found in a fruit called Garcinia Cambogia, has been shown to help inhibit the conversion of carbohydrates to fat. As a result, carbohydrates may get converted into energy more readily! Along with Garcinia Cambogia, Citrus Aurantium (bitter orange extract) is a weight loss enhancer. It has a thermogenic effsct, meaning the metaboiic rate in the body is increased and more calories are burned.

Exhibit L, p. 1 4/1/2C 1 f siv: An American Epidemic Page 1 of 3 Obesity: An American Epidemic Obesity plagues the.nation as a leading risk factor for heart disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension and depression Do you have a weight problem? You are not alone. An average American gains between one-half pound to one pound every ear. According to some estimates, almost one out of every 3 adults in the United States (about 97 million people) are classified s overweight or obese. This is almost double what it was in 1960, which means that more of us are getting heavier. An alarming trend is that weight roblems begin earlier in life than ever before. Millions of kids are 0veIWeight and research shows that obese children are very ikely to become obese adults. Why this emphasis on obesity? For most people it's just a matter of nd looking as good as they would like. The reai problem of obesity is that it poses serious dangers to your health. The Impact of Obesity on Health Last year the American Heart Association (AHA) officially recognized obesity as a definite risk factor for heart disease. The , National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), after a 3-year review of medical studies, concluded that obesity is associated with: e Cancer of the breast, uterus, prostate and colon Depression Diabetes Gallbladder disease Heart Disease Hypertension Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides Incontinence Osteoarthritis Pregnancy complications Sleep apnea In other words, most of our life-threatening heaith problems are associated with excess weight. Shedding those extra pounds will not only help you look good, more importantly, it will help prevent serious medical conditions. Treatment for Obesity First of all, set realistic objectives. The latest guidelines refiect the goal of rapidly losing weight in a short period of time. The current recommendation is to achieve a 5-1 0% reduction in body weight over a six-month period and every six months thereafter until you've reached your ideal body weight. A 5-10% weight reduction every six months is more achievable, sustainable and sufficient enough to reduce the risk of associated diseases. Gradual and steady weight loss will lead to better blood sugar control, lower blood pressure, decreased cholesterol and less stress on weight-bearing joints.. The next consideration is how do you actually lost the weight? Here we rely on the same tried and true method - eating less and exercising more to bum more calories. Unfortunately, this requires lifestyle changes. It takes. a lot of patience, support and perseverance to make permanent changes. What is the \"YO-YO\" Syndrome? Most people have tried numerous diets without success. The dieting results in the dreaded \"yo-yo\" syndrome. The \"yo-yo\" syndrome begins when you start a diet, iose some weight, go off the diet and then gain back all of the weiaht vnu tnst. sometimes even more weight. Over time it becomes more and more difficult to Ioseeven a few bric - . - .. . Exhibit L, p. 2 W1/2( ;ity: An American Epidemic Page 2 of 3 reduction. Clearly, this is not the way to do it. In order to lose 5-10% of your body weight over a six-month period you must, by definition, ck to the diet for six months. Since most of us will stop dieting after one or two months, we need help in order to see the sults we desire most. Appetite suppressing medications are popular because we need help in controlling food intake. Relying on drugs does not Ave the problem. Often these over-the-counter and prescription medications work for a few weeks, becoming ineffective as the ody leams to ignore them-a process known as tolerance. Additionally, drugs have side effects, some quite serious, such as insomnia, nervousness, depression, high blood pressure nd rapid heartbeat. Fen-phen had to be withdrawn by the Food and Drug Administration because it caused dangerous omplications, inciuding heart problems and pulmonary hypertension. However, there are real alternative diet aids that offer real lenefits without any risks. Nhat to Look for in a. Diet Aid ... When choosing a diet aid, it is extremely important to know what the ingredients of the product are and what actions they 3erfom in the body. This is true for any dietary supplement you choose. For a weight loss aid to be effective it must: 1. Be completely harmless, even over long-term use 2. Be physiological, in other words, work with the body instead of suppressing some vitaf metabolic process The good news is that a number of natural substances are available to help combat weight problems. Chitosan: Fiber From the Sea Chitosan is a special fiberfound in the shell of shellfish like crabs and lobsters. Fiber and its use as a weight loss aid have been the topic of considerable study in the last several decades. Increasing dietary fiber intake naturaily decreases fat intake, because fiber-rich foods are relatively low in fat and cholesterol. In addition, increasing fiber usually decreases LDL (bad cholesteroi) and increases HDL (good cholesterol), reducing the risk of heart disease. Just like plant fibers (brans, gums, pectin), Chitosan inhibits absorption of fat and bile acids, but it does so a lot more effectively. This happens because Chitosan has two unique properties: Unlike most piant fibers, it has a positive charge r It is the only natural fiber that is soluble in the stomach Since fats and bile acids have a negative charge, Chitosan actively attracts and binds them, making them unavailable for absorption. It actually binds up to 12 times its weight of lipids (fats). It's as if you are not eating the fat at all! Eating less is a key factor in weight loss, lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of heart disease. Even if you eat a reguiar diet, which for many of us is loaded with fat, the addition of Chitosan makes it a low-fat, low-calorie diet. The taste buds are happy because it tastes good, and the body is happy because less fat is absorbed. Garcinia Cambogia: Nature's Perfect Diet Ingredient Garcinia Cambogia is a sour fruit indigenous to southern Ask and India, It can help curb appetite, reduce food intake and inhibit the production of fats and cholesterol. The people of India and Asia have used Garcinia for culinary and medicinal purposed for hundreds of years. The active ingredient in Garcinia is hydoxycitric acid (HCA), which is chemically very similar to the citric acid in citrus fruits, and it is considered just as harmless. Why Does HGA Help Weight Loss? Carbohydrates from food are broken down into the sugar glucose, which is used as a source of energy. Once the energy needs are fulfilled, giucose molecules are stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen, a special energy starch. When glycogen stores become full, extra glucose is converted into fat and cholesterol. Exhibit L, p. 3 dry: An American Epidemic Page 3 of 3 HCA reduces the syntheses of fat from carbohydrates by 40-70\u00b0~ and forces glucose to form additional glycogen: As cogen levels increase, the body sends a satiety (\"full\") signal to the brain, which decreases appetite and food intake. In animal idies, HCA reduced food intake by about 10%. HCA is not a stimulant; it works with the body's natural processes. As a result, it continues to be effective even with long term ,e and does not lead to the \"yo-yon syndrome. itrus Aurantium: A Natural Metabolism Booster Citrus Aurantium, a hit also known as bitter orange, has a long history of medicinal use. One recently discovered quality of itnts Aurantium is its ability to stimulate the buming of fat within the body. This is known as thermogenesis, or production of eat from fat for energy. Citrus Aurantium increases energy levels and stimulates the accelerated breakdown of fat, causing weight loss. This effect is !nhmed even more by moderate physical activity. Because Citrus Aurantium does not stimulate the brain, it is very safe and is not associated with adverse side effects. he role of Chromium in weight reduction The body uses this mineral to produce a substance known as Glucose Toierance Factor (GTF), which is important in regulating biood sugar and triglycerides. Chromium supplements are used to reduce cravings for sweets and carbohydrates, to increase muscle tone and elevate energy levels. Now You Have a Choice As you can see, it is possib)e to lose extra weight safely, reliably and permanently. All you need is a sensible diet, moderate physical activity and proven natural diet aids. The choice of diet aid depends on the types of food you usually eat. If your diet is fairly high in fat, your best bet is the new Su~er Lipo Blo~kerm that combines Chitosan, Vitamin C and Chromium. If you eat a lot of carbohydrates (bread, pasta, potaioesj, have not successfully lost weight on other programs, or hii a weight loss plateau, try Super Carbo BiockerN that consists of Garcinia Cambogia, Citrus Aurantium, Chromium and Green Tea extract. ff your diet is both high in fats and carbohydrates, you may want to use both Suoer Li~o Blockerm and Super Carbo BlockerTM together. Moderate exercise or any physical activity along with a sensibie diet and plenty of water will enhance the effects of both Su~er Lipo Blockerm and mer Carbo Blockerm.

If there's one thing you can generally count on every year, it's that sometime during the months of September through February, you will get sick at least once. Your throat will feel sore and scratchy, your nose will be either stuffy, runny or both, you'll sneeze uncontrollably, your body will ache and your head may feel disconnected from the rest of your body. The peak of the season begins when the kids go back to school, sharing food, fun and germs. Then, it picks back up again with the stressful holiday season. You Don't Have to Get Sick this Flu Season! Infectious diseases are a main cause of illness, disability and death in America today. Recent surveys have found that about 90% of visits to the doctor are due to some type of infection. Most adults suffer two to four colds each ysar while children come down with at least six to eight. Though colds and flus are usually not serious, they can cause much misery and suffering. As a resuit, the person that is sick is not the on& one affected by their wretched condition. In addition, countless days of work are lost each year due to severe colds and flus alone! Over 50,000 Americans, mainly elderly, die from the flu every year. Fortunately, these illnesses are largely preventable. Wouldn't it be nice to make it through the cold and flu season WITHOUT getting sick? The Truth about OTC Drugs Unfortunately, most people spend billions of dollars every year, buying over-the-counter (OTC) remedies to try to alleviate their cold and fiu symptoms. The sad tntth is, these drugs do very little to actually treat the cause of sickness - all they do is just mask the symptoms temporarily. Plus, OTC's can actually have negative side effects that may be worse than the symptoms that they were used to treat! Many sinus relief products, for example, can claim drowsiness as their main side effect. Most nasal sprays intended to hydrate and relieve stuffy noses could actually lead to dependence, making the nasal sinus tissues more dry and irritated than they were to begin with. Children's remedies are no safer; in fact most children's cough syrups contain a significant amount of alcohol and sugar! Can Your Doctor really Help? Going to see your family physician will usually do you no better than using OTC drugs. Why? Because colds and flus are caused by viruses and for them there is no effective pharmaceutical treatment. Many doctors, however, will feel pressured by their patients to do something and will usually end up prescribing antibiotics - but they will do no good; antibiotics treat bacteria, not viruses! In reality, this may actually do indirect harm, because the overuse and abuse of antibiotics is what is causing our bodies to become resistant to the very drugs created to help us. This is becoming ' increasingly serious, as bacteria constantly mutate to more and more dangerous strains of their former selves. Thus, our bodies' defenses are becoming weaker and more vulnerable as bacteria gain in strength. The outlook would appear much brighter if more physicians relied upon the antiseptics of natu~ re. . Orogan~: Nature's Protection There exist in nature herbs that have been used for ages to help fight off and shorten the duration of various wld and flu symptoms. Oregano possesses superior antimicrobial powers. It has been found in studies to have unsurpassed antiseptic qualities, making it a very effective pain killer. Typical oregano, however, is not the same as that extracted from wild oregano for medicinal purposes. Your common store-bought or herb garden oregano is actually marjoram and thus does not equal wild oregano. The extract derived from wiid oregano is capable of bringing fast relief from various cold and fiu symptoms, such as mnny nose, congestion, chills, sore throat, ear aches, cough, fever, fatigue, stuffiness and muscle aches, because it is able . . .. , Exhibit M, p. 3 4/1/21 You Prepared?

According to physician Cass lngram, the oregano rxtract helps boost the function of the white blood cells, thus strengthening the immune system. Other Cold~Fighiing Herbs There are other natural herbs that have traditionally been used to relieve the miserable symptoms of colds and flus. The oiive leaf has been used medicinally since Biblical times! It is ex-tremely useful in combatting fevers. In the 1960's, done at America's Upjohn pharmaceutical company found that the extract from the olive leaf was effective in fighting off several different viruses, most of which led to the common cold, by destroying them at the membrane level. This stops the virus in its tracks. Native Americans have long used golden seal both as a tonic and to soothe sore throats. Recent studies have found that golden seal has antiviral qualities that help it to fight off infections. Golden seal supports a strengthened immune system. Its active ingredients have been known to help reduce innammation in mucous membranes, relieve pain and help prcvect infection. Both garlic and echinacea are recognized as boosting the efficiency of golden seal. Garlic has been used throughout history in a variety of ways; many medicinal in nature.

Most people will suffer 1 to 3 colds a year, usually juring early September and late April. Doctors call them \"viral upper respiratory infections\" or \"acute viral nasopharyngitis\" 3ecause big words always sound impressive to patients. . Colds may be caused by any one of over 200 viruses that cause inflammation in the mucous linings of the nose and throat. They are more common in winter, possibly because the indoor heating dries out our nasal passages, which makes them more susceptible to cold and flu viruses. The familiar symptoms - nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, runny nose, watery eyes and a sore throat - usually develop a day or two after exposure to the virus. The infection normally lasts about a week to ?O days. The symptoms are not caused by the virus itself, but by your body's attempts to get rid of the virus. In addition to the hundreds of cold viruses, there are dozens of the viruses that cause flu or influenza. Flu symptoms are simiiar to those produced by ?he cold virus - coughing, sneezing, muscle aches, fatigue, fever and gastrointestinal distress. One or more flu virus will certainly make an appearance during this winter season. Over 90 million Americans contract the flu every year at a cost of about 70 million lost work days and an annual $12 billion in lost production during epidemics. Thankfully, most flu sufferers will recover afier one to two weeks, but according to the Centers for Disease Controi and Prevention (CDC) there are approximately 20,000 deaths in an average flu season. Do Drugs Really Work against Colds and Flu? Cold and flu sufferers spend billions of dollars yearty on various over-the-counter medications that are designed to suppress cold symptoms. But since the symptoms actually represent your body's efforts to eliminate the virus, the conventional cold remedies that try to suppress the fever, runny nose, sneezing and coughing simply don't make any sense. Antibiotics, often requested by patients themselves, make even less sense because they fight bacteria, not viruses. These medications are not only useless, they are often harmful and even dangerous. They can cause a number of side effects, including drowsiness, elevation of blood pressure and increased chance of an allergic reaction. Some, especially nasal sprays, are addictive and can lead to dependence. Medical doctors are usually not very helpful either. Feeling pressured to provide some kind of treatment, they prescribe useless cough suppressants, nasal decongestants and even antibiotics that are completely useless against viruses. This practice is the main reason for the increasingly common probiem of bacterial resistance, when even the most potent antibiotics become powerless against the bacteria. Natural Protection against the Viruses Fortunately, there are a number of natural substances that help the immune system fight the viruses causing colds and flu. They have been used in folk medicine long before the first antibiotic was even discovered. Wild Oregano possesses superior antimicrobial powers, capable of bringing fast relief from cold and flu symptoms (runny nose, congestion, chills, sore throat, ear aches,. cough, fever, fatigue, stuffiness and muscle aches) because it is able to kill the virus which is their cause. Oregano oil has incredible antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal effects. Studies show it also has unrivaled antiseptic (pain-killing) qualities. Many studies have shown that oregano oil can improve the symptoms and shorten the duration of the common cold and flu. Plus, as discussed in Dr. Cass lngram's The Cure is in the Cupboard: How to Use Oregano for Better Health, oregano oil has been proven effective against a variety of microorganisms. The best part is that oregano oil is completely non-toxic and does not cause any side effects. The Olive Leaf has the distinction of being one of the few medicinal plants mentioned in the Bible. Studies show that Olive Leaf extract is a potent antimicrobial that has inhibited the growth of every human pathogen it has been tested against, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi and yeast. Echinacea has a rich tradition of use by North American Indians who used it medicinaHy more than anv nth~r nlant Frhinama siimulates the overall activity of the cells responsible for fighting all kinds of infection.

The main uses of Echinacea include: colds, coughs and Ru and other upper respiratory conditions, enlarged lymph ands and sore throat. olden Seal has been used for centuries in herbal medicine. Golden Seal has antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory roperties. It soothes irritated mucus membranes, aiding the eyes, ears, nose and throat. Taken at the first signs of respiratory roblems, Golden Seal may help prevent further symptoms from developing.

Modem scientific research confirms the benefits of these and other ancient uses for garlic. ;he Allicin in Garlic is responsible for many of its healing properties. It stimulates the immune system, increasing the activity of vhite blood cells that fight foreign organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and yeast. Garlic is particularly effective in treating upper espiratory viral infeciions due to its immune-enhancing propsajes and its ability to clear mucous from the lungs. Astragalus is a Chinese herb that has traditionally been used to strengthen the Wei Ch'i, or immune system. It is regarded as a potent tonic for increasing energy levels and stimulating the immune function. It has been proven effective in cases of colds, flu and even cancer. American Cancer Society reported that it restored immune functions in 90% of the cancer patients studied. It improves the white cell function and general resistance to infection. The effect of the mineral Zinc on the immune system is well known; According to medical studies, it can reduce the average duration of colds by 7 days and decrease the severity of all cold symptoms to virtually nonexistent affer the third day! Vitamin C is well known for its ability to fight viruses and bacteria by stimulating the white cells, which are the \"soldiers\" of the immune system.
