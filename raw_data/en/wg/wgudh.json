Hormone imbalances can affect your sleep, increase anxiety, and depression. What to Expect During a Male Hormone Imbalance Treatment Session If you've never had treatment for male hormone imbalance, you might be wondering what to expect during your first appointment. A trained physician at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking you a comprehensive set of questions to determine your current health status, including your mental and emotional health. From there, your physician will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm and will send it to the lab to carry out a testosterone levels test. This measures the levels of testosterone in your blood and helps determine if levels are too low or too high. Depending on your results, you may be prescribed several different types of treatment, such as: - testosterone replacement therapy in the form of gel patches, hormone pellets inserted under the skin, injections, or tablets - dietary changes - yoga and tai chi, to improve your body's movement - mental health sessions for patients experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression For more information about male hormone imbalances, contact One Source Integrative Medicine at (843) 773-1444. - [Male Hormone Imbalance](https://www.onesourceintegrativemed.com/articles/general/621670-male-hormone-imbalance/) Overview Have you been experiencing a lowered sex drive?
