When we rejoice, you celebrate with us; when we are anxious and afraid, you offer us a relationship where we can find courage to face the unknown; when we weep with sadness, you are our comforter. Help us, O God, to believe that you receive us as we are, and help us to entrust ourselves, with all our many struggles and hopes, to your faithful and abiding care. Amen. Unknown God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference, living one day at a time; enjoying one moment at a time; taking this world as it is and not as I would have it; trusting that You will make all things right if I surrender to Your will; so that I may be reasonably happy in this life and supremely happy with You forever in the next. Amen. Reinhold Niebuhr Hear my prayer, O God, source of all life. My child is ill and I am afraid. She/he is so fragile and young, so small and vulnerable. Deliver her/him from sickness. Make her/him strong, full of life and laughter once more. Bless her/him with your love that she/he may not be afraid and restore her/him to health. Amen. Unknown God help me to weave a tapestry of love and not hate in my children, a spirit of tolerance and caring, and a dedication to freedom for all and not just some. God help me to sow seeds of peace and justice in my children's hearts today. Amen. Marian Wright Edelman May the gentleness of God's supportive and sustaining love gather us in her arms this day/night, and bless us with sleep that restores both body and soul. Amen. Marchiene Vroon Rienstra Facing the Future Every journey begins With but a small step. And every day is a chance For a new, small step In the right direction. Just follow your Heartsong. Mattie J. Stepanek (then 8 years old) "}
