At the heart of Anthroposophy, lies a deep understanding of the nature of consciousness and its evolution through time. Rudolf Steiner himself was a great pioneer, social reformer and accomplished architect. He gave many lectures on a vast array of subjects, in response to questions he was asked - most notably in the areas of medicine, plants and education. You may have heard of biodynamic agriculture as Prince Charles is a well-known firm favourite of the method, which uses manures and composts (instead of chemicals), in the preparation of soil to grow crops. Steiner's reflections were shared in the early 20th century, which seems like a long time ago from today's world! However, many of his reflections on the various stages of child development were indeed timeless and serve as a foundation for the evolving pedagogy at Greenwich Steiner School. We use Steiner's insights particularly in the ages groups of 0-7 years, 7-14 years and 14-21 years. These indications offer a starting point for our own understanding and discussions around how we can best inspire all our pupils to truly flourish and live out their fullest, creative potential. Whilst anthroposophy offers a philosophical basis for the pedagogical insights at Greenwich Steiner School, it is simply that, a starting point. Perhaps what is most inspiring was Steiner's repeated suggestions himself that we must not take anything at face value, but to put his many insights and theories to the test in the classroom This is the way we can see how to practically best support the children in our care. It is in this spirit of perpetual enquiry and learning that we work in our school. Anthroposophy itself, however, is not directly taught at our school.
