During a [wave]of COVID-19, the usage of widespread [vaccination] [procedures]and broader coverage to the whole of humanity [will]be made possible if the general [population]has access. An intended effect of [vaccination]is to provide \" [herd immunity],\" which protects those [who]have not been vaccinated along with those [who]have been. However, some concerns regarding the [safety]and [efficacy]of [COVID-19 vaccines]were raised. AIM:This study aims to provide on the short-term [safety]and [efficacy]of four types of [vaccines]that are officially approved by the Ministry of [Health]in the [United Arab Emirates](UAE). These include Sinopharm, Sputnik V, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca. METHOD:This study utilized a cross-sectional descriptive design. Data on the [efficacy]and short-term [protection]of [COVID-19 vaccines]on vaccinated citizens and residents (n = 764) of the UAE were collected between February and April 2021. Participants were conveniently approached using a Google Forms [survey], where they responded to a semi-structured [questionnaire]pertaining to socio-demographic questions and in-depth questions related to COVID-19, including whether they suffer from any comorbidities, the most commonly encountered post- [vaccination]side effects, and the severity of their symptoms, using a 5-point Likert scale. Results were analyzed using SPSS version 24, calculations of p-values and descriptive statistics were used for data differentiation. RESULTS:The majority of the participants (n = 612 or 94.4%) stated that they did not become reinfected after receiving two doses of [COVID-19 vaccine]. In addition, the [incidence]of being hospitalized after [vaccination]was negligible. In terms of [adverse effects], the most common individually reported side effects, regardless of the [vaccination]type, included \" [pain]at the site of [injection]\", followed by \"general [fatigue]\", then \" [lethargy]\". Moreover, most of these side effects occurred after the second [dose]of the [vaccine], irrespective of the type of [vaccine]. [Females]were found to be more susceptible to the adversities of COVID-19 [vaccination]. The occurrence of side effects was not found to be related to the [nationality]/ [ethnicity]of the [vaccine]recipient. Furthermore, none of the [vaccines]affected [sleep]pattern, since a significant number of [respondents]reported a regular [sleep]pattern after being vaccinated. The majority [respondents] [who]received two doses of [vaccination](n = 585 or 76.6%) reported that they did not become infected post [vaccination], regardless the type of [vaccine]received, whereas only (n = 11 or 1.9%) were reinfected with COVID-19 after 2-4 weeks. CONCLUSION:The findings of this study suggest that [vaccines]can offer short-term [protection]against COVID-19 [reinfection]. Moreover, both the first- and second- [vaccination]side effects were described as very mild to moderate, which indicates tolerability. These data may strengthen the public confidence in receiving "}
