Only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is currently authorized for children ages 12 to 17. Just like vaccines for illnesses such as measles and mumps, the COVID-19 vaccine protects your child against the coronavirus disease, which is preventable. Children are not immune to COVID-19. To date, 1.5 million cases have been reported in U.S. children ages 11 to 17. The COVID-19 vaccine is their best protection from the disease. Here are some important vaccine details that parents should know: THE COVID-19 VACCINE HELPS PROTECT KIDS FROM GETTING COVID-19 Getting a COVID-19 vaccine will also help keep them from getting seriously ill if they do get COVID-19.

No cases of COVID-19 were found among children who received the vaccine. Although there have been some cases of heart inflammation reported after vaccination for COVID-19, the cases have been mild and persons recover easily with medications and rest. The CDC continues to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for youth given the greater risk of myocarditis, and other illnesses from COVID-19. There is no biological reason or proof that puberty can be impacted, since mRNA vaccines do not enter the nucleus of the cell. No loss of fertility has been reported among vaccine trial participants or the millions who have received the vaccines since their authorization, according to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
