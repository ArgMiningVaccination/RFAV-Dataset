Some family members have been so desperate to get hold of the vaccine to be allowed access to new grandchildren, they have been willing to pay almost twice as much for a travel shot that contains the whooping cough booster. But now the supply for that vaccine has been exhausted in the Hunter too. Tim Llewellyn, pharmacist-in-charge at Scott-Dibben Chemist in Kotara, told the Herald the whooping cough booster had been in short supply off-and-on since March, 2015. \"I'm getting requests for it every second or third day,\" he said. \"It's actually causing some family friction in that you have new mothers and fathers who won't let parents and grandparents see the baby because they haven't had the booster. \"They do make another vaccine which also has the vaccine for polio in it as well, and what has been happening is that GPs are aware the booster has been out of stock, so they've been giving that as an alternative to people who desperately need to get it, but that stock is also exhausted now. We probably won't get any more of that one until May.\" Mr Llewellyn said the pharmaceutical company behind the whooping cough booster, GlaxoSmithKline, said a \"much larger\" supply would arrive by late February, or early March. But he has so many on \"back order\", he is not sure how long they will last. Pregnant women and children can still access the publicly-funded vaccine. Data collected by Hunter New England Health show there were 1319 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, in children and adults in 2015. Hunter New England Health physician Professor David Durrheim told the Herald there were 594 notifications of cases in 2012, 288 in 2013, and 452 in 2014. He said the vaccine was very effective in preventing deaths in infants, but it only provided protection for three-to-five years. \"Across NSW, every four to five years we get outbreaks because the vaccine only provides shorter life-saving protection,\" he said. \"We are in the middle of an outbreak. It is very important the littlies - who are most vulnerable - get protected.\" Professor Durrheim said children needed to be vaccinated as soon as recommended, which is at six weeks old, four months, and six months, followed by a booster at 3.5 to four years. \"That booster will be brought down to 18 months in the next few months. Because of the duration of the protection, we want to get maximum protection to preschoolers,\" he said. \"There is no vaccine yet that we can give at birth, but we try to provide those babies with protection by getting antibodies from mum over the placenta to the baby. The best way to do that is to give mum a booster at 28 weeks of pregnancy. \"If granny or grandpa or aunts and uncles are coughing, keep baby away.\" Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.
