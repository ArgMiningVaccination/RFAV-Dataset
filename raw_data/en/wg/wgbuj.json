We can communicate our ideas, beliefs, and emotions. We balance and open and we can bring our personal truth out into the world. We have a easy flow of energy within the body and spirit. The energy that springs upward from the sacral chakra through the solar plexus can continue its path enabling free expression of the values and needs expressed within the energy.. When the throat chakra is out of balance, the physical symptoms may include sore throats, tight jaws, stiff neck, and headaches. When it is out of balance spiritually you might find yourself habitually lying, feeling fear and doubt about the intentions of others, or find yourself stammering or at a loss for words. You will likely have feelings of being isolated and misunderstood. You may well have symptoms of other chakras being out of balance. This is caused by the throat chakra blocking the energy flow from the other centers. The Third Eye Chakra is the center of perception and command. It directs our sight and everyday awareness of the world. Our consciousness is located here. This is the chakra that controls how we see ourselves and the external world. When the Third Eye Chakra is in balance, we can see clearly and understand what we see. This is our 'intuition center' so to speak. We are able to interpret visual cues and our awareness level is high. When it is out of balance or blocked you will find yourself confused, difficulty seeing clearly, and a hard time differentiating what is important and what is not. You may feel as if you do not have command of your thoughts. Physical symptoms can include headaches, ear aches, and vision problems. Fear not though, even if your third eye chakra is blocked or out of balance, indigo colored crystals can make it better. Color Energy of Echinacea The color ray for Echinacea is Violet.
