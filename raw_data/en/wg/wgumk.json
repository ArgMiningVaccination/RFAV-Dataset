Street Market, Home to 35 Independent Businesses by Rachel Reynolds Medora and Mike Safai were driving home from Cincinnati when they were brainstorming and landed on the great idea for Logan Street Market in Louisville. \"We were in the car and said, 'wouldn't it be cool if Louisville had a public market?'\" Medora says. The couple had just visited Findlay's Market in Cincinnati. \"By the time we got home, we had a business plan.\" Logan Street Market was launched in October 2019 in a building that was a candy and tobacco distribution warehouse for 30 years. In 2016 it became a coffee roasting facility run by Medora and Mike, and the building had lots of extra space for a market. \"Mike's family is from Seattle, and when we visit there we always go to Pike's Market,\" Medora says. The planning for Logan Street was inspired by public markets in larger cities like Pike's, Quincy Market in Boston, Reading Market in Philadelphia, and Findlay's Market in Cincinnati. The market, located at 1001 Logan Street, covers 30,000 square feet of interior space, plus there's a side street outdoor market on weekends. Thirty- five booths make up the permanent year-round market, with an additional 10-15 pop-up booths on Sundays. The market was created as an entrepreneurial incubator, each vendor chosen specifically to fill aniche. It fulfills the needs of local residents in the city's food desert neighborhoods while providing out-of-towners a fun place to explore Louisville's creative side. It houses Wild Hops Brewery and the newly revealed Wild Hops International Lounge -- an 8,000-square-foot space with a stage, soft seating and optimal social distancing options. The businesses are independently and locally owned, often by minorities and women. They showcase a mixture from apparel and arts to take- home staples like groceries, pet supplies, meats, seafood, cheese, coffee, packaged wine, spirits and beer as well as dine-in prepared foods inspired by Latin, Asian and French cuisine. Pop-up vendors on weekends increase shopping options from local bakers, makers and growers. Art Bazaar on the last Friday of the month highlights local artists' creativity. The market runs T uesday through Sunday and is closed on Mondays. Breakfast starts at 8 a.m., shopping is from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and bars serve until 8 p.m. There will be special extended hours through the holidays - on Friday and Saturday, all vendors will stay open until 8 p.m. Logan Street just won the runner up for \"best place to socially distance\" in the Leo Reader's Choice Award.8 LIBA MEMBER DIRECTORY ENTERTAINMENT Art Supplies and Classes The Resource Room 1860 Mellwood Ave, Studio 182 / 502-290-9139 www .resourceroomlou .com Arts & crafts studio with a gallery & gift shop: workshops, parties, and more .

My community involvement is personal,\" said Dettman, an attorney and head of Dettman Law. \"We try to sponsor local adoption and foster care organizations, like Via Colori or Wednesday's Child. We've also helped raise money for a van that went to an orphanage in Malawi, Africa. I built my family this way and never would have been able to do so without Louisville and our community.\" Dettman is also a Louisville booster. His firm sponsors The University of Louisville Hockey Team and the University of Louisville Rugby Team. Brian and his wife moved to Louisville from Florida when she took a job as a journalist at WLKY-TV. Soon, they fell in love with the city, and realized they wanted to put down roots here. \"I grew up in Fort Lauderdale as the oldest of four brothers,\" Dettman said. \"College at Johns Hopkins, followed by Stetson Law. Our plan was to move on when my wife's contract expired. It never happened. We love it here. I have four kids now, and it's a great family city.\" Dettman is the proud dad of two 6-year- old daughters from Malawi, a country in southeast Africa with spectacular highlands and extensive lakes. He's also in the process of adopting his two young foster sons.A LIBA member for two years, Dettman is eager to give back to the community. \"If anyone out there runs a local non-profit or charity, please enter it for our Month of Giving,\" Dettman said. \"In February every year we try to bring awareness to the community by giving away $200 a day to local non-profits.\" Dettman said his law firm has donated to all types of non-profit groups, including animal rescues, homeless shelters, and foster care organizations. He often posts videos of charities the firm has helped to increase their visibility. Non-profits wanting more information can find @ trackmylawyer; www.louisville-injury- lawyer.com Dettman said he loves waking up every day and going to work as an attorney. What sets his firm apart is the litigation and trial work, and the client communication. Dettman believes if you have a lawyer you should be able to speak to him or her. He also believes your lawyer should be willing to take a case to trial to get maximum value. \"In the third grade I was reading books about winning arguments,\" he said. \"Wasn't any fun for my parents or teachers, but I was always meant to be a lawyer. I'm lucky that I can use a skill to help people.\"BRIAN DETTMAN Lawyer, dad, and Louisville booster by Rachel Reynolds Brian Dettman is a local personal injury attorney who is trying to help his clients and his community. 502-444-Hurt Bdettman@dettmanlawgroup.com 918 Baxter Ave. www.louisville-injury-lawyer.com49 SERVICESDettman Law 918 Baxter Ave / 502-779-9998 www .louisville-injury-lawyer .com I a m a l o c a l p e r s o n a l i n j u ry l a wy e r .

For a marketing company whose life blood is connecting human beings through special events and in- person interactions, 2020 proved to be a unique and unprecedented challenge because of mandated social distancing and stay-at-home orders. \"It can be really scary for even well-established businesses to invest in their marketing in these uncertain times, but at the same time, putting the pause on marketing is not a viable option either,\" Blevins explained. Think Tank Marketing got creative and found new ways to support their clients during the pandemic. The company created a new payment schedule for clients who wanted to launch marketing initiatives and pay for it in smaller increments up front. Randy and his team also implemented new platforms that allowed restaurants to host bourbon tastings and other events virtually. Think Tank also re-evaluated its own brand and internal processes to make use of the quiet time imposed when many businesses in Louisville slowed or shut down temporarily. And the company embraced the idea that it's important to enjoy what you're doing, even during tough times.The result was a re-invigoration at Think Tank Marketing, highlighted by a commitment to local-centric marketing and advertising and deep caring for the community and those who share this sentiment. \"Social and community involvement are very important to our company because as we are often reminded right now, we are all in this together,\" says Blevins, who sits on the Membership Engagement Committee at LIBA. \"We care, that's our motto.\" Think Tank Marketing has a wide array of innovative clients in Louisville including Froggy's Popcorn, Kentucky Opera, Digs, Derby Diversity and Business Summit, NuLu Bock Fest, Bourbons Bistro, Actors Center for T raining, and many others. Blevins, who worked as Marketing Director with Actors Theatre and served as Art Director for the Broadway Series before founding his own company, is very committed to increasing social justice for all residents and expanding opportunities for young professionals who will be the leaders of tomorrow. Early in his career when he was an intern, Blevins learned from a mentor the importance of donating your time and money to the things you care about. With Think Tank Marketing, Blevins now has the distinct opportunity to work with clients who also \"care\" for the greater good of the Louisville community.A conversation with Randy Blevins, Founder & CEO of Think Tank Marketing by Rachel Reynolds 3Diane Davis, Marketing Director and Randy Blevins, Founder & CEO 83 "}
