The purpose of these activities is to protect individuals from harm and enhance the quality of services provided to them. The purpose of this policy is to ensure the health, safety and welfare of individuals receiving services from DDA -licensed and DDA -funded providers by formalizing a process to identify, report, and resolve incidents in a timely manner. An incident includes an allegation or an actual occurrence of an event that adversely and/or has the potential to negatively affect the health, safety, and welfare of a person. Accurate and complete documentation , and conducting a thorough investigation of all incidents are necessary to assure that the appropriate agencies receive information that can be used for system improvements. DDA -licensed and operated providers must report and collaborate with state agenci es such as DDA, the Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) , and the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) to ensure that corrective measures are immediately taken to protect the individual and all others who may be affected and to prevent recurrence. For example, the prompt reporting and investigation of the alleged abuse of an individual can ensure that immediate steps are taken to protect that individual and others from being exposed to the same or similar risk. Uniform reporting of incidents assists in identifying trends across the service delivery system. This information can be used to develop preventive and quality improvement strategies This policy applies to all community agencies , SRCs and FRCs licensed by DDA , regardless of funding source. Support broker s (SB) certified by the DDA to support people through DDA's self -directed waiver are also required to follow this policy. The policy describes the types of incid ents that the community agency/SRC/FRC/SB (\"agency\") is required to review internally, as well as those that must be reported to external entities, such as DDA's regional office, OHCQ, etc. It includes specific timeframes for reporting and investigating certain incidents. Please see page 8 for specific instructions regarding resource coordination agencies. This policy also briefly outlines the respective roles of OHCQ and the DDA with regard to incident investigations. This policy does not mandate that OHCQ or DDA investigate every incident, event or problem involving individual s receiving ser vices from an agency . However OHCQ, DDA, and SMA have the prerogative and authority to investigate any incident, including those which are not officially reported to OHCQ and/or DDA. The requirements that are set forth in this policy pertain to any inc ident that jeopardizes the health and safety and/or has the potential to cause harm to an individual. This may include incidents which have not been specifically described in the policy. Each agency shall develop and implement internal operating procedur es for identifying and addressing any situation that has or could have an undesirable outcome for the individuals it serves. Page 5 of 76 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS Incident Reporting: Appendi ces 1A - L of this policy contain the most common types of incid ents that the ag ency shall report. There may be other unusual events or situations that have not been described in the policy. T herefore each agency shall determine , either systematically or on a case- by-case basis if there are other incidents that should be reported an d investigated. The failure to identify a specific type of incident within this policy does not relieve the agency of its reporting responsibilities. Agency Internal Protocol: Every agency shall develop an internal protocol to ensure compliance with this policy. The protocol shall establish operating procedures, to include the definition of responsibilities of the director or designee, employees, interns, volunteers, consultants and contractors with regard to identifying, reporting, investigating, re view ing, addressing and monitoring the follow -up of incidents and identify trainings, other than the Policy on Reportable Incidents and Investigations (PORII), to be provided to assist in the completion of identified duties . The protocol shall also include pr ovisions for a standing committee and identify what trainings, in addition to the PORII, will be provided for standing committees . The agency's protocol shall also include the use of the Agency Investigation Report (AIR), formerly known as the Appendix 7 form, to investigate incidents that are reportable externally and internally , and the Standing Committee Review form, AIR Addendum , to document follow up and review of all incidents by the standing committee. Staff Designated to Report and Investigate: Every agency shall designate staff to implement the reporting and investigation duties as delineated by this policy and each agency's internal procedures. Designated staff shall be qualified, through successful completion of Investigations training, to ca rry out the duties and responsibilities mandated by PORII. Each agency shall maintain qualified staff in sufficient numbers to ensure availability to process and investigate reportable and internally investigated incidents as required by the timeframes set forth in this policy. Documentation indicating an employee's qualifications must be maintained in their personnel file and available to the Administration upon request. Policy Distribution and Emergency Information: Every agency director , or their designee, shall ensure a copy of this policy and the agency 's internal protocol on incident management is available to employees, interns, volunteers, consultants and contractors, members of the standing committees, as well as individuals receiving ser vices, their parents or guardians and advocates. The agency shall also ensure immediate access to telephone numbers for emergency contac ts within the agency as well as the appropriate DDA regional office to the above -listed persons . This information should be available through both electronic means and via posted information at licensed sites. Freedom from Retaliation: Every agency shall institute measures to reduce the potential for retaliation against any person reporting an incident. Work Days: For the purpose of this policy, working days are Monday through Friday, excluding State holidays. Page 6 of 76 Comprehensive Approach: This policy reflects a comprehensive approach to re porting , reviewing and investigating incidents. OHCQ reviews and prioritizes reportab le incidents as described in Appendices 1A -1G: abuse, neglect, death, hospital admissions, injuries, medication errors, and choking as well as all community complaints (collectively, \"Type I \" incidents). DDA reviews and prioritizes reportable incidents as described in Appendices 1H -1L: incidents requiring law enforcement/fire department/EMS, theft, unexpected or risky absence , restraints, and other (collectively, \"Type II \" incidents). I. REPORTABLE INCIDENTS A. Reportable incidents are significant events or situations that, because of the severity or the sensitivity of the situation, shall be reported electronically within prescribed timeframes to OHCQ , the DDA regional office , and involved Resource Coordinator/Resource Coordination office (RC) . All reportable incidents are reported DDA. Appendices 1A -1G are also reportable to OHCQ. The agency shall notify family and/or advocates as identified by the interdisciplinary team for all reportable incidents. Some reportable incidents shall also be reported to other external entities such as Maryland Disability Law Center ( MDLC ), local department of social services (Adul t Protective Services [ APS]), law enforcement, etc. B. Appendi ces 1A-L include s examples of events and situations categorized as reportable incidents. C. The agency director , or designee, shall be advised of all incidents in th e reportable category immediate ly upon discovery. The director /designee shall immediately assure the health, safety and/or well -being of any involved individuals. The director /designee shall also assure that all required parties are notified of the incident as defined by th is policy. D. Reporting requirements for reportable incidents are defined in Appendi ces 2A-L. E. As specified in Appendi ces 2A-L, some types of incidents shall be reported to the DDA regional office immediately either verbally or by e-mail. Within 1 working day of t he discovery of the incident, the agency shall submit a completed Incident Report, formerly known as the Appendix 4, for each reportable incident electronically to OHCQ, the DDA regional office , and the RC . Please note: verbal notification is not a substi tute for the completed Incident Report (IR) . F. The agency shall investigate each incident following their internal protocol. The agency shall confirm with the outside authorities, when applicable, i.e., law enforcement, fire department, Protec tive Service s, etc. if the agency should initiate/continue its investigation. The agency shall complete its investigation and submit its AIR electronically to OHCQ and the DDA regional office within 10 working days of the discovery of the incident . It should be noted that an AIR is required even if the agency Page 7 of 76 is instructed by the outside authority not to initiate/continue its investigation. The completed AIR shall be forwarded to the agency 's standing committee for review. Upon completing their r eview, the standing committee shall complete the AIR addendum form and attach it to the AIR. G. The agency shall provide follow -up and any actions necessary to resolve the incident. This may include corrective, preventive or disciplinary actions, as indicated by the agency investigation and/or OHCQ and/or outside a uthority (i.e., law enforcement, Protective S ervices). II. INTERNALLY INVESTIGATED INCIDENTS A. Internally investigated incidents are those events or situations that shall be reported to designated staff within the agen cy. The agency is responsible for reviewing and investigating each of these incident s. B. Appendi ces 1A-L include s examples of events and situations categorized as internally investigated incidents. C. The agency director /designee shall take whatever action is necessary to assure the health, safety and/or well -being of any involved individuals. D. Internally investigated incidents shall be reported to the agency director, or designee, within 1 working day of discovery. In addition, the agency shall immediately investigate each incident. The method for reporting and investigating shall be in accordance with the agency 's internal protocol. Within 21 working days, an A gency Investigation R eport (AIR) shall be com pleted by the agency using the DDA- approved format. The completed AIR shall be forwarded to the agency 's standing committee for review. Upon completing their review, the standing committee shall complete the AIR addendum form and attach it to the AIR. E. If the investigation reveals that the incident was of a more serious nature, this information shall be reflected in the AIR and the procedure, as per the Appendi ces 2A-L, must be followed. F. Final agency action on each incident shall be documented on the AIR Addendum and reflected in the corresponding Standing Committee minutes. G. Each agency shall submit electronically to DDA and OHCQ a listing of all internally investigated incidents which occurred during the prior quarterly period. This quarterly report is due January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15. H. The report shall be in the DDA format, Appendix 5. The report due January 15 shall include a listing of all internally investigated incidents occurring during the time period from October 1 through December 31of the previous calendar year ; the report due April 15 shall include internally investigated incidents occurring during the time period from January 1 through March 31; the report due July 15 shall include internally investigated Page 8 of 76 incidents occurring April 1 through June 30; and the report due October 15 shall include internally investigated incidents occurring during the time period from July 1 through September 30. I. When 3 internally investigated incidents occur within a 4 week time frame for the same individual , the t hird incident must be handled as a reportable incident and reported and investigated accordingly . Documentation regarding the other two incidents shall be included in this report. The next occurring internally investigated incident begins a new 4-week cycle. J. Files containing incident reports, any investigatory materials, meeting minutes, records of interviews, documented disciplinary actions, etc. shall be kept on f ile by the agency for a minimum of 6 years. III. RESOURCE COORDINATION AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES A. If an incident is alleged for an individual who receives resource coordination services during a period the individual is receiving services or supports from another DDA - licensed agency or certified provider (agency 2): a. the RC agency wi ll document the incident as per their internal protocol; b. the RC agency will notify agency 2 of the allegation and the need to report the incident as per PORII; c. the RC agency will carbon copy (\"cc\") the appropriate DDA regional office when notifying agency 2 of the allegation. d. If the resource coordination agency is unable to determine if agency 2 has reported the alleged incident, the resource coordination agency will contact the appropriate DDA regional office. i. The DDA regional office will determine if an IR has been submitted for the alleged incident, and if not; ii. The DDA regional office will contact agency 2 to follow -up for submission of an IR to DDA and OHCQ, as delineated in Appendices 2A - L. B. If an incident is alleged for an individual who is funded by DDA for only resource coordination services, the resource coordinator will submit an IR to the appropriate DDA regional office and OHCQ, as delineated in Appendices 2A -L. C. If a resource coordinator has significant concerns regarding the services an individual is receiving from another agency or certified provider, and the team process has been utilized to address the issue(s) to no avail, the resource coordinator will submit an IR to the appropriate DDA regional office and OHCQ as delineated in Appendices 2A -L. In the case of issues of abuse, neglect, and/or mistreatment, the team process may be bypassed. D. If there is disagreement between resource coordination and another agency regarding the need for submission or the content of an IR: a. an IR should be submitted to OHCQ and/or the appropriate DDA regional office by the resource coordination agency. b. OHCQ and/or DDA will determine the subsequent need for or revisions to an existing IR from the other agency. Page 9 of 76 E. Upon request of DDA or OHCQ, a resource coordination agency will submit an IR for an incident alleged for an individual receiving resource coordination services. Such requests will be based on the protocol outlined above. F. For any IR submitted by a Resource Coordinator, a subsequent AIR must be completed and submitted as required by Appendices 2A -L of this policy. IV. SUPPORT BROKER RESPONSIBILITIES \u2014SELF -DIRECTED SERVICES Services provided to individuals through DDA -funded self -directed waivers are subject to compliance with this policy. As indicated in Support Broker training, incidents as denoted in this policy are reportable to DDA. DDA will determine the need for follow -up actions. V. INVESTIGATION, FOLLOW -UP AND RECORDS MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS A. The primary concern of the agency regarding incidents shall be the health, safety and/or well-being of the individual (s). The agency d irector /designee shall always assure prompt treatment and care and the protection of all individuals from further harm. B. No one may participate in an investigation of an incident in which there is a conflict of interest, such as an incident in which he/she was directly involved or in which a spouse or other family member was involved. C. No member of a standing c ommittee of an agency may participate in the decision making process for any incident in which there is a conflict of interest, or in which the committee member was involved. D. All documentation regarding incidents shall be retrievable by the complete name of the individual and, if used, by a file number or other identification code. When an event/situation involves more than one individual, records shall be retrievable by file number or identification code, if utilized, in addition to being retrievable by each individual's name. E. Any incident report and/or documentation of an investigation shall be maintained confidentially . F. All relevant records, including but not limited to, reports, investigations, interview notes , and meeting minutes shall be available to OHCQ , DDA, and/or SMA staff upon request. Any appropriate internal or external authorities may interview any individual, staff or other relevant parties regarding an internal or reportable incident. Reviews and/or investigations conducted by OHCQ and/or DDA s hall assure confidentiality, except when reporting to other authorities as indicated in this policy . G. All records relevant to an internally investigated or a reportable incident, including but not limited to, reports, investigations, meeting minutes, inter view records , and Page 10 of 76 documentation of corrective, preventive and/or disciplinary action or any other follow -up activity shall be sub mitted to the agency 's standing committee within 7 calendar days of the closure of the matter. For internally investigated inc idents, closure means the completion of the agency investigation. For reportable incidents, a two -fold review may occur. The standing committee shall review the incident upon completion of the agency investigation, and should the incident be externally i nvestigated by OHCQ, DDA, SMA, or other external authorities, the Standing Committee shall re -evaluate the incident upon receipt of reports indicating closure of the investigation by the external party. The agency should also share any information regardi ng unusual incidents not addressed in the policy and any follow -up actions implemented to inform the standing comm ittee how the agency addressed those matters. VI. ADMINISTRATION PRIORITIZATION and INVESTIGATION PRO CEDURES A. Purpose. a. Outline Administration Process: The purpose of this Prioritization Protocol (\"Protocol') is to outline the screening and prioritization process for reportable incidents and complaints ; delineate the roles and responsibilities of the OHCQ, DDA, and any other entities involved in investigations; establish timelines for the investigation and issuance of reports related to certain specified reportable incidents; and, identify the procedures for monitoring the implementation of plans of correction. b. Insight: The protocol establishes how the Administration reviews, evaluates, and prioritizes incidents for investigation. The protocol does not include procedures to be followed when an incident or complaint is referred to another unit within OHCQ or appropriate external agency. c. Adminis trative Responsibilities: The OHCQ investigates Type 1 incidents, events or problems involving an individual in a n agency based on their scope and severity. The DDA evaluates Type 2 incidents to determine appropriate follow -up. The OHCQ, DDA, and SMA have the prerogative and authority to investigate any incident, including those which are not reported to OHCQ and/or DDA. B. Incident Screening and Evaluation Process: OHCQ reviews and prioritizes reportable incidents as described in Appendices 1A -1G: abuse, neglect, death, hospital admissions, injuries, medication errors, and choking as well as all community complaints (collectively, \"Type 1\" incidents). DDA reviews and prioritizes reportable incidents Appendices 1H -1L: incidents requiring law enforcement/fire department/EMS, theft, unexpected or risky absence , restraints, and other (collectively, \"Type 2\" incidents). a. Submission: All support brokers, licensed providers, state residential centers, and forensic residential centers (collectiv ely, \"agency') are required to identify, report, investigate, review, correct and monitor any event that threatens the health, safety or well-being of individuals receiving services. Agency requirements for the submission of reportable incidents to DDA and OHCQ are outlined in DDA's PORI I, under \"General Requirements\" and under \"Appendices 1 and 2.\" b. Initial Screening: Agency self-reported incidents and community complaints are reviewed within one working day of receipt by OHCQ and/or DDA triage staff to ensure that those incidents posing immediate jeopardy to the individual are immediately Page 11 of 76 investigated. A triage unit staff reviews each report and notifies the DD Investigations Unit M anager (at OHCQ) or the QA Coordinator (at DDA regional offices) of the need to evaluate the report for appropriate assignment based upon the severity and scope of the incident. (See Section (c), below ). The content of the written report is evaluated to ensure the following information is included: i. The individual is not in immediate danger; ii. When applicable, law enforcement and/or adult/child protective services have been contacted; iii. Staff suspected of abuse or neglect have been suspended from independent duty; iv. The individual has received needed intervention and health care; v. Systemic and/or environmental issues have been identified and emergently handled. If this information is not available in the report, the triage staff corresponds with the agency to ascertain the status of the individual and ensure health and safety. An inability to obtain this information from the agency within a reasonable timeframe (generally no more than 48 hours of initial review of the report), will influence the decision to begin an on-site investigation or activity more quickly. c. Incident/Complain t Evaluation -OHCQ: A triage committee meets to review self- reported Type 1 incidents or complaints, including those that may have been assigned on an emergency basis. The committee ensures a comprehensive review of reported incidents and community compl aints has occurred. The committee takes into consideration the number and frequency of reportable incidents or complaints attributed to the agency and the quality of the agency 's internal investigations. The committee also reviews submitted AIRs, to ensu re appropriate actions were taken by the agency. Incidents which may have been previously determined to not require investigation may be re -categorized based on information received in an AIR. d. Incident Evaluation -DDA: Agency self- reported Type 2 incid ents are reviewed within one working day of receipt by DDA Regional QA staff to ensure that those incidents posing immediate jeopardy to the individual receive immediate follow up . Each report is reviewed for completeness and for evidence of agency intervention that safeguards the health and safety of the individual. An initial review determines if intake information is sufficient to determine dangerous conditions are not present an d ongoing. If, based on review of the IR , the DDA Regional QA staff is unable to determine that action has been taken by the agency to protect the participant from harm ; the DDA Regional QA staff will intervene. Intervention may be via contact with the licensee by email or telephone or an on- site visit. An IR that is incomplete or contains errors will result in an email from the DDA Regional QA staff to the agency requesting revision to the IR and resubmission of a complete and correct IR. Based upon their review and/or if an IR is submitted incorrectly (the classification should be a Type I incident, not a Type II), DDA may refer an incident to OHCQ for further review and possible investigation . e. DDA Determination : When an agency reports three or more incidents that involve the same individual within a four week period, DDA will determine, based upon the agency 's compliance history and nature of the incidents, whether an on- site visit is warranted. f. Referrals: When an incident is alleged to have occu rred outside of a site or service licensed by DDA, and the agency has not yet done so, the OHCQ or DDA refers it to the appropriate entities or jurisdictions for their review and investigation. When indicated, Page 12 of 76 incidents are referred to the Attorney General 's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for consideration of filing criminal charges. When an incident involves legal issues for the individual, it may be refer red to the Maryland Disability Law Center (MDLC). g. Deaths: All deaths are submitted to the OHCQ Mortality Investigation Unit for review and investigation. The OHCQ Mortality Investigation Unit evaluates death reports, determines priority for investigations and conducts investigation s using its own policies and procedures . Findings are s ubmitted to the DHMH Mortality and Quality Review Committee (MQRC) . The MQRC is independent of OHCQ and DDA and reviews the investigations of all deaths of individuals that occur in DDA -licensed settings and services. C. OHCQ Incident Prioritization and Guidelines for Investigation. The OHCQ assigns a priority level based on the following: PRIORITY DESCRIPTION CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA TO DETERMINE PRIORITY LEVEL OF INCIDENT RESPONSE TIME Immediate Jeopardy Definition: the incident presents an immediate and serious threat of injury, harm, impairment or death of an individual. OHCQ will initiate an on -site investigation within 2 working days of receipt. High Definition: the individual is not in imminent danger, but the incident presents a situation where a serious threat exists to the individual's health and/or safety or harm that could significantly compromise an individual's physical and/or mental health. OHCQ will initiate an on -site investigation within 10 working days of receipt. Medium Definition: the incident involves a situation or presents an opportunity for harm that did not affect or would minimally affect an individual's physical and/or mental health. OHCQ will initiate an on -site investigation within 30 working days of assignment. Administrative Review Definition: The incident presents minimal risk for harm or no harm and an on- site investigation is not necessary. A provider submits documentation that indicates situation has been addressed through the implementation of corrective and preventive measures. OHCQ will electronically correspond with the licensee to ascertain the status of the individual. In some instances, submis sion of an acceptable AIR may be sufficient to determine appropriate actions have been taken by the agency . Referrals Definition: The incident involves a situation or presents an opportunity where criminal issues, issues that may require legal advocacy or the incident is outside of the OHCQ jurisdiction are present. Referrals may be made on an immediate jeopardy basis. Referrals include other units within OHCQ when determined the incident occurred outside the purview of DDA services and referrals to other divisions of the DD Unit (licensure and mortality) OHCQ will make referrals, within 1 working day of triage committee review to appropriate internal unit or appropriate agency for follow -up. Incidents referred to the DD Licensure unit will be reviewed during the next re -licensure Page 13 of 76 PRIORITY DESCRIPTION CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA TO DETERMINE PRIORITY LEVEL OF INCIDENT RESPONSE TIME survey. No Further Action Necessary (NFA) Definition: The incident involves a situation that has been resolved satisfactorily and appropriately at the time of reporting or within a short timeframe. The individual's health and safety are assured and the agency has implemented corrective action. The AIR is reviewed by the DDA Regional Office. The Regional Office will notify the OHCQ within 5 working days of the receipt of any additional information that may require the OHCQ re -evaluate or investigate the incident. D. Roles and Responsibilities: a. During the investigation of an incident an OHCQ investigator reviews the AIR, if already completed, and related documentation. The investigator( s) will make his or her best effort to interview all persons with knowledge of the incident, including, but not limited to: the individual receiving services, her/his guardian or family member(s), the agency's direct care and administrative staff who were involved in the incident, etc. The investigator also makes direct observations of the individual in her/his environment. When possible, evidence is corrobora ted between interviews, record reviews, and observations. Deficiencies are, to the extent practicable, cited at an exit conference held upon completion of the on- site investigation. Investigations are completed, whenever possible, within 45 working days of initiation. b. The OHCQ may require a n agency , depending on the severity of the incident, to make immediate correction to ensure the health and safety of the individual. This may occur at any time upon receipt of a report of an incident. c. When an investigation results in deficiencies, the agency's Plan of Correction (POC) is due to the OHCQ within 10 working days of the exit conference. The POC due date may be sooner than 10 working days when the nature of the deficiency warrants a more im mediate response. The investigator reviews the POC to: verify that all deficiencies have been addressed, review proposed corrective and preventative measures for appropriateness, and determine if responsible parties have been identified. The investigator reviews each POC, to the extent practicable, within 10 working days of its receipt. d. If a POC is deemed unacceptable, the OHCQ will send notice to the agency in writing within 5 working days of review to detail the issues which require further review and consideration. The agency must submit a revised POC to OHCQ within five working days of receipt of notification that a POC is not accepted. The investigator reviews the revised POC with procedures outlined in \"c\" above . These timeframes may be extended u pon request with good cause shown. e. Upon acceptance of an agency POC , OHCQ will send the Statement of Deficiency (SOD) and the approved POC within 10 working days to the: i. Agency ; ii. Complainant; iii. Agency's Executive Director and Board President; iv. DDA Regional Office; Page 14 of 76 v. Maryland Disability Law Center , if appropriate ; vi. Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Attorney General's Office, if appropriate; vii. Office of the Inspector General, if appropriate; and viii. Any other parties deemed appropriate by the OHCQ. f. The agency shall provide a copy of the SOD and the POC to the individual receiving services who is specifically the subject to the deficient practice, and to their resource coordinator, guardian or family , as appropriate. g. The SOD and POC are also sent to any reques ting party under the Public Information Act. In addition, the DDA Regional Office Representative and the MDLC Representative may receive a copy of the Investigation Summary completed by the OHCQ investigator when deficiencies are not cited. This summary is not a public document pursuant to the Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. Art., 1- 401(a)(3) and may not be re -disclosed. h. Methods of Investigation. OHCQ shall conduct investigations through: i. On-site inspections; ii. Interviews; or iii. Reviews of relevant records and documents. i. The agency and OHCQ may receive extensions of the time periods set forth in this policy for good cause shown. E. Follow -Up Procedures. a. Staff from t he DDA Regional Office (RO) conducts site visits; review quality assurance plans and provide technical assistance to agencies. These activities are designed to improve the agency's quality assurance plan and procedures to ensure that systems are in place for preventing the reoccurrence of incidents or patterns of defici encies within an agency. b. DDA Regional Office staff review IRs and AIRs and determine what follow -up from the Regional Office is appropriate, for example: no further action required, contact the agency, conduct an on- site visit, or discuss the need for fu rther investigation with OHCQ. The Regional Office will forward pertinent information to the OHCQ within 5 working days of receipt with a recommendation that the OHCQ re -evaluate or investigate an incident. c. The OHCQ and/or SMA will conduct follow -up monitoring for all Priority A incidents and identify a 10 -percent targeted sample taken from the B Priority incidents to be completed within six months of approval of the POC to determine whether or not the agency has implemented the POC. The OHCQ, in collaboration with the SMA and DDA, will identify the targeted sample based on criteria which include, but are not limited to: agency history, severity of the incident, and investigator recommendation. F. Information Sharing. a. OHCQ will forward information to MDLC as required by law or on request , if legally permissible. b. The DDA and OHCQ will have quarterly meetings to facilitate the exchange of pertinent information. Page 15 of 76 c. The DDA, OHCQ and MDLC will have quarterly meetings to facilitate the exchange of pertinent information. d. The OHCQ, DDA, agencies and advocates will meet annually to share information and trends found during the survey process.
