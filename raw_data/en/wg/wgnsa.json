The term Eubiotics is mainly used in the feed industry where it refers to a healthy balance of the micro-flora in the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteritic preparations intended for correction of biocenosis of the mucous membranes may be referred to as eubiotics. Poultry feed dominates the eubiotic market owing mainly to the large number of population consuming poultry meat in the world. The demand for eubiotics in animal feed is projected to grow during the forecast period, owing to the rapidly increasing global demand for quality animal products. Probiotics, prebiotics, essential oils and organic acids are often referred to as eubiotics. In this context, Probiotics account for the major share in poultry feed. It is hypothesized that different eubiotic combinations would have a synergistic effect in improving animal performance. In Iran, in last decade a number of local probiotic manufacturers have evolved which are producing high quality probiotic feed additives for animals. While, this trend is still in its developing and pillaring stages, a number of researches on eubiotic products with medical and animal applications are also on its rise. According to global estimates, Europe dominates the eubiotics market followed by North America, while, China, India, and Brazil are the developing countries where eubiotic market is also growing. The biotechnology industry is now creating an opportunity for growth in the eubiotics sector. A number of eubiotic drugs are being developed especially for treating dysbiosis. However, factors such as low shelf life of eubiotics and high cost of eubiotics leading to the rise in cost of production are restraining the growth of the market. With high tech approaches and biotechnological innovations we foresee a bright future for eubiotic products in Iran. Hopefully with entering the new era of Biotechnology we will soon witness highlight eubiotic products in the country with wide applications. Biography: Dr. Mojgani is an Associate professor at Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute has vast experience in the field of Medical Microbiology, Molecular Biology and Vaccinology. Her main area of research is on Probiotics, antibacterial peptides, designing and formulation of probiotic products, bacterial conjugate vaccines, tuberculin production, nano-encapsulation etc. She has successfully contributed in the production of Probiotic supplements for animals and humans and transferred the know-how to local manufacturers in the country. Her continuous efforts, dedication and hard work in the field of Probiotic have led her to be recognized in the country as an eminent specialist in the field. "}
