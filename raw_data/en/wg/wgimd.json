Is this face-to-face? Therapy will typically can last around 55 minutes for individual counseling. At this time I offer telehealth and face-to-face options. The face-to-face option has covid-19 precautions with a non-invasive temp check, sitting a minimum of 6-ft apart, items are sprayed and wiped down before next session, and etc. Where are you located? I practice in two locations: 1) Athens, GA at Revolution Therapy and Yoga. I provide counseling as well as teach a non-clinical Trauma Conscious Yoga class 2) United Methodist Church in Morgan County. The Athens location is a multipurpose space located in the historic Leathers building near downtown. On one side of the studio there are boutique-style yoga classes to the generally public and on the other side is where clinical private sessions are held. Do you take insurance? I am in the process of being credentialed with insurance panels. So far I have been approved for BCBS/Anthem, United Healthcare, and Aetna in Georgia as well as United Healthcare and Aetna in Florida. In addition, I also accept private pay if I am not able to take your insurance. Please revisit the insurance page and/or my Psychology Today profile to see if I have added any additional insurance panels. Thank you. What is Mind-Body Therapy and Intersectionality? Mind-Body Therapy is the therapeutic approach to the integration of mind, body, and/or spirit. While there is the traditional aspect of traditional psychotherapy or \"talk therapy\" (i.e., life history and the analysis of thought), it includes the relationship between a person's mental, physical, and/or spiritual experiences. Mind-Body Therapy might look like mindfulness, yoga therapy/meditation, EMDR, and etc. In addition, I use interventions that assist in the exploration of intersectional identity, that are inclusive to LGBTQIA+, race/ethnicity, sexuality/gender, spiritual/religious orientations, and etc. Note: The term 'intersectionality; was first coined by Professor Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw back in 1989, and it was added to the Oxford Dictionary in 2015. The Oxford Dictionary defines intersectionality as \"the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination "}
