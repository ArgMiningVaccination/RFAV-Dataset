Many health insurance companies, including most MassHealth plans except MassHealth Limited, now cover acupuncture services for treating pain. A very few insurers cover treatment of other chronic medical conditions as well. A physician referral may be needed. Please call your insurance company or consult your Summary of Benefits to see whether acupuncture is covered, for what conditions, and whether you have a copayment. If your insurance does not include an acupuncture benefit, self-pay fees are $60.00 for the initial visit and $45.00 for each following visit. "}
