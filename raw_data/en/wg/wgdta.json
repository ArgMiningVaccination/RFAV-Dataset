Executive Summary [SMMC community Health Needs Assessment]I. Executive Summary A community health assessment is a systematic method of identifying unmet health care needs of a population and identifying possible interventions to meet those needs. This community health assessment provided the opportunity to: xAssess the population's health status xHighlight areas of unmet need xPresent the community's perspectives xProvide improvement suggestions for possible interventions The report includes secondary data from national, state and local databases and when appropriate and possible, comparative information is presented. It also includes primary data from Shawnee Mission Medical Center's Primary Service Area residents (23 zip code areas; 20 zips located in Johnson County and 3 zips in Wyandotte County KS) that encompasses the community's perspective. Creating healthy communities requires a high level of mutual understanding and collaboration with community individuals and public health partner groups. The development of this assessment brings together community health leaders and providers along with local residents to research, prioritize county health needs and to document community health delivery successes. This health assessment will serve as the foundation for community health improvement efforts for next three years. This CHNA was a joint project among SMMC leadership, PSA community health leadership, Johnson County Department of Health & Environment and VVV Research & Development INC. from Olathe, KS Key Demographic and Socioeconomic Profile findings: xThe population for SMMC's PSA equals 351,992 (Yr 2011) with a 5 year projected growth rate of 5.3%. SMMC's underserved area equals 91,370 residents with a 5 year growth rate of only 1.9%. SMMC's underserved area represents 5 zip code 66101, 66102 and 66103. xSMMC's all households making under $15,000 per year versus 9.0% for all SMMC's PSA households. x13.6% of SMMC PSA's population identifies as Hispanic xSMMC PSA's per capita income is $34,854, considerably higher than SMMC's underserved area's per capita income of $20,038Town Hall Community Health \"Strengths\" Cited from Shawnee Mission Medical Center Primary Service Area (PSA) Johnson & Wyandotte Counties KS zAvailability & access of HC services zSupportive Johnson County law enforcement zSchool emphasis on wellness and prevention zGood Quality of life zEasy access to fresh fruits and vegetables zOpportunities for physical activity; parks and trails zPhysicians (good selection) zHealth screenings / Good immunization rates zCompetition among health care providers; incentivizes health care systems to perform zLower smoking rates than other counties zHigher education levels / Safe drivers zGreater opportunity for charity care because we're a wealthier county - more opportunity to provide CHNA \"Health Priorities\" Cited - SMMC PSA Johnson Co.

Methodology [SMMC community Health Needs Assessment]II. Methodology a.CHNA Scope and Purpose The new federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires that each registered 501(c)3 hospital conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) at least once every three years and adopt a strategy to meet community health needs. Any hospital who has filed a 990 is required to conduct a CHNA. IRS Notice 2011-52 was released in late fall of 2011 to give notice and request comments. JOB #1: Meet/Report IRS 990 Required Documentation 1.a description of the community served by the facility and how the community was determined; 2.a description of the process and methods used to conduct the CHNA; 3.the identity of any and all organizations with which the organization collaborated and third parties that it engaged to assist with the CHNA; 4.a description of how the organization considered the input of persons representing the community (e.g., through meetings, focus groups, interviews, etc.) , who those persons are, and their qualifications; 5.a prioritized description of all of the community needs identified by the CHNA and an explanation of the process and criteria used in prioritizing such needs; and 6.a description of the existing health care facilities and other resources within the community available to meet the needs identified through the CHNA. Section 501(r) provides that a CHNA must take into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility, including individuals with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. Under the Notice, the persons consulted must also include: Government agencies with current information relevant to the health needs of the community and representatives or members in the community that are medically underserved, low- income, minority populations, and populations with chronic disease needs. In addition, a hospital organization may seek input from other individuals and organizations located in or serving the hospital facility's defined community (e.g., health care consumer advocates, academic experts, private businesses, health insurance and managed care organizations, etc.). JOB #2: Making a CHNA Widely Available to the Public The Notice provides that a CHNA will be considered to be \"conducted\" in the taxable year that the written report of the CHNA findings is made widely available to the public. The Notice also indicates that the IRS intends to pattern its rules for making a CHNA \"widely available to the public\" after the rules currently in effect for Form 990. Accordingly, an organization would make a facility's written report widely available by posting the final report on its website either in the form of (1) the report itself, in a readily accessible format, or (2) a link to another organization's website, along with instructions for accessing the report on that website. The Notice clarifies that an organization must post the CHNA for each facility until the date on which its subsequent CHNA for that facility is posted.JOB #3: Adopt an Implementation Strategy by Hospital Section 501(r) requires a hospital organization to adopt an implementation strategy to meet the needs identified through each CHNA. The Notice defines an \"implementation strategy\" as a written plan that addresses each of the needs identified in a CHNA by either (1) describing how the facility plans to meet the health need, or (2) identifying the health need as one that the facility does not intend to meet and explaining why the facility does not intend to meet it. A hospital organization may develop an implementation strategy in collaboration with other organizations, which must be identified in the implementation strategy. As with the CHNA, a hospital organization that operates multiple hospital facilities must have a separate written implementation strategy for each of its facilities. Great emphasis has been given to work hand-in-hand with leaders from both hospitals and the local county health department. A common approach has been adopted to create the CHNA, leading to aligned implementation plans and community reporting. IRS Notice 2011-52 Overview Applicability of CHNA Requirements to \"Hospital Organizations\" The CHNA requirements apply to \" hospital organizations ,\" which are defined in Section 501(r) to include (1) organizations that operate one or more state-licensed hospital facilities, and (2) any other organization that the Treasury Secretary determines is providing hospital care as its principal function or basis for exemption. Under Section 501(r), a hospital organization is required to conduct a CHNA for each of its hospital facilities once every three taxable years. The CHNA must take into account input from persons representing the community served by the hospital facility and must be made widely available to the public .The CHNA requirements are effective for taxable years beginning after March 23, 2012 . As a result, a hospital organization with a June 30 fiscal year end must conduct an initial CHNA for each of its hospital facilities by June 30, 2013, either during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 or during either of the two previous fiscal years. Determining the Community Served AC H N Am u s ti d e n t i f ya n da s s e s st h eh e a l t hn e e d so ft h e community served by the hospital facility. Although the Notice suggests that geographic location should be the primary basis for defining the community served, it provides that the organization may also take into account the target populations served by the facility (e.g., children, women, or the aged) and/or the facility's principal functions (e.g., specialty area or targeted disease). A hospital organization, however, will not be permitted to define the community served in a way that would effectively circumvent the CHNA requirements (e.g., by excluding medically underserved populations, low-income persons, minority groups, or those with chronic disease needs). Persons Representing the Community Served Section 501(r) provides that a CHNA must take into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community served by the hospital facility, including individuals with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. Under the Notice, the persons consulted must also include: (1) government agencies with current information relevant to the health needs of the community and (2) representatives or members of medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations, and populations with chronic disease needs, in the community. In addition, a hospital organization may seek input from other individuals and organizations located in or serving the hospital facility's defined community (e.g., health care consumer advocates, academic experts, private businesses, health insurance and managed care organizations, etc.). Required Documentation The Notice provides that a hospital organization will be required to separately document the CHNA for each of its hospital facilities in a written report that includes the following information: \u0014 \u0003a description of the community served by the facility and how the community was determined; \u0015 \u0003ad e s c r i p t i o no ft h ep r o c e s sa n dm e t h o d su s e dt oc o n d u c tt h e CHNA; \u0016 \u0003the identity of any and all organizations with which the organization collaborated and third parties that it engaged to assist with the CHNA; \u0017 \u0003ad e s c r i p t i o no fh o wt h eo r g a n i z a t i o nc o n s i d e r e d the input of persons representing the community (e.g., through meetings, focus groups, interviews, etc.), who those persons are, and their qualifications; \u0018 \u0003a prioritized description of all of the community needs identified by the CHNA and an explanation of the process and criteria used in prioritizing such needs; and \u0019 \u0003ad e s c r i p t i o no ft h ee x i s t i n gh e a l t hc a r ef a c i l i t i e sa n do t h e rr e s o u r c e s within the community available to meet the needs identified through the CHNA.Making a CHNA Widely Available to the Public The Notice provides that a CHNA will be considered to be \" conducted \" in the taxable year that the written report of the CHNA findings is made widely available to the public .T h eN o t i c ea l s o indicates that the IRS intends to pattern its rules for making a CHNA \"widely available to the public\" after the rules currently in effect for Forms 990. Accordingly, an organization would make a facility's written report widely available by posting on its website either (1) the report itself, in a readily accessible format, or (2) a link to another organization's website, along with instructions for accessing the report on that website. The Notice clarifies that an organization must post the CHNA for each facility until the date on which its subsequent CHNA for that facility is posted. How and When to Adopt an Implementation Strategy Section 501(r) requires a hospital organization to adopt an implementation strategy to meet the needs identified through each CHNA. The Notice defines an \"implementation strategy\" as a written plan that addresses each of the needs identified in a CHNA by either (1) describing how the facility plans to meet the health need, or (2) identifying the health need as one that the facility does not intend to meet and explaining why the facility does not intend to meet it. A hospital organization may develop an implementation strategy in collaboration with other organizations, which must be identified in the implementation strategy. As with the CHNA, a hospital organization that operates multiple hospital facilities must have a separate written implementation strategy for each of its facilities. Under the Notice, an implementation strategy is considered to be \" adopted \"o nt h ed a t et h es t r a t e g yi s approved by the organization's board of directors or by a committee of the board or other parties legally authorized by the board to act on its behalf. Further, the formal adoption of the implementation strategy must occur by the end of the same taxable year in which the written report of the CHNA findings was made available to the public. For hospital organizations with a June 30 fiscal year end, that effectively means that the organization must complete and appropriately post its first CHNA no later than its fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, and formally adopt a related implementation strategy by the end of the same tax year. This final requirement may come as a surprise to many charitable hospitals, considering Section 501(r) contains no deadline for the adoption of the implementation strategy.II Methodology b) Collaborating CHNA parties Working together to improve community health takes collaboration.

Review / confirm CHNA calendar of events, explain / coach client to complete required participants database and schedule / organize all Phase II activities. Phase II - QUANTIFY Community Need: A) Conduct secondary research to uncover the following historical community health status for PSA. Use KS Health Matters, a joint venture between KHA and KHDE, Vital Statistics, County Health Rankings, etc. to document \"current state\" of county health organized as follows: TAB 9. Mortality Profile TAB 10. Preventative Quality MeasuresTAB 5. Hospitalization / Providers Profile TAB 6. Behavioral Health Profile TAB 7. Risk Indicators & Factors TAB 8. Uninsured ProfileTAB 1. Demographic Profile TAB 2. Economic/Business Profile TAB 3. Educational Profile TAB 4. Maternal and Infant Health ProfileB) Gather historical primary research to uncover public health needs, practices and perceptions for hospital primary service areas. Note: Use existing Johnson County Department of Health & Environment Community Health Improvement Plan YR 2012-17 findings to supplement secondary research. Phase III - QUALIFY Community Need: Conduct 90 minute Town Hall meeting with required county PSA residents. (Note: At SMMC's Town Hall meeting, CHNA secondary data was reviewed, facilitated group discussions occurred, and a group ranking activity to determine the most important community health needs was administered. SMMC Town Hall attendees represented minority populations, medically underserved and low income community areas.) Phase IV - Complete data analysis & create comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment. Post CHNA report findings to meet IRS CHNA criteria. After consideration of CHNA stakeholders (sponsoring hospital & local health department) the CHNA Basic option was selected with the following project schedule: Phase I: Discovery.......................................................................

Steps # 5 ReportingPrepare/Present comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment report (to community leaders) with Recommended Actions to improve health .< N o t e : Formal report will follow IRS Notice 2011-52 regs >Steps to Conduct Community Health Needs AssessmentOverview of Town Hall Community Priority Setting Process Each community has a wealth of expertise to be tapped for CHNA development. For this reason, a town hall is the perfect forum to gather community insight and provide an atmosphere to objectively consensus build and prioritize county health issues. All Town Hall priority-setting and scoring processes involve the input of key stakeholders in attendance. Individuals and organizations attending the Town Halls were critically important to the success of the CHNA. The following list outlines partners invited to Town Hall: local hospital, public health community, mental health community, free clinics, community- based clinics, service providers, local residents, community leaders, opinion leaders, school leaders, business leaders, local government, faith-based organizations and persons (or organizations serving them), people with chronic conditions, uninsured community members, low income residents, and minority groups. Johnson County's Town Hall, sponsored on behalf of Shawnee Mission Medical Center, and was held over dinner on Tuesday November 13st, 2012 at Matt Ross Community Center, Overland Park KS. Vince Vandehaar, Shelley Mathews and Amanda Burian facilitated this 1 \u00bd hour session with over thirty required community attendees.

Oct.30, 2012 Beth Lipoff Special to The Star - 913 News Imagine this: You walk into the clinic and see a doctor for the first time in 20 years. She says that you have diabetes, and you've got to change everything about your lifestyle, or you could lose a leg or go blind. The clinic has some support groups, but those may not be enough. That's why the Johnson County Health Department is partnering with Shawnee Mission Medical Center and Olathe Medical Center to assess the health needs of the community and determine what services need additional resources. \"I think it's going to benefit the community in general and raise more awareness in the community about these problems,\" said Jason Wesco, president and CEO of the Health Partnership of Johnson County. Wesco sees this sort of situation unfold regularly at the partnership's clinics and says the survey will help draw attention to needs such as behavioral health services, which provide counseling to such patients. As part of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act, surveying the community is mandatory. Area health care providers are welcoming the chance to hear the public's concerns. \"We hope that the survey and the town hall will allow us to determine what the community members see as the biggest needs throughout Johnson County,\" said Shannon Cates, a spokesperson for Shawnee Mission Medical Center. \"This is a good chance for us to talk with them directly.\"The assessment process includes two town hall meetings and mail-in and online surveys. Both hospitals stress that citizens should not base their answers on a particular hospital or clinic's offerings but look at what is available in the community as a whole. Shawnee Mission Medical Center is mailing 2,500 surveys to citizens all over Johnson County, but any Johnson County resident can take the survey online at https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CHNA_SMMC. None To boost survey turnout, the hospital is giving away Best Buy gift cards to three randomly selected survey respondents. Participants must return their surveys by today. \"It's the first step in determining what community members feel their health needs are or where services are lacking in the community,\" Cates said. Olathe Medical Center spokeswoman Stephanie Manning said the town hall meetings would use a structured approach, featuring a short presentation. After that, participants will have discussions in small groups to come up with a list of their top community health concerns. By the end, the group will have a larger discussion, concluding with a vote to determine a final list of concerns to present to the county. Officials are hoping that about 150 people will attend each meeting. Manning said the hospital has invited a variety of community leaders and elected officials in addition to the general public. Some of the issues that health department director Lougene Marsh expects to rise to the top are obesity, nutrition, dental care, mental health and substance abuse. \"Knowing we're never going to have all the resources we need to address all the needs in the community, (this helps by) giving a more razor-sharp focus on what are the highest priorities,\" Marsh said. Not all the issues are ones you'd normally associate with health care. Other items being addressed in the assessment include the affordability of healthy food and the availability of green spaces, such as parks, where people can go to exercise. Marsh said that, in a broad sense, all of these things affect a community's health. The county is already working on a program to provide free dental screenings to all children through the schools, with the help of local dental professionals, Marsh said.

You are invited to a public Town Hall meeting on Tuesday, November 13, 5:30-7 p.m., at Matt Ross Community Center, 8010 Marty, in downtown Overland Park. This gathering will allow you to voice your opinion about our community's top health care needs and the most efficient way for SMMC and JCDHE to deliver those services. A light dinner will be provided. SMMC and JCDHE are working with Vince Vandehaar from VVV Research and Development, Inc., to facilitate this meeting and assist in creating the final report. We would appreciate your input at this important meeting. To RSVP, or if you have questions, contact Shannon Cates, SMMC Marketing Manager, at 913-789-5565. We hope to see you on November 13. Sincerely, Ken Bacon President & CEO Shawnee Mission Medical CenterLougene Marsh, HED DirectorJohnson County Department of Health & EnvironmentEating right, staying fit top health needs of Johnson Co. residents By Mike Sherry for KHI News Service, Nov. 15, 2012 On Tuesday evening, Linda Leeper (left), chief executive with the Shawnee Chamber of Commerce, and Cherie Boxberger, of the American heart and stroke associations in Overland Park, discussed the health needs of residents in northern Johnson County. They were among about 40 participants gathered by Shawnee Mission Medical Center to help it comply with a mandate of the Affordable Care Act. OVERLAND PARK, Kan. - Help with eating right and staying fit are two top health needs for residents of northern Johnson County, according to a group of community leaders. At the invitation of Shawnee Mission Medical Center, the officials gathered Tuesday evening at the Matt Ross Community Center in downtown Overland Park. Other significant needs cited by the participants included improved access to mental health services and options for senior care. About 40 people were at the forum. Trevor Wright, the hospital's chief operating officer said the feedback at the forum was invaluable. Hospital administrators can look at data and survey results to determine community needs, \"but this puts a face and voice behind that,\" he said. The medical center organized the meeting to help it compile a community health needs assessment for its service area, which includes 23 ZIP codes within about 10 miles of the hospital. The assessments are required under the Affordable Care Act for nonprofit hospitals, according to Vince Vandehaar, the hospital's consultant who facilitated the meeting. He said the health-care reform law broadened reporting requirements to justify hospitals' nonprofit status. Beginning next year, the rules will require nonprofit hospitals to do a similar review every three years. According to information provided by Vandehaar, hospitals must also have an implementation strategy in place by next year to address the needs determined in the assessment process. The new requirements also apply to Olathe Medical Center. Vandehaar facilitated a public meeting for that hospital earlier this month. He said participants at that forum raised similar concerns to those identified in the northern part of the county, including the need for more behavioral health services and help with attacking chronic diseases by addressing problems such as obesity. It's important to discuss these issues, Vandehaar told the group Tuesday evening. \"Most people don't think about health numbers every day,\" he said. The Johnson County Department of Health and Environment also is part of the discussion. The department issued an updated Community Health Improvement Plan in May as part of its effort to earn certification through the Public Health Accreditation Board. The priorities of that plan were mirrored in the issues raised at the hospital forums: xIncreased physical activity and better nutrition for residents. xImproved access to health care. xAnd better availability of treatment for substance abuse and mental health problems. Vandehaar presented data that included the results of a survey Shawnee Mission Medical Center recently conducted of residents in its service area. About 10 percent of the approximately 630 respondents listed access to mental health care as \"poor\" or \"very poor.\" That was the highest negative rating of the availability of services from the survey. The second biggest service gap turned up in the survey was availability of nursing home care; 7.8 percent of respondents ranked access to those services as \"poor\" or \"very poor.\" Vandehaar also cited data from the annual county health rankings compiled by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Population Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin. In that report, Johnson County ranked first among Kansas' 105 counties in several categories last year, but it came in 63rd for \"physical environment.\" Vandehaar attributed that mostly to the relatively poor air quality in the Kansas City metropolitan area, but that category also included resident's access to recreational facilities, which play a role in the physical fitness of a community.Nothing presented at the forum suggested that Shawnee Mission Medical Center needed to radically shift directions, Wright said. The comments, he said, validated the hospital's focus on wellness and mental health services. The priorities identified by the group might seem fairly obvious, said participant Cherie Boxberger, quality and system improvement director with the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association in Overland Park. But, she said, it helped to see all the facts and figures in one presentation to \"get a pulse\" for the county's status and to take a \"foundational step\" toward addressing the needs. Johnson County might have plenty of parks and a highly educated population that knows the importance of eating right and exercising, Boxberger said, but that doesn't mean everyone takes advantage of the amenities or lives a healthy lifestyle. The hospital and its physicians, she said, can play an important role in driving home the need for personal responsibility. Your spouse might bug you for years to quit smoking, she said, but it's different coming from your doctor. \"People will listen to their physician,\" Boxberger said.

The Johnson County Department of Health and Environment is working with Olathe Medical Center and Shawnee Mission Medical Center over the next two months to gather information on community health issues. Under the federal Affordable Care Act, nonprofit hospitals are required to perform a community health needs assessment every three years. The results are expected to guide current and future health care needs for each hospital's primary service area, the county health department said. Last week , Shawnee Mission Medical Center mailed a survey to residents asking about health care practices and access to services. Survey returns are due by Oct. 31. NOTE: If you would like to take survey online please connect with below link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CHNA_SMMC In addition, two other fact-finding programs are planned: Olathe Medical Center will host a town hall dinner meeting on Nov. 1 at the Olathe Health Education Center, 21201 W. 152nd St.. The event runs from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. \u0083Shawnee Mission Medical Center will hold a public town hall dinner meeting on Nov. 13, at the Matt Ross Community Center, 8101 Marty St., Overland Park. The meeting is scheduled from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. Vince Vandehaar, managing consultant from VVV Research & Development Inc. in Olathe, has been hired to oversee the research assessment.
