Questions will be answered. All recommendations will be available after the visit through our portal, as well as handouts, lab orders and referrals ready to be printed. Dr. O sends supplement recommendations via an online dispensary with links to exact recommendations with dosages from very high quality supplements and trustworthy brands. Testimonials: \"A fellow friend with cancer recommended I make an appointment with Dr. Orceyre to discuss Mistletoe therapy treatment. Even though DC is at least an hour and a half drive, I made the appointment desperately wanting someone to give me something healthy for my body. All of the treatments for breast cancer have so many bad side effects and it was a breath of fresh air to get treatments that would build my body up. Not only did Dr. Orceyre prescribe the Mistletoe Therapy to boost my immune system, help with chemo nausea and kill cancer cells but she also looked at all my blood work and chemo cocktails and developed a custom plan for supplements and diet that would help my body to cope with all the things going on. I received some added benefits - my skin has never felt so soft in all my life and I finally was able to shed a few extra unwanted pounds. Dr. Orceyre was critical in helping me weigh out what the doctors were recommending for me to do. I love knowing that someone who has so much Natural training can also help me see the value of the medical profession and can offer real solutions for the side effects. I am happy to say that I made it through 3 months of chemo during the winter months, surrounded by the flu, colds and strep throat and I never got sick once. Dr. Orceyre also helped me develop a supplement protocol for my surgery that helped me sail through and for Proton Therapy (Radiation) which I have coming up next. I really appreciate her willingness to have phone appointments with me for follow up so I don't have to take a day to drive to DC. Even though my initial relationship has started because of cancer, I see such a value in how I have been feeling that I will continue to have follow up appointments with Dr. Orceyre for my general well being.\" - a patient. \"... My last appointment was Dr. Orceyre, and as always, the appointment was awesome! I have not felt as cared about by my physician as I do by Dr. O since my pediatrician.\" - J. Y. \"On Wednesday, I went to [a doctor] to rule out something serious since I couldn't get an appointment with you until Thursday. She took my temperature, looked in my ears/nose/throat, took my BP and my pulse ox. And suggested Z-Pac antibiotics. We agreed that I'd take a prescription, but I said I wouldn't fill it unless I was worse on Friday. Yesterday I went to you and you did much of the same thing, but you found a bunch of different things that all seemed to be working together. Plus you diagnosed the rib right away. And you listened to all the pieces of the story to figure out what remedies I needed. And now, I've avoided antibiotics. This is the reason [my husband] and I value your care so highly and the reason we tell everyone to try integrative medicine. It makes such a big difference and keeps us so much healthier overall. I hope that comparing the experience of typical care and integrative medicine will help your student see how much value there is in what you do. It really is invaluable as far as I'm concerned. Thank you for all you do!\" - K.D. \"I was diagnosed with cancer in August 2016 and, after surgery, began radiation and chemotherapy that Fall. During my first two chemos, I began having moderate-to-severe pain/neuropathy in my lower legs and feet. After doing some research, and talking to my oncologist and friends with similar experiences, I contacted GWCIM to learn about possible alternative remedies. Dr. Deirdre Orceyre, acupuncturist and naturopath, recommended several supplements as well as acupuncture treatments. My pain subsided noticeably after I began the supplements and acupuncture and I was able to complete my chemo treatments with fairly minimal side effects. It is not unusual for cancer patients to continue to experience neuropathy after chemo ends, and I did continue to experience some neuropathy for several months after my cancer treatments ended. Consequently, I have continued acupuncture treatments as well, reducing the frequency of treatments as the neuropathy has waned. I am now five months post-chemo and my neuropathy is almost completely gone. I credit much of my improvement to Dr. Orceyre's treatments. I also have found her to be a knowledgeable, patient and compassionate caregiver throughout the time I have seen her.\" - E.M. "}
