Practices also have unique issues for each particular practice that an experienced healthcare lawyer will review. What are the general compliance and transactional issues for physician driven practices and arrangements? Generally, physician-driven healthcare practices have the following compliance and business issues: - Numerous legal and regulatory compliance laws and requirements. We advise clients about: - Anti-referral laws such as Stark Law and the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) - HIPAA - The use of Managed Service Organizations (MSOs) - Federal and state agency compliance laws including warning letters. - The Federal Trade Commission generally monitors your online and offline advertising and marketing - Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations generally apply to companies that make and distribute drugs, medical devices, cosmetic devices, and other healthcare products. Physicians the physician-driven businesses do need to understand when and how FDA oversight does affect practices and businesses. - Over-the-Counter (OTC) compliance - Many business related issues including: - Business formation issues - Employment and consulting agreements - E-commerce issues - Real estate and licensing - Dispute resolution - Insurance issues Some of the regulatory compliance issues that Cohen Healthcare Law Group, PC, provides includes the following. Stark Law and AKS Law Physicians need to take very careful precautions for every type of business relationship they have - whether regarding their own business, ancillary practices, the people who might refer patients to them, and the people/businesses whose products they use. The federal government and state governments place an extremely high priority on ensuring that all financial and referral arrangements are designed to put the patient's health and safety above everything else. For example, patients shouldn't be given tests they don't need. If they do need tests, the tests should be reliable and accurate so the patient can receive quality care. We review the professional arrangements and contracts our clients have with other doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals and business. We focus on planning and compliance regarding: - Stark - a federal self-referral law - The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) - State laws governing fee-splitting such as the California Business & Professions Code. [Stark law](https://www.starklaw.net/) (a physician self-referral civil law) focuses on the relationships between a physician and a \"designated health service (DHS)\" In which the physician (or a family member) has a financial interest in. Generally, it is illegal for the doctor to refer patients to a DHS (where they have a financial interest in that DHS) unless a specific Stark exception applies. Stark law is a strict liability law which means doctors are subject to the law if they knew or \"should have known\" the conduct violated the law. Penalties can include: - Substantial fines - up to $15,000 for each prohibited referral. - A return of payments made by a government agency such as a Medicare or Medicaid - Exclusion from participating in Medicare or Medicaid programs Some of the [numerous exceptions](https://www.starklaw.net/stark-law-exceptions/) (which we review with our clients) include exceptions for: - Rental space - Office equipment - Bona-fide employment relationships - Physician recruitment - Group practice arrangements with a hospital - Personal service arrangements - Many other transactions We explain the requirements for each exception and then work to craft documents and protocols to help ensure you meet those specific requirements. [The AKS is a criminal statute](https://www.asahq.org/quality-and-practice-management/managing-your-practice/timely-topics-in-payment-and-practice-management/anti-kickback-statute-and-physician-self-referral-laws-stark-laws), an anti-corruption law, designed to benefit the beneficiaries of healthcare programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE, from the influence of financial incentives on referral decisions. \"The law makes it illegal to exchange (or offer to exchange), anything of value, in an effort to induce (or reward) the referral of business reimbursable by federal health care programs.\" Value includes money, sham directorships, discounts on office costs, vacations, and many other financial benefits. Penalties can include: - Fines up to $25,000 for each violation - Five years in jail - Exclusion from Medicaid and Medicare programs While Stark law applies to physician referrals, the AKS applies to referrals from any source. The AKS has a list of safe harbors which can help protect physicians if they are crafted and implemented correctly - with the help of an experienced healthcare lawyer. Many of the safe harbors are similar to the Stark Law exceptions. A few notable AKS safe harbors are payment for personal service arrangements or through a management contract. The [basic requirements of a management contract safe harbor](https://cohenhealthcarelaw.com/healthcare-compliance-regulatory/anti-kickback-fee-splitting-stark/) are, for example, - \"The management agreement covers all the services the manager provides for the term of the agreement and specifies those services - The agreement is intended to provide for the services of the agent on a periodic, sporadic or part-time basis, rather than on a full-time basis for the term of the agreement, the agreement specifies exactly the schedule of such intervals, the precise length, and the exact charge for such intervals - The term of the agreement is for at least one year - The aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement is set in advance, is consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions and is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties - The services performed under the agreement do not involve the counseling or promotion of a business arrangement or other activity that violates any state or federal law; and - The aggregate services contracted for do not exceed those which are reasonably necessary to accomplish the commercially reasonable business purpose of the services.\" California and Illegal Medical Referrals There is a California counterpart set forth in [Business & Professions Code Section 650(b)](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2411) which provides an allowance as follows: \"(a) Except as provided in Chapter 2.3 (commencing with Section 1400) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety Code, the offer, delivery, receipt, or acceptance by any person licensed under this division or the Chiropractic Initiative Act of any rebate, refund, commission, preference, patronage dividend, discount, or other consideration, whether in the form of money or otherwise, as compensation or inducement for referring patients, clients, or customers to any person, irrespective of any membership, proprietary interest, or coownership in or with any person to whom these patients, clients, or customers are referred is unlawful. (b) The payment or receipt of consideration for services other than the referral of patients which is based on a percentage of gross revenue or similar type of contractual arrangement shall not be unlawful if the consideration is commensurate with the value of the services furnished or with the fair rental value of any premises or equipment leased or provided by the recipient to the payer.\" Two of the key requirements of the California law are: - The compensation is at fair market value for the services rendered; and - The compensation does not vary by volume or value of patients referred Cohen Healthcare Law Group, PC Cohen has represented numerous healthcare practices, practitioners, and companies (including physicians, medical groups, home health agencies, addiction treatment centers, chiropractors, and diagnostic facilities) on Stark and AKS issues for both: - Healthcare startups - Continuing healthcare practices Doctors who run their own medical practices and doctors who run, mange, or assist practices that provide traditional, complementary, and integrative care for patients need to review the laws and regulations that apply to their practice. Failure to comply with these laws can result in the closure of the business, fines, and penalties - especially for violations of Stark Law, the AKS, and the state anti-referral laws.
