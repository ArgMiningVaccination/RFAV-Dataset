During his studies in Germany, Switzerland, Israel, Denmark, and the USA, he gained specialist skills in Homeopathy, Nutrition, Herbal Medicine, Acupuncture, and Clinic Management. He has written several books and has given many interviews on radio and TV. When Hermann Keppler started his clinic as a Naturopath, he soon came to find that he did not have the knowledge to help some of his clients. After further training in Iridology, Chinese Diagnosis, Nutrition, Tissue Salts, Flower Remedies, Homeopathy, and Herbal Medicine, he was able to help a greater number of clients, and he became a practitioner for the whole family. That's when he decided to open a college that would help future natural therapy practitioners learn and thrive by encompassing all of these skills in the curriculum. Hermann Keppler established the first CNM in London in 1998. More colleges followed across the UK and in Ireland. Today CNM is the UK's leading training provider of a range of natural therapies, providing CNM Diploma Courses in: + Naturopathic Nutrition + Herbal Medicine + Acupuncture + Homeopathy + NaturopathyDiploma Courses in Naturopathic Nutrition, Herbal Medicine, Acupuncture, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Natural Chef and Health Coach Our Mission + To provide thorough, practice-orientated training in natural therapies such as Nutrition, Herbal Medicine, Acupuncture, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Natural Chef, Vegan Natural Chef and Health Coach Training + To train students to become highly competent, successful practitioners. + To make sure CNM Courses are widely recognised and respected in the UK, Europe, and internationally. + To continuously raise the profile of natural therapies in society. + To support and promote CNM Graduates after qualification.

Acupuncture Dip. Naturopathy What is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is a core element of Chinese Medicine. It is based on the understanding that there is an energy flow in living organisms, which, if blocked, results in diseases. An Acupuncturist resolves this energy flow by placing needles in appropriate Acupuncture points. Acupuncture & Naturopathy The energy flow (qi) is produced by the food one eats and the better the diet, the more qi a person has. In other words: if one lives in a toxic environment, eats poorly, and does little exercise, the Acupuncturist has much less qi to work with. CNM Students are taught to consider TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) philosophy and to educate clients in developing healthier, more sustainable lifestyles. Naturopathic Acupuncturists stimulate the body's innate capability to balance health. CNM's unique Naturopathic Acupuncture course combines current Chinese Principles (Acupuncture) with a focus on detoxification, exercise and eating the right foods.

Homeopathy Dip. NaturopathyWhat is Homeopathy? Homeopathy is a therapy which was developed by the German physician Dr Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th Century.The term Homeopathy comes from the Greek word homoeos (similar) and pathos (suffering). The principle of Homeopathy lies in the philosophy like cures like, whereby substances which can cause symptoms in a healthy individual can address those symptoms manifesting in a sick person. How does Homeopathy work? Homeopaths believe that disease is a state of imbalance resulting from several factors. These factors include external influences; lifestyle, food, exercise, environmental exposures, microbes, physical and mental trauma. For external factors to cause a disease the individual must be susceptible. Someone who is mentally alert and physically active has a strong vital force and is more immune to the action of viruses, bacteria, parasites, seasonal changes, and stress, so they fall ill less often. A Homeopath looks at all physical and mental symptoms together and suggests the one remedy specific to the individual. It is the appropriateness of the remedy to the individual which stimulates the vital force and promotes good health.The course syllabus: Part 1 (Biomedicine, Naturopathy Study & Homeopathy I) 1 - 3 years Biomedicine + Biomedical Anatomy, Physiology & Pathology + Medical Terminology & Research Methods + Medical & Naturopathic Pharmacology + Medical & Naturopathic Clinical Diagnostics incl.

I found my CNM studies completely enthralling, despite being in my 40s and having to fit study around running a home, a family and a job.

Our students and graduates come from all walks of life and all backgrounds. What links them is the desire to help themselves and others to better health, and their commitment to having a fulfilling and flexible career. Nutrition helped me overcome chronic fatigue Rebecca, Graduate in Naturopathic Nutrition I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue and Lyme disease aged13, and had to use a wheelchair. Through my own research I realised the power of Nutrition to make me feel better. I then studied with CNM because their approach is natural and holistic, and enabled me to understand what helped me as a chronic fatigue sufferer. Today I lead a normal life without pain, and the wheelchair is long gone. The clinic that I opened after graduating is super-busy. I specialise in seeing clients with chronic fatigue and it gives them hope to see how I have improved. Practising doesn't feel like work to me, I love seeing my clients' progression. After bringing up my family I wanted a career Amanda, graduate in Naturopathy and Acupuncture I enrolled at CNM after a conversation whilst helping my daughter choose her GCSE options. \"What would you do if you had your time again, Mummy?\" \"Become an Acupuncturist!\" , was my immediate response, as Acupuncture had helped my health problems. As I had told my children they could do anything they wanted to with hard work and determination, they persuaded me in turn to pursue my new career. Graduating in Acupuncture and Naturopathy was both hard work and great fun, and it enabled me to set up a really successful clinic, making people feel better. Now I have a truly rewarding career, both personally and financially. It's wonderful to be doing something I believe in Adam, graduate in Naturopathy and Herbal Medicine After gaining a BSc in biochemistry, I worked in pharmaceutical marketing, but I became disillusioned with the pharma-led model of healthcare so I decided to change my career. I chose Herbal Medicine because it combined my scientific background with my burgeoning interest in natural healthcare. I chose CNM's course because it's based on naturopathic practices, because it maintains energetics as a key part of the course; and because students learn to be confident practitioners. It was invigorating to be around other like-minded people and some brilliant lecturers. Now, as a busy practitioner, it's truly wonderful to be doing something I believe in and helping people on a daily basis. I'm a Personal Trainer and Nutritionist Keris, graduate in Naturopathic Nutrition I started in the health industry as a personal trainer, but I wanted a more in-depth understanding and experience of nutritional therapy to enable me to successfully coach clients towards their wellness goals. Studying at CNM was an inspiring experience as I was able to implement a more holistic approach to health and get fantastic results with my clients. Our business has grown dramatically since I qualified. We've written two successful books, launched a Nutrition and exercise membership site, and we run regular workshops and retreats.
