Acknowledgements First, I would like to express m y appreciation to those who funded this research. This work could not have been done without the support of the John A. Hartford Foundation Building Academ ic Gerontology Nursing Capacity Scholarship and the Donald D. Harringt on Dissertation Fellowship. I would also like to thank those who adm inistered th e grants. Claire Fagin, PhD, RN, FAAN and Patty Franklin, MSN, RN who adm inistered the Hartford Scholarship, were supportive, encouraging, and flexible in thei r work as director and project director for the program . Chris Marcin and Dean Do llard of The University of Texas at Austin Harrington Dissertation Fellowship program represented the University with dignity and pride. Their efforts m ade me continually aware of the m agnitude of the honor I received when awarded the Harrington Fellowship. I would not have been able to do this research w ithout the support I received. I am deeply touched by the generosity and grateful for the support. Second, I would like to acknowledge th e support of m y advisor, Alexa Stuifbergen, PhD, RN, FAAN. I had no id ea of what I was capable of thinking, writing, or becom ing before I was her student. I am grateful that she was incredibly knowledgeable and that she was willing to share her knowledge. Not everyone is both. More im portantly, she insp ired m y interest in disability studies with her enthusiasm , encouragem ent, and positive attitude toward her own research. Being a part of her research team has been one of the best work experiences I have had. vThird, I would like to express m y appreciation to m y com mittee. My dissertation com mittee was com prised of Dr. Nosek, Dr. Spirduso, Dr. W alker and Dr. McDougall. These people are com mitted and brilliant scientists. I could not im agine doing this work without thei r guidance and support. First, Dr. Nosek spent considerable tim e sharing her vast experience as a researcher and a wom an with a disability. This work was shaped by m any of her insights. Second, I owe my interest in gerontological research to Dr. Spirduso. She was an excellent teacher whose enthusiasm for the care of our aging population was, and still is, unmatched. Next, I owe m uch of m y intere st in wom en's health to Dr. W alker. Through her hard work at The University of Texas at Austin, School of Nursing an Institutional National Research Serv ice Award for the study of underserved wom en was awarded to the school. This provided m any students opportunities for intensive study in wom en's health issues; fortunately, I was one of those students. Dr. W alker has been an excellent role model for each one of us. Finally, Dr. McDougall has been challenging and intellectually stim ulating with his theoretical insight into issues of aging. I appreciated his willingness to share his expertise and tim e. Fourth, I want to acknowledge all of those who have worked hard to maintain the portf olio program s at The Univ ersity of Texas at Austin. Dr. W aneen Spirduso and Dr. Gayle Acton have done an excellent job building a multidisciplinary educational program for gerontology students. Not only did I receive excellent research inform ation, but I received the support of a group of internationally known researchers. I w ould not have received a com parable vieducation without the gerontology Institu te. I also wish to acknowledge the numerous people involved in the W omen's and Gender Studies portfolio program s. The workshops and courses availa ble to m e as a portfolio student were challenging and stim ulating. Fifth, I would also like to thank all of the professors who took the tim e to discuss this research with m e. Specifically, I would like to thank David L. Kahn, PhD, RN, for his help with the devel opment of the research proposal. I was saddened by his need to resign from the committee prior to the com pletion of the study. I would also like to thank Benjam in Gregg, PhD for his help with the herm eneutic phenom enology philosophical foundations behind the work. The next group of people I would lik e to acknowledge is the wom en who shared so m any details of their lives with me. Not only did they help m e with this research but they were also very kind to me. Many showed concern for m y well being as I traveled m any m iles across Texas to interview them . I felt like I had made friends. I hope they felt the sam e. I will always treasure the tim e I spent with each one of them . Finally, I would like to acknowledge th e support of m y family. They have frequently provided the inspiration, or ki ck, to continue, whichever was needed. My children always encouraged m e to keep studying. They were always excellent children. W hen I looked at them I knew I had to keep working because they deserved m ore than I could give them the day before. Moreover, m y parent's enthusiasm for m e to finish this work was m ore than enough to keep m e going. My m other m ade life easier in everyway she could and I appreciate her effort. viiThe Meaning of Aging for Women w ith Childhood Onset Disabilities Publication No._____________ Tracie Culp Harrison, Ph.D. The University of Texas at Austin, 2004 Supervisor: Alexa Stuifbergen The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of the m eaning of aging for wom en with childhood onset disabilities. It was m y aim to explore the life course of wom en aging with paralytic polio and to convey an account of the changes associated with aging, the strategies used to adapt to the changes, and the affects of gender on their ability to adap t to the changes. Using a herm eneutic- phenom enological m ethodology, 32 wom en with a history of paralytic polio were interviewed and audio taped 2 to 4 tim es for 1 to 4 hours at each interview. Of these wom en, 25 m et the criterion needed to understand aging with im pairm ent from childhood. The 25 wom en whose stories we re used in the final analysis were 55 to 65 years old. The m ajority was A nglo (80%), m arried (64%), and had children (68%). The m ean age of paralytic polio onset was 5.5 years of age. The majority had been diagnosed with post polio syndrom e (88%), and was using viiisome type of assistive device (88%). A them atic analysis revealed 4 them es regarding the m eaning of aging: It's Just Part of Me, Slowing Down, The Particulars of Aging, and the Journey that Changes You. Next, changes associated with aging, consequences of the changes, and strategies used to adapt to the changes were described. Finally, 2 them es em erged to describe how gender influenced their ability to adapt to the cha nges with aging: Perceptions of Self and Discrepancies in W omanhood. Findings indicated that perceptions of age influenced their reaction to im pairm ent. Their ability to adapt was inf luenced by their ability to find synchrony between percep tions of self and their ability to act on their behalf . Impairm ent did not necessarily dam age their ability to act on their behalf. Other life circum stances, m any of which m ay be com mon to wom en without disabilities, com bined with their impairm ents to influence the m eaning of aging. Although the wom en pushed their bodies to the point of decline to achieve their chosen roles, they valued their achievem ents in lif e. Directions f or future research and im plications for nursing practice were discussed. ixTable of Contents List of Tables ......................................................................................................... xv List of Figures ...................................................................................................... xvi List of Figures ...................................................................................................... xvi Chapter 1: Introduction ........................................................................................... 1 Study Purpose ................................................................................................. 2 Background ....................................................................................................

Life course developm ent for wom en with childhood onset disability. Adapted from the work of Cam pbell (1994), Scheer & Luborsky (1991), W enneberg and Ahlstrom (2000), and Schuster (1993) ......14 xviChapter 1: Introduction There are 53.9 m illion Am ericans with a disability (Jans & Stoddard, 1999); 28.6 m illion are wom en and their num bers are increasing (Gerschick, 2000). The increase is partly due to a longe r lifespan for persons with disabilities, which is m ost pronounced am ong those ag ing with a disability since childhood (Cam pbell & Barras, 1999; Cam pbell, Sheets & Strong, 1999). For exam ple, the average life span has increased for the nearly 700,000 with cerebral palsy and the over 500,000 polio survivors (Cam pbell, 1998) . Regretfully, their increased life span has been accom panied by health and social problem s (Cam pbell; Harrison & Stuifbergen, 2001). Women with disabilities experience high rates of poverty, negative stereotypes, high rates of institutionalization (Frank, 2000) and increased secondary conditions and co-m orbidities with aging (Harrison & Stuifbergen, 2001). These problem s are costly to the individual, the fam ily, and society. The health risks associated with aging w ith a disability were behind the U.S. Departm ent of Health and Hum an Services ' decision to include the elim ination of health disparities am ongst people with di sabilities as a 2010 goal, which followed the goal to elim inate disparities associated with gender (U.S. DHHS, 2000). The research available on aging a nd disability in wom en has f ocused prim arily upon aging as a process of biological decline. There is little understanding of the lived experience of aging for wom en who have had disabilities since childhood; despite evidence from nursing, gerontology, 1sociology, and developm ental psychology th at aging has physical, psychological, social, and cultural com ponents (Eld er, 1994; Moen, Dem pster-McClain, & William s, 1992; Sarvim aki, & Stenbock-Hult, 2000). W omen age in com plex ways, therefore, it is tim e to expand the current understanding of aging to include the experiences of wom en with childhood onset disabilities. When society develops an understanding of the experiences of aging for a group, health care treatm ent and policy decisions can be tailored appropriately (Torres-Gill, 1992). By understanding the experience of aging, resources that prom ote opportunities for a high quality of life can be developed to anticipate changes and support wom en over their life course. If researchers do not understand m ore than the often inevitable biological decline few culturally appropriate interventions can be designed that help wom en with disabilities with their daily lives. Moreover, by understanding the psychological, social and cultural, as well as physical dem ands of aging, preventive steps can be taken that may reduce the problem s wom en with disabilities experience. STUDY PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to expl ore the m eaning of aging for wom en with childhood onset disabilities. A herm eneutic phenom enological approach was used to guide this qualitative study of wo men who survived paralytic polio in childhood and were aging into late adu lthood. Due to the varied cultural and societal experiences throughout the histor y of the United States for wom en of varied ethnicities, Anglo, Hispanic, and Af rican Am erican wom en were interviewed for their experiences of aging with childhood onset disabilities. 2Moreover, because perceptions of gende r influence awareness of the body and social status, gender was explored as an influence on perceptions of age related changes and subsequent adjustm ent. The specific aim was to produce a life course description of the m eaning of aging developed from the experience of living with a disability since childhood in a cohort of wom en age 55 to 65 who surv ived paralytic polio. W ithin this study it was also the aim of the researcher to: \u0083 Explore the m eaning of the ch anges wom en with childhood onset disabilities associated with aging as they entered into later adulthood\u2014 ages 55 to 65. \u0083 Explore how wom en with childhood ons et disabilities adjusted to the changes they associated with aging. \u0083 Explore how the wom en's gender im pacted their experience of aging and subsequent adjustm ent. BACKGROUND This was a study of the experiences of wom en growing older with impairm ent related to childhood onset polio. The background for this study included the historical context that in fluenced the m eaning of the wom en's experiences. This form ed the basis for understanding the shared m eanings of the group. In order to understand aging for wom en over the life course the historical and cultural setting for the cohort was expl ored. Cultural values have shifted over the 20th century in relation to the positi on of wom en in society, and that was 3taken into account. W omen now live longer, have m ore com plex roles, and have greater freedom in Am erican society (Gie le, 1993). In a review of m ultiple studies of wom en and their level of educati on in Am erican society, Schuster (1993) classified wom en's lives from the ear ly 1900's to the 1950's as typical of a Vanguard Era because wom en were only se lectively gaining education and few entertained the idea of com bining fa mily responsibility and professional employm ent. The post 1950's period was de scribed by Schuster as the Era of Limitations because wom en were encouraged to educate them selves but prim arily for the purposes of gaining a suitable husband. This was followed by the Era of Transitions, which was typified by wom en struggling to find m eaning in their lives through education and em ploym ent. This tim e period was considered a critical tim e for social change in Am erican history. The Era of Liberation was described as the tim e period after 1965 wh en wom en began to enter the work force with m ultiple professional opportun ities, but with new social stressors (Schuster, 1993). The changes within the social context were significant when studying the lives of wom en aging with the effects of paralytic polio. Poliom yelitis is a very old disease; although the height of its im pact on Western societies was during the f irst half of the 20th century. Poliom yelitis could be traced back as far as the Egyptian rem ains of a m ummy found in 3700 B.C. (Mitchell, 1900). Heine reported the first clear description of the disease in 1840 (Frost, 1911), and in 1841 an epidem ic wa s described by Colm er in a group of infants residing in Louisiana (Frost). S ources indicated that the epidem ics of poliom yelitis were f irst recorded in rway and Sweden (Lavinder, Freem an & 4Frost, 1918), and in the U.S. from 1909 to 1915, the rate of polio was of endem ic proportions; death rates ranging from 5,000 to 12,000 over the entire 6 year period (Lavinder et al.). In the year 1916, things began to change in the U.S.; polio becam e epidem ic in the eastern US and contributed to over 6,000 deaths and 23,000 cases (Lavinder et al.). Afterwards , epidem ics of polio sporadically occurred in cities and rural regions in the United States and throughout the world with increasing virulence (Sabin, 1949). Currently, am ong wom en with disabilitie s, polio is one of the m ost common causes of paralysis; it is sec ond to stroke (LeCom pte, 1997). Polio- related paralysis could range from minor m uscle weakness to total paralysis requiring ventilatory support (Morag & Ogra, 1996). Prior to the use of the poliom yelitis vaccine, approxim ately 32 of every 100,000 children born in the world suf fered perm anent disability due to the polio virus (Bart, Foulds, & Patriarca, 1996). In 1952, 50,000 people were infected with polio in the United States alone (March of Dim es, 2001b) . Today, approxim ately 640,000 people in the United States have som e degree of impairm ent related to polio; 10 m illion polio survivors live worldwide (March of Dim es, 2001a). In paralytic polio, the focus of this study, dam age is related to cellular destruction. The lesions of destruction occur in the spinal cord, m edulla, cerebellum , midbrain, pallidum and/or the motor area of the cerebral cortex. All other areas of the cerebral cortex are spared (Morag & Ogra, 1996). Three types of paralytic polio have been described correlating with characteristic patterns of the disease (Morag & Ogra). First, there is pure spinal poliom yelitis that involves 5tightness, weakness or paralysis of the respiratory m uscles without involvem ent of cranial nerves or vital centers. The largest degree of destruction involves the cervical and thoracic spinal cord segm ents. Second, pure bulbar poliom yelitis involves the m otor cranial nerve nuclei with or without involvem ent of the vital centers that control things like body tem perature and circulation. The third type, bulbospinal poliom yelitis, af fects the respiratory centers and the cranial m otor nerve nuclei. The sym ptoms range f rom increased respiratory rate, inability to cough or sniff to inability to swallow, h eart irregularities, flaccid paralysis, pain, incontinence, and decreased blood pressu re. This is followed by m uscle atrophy due to disuse and denervation. The onl y treatm ent is supportive care (Burns, Barber, Brady, & Dunn, 1996). Although polio infection is no longer a public health epidem ic within the United States, there are reasons to conduct th is research with polio survivors. The experience of polio survivors can se rve as a m odel for understanding the experience of aging with a disability (Ale xander, 1990). This is the first tim e in history that people with m ajor disabling conditions have lived from childhood to middle and late adulthood (Cam pbell, 1998) and the aging of polio survivors is largely responsible for this new phenom enon. Many wom en who are aging with polio were inf ected as children, rehabilita ted and then lived within the com munity as productive citizens. The focus of po lio treatm ent was on acute care m edical issues and m any of the long-term conse quences of living with a disability over time were ignored (Kem p & Krause, 1999). The experience of aging with a disability can be understood by analyzing the stories of polio survivors. 6Polio survivors have described how a disability since childhood has impacted their behaviors and em otions in later life. Research has indicated that polio survivors have m ade ef forts to adapt to new disabilities and environm ental problem s as they arise (Hansson & Ahls trom , 1999), and have frequently been able to m aintain their self -esteem and quality of life in the f ace of worsening disability (Currie, Gershkoff, & Cifu, 1993). However, their values related to education, achievem ent, and inner strength, which have been reported to help them norm alize when they were young and forget their disability, have been less useful to them as they seek to cope with failing physical health in older age (Kuehn & W inters, 1994). Many of the diffi culties associated with living with a disability since childhood have contributed to having a lim ited social life, not being able to live independently, unem ploym ent, and a loss of access to the health care system after age 21 (Currie et al.). The life stories of polio survivors can provide evidence of how aging is experienced. Most polio survivors are now in the age range of 40 to 70 years and are likely to enter the health care system at an increased rate as the years pass, which includes acute care settings. Although polio survivors have had on going experiences with health care providers, th is has been prim arily with rehabilitation professionals who m ay have a different approach to the care of persons with disabilities than general practitioners (Albr echt, 2001). Nurses in all settings need to be m ade aware of the rehabilitation n eeds of persons aging with disabilities. This was supported in an ethnographic st udy over 3 years with 153 persons with disabilities. From this study, researchers reported two case studies of the 7experience of how m acro-level policies im pact the daily lives and care of persons with disabilities. One participant, a 48-year-old m ale with PPS who was hospitalized with acute respiratory f ailure, reported that a nurse asked his wife why they would use costly technology to support a person with a disability, such as her husband, who would have little quality of life (Albrecht). The nurse and other acute care providers dem onstrated little understanding of polio, the m an's quality of life with a disability, how the pa rticipant had cared f or his im pairm ent over his lif e course, or what changes were anticipated f or persons with disabilities as they aged. The participant did not receive the instruction he wanted for discharge and the health care system did not understand the m an's past experiences with polio that shaped his current health care needs. Providers cannot remain ignorant to the way a disease shapes the body, m ind, and society. The social reaction to polio was an ex emplar of how a disease could have a large and lasting im pact upon the hea lth and psychology of people. Recently, I toured a local university m useum ; the deve lopm ent of the polio vaccine was listed as one of the m ajor social developm ents of the 1950's. No other disease related achievem ent was listed during any of the time periods from the 1800's to present. I was struck by the im pact this discovery had m ade. Later, scientists announced that they had developed a m eans of producing polio in a laboratory setting, I watched as the m edia reacted with outrage . And when persons infected with W est Nile virus developed paralysis, it was im mediately described as polio like symptoms, which conveyed the idea of an im minent threat. Although other 8diseases have resulted in the deaths of far m ore individuals worldwide, polio has invoked considerable societal response within the United States. Other countries have been less fortunate. It was 30 years after the developm ent of the polio vaccine that the W orld Health Organization devoted resources and began planning to elim inate polio in developing countries (Shiffm an, Beer & W u, 2002). This was par tly due to the realization that people in developing countries were suffering seri ous im pairm ent related to polio despite being considered m ore prone to early in crem ental exposure, which was thought to have decreased their chance of serious paralysis from the virus. It was also partly because developing countries dem onstrated they could m ount effective vaccine program s to reduce the incidence of the di sease (Shiffm an, et al.). It was clear; however, that the world had to com e to the conclusion that polio deserved attention, not only a national level, but on a world wide level (Shiffm an, et al.). Today, polio still causes paralysis in various countries such as India. SENSITIZ ING FRAMEWORK A fram ework that integrates sym bolic interactionism and the lif e course paradigm was used for this initial he rmeneutic phenom enological study exploring the m eaning of aging f or wom en with disabilities. W ithin the lif e course paradigm , aging was viewed as a devel opmental process of changing events and socio-cultural m eanings that m ove acro ss tim e but within the historical and cultural context of the cohort (Giele & Elder, 1998). The life course paradigm incorporated four distinct areas of soci al life that when brought together told a story of aging. The four elem ents, which made up the paradigm , were: 1) lives in 9time and place, 2) hum an agency, 3) th e tim ing of lives, and 4) linked lives (Elder, 1994, 1996). These elem ents, whic h were based upon the prem ises of symbolic interactionism , com bined to form the life course view of aging. Symbolic interactionism (Blum er, 1969) was based upon three prem ises. First, people acted based upon the m eaning objects and events have for them . Second, the m eaning assigned was based upon their interaction with other people, and third, people selected objects and events out of their environm ent and process them through tim e to m ake m eaning. W hen a person was asked about an event in her childhood she told a story that appear ed random , but because it was selected it held m eaning to that person who processe d it over tim e. This indicated their story was not extraneous. It told about their interaction with other people within a specified tim e and place. For purposes of research, the stories about how people chose to act or not to act throughout life pr ovide a series of events and associated meanings that tell about aging. The life course paradigm enabled the researcher to understand the developm ental changes wom en with disabilities experience. Harrison (2004) docum ented through a review of the histori cal and extant research on wom en with disabilities that four issues were important for the understanding of the developm ent of wom en with disabilities: \u0083 Their lives are highly interdependent, \u0083 Institutions f or people with disabilities m ay shape or alter lif e course developm ent, 10\u0083 Cultural and historical context shape the m eaning of gender and disability, and \u0083 There was a continued, not episodic, im pact of im pairm ent on social role developm ent. The life course paradigm provided the re searcher a useful tool for understanding the m eaning of aging from the perspec tive of wom en with disabilities (Harrison, 2004). The life course paradigm was found to be consistent with phenom enological views of tim e, which was relevant when studying the effects of aging. The m ajor assum ption of the life c ourse paradigm , which was based on the importance of past events on present life pathways, was explained with Husserl's description of how present and future was based upon past perceptions. According to Husserl (1999), when tim e was viewed as individual consciousness, it was the medium of existence that passed without regard in the present. It took form through a stream of perceptions while allo wing the person to anticipate the future and bring the past into the present. Pe rceptions in the present ultim ately becam e recollection. In other words, they we re objectified and brought forward as recollection but never again as a percepti on. The perceptions that passed rem ained in the past despite new perceptions. C ontinually passing perceptions were again objectified within the m ind. According to Husserl, the hum an function of objectifying past perception allowed peopl e to build an identity, reality, and history. 11The objectification of continually passi ng perceptions was valuable to this research on aging because it allowed for the understanding of the passage of tim e with age and the accum ulation of knowledge of oneself and others. Aging was understood within tim e because every m oment perceived was placed in sequence by tim e with death rem inding us of its end (Berger & Luckm an, 1966). Moreover, the objectification of past events as reco llection m ade the experience of events in time knowledge, and this knowledge form ed our history and m ade us aware of the limits of our bodies. Geertz, in his work with the Balinese, wrote that tim e could be m arked in m any ways to gain an understanding of its passage, yet the \"m ost important is by the recognition in their self and in their f ellowm en of the process of biological aging, the appearance, maturation, decay, and disappearance of concrete individuals\" (1973, p. 389). Aging occurs within tim e and tim e is the fram ework for all interpretations (Heidegger, 1962). Understanding the im pact of disability f rom a herm eneutic phenom enological view of the life course may advance our understanding of how aging was experienced from the standpoint of wom en with disabilities. According to Shakespeare & W atson (2001) there is a need for an understanding of disability that values im pairm ent as part of the continuum of hum an experience instead of objectifying and dividing persons based upon categories of ability. In other words, disability should be contextualized as a lived experience dependent upon context (Gabel 1999) that does not place people into stringent categories of disabled and able-bodied. W hen the body is no longer seen as ill or in a sick role, persons with disabilities are viewed within a context of aging understood as variations of the 12human body (Shakespeare & W atson). W ithin this context they are no longer the other or the excluded, but active m embers of society aging within a different context. Just as wom en were reexam ined when acknowledged to have a varied experience f rom men, wom en with disab ilities m ust be explored--not as an extension of disease, m edicine, illness or men with disabilities, but within their own lived experience. The lif e course trajectory com bined w ith a disability trajectory set within the historical changes experienced by wom en can guide the understanding of how disability af fects wom en with disabilities. Based on the work of Scheer and Luborsky (1991), Schuster (1993), Cam pbell (1994) and W enneberg & Ahlstrom (2000) the life course trajectory was ad apted for wom en with disabilities and presented in figure 1. 13 1980 1990 Life Course Events Era of Liberation Vanguard EraEra of Lim itationsCultural and Historical Chan ge Era of Transitions2000 1970 1960 1950 Disability experience with age Figure 1. Life course developm ent for wom en with childhood onset disability. Adapted from the work of Cam pbell (1994), Scheer & Luborsky (1991), W enneberg and Ahlstrom (2000), and Schuster (1993) 14DEFINITIONS \u0083 Childhood onset disability was understood as a perm anent functional impairm ent resulting from pathology a nd/or dam age that occurred at or prior to age thirteen and im pacts adjustm ent over the life course. \u0083 Gender was a set of culturally prescrib ed attributes that characterize the degree of fem ininity and/or m asculinity perceived by others and/or enacted by the individual. \u0083 Impairm ent was an objectively or subj ectively determ ined alteration in the body's ability to function in a way th at is norm al. For exam ple, the inability to m ove an arm or leg was im pairm ent. \u0083 Disability was a relative inability to meet the dem ands of the socio- cultural environm ent. The loss of one's job due to the inability to sort papers, which was attributed to ar m paralysis, was an exam ple of disability. \u0083 Culture was a set of m eanings that were locally shared am ong people and enabled them to com municate and advance their knowledge (Parsons, 1951; Geertz, 1973; Hall & Neitz, 1993). \u0083 Aging was a process of changing m eanings set within chronological tim e. \u0083 Frailty was def ined as being in a state of increased risk f or negative health related outcom es (Fried, Ferrucci, Darer, W illiam son, & Anderson, 2004). \u0083 Com orbidity was defined as m ore than one m edically diagnosed and recognizable condition in one individual (Fried, et al., 2004). 15\u0083 The life course was defined as th e \"culturally defined script of norm atively expected stages and trans itions for the socially defined (Scheer 1174). \u0083 Herm enology was define d as a m ethodology used to guide the understanding of the lived expe rience through the explication of transcribed text (Cohen, Kahn, & Steeves, 2001). The goal of H/P research is to understand the m eaning of a phenom enon as told by those experiencing it. ASSUMPTIONS \u0083 People act based upon the m eanings they gain from interaction within their environm ent and the derived m eanings are processed over tim e. (Blum er, 1969). \u0083 We can understand the m eaning of experiences through com munication, which m ay include facial expression, gestures and written or verbal expression (Gadam er, 1960/2000; Polkinghorne, 1983). \u0083 The m ost accurate interpretation of the m eaning of experiences conveyed is gained through a precise understa nding of the social, cultural, and historical context in which people live out their lives (Gadam er, 1960/2000). \u0083 Early events within the lif e course im pact later adult developm ent (Elder, 1996, 1998). A person's biography influences how she reacts to and adapts to any new events (Elder & Liker, 1982; Elder & Chan, 1999). 16\u0083 Gender, ethnicity, and disability have culturally assigned m eanings that may influence perceptions of health. SIGNIFICANCE TO NURSING Although this was not a study of the pr actice of nursing, it was designed to inform nursing praxis. Nurses are challe nged to take the study findings and use them to guide the care of wom en with di sabilities. This involves the care provided in acute, rehabilitation, and com munity setti ngs. It also involves the care given when influencing policy decisions and in teracting with wom en on a daily basis. This was a study of wom en with chil dhood onset disabilities done to inform nursing praxis of the m eaning found in aging. When historical shifts in the care of persons with disabilities were exam ined, the need for this understanding becom es clear. In only four decades, society m oved from celebrating the survival of persons with polio to contem plating assi sted suicide f or persons with disabilities that threaten quality of life (Koch, 1999). The Am erican public, scientific community, governm ent, and health care com munity have been consistently faced with difficult choices surrounding the us e of technology and the subsequent form ation of policy designed to care fo r those in need. One of the m ost controversial has been the decision to prolong life in the face of disability and possible suffering. Other decisions include d how to best distribute resources through entitlem ent program s to the elde rly and/or need-based program s to persons with disabilities. All of these d ecisions have surrounded the interpretation of the m eaning given to the experience of aging and to disability, of ten by people 17who have not lived the m ajority of their life with a disability. Nursing was viewed as one discipline that could guide the application of new technology respectfully into clinical practice (Newell, 2000), and help guide policy decisions designed to improve the lives of persons aging with disabilities. However, nursing m ust begin with an understanding of the life course experience of disability and aging. Without this inform ation, society m ay wa ste valuable resources on health care policies and provisions not grounded in the lived experience of wom en aging with disabilities. Life course stories have clinical application because nurses can use them in practice to guide care. According to Fr ank (1996), stories could be analyzed to capture the m eaning of an experience fo r a group, which could be used by health care providers to m ake assessm ents and provide care that m ay indicate a need for further intervention. These stories coul d highlight what wom en with childhood onset disabilities f ind as benef icial while aging with a disability and provide nurses a source to validate their interpre tations of their patient's experiences (Frank, 1996). Women with disabilities m ay also serv e as role m odels f or people aging into disabilities after years without im pairment. Nurses can use the inform ation provided by wom en with childhood onset di sabilities to build interventions for successful adaptation for wom en who age into impairm ents. In an analysis of the Disability supplem ent to the 1994-1995 H ealth Interview Survey Vebrugge & Yang (2002) analyzed the phase I data that consisted of 77,437 adults. They compared those who aged into disability to those who had a disability onset prior 18to age 20 years. They reported that people with early onset disabilities, disability prior to age 20 years, had m ore disabilities and m ore social participation than those with later lif e disabilities of similar ages. This work indicated that people with childhood onset disabilities deserve further study to understand how they adapt to their im pairm ents while m aintaining social roles. Moreover, in a study comparing three wom en's views of agi ng Harrison and Kahn (2004) reported that the wom an with the childhood onset disab ility was m ore apt to choose social interactions that supported her view of self than the wom an with adult onset chronic illness who f elt stigm atized by her im pairm ent and rem ained isolated. Women with childhood onset disabilities m ay provide strategies that can be benef icial to all wom en as they age into later lif e. 19Chapter 2: Literature Review In order to exam ine the current knowledge base that captures the m eaning of aging for wom en with childhood onset di sability, five m ajor areas of literature were reviewed. The f irst section of the literature review f ocused on the m eaning of aging. This section was followed by a re view of life course studies of aging wom en. Although this was not intended to be an exhaustive review, it provided an understanding of aging wom en within a life course context. The third section was a sum mary of studies that reported the e xperiences of aging with a disability. A fourth section narrowed the report to the physiologic and psychosocial changes experienced by polio survivors. In the fi nal section, studies that represented the experiences of wom en with disabilities w ithin a lif e course perspective were reviewed. This section was essential becau se few studies directly exam ined the experience of aging f or wom en with disabilities. THE MEANING OF AGING Aging has been interpreted differe ntly by different groups throughout time. Understanding that m eaning is of significance because the m eaning that aging has in \"in any given society puts that whole society to the test, since it is this that reveals the m eaning or the lack of m eaning of the entirety of the life leading to that old age.\" (De Beauvoi r, 1970/1996). Covey (1992) reviewed the meaning of old age across history and found that it differed over tim e and between genders. For instance, Covey noted that biblical interpretations of age were less focused on chronology and m ore focused upon being functional and living a good life. W ithin the biblical view of aging, the vitality of the soul grew 20while the body perished. The ancient Greek philosopher, Hippocrates, viewed old age as starting at 56 years, and a m edieval scholar wrote that old age began at 30 years for wom en and 50 years for men (Covey, 1992). Throughout the m iddle ages and beyond, wom en were perceived as aging at an advanced pace com pared to m en due to their lim ited tim e as object s of sexual attraction and childbearing ability (Covey, 1992). Modern views of agi ng have shifted to coincide with retirem ent and proxim ity to estim ated time until death. Today, as people live longer and need to rem ain in the work force longer, old age m ay increase to well in advance of 65 years (Covey, 1992). Th e meaning of aging, however, has not been fixed at any specific chronological age. The m eaning of aging has traditionally been studied in the later years of life because with tim e and experience older people have been capable of integrating a large variety of positive and negative experiences to f ind m eaning (Hulbert & Lens, 1988). For instance, Er ikson, Erikson, and Kivnick (1986) broke chronological age into stages of life with associated tasks, m eanings, and roles. The prim ary task of the later stage wa s to find m eaning in past experiences. Persons were to review the events of th eir life to find m eaning in what had com e and gone. In a qualitative phenom enological study com paring 19 undergraduate students to 17 older adults, older indivi duals did not associate aging with any particular event nor did they recognize wh en it was that they becam e old (Adam s- Price, Henley, & Hale, 1998). The older a dults were, however, m ore apt than the younger adults to integrate positive and negative experiences in order to find meaning in what their lives had been. Th e younger adults were m ore apt to value 21their im age over the substance of their liv es. According to Adam s-Price, Henley, & Hale (1998) aging em erged as a positive experience despite associated negative changes. The m eaning of aging m ay be described as a life course phenom enon perceived with increased value in the later years. Levinson theorized that aging was a life course phenom enon with specific social roles, psychological tasks, and soci al expectations that were set within various stages of life. For Levinson (1986) , life consisted of an orderly sequence of 'periods' that were characterized by stable, lif e building tim es and interrupted by tim es of change that led to the ne xt period. Men and wom en had the sam e periods within each era of their lives described as childhood (0 to 20), early adulthood (17 to 45), m iddle adulthood (40 to 65), late adulthood (60 to 85), and late-late adulthood (85 and up). These pe riods and eras were invariant but overlapping stages of the life. W ithin each era, each person was required to complete a set of tasks. For instance, w ithin the early adult era there were f our tasks to be com pleted: a) form ing a dream , b) form ing a m entor relationship, c) form ing an occupation, and d) form ing an enduring love relationship (Levinson & Levinson, 1996). The fram ework applied to all hum an beings, and served to highlight the variations in culture, class, history, and gender (Levinson & Levinson, 1996). The problem with Levinson' s stages theory of aging, however, was the em phasis on the fixed stages of life. Life events in m odern society have been found to vary depending upon the indi vidual life and the social circum stance (Neugarten, 1968); therefore, events have not been fixed to specific stages of life. 22Despite the variability in lif e, the m eaning of aging has been shared among people within western culture and that shared m eaning m ay influence individual perceptions of the aging se lf over tim e (Levy, 2003). According to Goffm an (1997) the m oral career of a person was the change a person perceived in their self-im age as others looked at them over tim e. The inability to accept aging due to the youth orientation of so ciety has forced m any to devalue their later years of life (Andrew s, 1999). The feeling of being stigm atized for aging may create a desire not to age or to hide one's age. Moreover, biom edical im ages of aging have predisposed the word geri atric to m ean m ental and physical decay (Hepworth, 1995). Hepworth suggested th at when the m eaning of aging was associated with ill health, elderly indi viduals were treated like expiring objects\u2014 \"cared for but socially neglected\" (Hepworth, p.17). Over tim e, associating negative m eanings with aging m ay have deleterious effects on health. In a study of 54 m en and wom en over age 62, Levy, Hausdorff, Hencke, and W ei (2000) found that negative im ages of older adults heightened cardiovascular reactivity while positive im ages reduced cardiovascular reactivity. Levy, Slade, and Kasl (2002) studied the effects of negative views of aging on health outcom es in a population of 433 participants over age 50 for as m any as 20 years. Those who had m ore positive views of aging at baseline had better functional health scores over tim e than those who had m ore negative views of aging at baseline. These results rem ained significant after controlling for baseline functional health, self-rated health, age, gender, race, and socioeconom ics. The research on negative im ages of aging provided growing evidence that the shared 23negative m eanings of aging, once intern alized, m ay directly im pact health outcom es. For the past 20 years gerontologists have recognized the need to study people who age into late lif e in successf ul ways. In other words, there was a recognized need to study people who ag e without developing the problem s once thought of as aspects of norm al or usual aging, such as osteoporosis and isolation (Rowe & Kahn, 1987). Although successful agi ng has been defined differently by different researchers depending upon their values (Torres, 1999), the theory of selection, optim ization, and com pensation by Baltes and Baltes (1990) was reviewed here. According to Baltes and Baltes, success was gained by m eeting a combination of researcher-defined subj ective and objective criteria for success. These could be any com bination of length of life, biological health, m ental health, cognitive efficacy, social com petence and productivity, personal control, and life satisfaction. These criteria could be achieved through two strategies. First, the person could prom ote her health over the life course, and second, the person could be adaptable enough to m inimize the loss asso ciated with aging using strategies of selection, optim ization, and com pensation (Baltes & Baltes, 1990). These strategies would allow the individual to adapt to unique circum stances with aging. Research on successful aging has been varied due to the lack of a multidisciplinary fram ework that com bines what success is and how people m ight obtain it (Steverink, Lindenberg, & Orm el, 1998). Frequently, success has been defined by the ability to m aintain f unctional ability over tim e (Seem an, Unger, Mcavay, De Leon, & Mendes, 1999; Stra wbridge, Cohen, Shem a, & Kaplan, 241996; Seem an & Chen, 2002). Tate, Lah, and Cuddy (2003) explored the definition of successful aging in nearly 4,000 retired air force m en with a m ean age of 78 years. These authors reported that 30% of the m en defined successful aging as related to their health. In a qualitative study of 30 wom en age 78 to 88 years, Day (1992) reported that negative changes in health and ability were the most traum atic experiences to the wom en, second only to loss due to death of a family m ember or m oving away from family. This sam ple of wom en was relatively functional, 90% of them could take care of their own functional needs. Few studies were found that exam ined th e meaning of successful aging in the context of life long disability. Nilsson, Ekm an, and Sarvim aki (1998) published a phenom enological- herm eneutic study of the m eaning 30 older people (age 82-92 years) gave to their lived experiences. Old age experiences were broken down into successful aging, good old age, com paratively good life in ol d age, bad aging, and a m iserable life in old age. The health of the participants was sim ilar across groups, but the participants in the successful aging group di d not m ention their health as an issue while those in the m iserable aging group m entioned it frequently. Moreover, the successful group had close relationships and was actively involved while the miserable group was lonely and idle. This study indicated that perceptions of health m ay influence well-being for thos e who have not lived their lives with impairm ents. It m ay also indicate that t hose who com plain about their health and associated im pairm ents m ay be perceived as less successful as they age. 25The m eaning of aging and its relation to illness was explored by Gadow (1982) in a phenom enological treatise. Gadow described four levels of relation between the self and the body over tim e. First, the prim ary im mediacy was defined by the self being conscious of acting with the body in the world. Second, the disrupted im mediacy was when incapac ity disrupted the harm ony between self and body. The body was an object that encum bered the ability of the self to act. This occurred with pain or disease. Third, cultivated im mediacy was the transcendence of im pairm ent in order for the self to overcom e the problem s of the body. The self and body are reunited and able to work together again after the struggle caused by disease or im pairm ent. Finally, aesthetic im mediacy was the meaning given to the body with aging and illness. The self viewed the object body with com mitment to concern, persever ance, and developm ent. The body was viewed with aesthetic regard as a whole with the self . The m eaning given to the body by the self m ade the experience of liv ing in the world with the aging or impaired body worthwhile. Kaufm an (1986) com pleted 15 intensive life history narratives with white middle class m en and wom en regarding the m eaning of aging. Their experiences were brought to the present to create th e individual identity through a process of finding m eaning. The elderly individuals Kaufm an spoke with were expressing them selves as ageless despite noting m ultiple physical changes that had occurred in later lif e. Age was not an em phasis f or the people and their identity rem ained constant despite the cultural changes that were dem anded throughout life. Moreover, Kaufm an stated that individuals integrated their life stories of work, 26friendships, fam ily, and health to \"connect and integrate the diverse experiences of a life tim e\" (p. 25-6). Sour ces of m eaning for these elders were structural and related to personal values. The structural sources of m eaning were fam ily ties, socio-econom ics of childhood, education, geographic m obility, and work; national historical events were not sour ces of m eaning. The values, which were sources of m eaning, were achievem ent, pr oductivity, progress, social usefulness, and individualism through self-reliance, initiative and industry. By understanding the sources of m eaning to these elders, the whole life was revealed and m ade sense of for the researcher and the participant (Kaufm an). In a study of the shared m eanings of adapting to the nursing hom e, Kahn (1999) used lifetim e narratives consistent with the m ethod described by Kaufm an (1986) to gain a thick description of the experience. The participants were m ostly wom en with chronic illnesses. These 21 pa rticipants described through the course of several 20 m inute to 1 hour interviews how they recognized the am bivalence of the situation, downplayed the negative, and used their will to create a hom e in the institutional environm ent. The participan ts felt a personal responsibility to m ake the best of the situation through the pr ocess of m aking the room they were assigned into a hom e. By bringing in personal item s that had m eaning to the individual the environm ent provided them with a source of m eaning\u2014hom e. This, at least partially, restored their sense of well being. Summary The m eaning of aging is a subjective in terpretation of the lived experience, which has different m eanings across groups. The m eaning m ay, however, be 27shared by groups within a culture. W hen the shared m eaning is negative it m ay negatively im pact the health outcom es of pe rsons as they age. Gerontologists have increasingly focused upon successful ways of aging. This has been defined differently, but f requently associated w ith better health and f unctional ability. It has not been well researched within groups with life long im pairm ents or disabilities. By labeling successful aging as functional ability and not investigating the experiences of persons with disabilities, researchers m ay be inadvertently delegating persons with im pairm ents to the unsuccessful category without understanding how they age. It is possible that persons with life long impairm ents perceive success in aging by finding m eaning in the experiences they live as an em bodied self while adapti ng to their changing environm ents and abilities. STUDIES OF AGING WOMEN : LIFE COURSE PERSPECTIVES As a starting point for the understanding of the perspective of the lives of wom en with disabilities, it is im portant to review what is known about the life course of wom en in general (Danek, 1992). In this section, selected life course studies focusing on aging wom en are pres ented. Using data from the Berkeley Longitudinal Study of norm al developm ent, Elder and Liker (1982) conducted a quantitative investigation of the life c ourse outcom es of wom en born from 1890 to 1910. It was hypothesized that loss dur ing the 1930's would im pact well-being in late lif e with health being a balance between loss and gain of resources over the life course. The results indicated that wom en's lives were shaped by the great depression, which was m ost evident in their em otional health in old age. W omen 28of working class backgrounds, who experi enced hard tim es during the depression, experienced poor em otional health and intellectual capability while wom en of middle class backgrounds, who also experienced hard tim es, becam e more self- assured and cheerful in old age. Intere stingly, m iddle class wom en who did not experience hard tim es did not gain the sam e emotional benefits. It was posited that som e wom en are m ore prepared for old age due to their life course experiences that strengthen their ability to adapt (Elder & Liker). In a qualitative case study of three aging wom en using a life course approach, Shenk (2001) argued that wom en's late adult lives are influenced by the relationships they have with their f amilies. The relationships inf luenced lif e choices and opportunities, which m olded how their later lives were viewed. For instance, one wom an who lived her entir e life with her parents after having a child, found herself being their caregiver in old age. Later she becam e bitter with few interactions and lived alone in the f amily hom e. Her lif e choices were influenced by the out of wedlock birth of her child and her fam ilies' response. In late life, she becam e an em otionally isol ated wom an without contact with her own child. The early life experiences of th e wom an were given m eaning through her interactions with significant others and these im pacted her life as an older wom an. The different life course paths that wo men enter were explored in a sam ple of 313 wives and m others interviewed in 1956 and 1986 (Moen et al., 1992). The rate of disability or severe illness expe rienced in persons who were healthy in 1956 was exam ined over the 30 year peri od. The duration and tim ing of adult roles were also exam ined. The research ers found that m ultiple roles in 1986 were 29associated with better health in 1956 and 1986. About a third of the wom en experienced som e form of severe illne ss or disability over the 30 year period. Educational level or num ber of children was not significantly related to duration of health. The wom en who engaged in cl ubs and other organizations experienced a significantly longer period without disab ility or severe illness. The accum ulation of roles over the 30 year period was positively associated with the wom en's appraisal of health in 1986 even when controlling for socioeconom ic variables such as social class, husband's occupa tion, and incom e. The authors posited that these findings indicated that wom en follow two distinct paths influenced by role acquisition and by health. In a study of the life course developm ent of 68 m iddle aged (age 33 to 56) wom en, Rossi (1980) investigated how wom en cope with fam ily and work responsibility as well as how fam ily and work affected the m eaning they associated with aging. This group of wom en was part of the baby boom er generation, which was characterized as an educated cohort of wom en who have participated in sexual freedom s and witnessed civil rights and fem inist movem ents. Many of these wom en post poned m otherhood and opted to further their careers, which was unique to this c ohort at that tim e in history. The results indicated that none of the wom en wanted to be older than their chronological age; most wanted to be around 6 years younger and wanted to live to around 75 years. Women with larger f amilies and wom en who were older when their f irst child was born reported they wanted to be significantly younger than wom en with smaller fam ilies and wom en who were younger when their first child was born. 30Overall, wom en who perceived life was goi ng well were satisf ied with their age. Moreover, the m ore age-related sym ptoms they reported, the worse the relationship with their adolescent children. Rossi's study indicated that strain can occur in wom en's lives as the social ch ange characteristic of their cohort is enacted in their daily lives. Summary In sum mary the literature indicated that wom en's lives are interconnected (Shenk, 2001) and affected by social events and the historical tim e period (Elder & Liker, 1982; Rossi, 1980). This can, in tur n, affect their health, social activities, and ability to adapt to change in later life (Elder & Liker; Moen et al., 1992; Shenk). STUDIES OF AGING WITH DISABILITY Few studies have exam ined the effect of aging on the health status of wom en with disabilities. Coyle and co lleagues (Coyle, Santiago, Shank, Ma & Boyd, 2000) studied the degree of seconda ry conditions in a sam ple of 165 wom en age 18 to 65 years with varying types of disabilities. These researchers found high rates of secondary conditions that were dependent upon the type of initial disability, with the m ajority re porting f atigue, spasticity, pain, m obility problem s, and physical de-conditioning. Th e most severe secondary problem s were am putations and respiratory pr oblem s. A large proportion of wom en reported poor functional ability to com plete everyday tasks. Other work has indicated that wom en with disabilities m ay be at increased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis after m enopause due to inactivity and non-weight bearing 31activities (Vandenakker & Glass, 2001). St uifbergen & Becker (2001) reported that wom en with MS who engaged in health prom oting behaviors over tim e reported less f unctional decline than t hose who did not engage in health prom oting behaviors. This work indicated that functional decline was not a purely biological necessity of aging f or wo men with disabilities. A behavioral component exists, which m ay be influe nced by the psychological, social, and cultural context. The psychosocial aspects of being wom en and aging with disability have placed wom en at risk for further health problem s. The im pact of disability, aging and gender create a triple jeopardy that place wom en with disabilities at risk of social m arginalization and poor health beyond that of persons without disabilities or m en with disabilities (Pentland, Trem blay, Spring, Rosenthal, 1999). Pentland and colleagues docum ented that wom en with disabilities were concerned about their changing bodies with age and how that affected their social roles. The loss of social roles placed them at risk of losing needed health benefits for access to care, thus increasing their risk for further health problem s over tim e. Unfortunately, this work was lim ited due to the inclus ion of participants with a wide age variation (age 25 to 71 years of age) wit hout an exploration of the influence of culture, cohort, or tim ing of disability (Pentland et al). Despite physiologic changes in the body, there are positive factors associated with aging. Researchers have reported that factors associated with decline are decreased in those who engage in health prom oting life styles over the life course (Fries, Green & Levine, 1989) . The prospect of a com pression of 32morbidity--extension of life without disab ility-- has led to theories of successful aging, which began with studies of elite el derly athletes and has culm inated in a theory of selection, optim ization, and com pensation with age discussed earlier (Baltes & Baltes, 1990). Other researcher s focused upon positive aspects of aging that included Neugarten's (1968) and Erikson, Erikson, and Kivnick's (1986) theoretical work on m ental growth in agi ng. This led to work indicating that self- esteem can be high in the elderly (H erzog & Rogers, 1986). Despite losses in health, the elderly m ay have optim istic vi ews of them selves with a high sense of purpose (Mossey, 1995). The need for an in sider view of the aging body, which is suitable for qualitative m ethods, is often need ed to integrate the lived experience of aging with the changes in the biological body. Qualitative m ethods m ay be suitable for integrating the experience of aging with the biological changes but f ew qualitative studies of wom en aging with childhood onset disabilities have been reported in the literature (W iley, 2003). Qualitative reports of the experience of aging with disabilities m ay benef it persons with disabilities by giving them an outlet to com pare their experiences with others, by giving them more contro l over their lives by reading about what others have done, and by providing them an inspiration in regard to their aging potential (W iley, 2003). Despite the possible benefits of qualitative research for wom en aging with childhood onset disab ilities few have been published in the literature. The im pact of disability throughout th e life course was exam ined in an ethnographic study of persons aging with the effects of polio (Scheer & Luborsky, 331991). The biographies of three people were set within a developm ental and life course context that was influenced by historical change. The norm ative life expectation and developm ental norm s and the rehabilitation and recovery f rom polio influenced life course experiences. Th e influence of the historical m ovem ent surrounding polio was strong enough to sway the participants to label them selves as having a Type \"P\" (for polio) personalit y. The polio survivors were driven to norm alize. The m ain problem they repor ted with aging was not related to medically defined conditions, but with th e prem ature loss of roles and goals for the future. This study was a contributi on to our understanding of aging with a disability, but it did not address the im pact of gender upon perceptions of aging. The work by Scheer and Luborsky ( 1991) was followed by a dissertation study of 15 purposively sam pled polio survivors who experienced the disease as children (Lewis, 1992). The inclusion criteri a for this study were paralytic polio prior to age 13 and intact cognitive f unction. Lewis's research was based upon polio as an illness trajectory. The them es reported were the acute illness phase, recovery with a long plateau, unanticipated late effects, and further functional decline. Lewis (1992), like Scheer and Luborsky (1991), found that two life course them es dom inated their biographies , but in this sam ple the cultural and developm ental norm alcy them es were accom panied by them es of chronic and emotional distress with unending struggles . This work supported the need to provide context to disability within the lif e course, but persons with disabilities often criticize work that places them with in a chronic illness perspective (Oliver, 341996). The view of the group as having unending struggles m ay have em erged due to the f ocus on polio as a chronic illness with associated sick role behavior. Charm az (1991) conducted interviews with 55 inform ants with chronic illnesses that ranged f rom neurologic im pairm ents such as m ultiple sclerosis to those with circulatory diseases and cancer. Her study focused upon the construction of identity and tim e while e xperiencing chronic illness. All of the participants were white and ranged in ag e from early twenties to over 70 years of age. She conducted m ultiple interviews with the participants in order to gain comfort with disclosure. She wrote that her inform ants were able to understand the abstract nature of her study when they were given tim e to think about the nature of her questions. This also allowed her tim e to speak m ore in depth with the inform ants about issues that arose during previous interviews. In regard to this study, the m ost sa lient interpretations that Charm az (1991) presented were related to tim e because tim e is a fram ework for aging. Charm az provided a thick description of how chronic illness could change the way tim e is experienced. For instance, if people becam e prim arily positioned in their past, they could lose the experience of the present. These people would reflect on past m emories without attending to the present or future because only the past held m eaning for them . She also found that if people becam e caught up in present activities of caring for their illness, they could hasten tim e. Others found them selves longing for a future that br ought them immortality and freedom from their failed physical beings, or they s earched for a purpose in life that brought them immortality or lasting identity. Thes e experiences of time were m any of the 35ways those years were m arked and rem embered as events passed. However, Charm az only interviewed Anglo Am erican s, interviewed a wide range of age cohorts, and m ade little attem pt to understand disability apart from chronic illness. The disability experience was analyzed by W enneberg and Ahlstrom , (2000) who interviewed 15 polio survivors. The five them es identified were the acute phase of severe illness, rehabilitation phase with restoration of capabilities, phase of relative stability, transitional phase where f unctional capacity is lost, and new dependence on m edical technology. These individuals com municated stories of strength in overcom ing their initial disability but found their new disabilities could not be overcom e in the sam e manner. The disability that arrived with aging required new resources from them and their m emories of their childhood disability overwhelm ed them \u2014creating a sense of vulnerability. This work was similar to the prior studies but added to the literature because it explored them es related to adjustm ent to later lif e disab ility. Again, gender was not explored as an influence on the life course of these participants. In a phenom enological study of the expe rience of aging for approxim ately 27 m en and three wom en with spinal cord injuries living in Japan, researchers reported that six underlying them es emerged (Iwakum a, 2001). First, the participants stated that tim e had been a ltered by their im pairm ent. One participant stated that tim e had stopped since his accident and he was only rem inded of its passage by a birthday card. Second, particip ants were concerned about how their bodies would adapt to changes associated with aging, but contact with disabled 36elders was a calm ing source of feedback for them . By seeing others cope with the effects of aging, younger persons were better prepared for the future. Third, persons with disabilities felt they aged di fferently than non-disabled people. They reported that the opportunities for fulf illing life goals were altered by their disabilities. Fourth, m any reported they we re better prepared f or the ef fects of aging because of their early onset disa bilities. Im pairm ent had altered their trajectories but prepared them better to a ppreciate life's gifts that occur over tim e; such as m eeting new people. Fifth, the participants had concerns for their family\u2014especially their wives because they relied so heavily upon them for their care. As their wives experienced physical changes with age, they feared what those changes m ight m ean for them . Finall y, they did not fear changes that were already present. They did not fear th e loss of physical functioning that m any without disabilities fear with aging. This study was lim ited due to its low num ber of wom en and lack of gender analysis, but it did provide a unique glim pse at the phenom enon of aging for persons with di sabilities in Japan. It was unclear how the experiences of those in Japan would overlap with those in the United States. It was not until Cam pbell (1994) reported a quantitative study of impairm ent related outcom es based upon tim ing of disability in the life span that gender was considered an influence on th e life course developm ent of persons with disabilities. This study was conducte d with three groups of persons aging with disabilities\u2014those who have had poli o, stroke, and spinal cord injuries. Again, this work supported the use of life course theory with persons aging with disabilities. Cam pbell found that the tim e of disability onset was significantly 37related to the degree of im pairm ent. W omen who developed post polio syndrom e (PPS), which is characterized by ne w onset weakness and fatigue, had significantly m ore depressive sym ptoms than wom en without PPS. They also had higher depressive sym ptoms than m en with or without PPS. W omen were also more likely to have had to stop thei r education based upon their polio-related impairm ent when com pared to m en. This study com pared outcom es based upon gender using a life course theory approach. It indicated that further work was needed to understand how gender im pacted the problem s associated with aging and subsequent adjustm ent. Frank (2000) reported the results of a 20-year herm eneutic phenom enological life course investiga tion of one wom an born in the United States with no arm s or legs. Findings i ndicated that m any barriers grew out of cultural stereotypes and inf luenced the participant's ability to becom e employed, stay m arried and rem ain living within the com munity. These cultural barriers combined with the historical tim e period, were a m ajor influence on the participants developm ent into m id life. Frank was able to report how researcher and participant m ay co-construct the lif e course story in Am erican culture. However, this study did not follow the pa rticipant into later adulthood and was based on the experience of one Anglo Am erican wom an. Summary In sum mary, studies were found that exam ined the experiences of aging while living with a disability, but they did not exam ine the ef fects of gender on the Scheer 1987). Other studies exam ined the health experience of persons with chronic illness over tim e, but did not m ake an attem pt to understand disability apart from an illness experi ence (Charm az, 1991; Lewis, 1992; Thorne, 1993). Studies that did focus on aging w ith disabilities did not incorporate the impact of gender on the experiences (Iwakum a, 2001; W enneberg & Ahlstrom , 2000). Frank's (2000) 20-year case study of one wom an provided a glim pse of how difficult experiences m ay be for wom en as they enter m idlife. Yet, this study was not designed to incorporate shared experiences of wom en, nor did Frank follow the participant into later lif e. Qu alitative studies m ay be benef icial to persons aging with a disability but fe w qualitative studies were found in the literature (W iley, 2003). Another lim itation in the extant literature was the lack of multi-ethnic sam ples of persons with disabilities. STUDIES OF AGING WITH POLIO Persons who survived polio have been the focus of neurological and muscular studies due to the occurrence of age-related m uscular weakness and fatigue. Twenty-eight to 40% of polio survivors have reported age-related symptoms known as Post Polio Syndrom e (PPS) (Halstead, 1998; Lecom pte, 1997). The pain, new onset weakness, and fa tigue with PPS have been associated with factors associated w ith the acute illness (Currie, et al., 1993). Overall, PPS has resulted in decreased m obility (Willen & Grim by, 1998), a new need for ambulatory and ventilatory aids (M acdonald, Gift, Bell, & Soeken, 1993), difficulty dressing, a new need for persona l assistance, and a change or cessation in occupation (Jubelt & Cashm an, 1987). The problem s experienced by polio 39survivors with age range from pain (See Table 1), respiratory problem s (See Table 2), and decreased m uscle strength (See Table 3), to various sym ptoms of decline (Table 4). Moreover, studies that tested therapies to help with these changes were predom inantly focused upon ex ercise as W illen, Sunnerhagen, & Grim by, 2001), but sm all sam ple sizes with carefully selected participants m ake it difficult to judge th e efficacy of exercise interventions for PPS at this point in tim e (McNaughton & McPherson, 2003). 40Table 1: Pain studies in persons aging with polio. Author, Year Design Sample Findings Koh, W illiam s & Povlsen, 2002 Self-report survey 139 Polio survivors 64% had upper lim b pain and 74% used m obility aids. Those who used mobility aids were at risk for upper lim b pain. Widar & Ahlstrom , 1999 Self-report survey 37 with PPS, age 52 to79 The group had pain a mean of 19 years in a mean of 5 locations. The wom en had pain longer than the m en. Aches in back and joints. Cram ps in lower extrem ities. Widar & Ahlstrom , 1998 Self-report survey 35 with PPS, mean age 65 Lower back (66%), knees (47%), and upper joints (38%) were m ost frequent sites of pain. Physical strain preceded pain. Heat and relaxation relieved pain. Willen & Grim by, 1998 Self-report survey 32 with PPS >50% experienced pain everyday. Muscle weakness had no correlation with pain. 41Table 2: Pulm onary changes studied in persons aging with polio. Author, Year Design Sample Findings Chasens, Umlauf, Valappil, & Singh, 2001 Self-report survey 584 with PPS. Those with sleep apnea increased frequency of naps. Poor sleep quality predicted increased risk of PPS. Weinberg, Borg, Bevegard, & Sinderby, 1999 Physiologic study 5 men with PPS age 42 to 58 Majority had norm al blood gas results but had ventilatory insuf ficiency when exercising. MacDonald, Gift, Bell, & Soeken, 1993 Physiologic study 23 PPS persons with age and gender m atched comparison with mean age of 55 Mean maximum inspiratory pressure was signif icantly lower f or the PPS group. Control group im proved in strength over three trials but the PPS group did not. Lin, Liaw, Chen, Cheng, Wong, & Chiou, 2001 Physiologic study 44 persons with idiopathic scoliosis and 16 with polio related scoliosis Pulm onary function for the polio group was related to scoliotic angle, kuphotic angle, upper vertebra of the scoliotic curve and age. Respiratory problem s were restrictive and not predicted by radiograph alone Stanghelle & Festvag, 1997 Longitudinal over 3 to 5 years with survey questions and physiologic measures 68 persons hospitalized with PPS. Mean age of 55 Lung function was a reduced restrictive type. Weight and polio symptoms increased over time. 42Table 3: Muscle changes in persons aging with polio. Author, Year Design Sample Findings Klein, W hyte, Keenan, Esqenazi & Polansky, 2000 Longitudinal with physiologic measures 120 persons with PPS Muscle deterioration was present in the f lexor m uscles of ankle, hip and knee, but it was not strongly related to age, tim e since polio, or gender. Rate of deterioration greater than expected with norm al aging. Dalakas, Elder, Hallet, Ravits, Baker, Papadopoulos, Albrecht, & Server, 1986 Longitudinal with physiologic measures 27 with polio mean age 51 years Rate of decline averaged 1% per year. The m uscles showed evidence of chronic and new denervation. No loss of whole m otor neurons. Slow disintegration of terminal nerve axons. Allen, Gandevia, Neering, Hickie, Jones, & Middleton, 1994 Physiologic study 21 persons with polio and 20 healthy age matched controls Group with PPS had m ore muscle fatigue than controls. Group with PPS had impaired activation of muscles when not fatigued. Sorenson & Windebank, 2002 Questionnaires and physiologic measures using longitudinal design 23 with polio 10 had sym ptoms of late progressive m otor deficits. The rate of progression was uniform over tim e. Severe residual im pairm ents were associated with sym ptoms of decline. Agre, Rodriquez, & Franke, 1998 Physiologic study 25 with polio related decline, 16 with polio and no decline, and 25 controls Recovery tim e from muscular exercise was greater in those with complaints of decline. Those with polio without decline did not differ from controls. 43Table 4: Various studies of decline in persons aging with polio. Author, Year Design Sample Findings Trojan, Cashm an, Shapiro, Tansey, & Esdaile, 1994 Chart review 127 with PPS and 39 with polio but no PPS Age at presentation, length of tim e since infection, weakness with initial infection, joint pain, weight gain, and m uscle pain predictive of PPS. 233 with polio age 39 to 77 58% reported m uscle weakness, 56% reported increased disability. 53% reported increased problem s with job and social integration. Nollet, Beelen, Prins, de Visser, Sargeant, Lankhorst, & de Jong, 2001 Self report and physiologic study 76 polio survivors with PPS and 27 without PPS. 78% reported that fatigue was m ajor problem , Walking outside (46%) and climbing stairs (41%) were next. The differences between those with and those without PPS were in social and physical functioning not in measured m uscle strength. Kum akura, Takayanagi, Hasegawa, Ibara, Yano, & Self report survey 662 with polio and 736 with spinal cord injuries 74.8% had som e type of decline. 53% of those with polio had PPS. Cum ulative incidence of PPS was 60% by 60 years of age. Decline was estim ated at 35 years post onset of polio. Those with severest sym ptoms at onset had m ore problem s with decline. 44Age-related changes experienced by po lio survivors af ter years of living with a stable im pairm ent should be exam ined within a life course perspective in order to understand the m ultitude of affect s these changes have had on their lives (Harrison, 2004; Maynard, 1995; Mc Naughton & Mcpherson, 2003). Persons aging with polio have reported higher le vels of depressive sym ptoms when compared to non-disabled age m atched controls (Kem p & Krause, 1999). Moreover, those who experienced pain, w eakness, and fatigue associated with PPS have reported less satisfied lives (Burger & Marincek, 2000) and a poorer quality of life (Kling, Persson, & Gardulf, 2000) than those without PPS. This may be because their im pairm ents with increasing age ham pered their ability to socially integrate (Farbu, Rekeand, Aar li, & Gilhus, 2001). Researchers have noted the psychosocial changes with aging for persons with PPS. The problem s studied were prim arily issues related to life satisfaction (Table 5), coping (Table 6), and other social determ inants of health (Table 7). 45Table 5: Life Satisfaction studies in persons aging with polio. Author, Year Design Sample Findings Kem p & Krause, 1999 Self report study 360 persons (121 with PPS and 177 with spinal cord injury) plus 62 controls The control group highest in all lif e satisf action scales. PPS group scored higher then the spinal cord injury group. Burger & Marincek, 2000 Self report study 100 polio survivors with average age of 55 69 out of 100 had sym ptoms of PPS. PPS decreased their ability to be active and social. It decreased their life satisfaction. Thoren-Jonsson, Hedberg, & Grim by, 2001 Self report study 113 polio survivors with mean age of 57 Women and m en < 44 had more em otional distress then those 45 to 64. Most health problem s were in work, housework, and leisure activities. Men reported m ore problem s with housework. Persons who had problem s with their social life had m ore complaints of problem s with energy, physical m obility, pain, em otional problem s, and isolation. Kling, Persson, & Gardulf, 2000 Self report study 150 persons with polio with mean age of 61. Perceived health associated with post polio sym ptoms. They had worse functional status and worse quality of life then a national sam ple. The wom en with PPS had significantly worse pain. Only those ages 75 to 82 appeared functionally similar to the general population. 46Table 6: Coping strategies used by persons aging with polio. Author, Year Design Sample Findings Natterlund, & Ahlstrom , 1999 Self report study 119 persons: 33 with muscular dystrophy, 46 with m yotonic dystrophy and 40 with PPS The m ajority of problem s were m obility and occupation related. People with m uscular dystrophy had greatest reported problem s. Women used m ore aids and own solutions to problem s than m en in basic personal care. People with PPS used more avoidance strategies for mobility problem s. Schanke, 1997 Self report study with physiologic measures 63 polio survivors (43 wom en and 20 m en with mean age of 55.3 years) Work capacity (peak oxygen uptake) did not correlate with psychosocial variables. They had high adjustm ent and problem focused coping. They had low psychological distress. Hansson & Ahlstrom , 1999 Qualitative 24 with PPS with average age of 66 General weakness, fatigue and pain added to their distress. Illness related problem s interf ered with daily activities. They coped by accepting illness, preventing sym ptoms, changing activities, distancing, em otional reactions and seeking social support. Thoren- Jonsson, 2001 Qualitative 22 persons with late effects of polio Main them e was com ing to a changed approach in response to changes in their bodies. Had flexibility in problem solving ability. Traded off independence and dependence. 47Table 7: Studies of social determ inants of health in persons aging with polio. Author, Year Design Sample Findings Foster, Berkm an, Wellen& Schuster, 1993 Self report study 268 polio survivors Many perceived no access to knowledgeable physicians or social and health care services. This interf ered with their ability to cope with problem s. Farbu & Gilhus, 2002 Self report study 168 polio survivors and 239 siblings Fewer polio survivors than siblings were working by age 40. 11 of 14 on perm anent disability were wom en. Fewer with polio m arried than did siblings. More wom en with polio then men with polio were divorced. Significantly more siblings reported good health and good life. Walker, 1998 Self report study 341 persons with polio with mean age of 56 75% ran out of energy quickly. Most had problem s perform ing activities requiring lower body use. 43% satisfied with sex lif e. Farbu, Rekand, Aarli, & Gilhus, 2001 Self report study 149 persons with polio and 98 controls Residual weakness was associated with not being married. Most polio survivors m arried at same rate as controls. Education was associated with parental education for both groups. Majority of polio survivors worked past 60 years of age. 48There is evidence that the lived experiences of wom en aging with paralytic polio m ay be sim ilar to wom en with other chronic disabling conditions. (Stuifbergen, Harrison, Becker, & Carter , 2004; Stuifbergen, Seraphine, Harrison, & Adachi, in press). Sim ilarities in sym ptoms and role expectations while living with im pairm ents create com monalities in wom en's experiences ng the im pairm ents (Stuifbergen, et al, 2004). Moreover, in a study of over 1600 pers ons with PPS, a m odel developed to investigate quality of life and health prom oting behaviors in persons with MS was found to be sim ilar for persons with PPS. Based upon the evidence supporting commonalities in experiences between types of im pairm ent, it behooves researchers to be knowledgeable of th e research on aging with PPS and aging with a disability in general. STUDIES OF WOMEN WITH DISABILITIES Women with disabilities are at risk f or social and health problem s with aging (Frank, 2000; Pentland et al., 1999) that threaten their ability to adjust to late adulthood, but few studies have been found exam ining the m eaning of aging into late adulthood for wom en with ch ildhood onset disabilities. The life course paradigm (Elder, 1994; Giele & Elder, 1998) provides one way to organize the studies that have been published into a c oherent whole. The following section is a synthesis of studies grouped according to the life course paradigm and focused upon wom en with disabilities. 49Lives in Time and Place Since the 1960's researchers have unde rstood that historical tim e and place affect life choices and subsequent aging. Ryder (1965) described this as a cohort effect. The approxim ate tim e and place of birth can affect what a group experienced when they were born and as th ey aged. Larger societal and historical changes experienced are shared with persons from the sam e cohort, which is traditionally viewed as no m ore than a 10-year birth span. Elder (1994) stated that cohort eff ects are especially im portant when society is changing quickly, which has been the case f or persons with disabilities. In the United States since the 1960's, there have been 13 different civil rights laws passed that were directed toward persons with disabilities (Harrison, 2002). For instance, legislation written in 1975 ensured education for children with disabilities, and the Olm stead Act of 1999 required that persons with disabilities not be institutionalized when sim ilar less re strictive environm ents were available. The Am erican's with Disabilities Act ( ADA), which m ade discrim ination against persons with disabilities illegal, has only been in ef fect for 12 years. Many of the laws passed over the last 50 years im pacted the daily lives of persons with disabilities in the f orm of educational and residential environm ents that m ay impact health. Econom ic policies toward wom en with disabilities, which are set within a specific tim e period, m ay also exclude th em from society. In a study of how patients qualif ied f or social security disa bility benef its, researchers reported that participants waited as long as 72 m onths for benefits, hired attorneys, com pleted 50multiple form s, and applied m ultiple tim es (Nasr & W elsch, 1996). The benefits provided were im portant because they provided access to health insurance and cash that allowed for increased independe nce (Nasr & W elsch). Moreover, in a study of gender differences in social s ecurity disability awards wom en received social security disability awards at a si gnificantly lower rate than m en even af ter controlling for the type of im pairm ent and personal characteristics (Baldwin, 1997). Although m en and wom en equally sa tisfied m edical eligibility, wom en were less likely to m eet vocational e ligibility requirem ents. For wom en with disabilities, exerting the continued ef fort to qualif y for benef its only to be rejected at an increased rate m ay prevent them from becom ing independent m embers of society. The governm ent has responded to the n eeds of persons with disabilities, however, the response has historically fa vored m en. The first national disability law was enacted for veterans of the Revolutionary W ar and followed by legislation to benefit m ilitary m erchant m arines (Albrecht, 1997). Most governm ent assistance has been either m ilitary or work related (Albrecht), which has excluded m any wom en from gaining benefits. This has been com pounded by the fact that social security benefits ha ve been distributed with a heavy weight upon vocational and m arital status, wh ich has excluded m any wom en with disabilities due to their low rate of m arriage and em ploym ent (Meyer, 1996). Living with a physical disability in the Unites States has been characterized as isolating. In the classi c work of Goffm an (1963), stigm a due to disability was well docum ented with cultural accounts of discrim ination and 51isolation of persons with disabilities. Murphy (1987) also added to our cultural understanding of disability in his studies of rites of passage. Murphy and colleagues ethnographic work reported that persons with disabilities in the United States were located in a lim inal state --being viewed as neither ill nor well and unable to participate in Am erican cultural norm s (Murphy, Scheer, Murphy, & Mack, 1988). Culture is m ore than som ething a society has; it is som ething that is done to each m ember (Agar, 1994). The individual is im mersed within a culture that is not only where they interact but also where they learn how to interact (Agar). It is within a culture that a person learns how to be a wom an and others learn how to interact with her (de Beauvoir, 1952/1974). Within Am erican culture, fem ininity is part of the essential expression of what it is to be a wom an (Goffm an, 1979; West & Zim merman, 1987). The way a wom an dresses, wears her hair, and walks produces signs that are regarded as expre ssive behaviors that convey to others she is a wom an and indicate term s for contact in social situations (W est & Zimmerman). Alm ost any activity is assessed to its wom anly or m anly characteristics (W est & Zim merman). Women with disabilities m ay feel stigm atized due to a self -image that is in conflict with how society views wom en (Goffm an, 1963). Feeling stigm atized has been reported to lower the self -esteem of wom en with disabilities and subsequently influence their ability to perform social roles (Nosek, Hughes, Swedlund, Taylor & Swank, 2003). A person is affected by how people see her 52over tim e and the change in people's response to her based upon that im age (Blum er, 1969; Goffm an 1963). The m eaning assigned to a wom an's im pairm ent for purposes of explaining her body within a culture, m ay influence her identity, roles, behaviors, and health (Kleinm an, 1980). For instance, in an African society, the way the Songye explained the disability of a child determ ined how the child was treated and their subsequent roles in the com munity (Devlieger, 1995). The Am erican view of the 'norm al body' com pared to the 'disabled body' has been rooted in scientific explanations of what is norm al for the hum an body and what is deviant. Women with disabilities have been described as \"asexual, sick, retarded, handicapped, over sexed, and a burden upon society\" (Anderson & Kitchin, 2000, p. 1164), and these im ages conflict with the slender sexually active m odern wom an that is prom oted within Am erican culture. W omen with disabilities have voiced concern over their ability to m eet th e cultural dem ands of the ideal f emale body im age (Ablon, 1996; Fine & Asche, 1988). In a study of body im age, gender and disability, wom en have reported concer n about the physical alterations that occurred and created a social stigm a (Abl on). Cultural expectations can hinder the integration of wom en with disabilities into society and have been used to explain the differential treatm ent they receive in gender roles such as wife (Parker, 1993) and m other (Harrison & Stuifbergen, 2002; Thom as, 2001; Thorne, 1990). The cultural im age of the ideal fem ale physique is difficult for m ost wom en to attain. This m ay have contributed to eating disorders and low self- esteem in m any wom en (Bordo, 1993), but wom en with disabilities m ay be 53impacted m ore by these im ages. Adolescent girls with disabilities have reported significantly higher use of laxatives, di et pills, and vom iting for control of body physique (Neum ark-Sztainer, Falkner, Beuhring, & Resnick, 1998). Moreover, in a study of the gender differences between young m en and wom en with cystic fibrosis, girls were found to be hi ghly concerned with m eeting norm ative definitions of fem ininity (W illis, Miller & W yn, 2001). The young wom en were less active, ate less, and had higher mortality rates than the young m en. The wom en placed norm ative gender expectations above participating in practices that would prom ote their health. For exam ple, the girls felt being thin was a good even though it was due to a m al-absorption of nutri ents related to their disease process so they did little to correct the problem (Neum ark-Sztainer, et al.). For wom en with m astectom ies due to breast cancer, norm ative evaluations of the fem ale body led m any to choose reconstructive surg ery although few found it satisfying and it placed them at risk of surgical com plications (Kasper, 1995). The practices used to attain the f eminine im age m ay be in conf lict with the practices needed to maintain health when living with a disability. The cultural im ages of wom en with disabilities m ay also im pact interactions with the health care system . Studies have reported that wom en with disabilities do not receive adequate preventive and reproductive health care (Coyle & Santiago, 2002) with m any reporting m ultiple barriers to an exam ination (Gans, Mann, & Becker 1993). Providers have been described as acting surprised when wom en with disa bilities report their level of sexuality (Becker, Stuifbergen, & Tinkle, 1997). Furtherm ore, when a disease has been 54diagnosed predom inantly in the fem ale body, its existence has been questioned as a valid diagnosis (e.g. chronic fatigue syndrom e and fibrom yalgia) (Thorne, McCorm ick, & Carty, 1997). Negative cultura l images of wom en with disabilities may have influenced which disorders pr oviders screen for and how they offer services. Human Agency Hum an agency is concerned with th e ability to adjust over tim e (Elder, 1994, 1998; Giele & Elder, 1998). Adjustm ent is a process of living life and interpreting the experiences in order to gain m eaning from them . The m eaning gained is applied to perceptions of ch anging bodies and roles within society over time. The m eaning of the changing body and society influence how the person responds to the change. The ability to adjust to the changing body and the changing socio-cultural environm ent is an essential part of aging. It has been docum ented since the 1950s that wom en may have difficulty adjusting to disability. W att (1955) f ound that wom en had m ore difficulty adjusting to disability when they had very little purpose in lif e or needed something to do. At that tim e, when m en were m ore preoccupied with careers, it was suggested that therapists provide wo men with hobbies to distract them from their physical com plaints. In m ore recent studies, m en have been found to have higher levels of acceptance of disability than wom en (Ham pton & Crystal, 1999). For wom en, the severity of the disability has been less im portant than the ability to perform an expected activity (N osek, Howland, Rintala, Young & Chanpong, 2001). The inability to perform valued activities and feeling stigm atized was 55reported to lower the self -esteem of wom en with disabilities and subsequently influence her ability to perform social roles (Nosek, et al., 2003; Nosek et al. 2001). The Timing of Lives Events are interpreted depending upon when they occur in the sequence of life (Neugarten, 1968). W hen disability happens to a child, the reaction interpretation of the disability is dif ferent than when it occurs to an older person (Antonak & Livneh, 1995; Livneh, 2001). In a study of 1,266 persons in the U.S. with disabilities, the tim ing or onset of the disability af fected the acceptance and adjustm ent to the disability (Li & Moor e, 1998). In a study of young persons with spinal cord injuries age 15 to 29 years, the spinal cord injury affected their body image and left them preoccupied with be ing valued. They engaged in efforts to appear and to function norm ally for thei r age (Dewis, 1989). This indicated the importance of affiliation within the cohort. Timing of events is dif ficult to interpre t with cross sectional data and often requires retrospective or longitudinal evaluations. For instance, in a study of impairm ent outcom es based upon tim ing of disability, wom en less than 60 years of age at onset of stroke were m ore likely than wom en over 60 years of age to have poor adjustm ent to stroke-related disability (Cam pbell, 1994). This m ay be due to age or it m ay be due to the charact eristics of those born into cohorts prior to, as opposed to after, 1934. Researcher s must be careful when com paring characteristics related to age in cross s ectional studies to avoid confusing age effects with cohort effects. 56Link ed Lives People are linked to one another in f amilial and social experiences. These linkages can provide or prevent opportun ities that enhance quality of life. The importance of relationships while aging with disabilities has been em phasized in the literature. Kem p (1999) reported a positive correlation between m aintaining active com munity ties and form ing a pos itive quality of life throughout the life span f or those with spinal cord injuries. Moreover, in the ethnographic/phenom enological autobiogra phical work of Frank, (2000) the participant had a positive body im age despite having no arm s or legs. She had two reoccurring worries of not paying rent a nd being unable to find a job because it would result in entering a nursing hom e, giving up her transportation, and losing autonom y. She also required m ore intense bodily interaction due to needed support from others. This study illustrate d that wom en with disabilities require varied levels of interdependence in orde r to rem ain independent, and the risks of losing support is high. Women with disabilities can be vulnerable within their interactions due to unequal power distributions that m ay lim it life choices as they age and put them at risk for poor health outcom es. Studies have shown abuse am ong wom en with disabilities to be different than that experienced by wom en without disabilities (Curry, Hassouneh-Phillips & Johnston-Silverberg, 2001; included dism antling equipm ent, threats of abandonm ent, theft, sexual m olestation, m edication over dosage, and physical 57abuse (Powers, Curry, Oschwald, Ma ley, Saxton, & Eckels, 2002). Partners, family m embers, and paid and unpaid caregivers have perpetrated the abuse against these wom en. W omen with disabilitie s have reported that they stayed in abusive relationships longer than wom en without disabilities (Nosek, et al. 2001), and m inority wom en with disabilities have reported m ore abuse f rom family members due to their higher use of unpaid fam ilial caregivers (Powers, et al). The type of interactions wom en with disabilities have with f amily can influence their life course and put them at risk for poor adjustm ent. For instance, marital status has been a predictor of positive health outcom es, and m en with disabilities m arry m ore often then wom en with disabilities (Am erican Association of Neuroscience Nurses, 2001; Brown & Giesy, 1986). W omen with disabilities have had higher rates of divorce then wom en without disabilities and m en with the sam e disabilities (Am erican Associa tion of Neuroscience Nurses). W hen disability occurs after m arriage, wom en with disabilities experience guilt about not taking care of their able-bodied husba nds (Parker, 1993) despite evidence that husbands of wom en with disabilities had f ewer burdens related to care giving than wives of m en with disabilities (Bull, 2001) . Moreover, in a study of m others with disabilities, concern f or how their disability affected their children was predictive of higher levels of depression. Intere stingly, the depression was m ediated by perceptions of higher social support (H arrison & Stuifbergen, 2002). No studies found addressed the health outcom es of wom en who never m arry or never had children. 58Provider relationships have im pacted the ability of wom en with disabilities to age without secondary conditions and m ay have lim ited the opportunities they have had in life. Studies have reported that wom en with disabilities do not receive adequate preventive and reproductive health care (Coyle & Santiago, 2002), with m any reporti ng m ultiple environm ental barriers to an exam ination by a physician (Gans et al ., 1993). Providers have been described as acting surprised when wom en report being sexually active, and stereotypes may be responsible for the inadequate reproductive care provided (Becker et al., 1997). In a study by Nosek & Howland (1997), 38% of the wom en with disabilities surveyed reported they had been refused treatm ent solely due to their disability. W omen with disabilities also qualif y for disability insurance less frequently then m en (Baldwin, 1997). Providers m ay not offer wom en with disabilities services they do not understand the need for in the wom en's lives. Summary Studies have provided evidence that the elem ents of the life course paradigm --hum an agency (Nosek, et al., 2003; Nosek, et al. 2001), tim ing of events (Dewis, 1989; Li & Moore, 1998; Livneh & Antonak, 1995), linked lives (Coyle & Santiago, 2002; Parker, 1993), and lives in tim e and place (Goffm an 1963; Murphy, 1987; Murphy et al., 1988)--are highly applicable to the life course of persons with disabilities. The re search supports the use of this paradigm in wom en with disabilities. The extant research cited, however, used cross sectional designs with sam ples of persons from varied cohorts without analyzing the affects of the social, historical, a nd cultural context. W ithout data that 59longitudinally tracked wom en with di sabilities over the past 50 years, a retrospective study that incorporates th e full life course is needed. A qualitative design that allows for the exploration of th e lived experience within the historical, social, and cultural context is the m ost appropriate design to explore the life course. Polio will provide the best exem plar of aging with disability at this point in tim e (Alexander, 1990). SUMMARY Five m ajor areas of research were re viewed: the m eaning of aging, studies of aging wom en, aging with disability, ag ing with polio, and wom en aging with disability. This review indicated that f urther research was needed on the experience of wom en aging with di sabilities. W ithout understanding their experiences with aging, their lives m ay be interpreted as unsuccessful based on the values of those without im pairm ents. Although researchers have begun to explore aging with disabilities the work has been prim arily descriptive and focused upon im pairm ents, secondary cond itions, and co-m orbid problem s. Those studies that explored the issues of aging with a disability f urther did not explore wom en's issues. W omen aging with paralytic polio represented an exem plar of aging due to the com monalities experienced by m any persons with disabilities. The life course paradigm offers a fr amework from which to begin that exploration. 60Chapter 3: Methodology The m ethodology of a research project gives reason for the choices of research m ethods used throughout the inve stigation; it guides the investigator's decisions on how to achieve the purpose of the study. The purpose of this study was to explore the m eaning of aging for wom en with childhood onset disability. The central guiding question was \"W hat is the m eaning of aging for wom en with childhood onset disabilities? \" This ques tion was answered with a qualitative design that consisted of interviews, fiel d notes, life course charts, and specified demographic inform ation. The reason for the m ethods used in this project was justified by the m ethodology; the m ethodology chosen was herm eneutic phenom enology within the Dilthey, Hans-Georg Gadam er, and Husserl. The following chapter describes the m ethods used throughout the study as guided by the m ethodology. The philosophical perspective, the research design, and the details of the m ethods chosen to answer the research question are discussed. The chapter concludes with a de scription of researcher bias and study limitations. PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE The founder of philosophical herm eneutics was Friedrich D. E. Schleierm acher (Mueller-Vollm ther efore, this chapter begins with the salient aspects of his work that apply to this research. This is f ollowed by a discussion of Dilthey's, philosophical herm eneutics was concerned with the art of understanding written words, which represented the thoughts of another person; language repr esented thoughts. The language and the person, who spoke, were tied together in shaping both thought and language. In other words, people used their native la nguage to express their thought but the thought was bound and shaped by the language. Understanding occurred by exam ining both the psychology behind the person speaking and the specifics of their spoken language. Schleierm acher desc ribed two types of interpretation used together to achieve this type of understanding: gram matical and technical. First, gram matical interpretation, according to Schleierm acher (1985), began with the knowledge of the language com mon to the author of the statem ents and to the public to which the statem ents were intended (Schleierm acher, 1985). Second, gram matical interpretation was grounded in an understanding of the whole. In other words, each word could be understood within the context of the other words, as well as, the context of the entire docum ent. Schleierm acher (1985) described tec hnical interpretation, the second type of interpretation, as the understanding of the author's style. Schleierm acher stated that \"in technical interpretation the unity of the work, it's them e, is viewed as the dynam ic principle im pelling the author, and the basic features of the com position are viewed as his distinctive nature , revealing itself in that m oment.\" (Schleierm acher, 1985, p.94). By seeking to understand the spoken or written word, the person's thoughts were sought because through the person's language 62his or her ability to think took shape, and it was through the person's style that the person shaped the m eaning of his or her wo rds as a whole. The style of the person could be understood through the com monalities the person possessed with other people. In other words, it was assum ed that people share com mon experiences that others could relate to. The com monalities allowed com parisons with the author and others who were the intended audience. For understanding to occur, one m ust know \"who these people were and what affect these passages were to have on them \" (Schleierm acher, 1985, p. 96). Understanding for Schleierm acher, however, was an internal knowledge without form as a research m ethodology. Wilhelm Dilthey advanced herm eneu tic philosophy towards a research methodology. Schleierm acher's herm eneutic philosophy was interpreted and advanced by Dilthey whose effort was a reaction against positivism . (Mueller- Vollm er, 1985). Dithey argued that the assum ptions used to understand the natural sciences could not be used to understand hum ans. For instance, it was not our biology that defined what it m eant to be a wom an. It was our consciousness of being a wom an in the world in tim e and space that gave m eaning. Dilthey was concerned with the \"objective value of the m ind constructed world [through] which em erge experience\" (Dilthey, 1985, p. 149) . Dilthey wrote, \"It is in the life actually lived that the reality known in the hum an studies lies.\" (Dilthey, 1985, p. 150). Dilthey's work helped advance the human sciences toward a herm eneutic research m ethodology. Dilthey (1985) wrote that herm eneu tic understanding occurred within the mind-constructed world. The m ind constructed world was an interaction of the 63lived experience, the insight into the mind, the understanding of other people, and the understanding of the historical com munity. Dilthey recognized that part of \"understanding was irrational because life is irrational\" (1985, p. 162). There are limits to the application of logic in understanding the lived experience. Som e words cannot be understood based upon the ru les of gram mar. The words are both determ inant and indeterm inate; therefor e, the words m ust be understood within the context of the whole. Herm eneuti cal understanding was an inductive process that linked the parts to the whole. This in cluded the historical context of the text, as well as, the lived experience all set within the m ind-constructed world. The understanding gained from herm eneutic methods contributed to knowledge of other people and their experiences. Ditlhey's herm eneutic m ethodology was based upon the interaction between the experience of living and understanding oneself in tim e (Dilthey, 1985). Understanding occurred as the person was conscious of their experiences in tim e. Tim e unified the experience. Past experiences were m omentary abstractions brought to consciousness, while present tim e did not exist to conscious thought because \"what we expe rience as present always contains memory of what has just been pres ent.\" (Dilthey, 1985, p. 150). Being conscious of the abstractions of the past unifies and synthesizes the lived experience. The conscious experience of the self in time could be persistent or it could change (Dilthey, 1985). Each experience the person had was related to the self, and the self was m ade up of conscious experiences. It was possible to be conscious of change and persistent qualities in the self as consciousness of the 64abstract past was altered. In other words, the abstract recollection of the past self as a whole could be altered or persistent. Dilthey explained, We experience persistence when we return to what we have just seen or heard and f ind it still there. W e experience change when particular qualities of the com posite whole have been replaced. The sam e applies when we look into ourselves, becom e aware of the self which experiences duration and change, and observe our inner life. (Dilthey, 1985, p.151). Next, Hans-Georg Gadam er (1960/2000) philosophical but ultim ately m aintained that no m ethodology within the human sciences could produce absolute truth. All written word was situated within a dialogue that started before the text was read and that continued afterwards. The reader entered into a dial ogue with the author when the text was read. The best that could be achieved was an understanding of the text by m oving the text, or the question put to the text, into the reader's context for understanding. According to Gadam er, the understanding was m ore com plete when the reader understood the social and historical context of the author and a shared horizon for understanding was achieved. This was not a relativistic historical understanding because the m eaning was shared, and the value of the understanding was found in its usefulness (Grondin, 1994). Finally, aspects of the philosophy of Ed mund Husserl were critical in this research. Specifically, Husserl's (1999) work on perception and the body. According to Husserl (1999) consciousness was always of som ething else. W hen a person was conscious, his or her consciousness was directed toward som ething, which was ref erred to as intentionality. It was the task of herm eneutics to understand hum an consciousness. 65It was through the body that the nature of being conscious was understood (Husserl, 1999). In other words, the body wa s the m edium for all interaction with the world. The body was described as the sense organ through which consciousness occurred. The body, however, provided a subjective account of the world. Understanding m ust com e through m ultiple perspectives in order to gain a more com plete view of the experi ence or phenom enon under consideration. According to Husserl, \"only through m utual understanding is there the possibility of knowing that what others see is what I see.\" (1999, p. 172). Husserl's description of the body a nd consciousness were im portant for understanding the m eaning of aging for wom en with disabilities because his philosophy provided a m eans for unders tanding how the im paired body m ight affect conscious perception of aging. Fo r Husserl, the body, defined as the organ of consciousness, was the m eans of sensing and understanding the world. All sensation was brought together into a nexus, the body the center of orientation toward the world. It was also the or gan of will because the body was also involved in conscious functioning within the lived world (Husserl, 1999). More specifically, the sensing function of the body was involved in feelings of pleasure, pain, and fatigue, which all had a physical means for being m ade aware of by the wom an. These sensations f ormed the base f rom which the will and desire of the will to act were fed. The wom an could not be distanced from her body because it was the organ of all lived experien ce throughout tim e. This form ed the philosophical basis for this herm eneutic phenom enological study. 66One potential philosophical conflict could be m entioned regarding the use of socially constructed concepts of disability and gender with a herm eneutic phenom enological study. Typically social constructionists reject the use of essential truths. I would like to argue that there is no basis f or conf lict. First, there was no philosophical claim made for absolu te truth. Second, the investigation of essences shared between culturally and hi storically situated individuals was not the sam e as an essential label or ster eotype culturally identif ied with a person based upon their gender or disability status (G. Frank, personal com munication, Jan, 5 2003). In fact, Kahn (2000) wrot e that H/P was a non-essentialist methodology that viewed the essential them es as contextualized m eanings that depend upon the shared horizon, not som e universal truth or stereotypical essentializing. This was also consistent w ith Sim one de Beauvoir's, the existential feminist philosopher, writings about th e experience of wom en (de Beauvoir, 1952/1974, Tong, 1998). Moreover, Cohen (1987) wrote that Husserl's descriptions of essences, ideal types that correspond to laws, were im portant to the philosophy but not im portant to th e phenom enological research tradition, which was m ore interested in case expe riences. In this research, wom en with common life experiences shared experien ces with the phenom enon of aging that were viewed f rom their perspectives . The com monality in their experiences emerged from their stories. RESEARCH DESIGN This is a qualitative study of agi ng for wom en with childhood onset paralytic polio. Herm eneutic phenom enology (H/P) was chosen as a m ethodology 67to give the phenom enon of aging in wom en with childhood onset disabilities a fuller understanding (Cohen 2000; Spiegelb erg, 1960; Toom bs, 2001). It was the goal of this H/P study to understand the intent and im pact surrounding the experience of aging with im pairm ent (Spiegelberg, 1960; Toom bs, 2001). Therefore, when questions about the cha nges associated with aging were asked, the wom en were free to speak of experi ences and associated feelings that indicated what aging m eant to them . And when the wom en were asked how they adjusted to these changes, they we re free to tell stories about how the phenom enon im pacted their lives. Herm eneutic phenom enology was consistent within the overall design of this life course study. It has been used with other life course studies (Tierney, 2000), and H/P analysis has been described as a natural tool for use with the life course paradigm because life course descriptions are essentially phenom enological\u2014stories of the lived experience (Frank, 1979, 2000). The H/P analysis allowed for interpretation of the life course placed into text form at for analysis and interpretation of m eaning (Frank, 1979, 2000). This way the lived experience, as it related to the phenom enon of interest, em erged from the stories (Frank). After all, it was not the purpose of this study to test a life course theory or hypothesis. The purpose was to understand the experience of aging. The m ethodology called for interviews designed to draw out stories of the meaning of aging, which included changes associated with aging and how wom en adjusted to the changes. The four elem ents of the life course paradigm were used to bring shape to the study, which was consistent with the H/P em phasis on 68understanding the cultural and histori cal context of the group (Cohen, 2000). Com ponents of the life course paradigm , which included the hum an agency, the surrounding relationship, hum an agency issues, and the socio cultural and historical tim e period were understood through conducting interviews and writing field notes of observations. The goal was to elicit a story about the life course for each wom an; their stories were analyzed to understand the m eaning of aging. Them es related to the inf luence of being wom en within the historical and cultural time period em erged as the stories were analyzed. METHODS The m ethods section includes the participant selection strategies and the data m anagem ent strategies used in the study. The following sections outline the details of the strategies used to select those who participated in the study. The characteristics of the final sam ple are al so described. The section is followed by the data m anagem ent strategies, which includes a description of the data collection and the data analysis procedures. Participant Selection Strategies Participant selection strategies were the procedures used to gain the sample used for the study. The participant selection strategies included the sam ple selection, sam ple size, sam ple character istics, recruitm ent, and hum an subject protection. Sample Selection The sam ple selection was based upon the following inclusion criteria: \u0083 All participants had physician-diagnosed paralytic polio before age 14. 69\u0083 All participants belonged to the age cohort between 55 to 65 years. \u0083 All participants were living in thei r com munity, not an institution, within the United States. \u0083 All participants had a physical im pairm ent related to paralytic polio. \u0083 All participants were able to speak English. \u0083 All participants were f emale. The sam ple selection also included f our wom en who m et the aforem entioned criteria except two wom en were less than 55 years of age and two wom en were more than 65 years of age. These four negative cases allowed for com parisons between cohort experiences but were not used in the final H/P analysis. Only wom en were included in the st udy in order to capture their unique experience of aging with im pairm ent. The social, historical, and cultural experiences of wom en may have been di fferent than for m en, thus the unique experiences were studied independently, not as a com bined experience that could have neglected the unique experience of wom en. This design allowed for the understanding of how the wom en perceive d their gender and its affect on the changes associated with aging. The m ain concern f or participant se lection was m aking sure the wom en experienced the phenom enon of concern (C reswell, 1998), aging with im pairm ent related to childhood onset polio. The m ajority of the wom en interviewed had aged with im pairm ent related to polio since childhood. Three wom en who were interviewed did not report the experience of aging with im pairm ent. The wom en 70told stories of having a f ull recovery f rom the af fects of paralytic poliom yelitis; therefore, they were excluded in the final analysis. The wom en included in the final analysis experienced polio at the height of the polio epidem ic and lived through si milar social changes within the United States. All of the wom en interviewed re sided in one of 18 different counties within the state of Texa s; 21 of the wom en grew up since birth in Texas. Moreover, the tim ing of their im pairm ent was during childhood, thus consistency in tim ing of impairm ent and its ef fect on aging was obtained. This provided a solid basis f or com monality of experiences. Sample Size Thirty-two wom en participated in the study. For the final analysis of the experience of aging with childhood onset disability, 25 wom en were selected from the 32 interviewed. The four negative cases and the three wom en without residual polio related im pairm ent were excluded. The 25 wom en included in the final analysis were m ore than sufficient to provide saturation and redundancy of data (Rubin & Rubin, 1995). Steeves (2000) wrote that prior studies and em pirical knowledge drive sam ple size selection. Kahn (1999) reached saturation, using a sim ilar design with elderly individuals, after 15 intensive interviews. Moreover, in this study m ultiple interviews were done where the wom en talked at length about their experience and observational field notes were written, which resulted in a large am ount of data. Based upon the amount of data collected from the wom en there was no need for a larger sam ple 71(Morse, 2000). It was estim ated that no m ore than 15 wom en would be needed for the study; the 32 wom en who participated in the study and the 25 used in the final analysis were m ore than adequate to provide an understanding of their experiences. Sample Characteristics Selected characteristics of the 32 wom en who participated in the study are in Table 8. The m ean age of the wom en was 59.8 years. Seventy-eight percent were Anglo, 16% were Hispanic, and 6% were African Am erican. The m ajority of the wom en was m arried (63%) and had children (69%). A large percentage was unem ployed due to disability (31%) or retired (41%). Over half of the sam ple was college educated; 34% had a bachelor's degree, 16% had a m aster's degree, and 13% had a PhD. Selected characteristics of the 25 wo men who were included in the final analysis are in Table 9. The m ean age of the wom en was 59.4 years. Eighty percent were Anglo, 16% were Hispanic , and 4% were African Am erican. The majority of the wom en was m arried ( 64%) and had children (68%). A large percentage was unem ployed due to disability (40%) or retired (36%). Over half of the sam ple was college educated; 32% had a bachelor's degree, 12% had a master's degree, and 8% had a PhD. For the 25 wom en included in the final analysis, a m ore detailed description will be provided. The year th ey contracted polio was from 1942 to 1955. At the tim e of their infection, their age ranged from 3 m onths to 13 years. 72The m ean age at the tim e of infection wa s 5.25 years; the m ode was 5 years. The wom en were hospitalized during their acute infection from 0 to 72 m onths. The majority reported they had spinal para lytic polio (68%). At the tim e of the infection, 68% (17) reported that their extrem ities were paralyzed, 28% (7) reported their entire bodies were paralyzed, and 4% (1) stated it was m ainly in the back and spine. Over the course of the interviews the wom en described their im pairm ent severity and its af fect on their lives. The types of decline experienced were listed and described in Table 10. The m ajority explained that they had a life long moderate im pairm ent with a severe decline (44%). Eight wom en (32%) described severe life long im pairm ent that onl y worsened over tim e. One (4%) wom an described m ild life long im pairm ent with mild decline, and 5 (20%) described life long m ild im pairm ent with a m oderate decline. 73Table 8: Sample characteristics of the 32 participants interviewed.

Life Long Severe with Decline Experienced by 8 participants. A severe residual impairm ent that worsened with age. The wom en were unable to walk or walked m inimally with assistive devices. By later adulthood they were dependent upon others f or most activities with som e discom fort. Life Long Moderate with Severe Decline Experienced by 11 participants. A m oderate im pairm ent from polio that worsened as they aged with a degree of dependency upon others. The wom en were walked with assistive devices but by later adulthood were dependent upon assistance for activities with discom fort. Life Long Mild with Moderate Decline Experienced by 5 participants. A m ild im pairm ent from polio that worsened as they aged but did not cause dependency upon others. The wom en were able to walk without assistive devices but were restricted in som e activities. By later adulthood, they were in need of assistive devices or experiencing discom fort. Life Long Mild with Mild Decline Experienced by 1 wom an in the study. A m ild level of residual im pairm ent from polio with m ild levels of decline that did not cause dependency upon others for assistance. The wom an described an im pairm ent related to polio that did not af fect her ability to walk or do other types of activities. By later adulthood she had experienced som e discom fort and decreased ability to function as she had m ost of her life. 76 Eighty-eight percent of the 25 wom en indicated they had post-polio syndrom e and 88% were currently using som e type of assistive device such as a scooter, electric wheelchair, or brace. Th e wom en also had a high num ber of co- morbidities and secondary conditions. Only two wom en stated they had no co- morbidities or secondary conditions; 52% had m ore than three co-m orbidities or secondary conditions. One wom an reported as m any as seven co-m orbid problem s. The m ost frequently m entioned co-m orbidities and secondary conditions were hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, sleep apnea, and osteoporosis. Other problem s mentioned were cancer, pne umonia, depression, high cholesterol, and thyroid abnorm alities. Experiences with abuse were also com mon. Although the wom en were not directly asked if they were abused, of the 25 wom en included in the final analysis, 64% reported som e type of abuse in their life tim e. Childhood abuse, which included physical, em otional, and sexual abuse, was reported by seven (28%) of the wom en. Adult physical or sexual abuse was reported by five (20%), and four (16%) reported both adult and childhood abus e. Only nine (36%) of the wom en reported that they had not been abused in their lifetim e. Recruitment The wom en were recruited by one of three m ethods. First, letters explaining the study were m ailed to 12 wom en who had participated in a study of health prom otion for persons with chronic disabling conditions and m et the 77inclusion criteria. The wom en were asked to address an enclosed stam ped card if they were interested in being cont acted about the study. Second, brochures explaining the study were disbursed at support group m eetings either by the principal investigator or another polio su rvivor. If the wom en at the m eeting were interested in the study they were asked to com plete a card with their contact inform ation on it. Third, wom en known to th e investigator to have had polio and be interested in the study were encourag ed to provide contact inform ation. From these efforts, 41 wom en replied that they were interested in the study. Seven of the wom en were excluded because they di d not m eet the inclusion criteria: one did not have paralytic polio as a child although she reported post polio syndrom e as an adult, and six wom en did not m eet the age requirem ents. Two other wom en contacted m e after saturation had been obtained and I was no longer recruiting subjects. Efforts were m ade to recruit a larger African Am erican sam ple. An African Am erican wom an known to have had polio contacted people within her community to gather interest. She was able to locate one other wom an, who was interviewed. This wom an said she par ticipated because she knew I needed participants to finish m y degree, but sh e said polio was not a problem in her life or som ething she thought m uch about. Th ree predom inantly African Am erican churches within a central Texas com munity were contacted about the study. Brochures and contact inform ation were sent to them , but I received no response by potential participants. Contact was m ade with a wom an who worked at an African Am erican com munity center. She wa s able to think of three wom en in her 78community that had polio, but none of th e wom en were interested in the study. Finally, I contacted an African Am erican wom an who worked within a community working in the public health services. She was able to locate one wom an, who again was not interested in the study. If the wom en consented to be contact ed and m et the inclusion criteria, I contacted them and explained the study in detail. If the wom en were willing to be interviewed, a m eeting was scheduled at their convenience at a m utually acceptable tim e and place. Prior to the m eeting a dem ographic sheet and a life course chart was m ailed to the participant for them to com plete prior to the f irst interview. Most interviews were co mpleted in the wom en's hom es, but one participant was interviewed at a church, two participants were interviewed in restaurants, and one participant was interviewed at the School of Nursing. A hand written thank you note was m ailed to each participant after each interview. Human Subjects The proposal was sent to the Depart mental Review Com mittee (DRC) of the School of Nursing and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Texas at Austin for approval. No info rmants were involved in the study prior to the com pletion of the DRC and IRB review and approval. The IRB approval form and the approved inform ed consent are in Appendix A. Inform ed consent was obtained from each participant in the study. No participants were excluded based upon r ace, ethnicity, or religion. No negative outcom es were reported by the participan ts in connection with this study. The participants were encouraged to term inate, reschedule, or drop from the study 79without explanation at any tim e they felt unable to participate for any reason. Although several participants rescheduled interviews, none of the wom en dropped from the study. Each participant was inform ed at each interview session that they could refuse to answer any question or re fuse to talk about any topic. The wom en spoke freely and agreed to be audio ta ped. The participants were told the interviews would end if the participant appeared to grow fatigued, which occurred during one interview. No invasive procedures were included in the study. Conf identiality was m aintained f or the subjects by changing their nam es to pseudonym s--non-identifying nam es. The pseudonym s were used in all written records. Only the researcher and superv ising professor had access to the actual names, addresses, and phone num bers of the participants. These rem ained in a locked cabinet. These will be destroyed 5 years af ter com pletion of the data analysis. Participants received $10.00 per interview as a reward for participation in the study. They were not coerced to par ticipate in the study. Many stated they gained from sharing their stories, and m any were pleased to contribute to the existing knowledge base. Several wom en reported that they gained som e therapeutic benefit from talking about their lives. Data Management Strategies The data m anagem ent strategies included the data collection and data analysis procedures. The data collection procedures included the interviews, demographic profiles, life course tables , and field notes. The data analysis procedures included the procedures for data analysis and bias control. 80Data Collection An underlying prem ise of this resear ch was that people try to m ake meaning of their experience and the m eaning m ade would be contained in their stories (Kahn, 2000). Consequently, the aim of the interviews was to bring out stories about the lives of the wom en (Kahn, 2000). The wom en were asked to reflect upon th eir lives and the im portant things that had happened prior to the first inte rview. Since the study was of the changes associated with aging and subsequent ad justm ent, a current and a retrospective approach was taken. (See Appendix B for th e interview questions). At the f irst interview, the wom en were asked to begin with their f irst m emories and tell what had happened. The wom en were then to ld to work forward reviewing the memories that were m ost salient to thei r lives. At the subsequent interviews the wom en were encouraged to continue th eir descriptions of their lives up until present. Next, the wom en were asked about relationships that influenced their lives, about what m eaning m eant to them , and what it m eant to be a wom an. All the interviews were transcribed verbatim . Two to f our interviews were required to cover the content in the interview questions. Two participants required two in terviews, one participant required four interviews, and the rem aining 22 wom en required three interviews. It was recom mended that m ultiple interviews be done for the purpose of gaining the trust of participants so they would engage in open discussion (Steeves, 2000). The tim e between the two to four audio taped inte rviews also gave tim e to review and research prior interviews f or clarif ication prior to the next interview. Interviews 81were rescheduled within 1 to 8 weeks of the prior interview, which gave tim e to reflect upon the com ments m ade in the previous interviews. Besides the interviews, data was collected with dem ographic sheets, a lif e course review table, and field notes. Dem ographic data was collected prior to the first interview. (Appendix B) The life course review table served as a tool to help the participant remember events prior to the intervie w. (Appendix B) According to Clausen (1998), these charts were useful way of obtaining life course inform ation because it allowed for the appraisal of the social a nd historical context by the researcher as well as the participant. The table was sent prior to the study and reviewed with the participant at the first interview session. If it was not com pleted, the interviewer and participant com pleted and discussed it at the f irst interview. This table was a prom pt to help the participants think of life course events that were m eaningful to them . Field notes were written to enha nce the quality of data obtained (Emmerson, Fretz, & Shaw, 1995; Kahn, 2000) . Inform ation such as dress, body language, assistive devices, and environm ental details, as well as theoretical observations and docum entation of self-evalu ations of the interviews were added to the field notes. They also included desc riptions of pictures that represented memories of the past. The field notes serv ed as a record of continued evaluations and an on going reflective dialogue that helped with understanding when saturation and com pleteness were reached (Em erson, Fretz & Shaw). 82Data Analysis The following section was written to describe the data organization, analysis, and bias reduction used in th e study. The data organization for the study was the way the data was handled af ter each interview was com pleted. The interviews and field notes were transcribe d as soon as possible after the interview by a professional transcriptionist and th e researcher. This produced nearly 4,000 pages of double spaced text. Next, the data were checked for accuracy by listening and com paring it to the transcribed notes. Transcribed notes and collected dem ographics were kept within a locked cabinet at all tim es except when being analyzed. The analysis was begun with a herm eneutic philosophical attitude toward what was considered data and how to understand the data. The herm eneutic phenom enological analysis, which was con cerned with the correct interpretation of hum an expression (Polkinghorne, 1983) , was begun by recording what was communicated in verbal and non-verbal form into a perm anent written record or a text (Steeves & Kahn, 1995). The text was considered the \"working ground for the study of socially constructed m eaning\" (Steeves & Kahn, p. 185). In other words, the text was the basis for unde rstanding the m eaning the wom en were trying to convey about aging. Understanding was the com prehension of the meaning that went beyond logical analys is of the text (Polkinghorne, 1983). The analysis occurred within the herm eneutic circle; the analysis was a process of going from the parts to the whole and back again to understand what was being conveyed. The analysis was a m ental, integr ative process of bringing in the whole 83and then the parts in a continual m ovem ent back and forth. The understanding appeared in an unspecified, tacit sense (Polkinghorne, 1983). Herm eneutic interpretation was possible because the text was supplying a meaning to the reader\u2014it was not a non- intentional group of words without a reader (Crotty, 1998). The wom en spoke to m e as their audience in order to convey m eaning. It was m ore than sem antic m eaning, but the sem antics were indicative of m eaning. Determ ination of the m eaning was m ore than relating the work to a theory, such as life course or any other type of gerontological or disability theory. Herm eneutic interpretation was a process of creating knowledge that com es from thinking som ething through and relating it to a sense of what was plausible (Crotty, 1998). This was the ph ilosophical starting point in which the analysis was based. Herm eneutic phenom enological studies rely on the reflections of the researcher involved in the study; therefore, the reflections were part of the data. Kahn (2000) recom mended that researcher s critically reflect upon assum ptions, preconceptions, and prejudices prior to and during the study. The analysis contained the bracketing of personal expe riences and prior thoughts in regard to wom en aging with disabilities. The bracketi ng of these critical ref lections was an important continual process throughout the analysis (Creswell, 1998; Spiegelberg, 1960). Data analysis continued in the field with interpretations recorded in the field notes. Field notes were incorporated in to the analysis process. Af ter the data was transcribed and checked for accuracy, the data were read and reread. This 84immersion within the data with reading a nd rereading helped to create the initial interpretations, which were entered into field notes. This was done before and after each interview. This was a cyclical interpretation of the m eaning of the experience, which was consistent with the herm eneutic circle. Them atic analysis was used to answer the specific aim s, and was based upon the recom mendations of Cohen, Kahn, & Steeves (2000). The text was read and reread to verify if it was represen tative of the experience. Those wom en who did not have lifelong im pairm ents were th en excluded from analysis. Next, the transcripts were read line-by-line and hand coded with a pencil for specific phrases that indicated a salient aspect of the experience. The them atic analysis then proceeded in the following steps, but in a non-linear fashion. \u0083 Line by line coding was done by labeling phrases with code nam es. These were sm all pieces of inform ation that related their perceptions of hum an agency, relationships, and events in tim e and place. \u0083 Interview sections were cut fr om the text and grouped based upon childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, m iddle adulthood, and later adulthood or now. \u0083 Like code nam es from each area of th e paradigm were placed side by side for further analysis and rules were m ade as to how they were related. These were categories. \u0083 Categories were placed together for further analysis to discover the complex interrelations of the content drawn out from each elem ent of the paradigm . Rules were m ade as to how they interrelated and called them es. 85\u0083 Exem plars were chosen to represent the them es. Exem plar them es were connected throughout the life course to tell the story of how the m eanings changed over tim e within each period of their life. This change over tim e in meanings represented aging. \u0083 Exem plar them es were pulled to expre ss what the m eaning of aging was to the wom en and how the m eaning of thei r gender influenced how they aged with a disability. Researcher Bias As recom mended by Kahn (2000), biases we re bracketed prior to the start of the study of aging in order to understand m y preconceptions prior to interpreting the experience of the participants. A journal of the study was maintained to docum ent all research proj ect decisions for continual tracking. It contained all preconceptions and prejudices as well as a log of all research project decisions. Study Limitations The study design was lim ited by its re striction to the study of wom en aging with the ef fects of paralytic poli o. The experience of m en aging with the effects of paralytic polio could not be determ ined from this study. Moreover, the effects of other types of im pairm ents m ay be different then the effects of polio. The physical changes associated with aging with polio m ay create a varied experience then what other wom en with im pairm ents m ay report. There m ay also be social differences in wom en with polio as com pared to wom en with other types of disabilities. W omen aging with polio may be m ore educated and have m ore 86resources then wom en with other types of impairm ents. The effects of aging with other types of im pairm ents should be investigated further. The study was lim ited by the low num ber of m inority wom en included in the study. Although considerable effort wa s made to recruit African Am erican wom en, only two wom en participated. Th is was sim ilar to the dem ographic profile for paralytic polio, but furthe r study should be done to understand their experiences with disability. The cultural and historical m eaning of being an African Am erican wom an with a disab ility could not be understood from this study. Although five Hispanic participan ts were included in the study, m ore would be needed to do a separate analysis for this group. Generalizing these results is not recom mended. Although this study contained m ore than an adequate sam ple for understanding lived experience, it does not contain generalizable data. The pa rticipants were restricted to wom en within a narrow age cohort living in Texa s. Persons from other age cohorts, m en, persons from other cultures, and persons living in other areas of the country m ay have varied experiences. Summary Herm eneutic phenom enology based on the philosophical work of Schleierm acher, Dilthey, Husserl, and Gadam er provided the groundwork for this study of wom en aging with childhood onset disability. No other m ethodology would have allowed for the understanding of the m eaning of their lived experience, which was the focus of this research. The m ethods for answering the research question included in-depth a udio taped interviews of 32 wom en, of 87which 25 were aging with life long im pairment. The interviews of the 25 wom en aging with childhood onset im pairm ent were included in the final analysis. Analyzed data included two to four transcribed interviews, field notes, demographic inform ation and life course charts. Using herm eneutic phenom enological analysis, them es and exem plars were identif ied to represent the experience of aging. The study was lim ited to the understanding of wom en aging with paralytic polio. Studies that incl ude m en, persons with other types of impairm ents, and a larger num ber of wom en from different cultures are needed. 88FINDINGS Chapter 4: The Life Course The findings of this research are desc ribed in chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 4 contains the life course herm eneutic phenom enological description of the meaning of aging. Chapter 5 contains the findings for the three exploratory questions: the exploration of the m eaning the wom en associated with aging, the exploration of how the wom en adjusted to the changes they associated with aging, and the exploration of how the wom en's gender im pacted their experiences and adjustm ent to aging. This chapter begins with the life course herm eneutic phenom enological description of the m eaning of aging. Th e experience of aging for wom en with childhood onset disabilities was interprete d based upon the life course narratives provided by 25 of the 32 participants. For purposes of gaining a coherent understanding of aging produced from the va st am ount of text, the life course was broken down into childhood (0 to 12 years), adolescence (13 to 22 years), young adulthood (23 to 34 years), m iddle adult hood (35 to 54 years) and later adulthood or now (55 to 65 years). W ithin each pe riod of life, areas of the life course paradigm were used as an organizing fr amework to give structure to the life course analysis and presentation of fi ndings. The m ajor them es and sub-them es that em erged are presented within each of these periods of life organized around the life course paradigm . These are sum marized in Table 11. 89Table 11: Summary of life course them es Childhood Adolescence Young Adulthood Middle Adulthood Later Adulthood Environment Different Time & Place Events that Change a Time & Place Things Need to Change With Tim e the Place Im proved Expecting More from the Tim e & Place Human Agency Feeling Peculiar: Getting Polio Living the Altered Body Conscious of Body's Improvem ent Conscious of Potential Knowing& Showing Body's Lim itsI Can Achieve Being Aware of Body's Limits Willed to Success but Pushed to Decline Becom ing Conscious of Body's Needs Responding to Body's Needs Facing Threats from Increasing Dependency Focusing on the Body Working to do the Sim ple Things Preserving the Body Conf licts Between Self & Body Relationships Families Shape their Children Things Worse than Polio Finding Voice in Relationships Proving I Can in RelationshipsCaring for Aging Parents Relating with Interdependent Self 90CHILDHOOD - 1939/1949 TO 1951/1961 A Different Time and Place Many of the wom en described living in a different tim e and place as children, which encom passed birth through 12 years of age. The m ajority grew up in rural Texas; others grew up in m etropo litan areas or out of state. Despite the location the wom en acknowledged the worl d was different when they were children, and they had been shaped by the time period in which they were born. In other words, they grew up when people did f or them selves and they tried to maintain that attitude towards lif e. As children, they watched Howdy Doody on television or pretended they were Dale Evans and Ginger Rogers. They observed as the icem an put ice in the ice box, partic ipated in air drills at schools, and piled into the back of Dad's pick-up truck to go to the drive-in m ovie, where no one bought popcorn or drinks. A few wom en mentioned using outdoor toilets while another was envied because her farm house had an indoor bathroom . As Janice, a 57 year old with polio at age 3 years noted \"I am glad I grew up in that era where we didn't have a lot of things. One, b ecause we didn't have a lot of m oney but also just because it was in the 1950's and 1960's when there weren't a lot of labor saving devices that we have today. Cell phones, cordless phones, com puters.\" These wom en grew up in a tim e and place where people physically did for them selves. This was also the tim e of the polio epidem ics in the United States. No one remembered public health warnings about polio, but those who were infected as 91older children recalled the fear of catch ing the virus. Joann, a 65 year old who contracted polio at age 12 stated, \"I rem ember it very clearly. It was the year; I guess that would be 1952. I'm not sure. We didn't go out to eat. W e didn't do this. W e didn't do that because of the scare. I can rem ember we were at the beach and this fly landed on m y glass. I thought oh, if I drink that stuff I'll get polio.\" Feeling Peculiar: Getting Polio Despite the young age of the participan ts when they were infected, the majority of wom en rem embered the events surrounding their \"getting polio\". They described no longer being able to control their bodies. They could not will various parts of their bodies to action. One wom an described only being able to move her thum b while another could only move from the left elbow down. They also described feeling hot and having pain in their heads, throats, necks or backs. Charlotte, a 57 year old with polio at age 4 years stated And I rem ember waking up and having..., the sore throat being m uch worse. Feeling very hot, just so hot. And I rem ember trying to call to m y dad but it was like a croak. I couldn't get it out. And feeling very peculiar, being 4. I just knew I felt terrible and I was scared. I rem ember I couldn't get out of the bed, and I rem ember telling him (dad), 'I can't m ove m y legs'. So he kind of m oved m e around and stood m e up, and I just fell right down on the floor. I could not walk. Getting polio disrupted the ability of the self to will the body to action, it disrupted the usual sensory input to and from the body, and subsequently, it disrupted the subjective interpretation of the self as it existed in the world. Lena, a 62 year old with polio at age 10 stated, 92I was a skater, a biker, a tree clim ber and so forth, and then all of a sudden you're losing everything. You can't m ove. I was talking and m y mouth was m oving but the voice wouldn't com e out. I couldn't turn m y head. They put you in quarantine where you can't see your parents. You can't see anybody and that... do you know how scary that can be? Descriptions of the disruption of the body, the senses, and the self continued as the wom en recollected the treatm ent they received. Overall, the wom en recalled how one childhood viral infection left them to feel peculiar; they were special, distinctive, and odd. The them e of Feeli ng Peculiar: Getting polio was broken into two sub-them es: The Initial Treatm ent fo r Polio and The Long Term Treatm ent for Polio. The Initial Treatment for Polio During the initial treatm ent the wom en recalled that their bodies were further restrained while their senses were inundated. Their ability to consciously act on their own behalf was not perm itted. Attention was focused on their bodies, but that had consequences for the self as the wom en described feeling uninform ed, na\u00efve, sad and afraid. It was also worsened when they witnessed deaths that were never explained to them . Through this experience the iron lung emerged as a sym bol of their initial polio treatm ent experiences. The initial treatm ent frequently i nvolved seeing a physician who did a spinal tap to diagnose the likelihood of polio or infantile paralysis, as it was occasionally called during that tim e. Charlo tte, a 57 year old that had polio at age 4 years recalled, They held m e real tight all around m e, and the nurse that was at the head of the table, where m y face was down, she held m e so hard m y face was up into her starched white uniform and I rem ember that sm ell so m uch. 93But I couldn't breathe. They were holding m e too tight. And I thought I was going to pass out or som ething bad happen to m e because I couldn't breathe because she had m y face right up into this part, you know, holding me down. After the spinal tap confirm ed the diagnosis of polio, all but one of the wom en were taken from their fam ilies a nd placed into isolation where further treatm ent was initiated to treat their paralyzed body. In order to relax their affected m uscles the wom en were placed in to hot water or covered with steam ing hot wool. The fear of drowning caused one wom an to cry out for help after being placed in a tub, which was filling up with water, by a nurse who walked away without explaining. Several wom en recalle d the feel and sm ell of hot wool on their bodies as nurses or nuns applied vari ous treatm ents to their m uscles. Three of the wom en described the developm ent of boils that needed lancing because their bodies were not being turned while paralyzed. One stated the scars were still present. Martha, a 57 year old with polio since the age of 8 years recalled that While you're in the hospital you get this lovely hot steam y wool, and I mean hot. They had these steam er things they would bring in. W et wool has a sm ell like no other. It's stuck in m y head because they would either put it down your front side or they would roll you over and put it down your backside so that they could get the heat on the m uscles. And then the physical therapists would com e in and start doing the m uscles leg stretches and all the stretches you could do on your arm s. There were grown m en in there who would scream and cry from the pain of having your legs stretching. They would have their hand on your knee and then they'd draw up your leg, trying to stretch all the tendons and the m uscles and stuff because they'd just be tight. And then they'd work on your feet and pull them forward. It's not pleasant. Like I said, grown m en were scream ing. During the tim e of the initial treatm ent the wom en described f eeling as though the conscious self was isolated, uninform ed, na\u00efve, afraid and/or sad. Their body was the focus of care and they experienced increasing am ounts of 94foreign stim uli, which the conscious self could not understand a nd at tim es did not try to understand. As Lena recollected: But I could hear m y mother's voice. He [dad] parked the car next to the window where I was and m y mother got on top of the roof and I could hear her. I rem ember her calling m e. I rem ember her telling m e, \"Don't be afraid. W e are right outside the window.\" But still. They were out there and I was in here and I couldn't see them . I didn't know why. I thought I'm going to die. I kept, you know, where are m y parents? But nobody would answer you. Nobody would tell you anything. Nobody would explain anything. I kept thinking well, they can see that I'm old enough. I'm no dum my. I can understand. Tell m e what's going on. No. Nobody would tell you. They would just tell you open your m outh and they'd stick the spoon of whatever they were going to give you to eat for breakfast and lunch. Many of the wom en explained that the treatm ent they received as children was consistent with the way children were treated in the culture and tim e period that they grew up. For instance, Kathy, a 62 year old with polio since age 12 years stated, I looked back on it and wondered, wondered why I didn't ask any questions. I just presum ed because I was being tube fed. It didn't last long. I just went along. Maybe I was on drugs. I don't know. You didn't tell your kid he was stupid in front of them , you told other people he was stupid. They were quiet people, farm people. Although som e wom en stated they were able to get past the events that occurred during their initial hospital stay, others witnessed events that scared them or changed the way they were cons cious of the world. These events were described as being too m uch for the eyes of a child. For instance, Dorothy, a 62 year old with polio since age 10 years de scribed the death of a child on the bed next to her. \"It scared m e because I was 10 and she was m y age or younger. Couldn't have been too m uch younger but she was sitting on the bed and she was 95gasping trying to breathe. I rem ember seeing her in m y mind. I rem ember her turning dark and falling over. She was dead then.\" Charlotte, 57 years of age with polio since age 4 years stated that she remembered \"seeing terrible sights like, I know there was m ore than this, but the only one that's vivid is this black m an on a gurney with blood all over him . ...My dad t ook his hat and put it in front of m y eyes to try and keep m e from seeing it. But it was really frightening.\" During the initial treatm ent period the iron lung was described as a sym bol of polio, which represented their stim ulated but uncontrollable body and their mental isolation, fear, and naivety. A lthough only two wom en were placed into iron lungs for therapeutic care, othe rs rem embered viewing them , being threatened by them , or seeing others die in them . One participant recalled visiting her brother who was placed in an iron lung and later died. Another recalled walking through the room that held those in iron lungs. She stated that she could recall \"that sound, that breathing sound, and seeing those people. They all looked dead to m e.\" The Long Term Treatment for Polio During the long term treatm ent of polio the wom en described gaining some control over their bodies and the sensory input was less disturbing then during their initial treatm ent because their bodies began to be m ore useful in doing their will. At the very least, the wo men were given hope that they would be able to function in the world. The treat ment continued to be focused on the body, which included often unpleasant experiences with m ultiple surgeries, but also incorporated teaching them how to use th eir bodies with various assistive devices. 96More im portantly, im provem ents in their bodi es could be identified as they were encouraged to take control of their bodies. The brace becam e a sym bol for their experiences with the long term treatm ent of childhood polio. After the initial diagnosis and treatm ent for polio, the m ajority of wom en continued to receive som e type of long term therapy and they were m onitored by their parents, fam ily physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and/or physical therapists. Some of the wom en were discharged to long term rehabilitation centers where several philanthropic organizations or priv ate insurance agencies financed their care for extended periods of tim e. Others left the hospital for hom e unable to walk, crawling or being carried by parent s. Keeping the m uscles stretched, which was usually done by their m others or hired nurses and relearning to walk were the initial priorities. During the tim e of long term treatm ent, various surgeries were m entioned; some surgeries were described as needed while others stated they were experim ental or unneeded. Typically, th e wom en mentioned various corrective surgeries to im prove the function of a pa rticular extrem ity, such as the hand or foot. For instance, Betty, a 59 year old with polio since age 2 years stated that her thum b was a \"flopping appendage\" until surg eons transferred a m uscle from the middle finger to an area surrounding the thum b, which gave it support. Other surgeries were done to balance the grow th of the individual. For instance the growth plate was dam aged in one leg to prevent it from growing because the opposite leg was not growing due to the e ffects of polio. Deborah, a 59 year old with polio since 3 m onths of age desc ribed six childhood orthopedic surgeries for 97various reasons. She stated, \"One of the su rgeries was to stop the growth of this (left) leg so that this (right) leg could catch up. But they let m e go hom e and I had a growth spurt. So I ended up with m y right leg longer than m y left. Can't win for losing.\" By far, however, the m ajority of surgeries were done to correct an abnorm al curvature of the spine, which often required m ultiple surgeries and body casts for extensive periods of tim e, frequently longer than 6 m onths. This was described in detail by Martha, a 57 year old with polio at age 8 years. I've had three spinal fusions. They put m e in a cast, I rem ember, to try and keep it from curving. I rem ember watching the m ovie. It was a pretty horrendous m ovie to watch knowing that they're going to be doing that to you, but they had the video. They showed m y parents and m e before they did the first spinal fusion in Hot Springs. And then I was in a body cast but they let m e get out and walk around with it. And that was a good sign. I was back on m y feet again by that tim e. And that was kind of m id spine. So what they did on that one was they ran across m y hip bone on both sides and chopped off the bone on top of the hip bone and used that to put along side the spine to brace it when they put it back in to a m ore vertical position. But that did not hold and then I curved above and below it. And they put m e in a Milwaukee brace, talk about torture device. Few wom en were spared m ultiple surgeries. Antoinette, a 57 year old with polio since 15 m onths of age required two surgeries. She was f ollowed in a clinic for children with polio and noticed others were having m ore frequent surgeries, which she called the operation hopper. She stated, Yes. See, that was happening. I know that that was happening because you'd go to the m onthly checkups and people that you saw were walking in braces. The last m onth they are going in for their final you know evaluation before their surgery. Then the next tim e that you see them , you know they're in casts or on crutches and all this stuff and they're like, wait until it starts with you. I'd say nobody said anything to m e. My parents weren't interested. Maybe it's because m y parents were determ ined to pay part of it them selves that I never was put into that the operation hopper 98because I just had two, and the two that I had enabled m e to walk without braces. W ell, enabled m e to walk better in braces. During the long term treatm ent the wo men described feeling that their selves had been altered by their treatm ent experiences. The m ain changes were related to their growing need for i ndependence as they felt a positive outlook toward their f uture abilities and a determ ination to provide what they needed f or them selves. Physical im provem ents gave them a basis for hope; being optim istic was described by several. As Pauline, age 57 with polio at age 9 years recalled, Still rather lim ited physically but since im provem ent was still daily or almost daily, it was easy to be optim istic. And you saw changes not only in yourself, but you saw it in others so even if you didn't quite m ake it today, there was no reason to believe that you wouldn't be able to do it tomorrow and that was very helpful...You kind of hope for the best and brace yourself for the worst. W hen progress slows, then at som e level your brain says well, it's probably not going to be like it used to be, ever. But I guess I just sort of took it as it cam e. The wom en also recalled that during their treatm ent they had to do for them selves. They recognized they had n eeds for their body and for them selves as individuals and m any of the wom en were determ ined as children to provide for them selves. It is difficult to say if the wo men survived because they were innately determ ined to care f or them selves or if this skill developed f rom the type of care they received. Pauline, age 57 with polio since age 9 years stated: Then I could lift m y head up and put som e food in m y mouth and then put my head back down again to chew. Because sitting up even just, I m ean not all the way up but som ewhat, I could stick the food up and I'd do fine the first few bites. And then it would be kind of very unsteady and I was liable to wind up with the food on m y chest instead of in m y mouth. So I was the one who decided rather than wait until the food was cold and 99somebody would com e help m e eat, I would just try having the tray put on the bed and I would just take care of feeding m yself that way. Kathy, age 63 with polio since age 12, cam e hom e after her initial treatm ent but developed a sim ilar need to care for herself. She stated: \"...it seem ed to m e that once I got hom e life just continued and it didn't continue around m e. I wasn't really..., it was hard. So, I was kind of on m y own and developed m y own abilities with tim e. You know...devices to entertain m yself.\" A sym bol of the long term treatm ent of the child with polio was the brace. During childhood all of the wom en described a need for som e type of assistive device and the leg brace was the m ost frequently used. For instance, when asked about her body during childhood, Lena stated \"I was in a wheelchair all m y life but then I was a like a robot. I had long leg braces. I had hand braces, arm braces. I lived in a corset all m y life and so forth.\" Braces sym bolized their altered body, which were difficult to hide or disgui se. Beatrice, who was age 60 with polio since the age of 5 years, stated she hated the leg brace because it m ade her different. She could not hide it because it was so big and bulky. But it also gave her the ability to \"get up and walk with a cane\" by the age of 9 years. Living w ith the Altered Body Living with the altered body was an e xperience of becom ing conscious of the body as different in appearance and abilit y. It was also being conscious of an altered experience of the self from that of others who did not have an altered body. The ugly brown shoes the wom en had to wear, which were different than the other girls, becam e a sym bol for living the altered body. Living the altered 100body was com posed of two sub-them es: The Altered Body and The Altered Childhood Experience. The Altered Body The wom en recalled becom ing conscious of their altered bodies after the initial treatm ent for polio. Som e of the wom en rem embered their bodies before polio and som e did not. Despite this, the wom en noted that their bodies were different than they thought they should be, as they com pared one lim b to the other limb or com pared their bodies to that of siblings or peers. The difference becam e notable to them over tim e as they used their bodies. For the wom en who rem embered thei r bodies prior to polio, the body was experienced as dif ferent in appearance and ability. Their experience bef ore polio as children with sym metric extrem ities, a norm ally curved spine, or a f ull voice was changed indefinitely. Patsy, age 60 with polio since age 9 years, stated, \"I was ten or eleven and I kept getting wo rse and worse and it got to where I was just bent over kind of doubled over and I couldn't straighten out\". Donna, age 56 with polio since age 5 years, stated that \"so you know but I was always embarrassed by it and didn't want people to see it. Because m y toes don't lay down exactly like they're suppose to. I even have a finger that's crooked. But m y toes, m y foot kind of leans this way a little bit. This is the little toe, it kind of sticks up. I was always em barrassed for people to see it\". Moreover, even the most active of children noticed the diffe rence in the ability of their bodies to perform . Martha, age 57 with polio at 8 years, recalled how her body changed in function due to polio and the brace sh e was wearing when she noted \"And I 101couldn't sit because it cut into the top of m y legs. I knelt, I knelt at school. I knelt at church. I knelt at hom e.\" Women who did not rem ember their bodies prior to polio often stated they were fortunate not to know how they m ight have been without polio. Janice, age 57 with polio at age 3 years, stated, \"I know one of the things is because I had polio when I was three. I don't have a memory of walking and running and playing and doing things as a 'norm al' ch ild. I've always had a disability and so it's easier to live with it than had I had it at a later tim e.\" Despite this, they noted the differences in their own bodies' appearance and ability. The m ovem ent of other bodies when they walked was noti ceably different then their own. Other children didn't wear braces or need surger ies. For instance, Elizabeth, age 55 with polio since 6 m onths, could not walk afte r a spinal fusion. She described how her leg would not bend and her fused back woul d not allow her to hike her hip up to compensate f or the stif f leg. This lef t her with no choice but to rem ain in a wheel chair. For Deborah, age 59 with polio since 3 m onths of age, knowing her body was different was part of her uniqueness; however, this was shattered when she learned at a rehabilitation hospital that her unique shape was not unique. In f act, she was part of a group of children who were physically altered. The Altered Childhood Experience Living in the world as a child with an altered body, with altered physical abilities, im pacted the wom en's ability to participate in and experience the world. Their place in the world was considered special, whether they were being included or excluded. For som e it m eant th ey could not run. Other kids ran for 102them after they hit the ball in recess. For others it m eant they could not have friends or trust people to be consistently nice. They knew that kids could be cruel. Over all, the wom en knew they were diffe rent, which was m ore than a difference in appearance and ability. It was a way of being in the world. Kathy, age 63 with polio since age 12, described her experience in elem entary school, where she was taken, put in a chair, and stayed until she was picked up. She said, Kids didn't know anything. They were afraid. Because parents, you know. The whole deal was still a f ear. Even af ter the sum mer. You didn't f it in. You weren't able to do the things... I had friends, call friends and stuff. We would talk and read things. But, not... A lot of children were afraid. I was never cruelly treated. I wasn't other than looked at, of course. But, nobody was ever m alicious. I was in m y own world, I don't know. I was different then a lot of people. The wom en began to plan for life based on their experiences as being different because of lim itations of their bodies. Deborah, age 59 with polio since 3 months of age, began to rely heavily on her m ental abilities. She stated, \"I also remember telling m yself well, hell. Now you've got scars on your legs. Can't be any beauty queen with this. I guess you 're going to have to m ake it on your brains.\" Over tim e, the wom en began to see them selves as \"dif ferent lim itations that you know of as yourself\". The self a nd the lim itations were part of being in the world as them selves\u2014the body and the lim its were all part of the child. However, the child also had strengths, which were prim arily recognized in their cognitive abilities. Shoes were a sym bol of the altere d experience of childhood. Alm ost every wom an described her dislike for 'those ugly brown shoes\" she was forced to wear. An exam ple of these shoes with an att ached brace, as well as other types of 103braces, was provided in Appendix C. Duri ng this tim e dresses were m andatory, which m eant shoes and braces were visi ble. Being picked on for wearing ugly shoes was not uncom mon. Typically the wom en noticed the difference in the shoes they wore com pared to the shoe s of the other girls around them . They wished to be like all the other girls and wear cute little shoes. How Families Shape their Children Relationships with f amily m embers were intensely im portant to the wom en prim arily because the wom en were c onscious of the sacrifices m embers of their fam ilies m ade for them during thei r childhood and due to the influence of their parents' presence in their lives. This them e, How Fam ilies Shape their Children, was com posed of two sub-them es Fam ily Sacrifice and Parental Presence. Family Sacrifice The wom en were conscious of how m embers of their f amilies sacrif iced for them during their childhood experiences with polio. Parents, siblings, grandparents, and cousins were all m entioned as people who sacrificed in som e way for them . Kathy stated that her m other \"bout strangled herself cause she thought I was suffering from som ething she did.\" Many of the m others were responsible for providing physical ther apy at hom e while caring for other children. The wom en knew this was a sacrifice for their often busy and tired mothers. As Sarah Jane, age 61 with polio at 4 years, stated, She put those hot packs on there, is what they had her to do. She'd get them as hot as she could stand to wring them out and put them on m e for so long. Then she would exercise m e so long and then she would give m e 104a real hot bath and exercise you in the bathtub. She did that twice a day. I always wonder how m y mother m ade it when I had polio because I was only four. That would m ake a sister nine and that would m ade a brother seven and then that would have m ade m y little brother three and the baby, then...she told m e in later years when every tim e I cried and begged her not to do it, she'd go off in the other room and cry. Other m embers of the fam ily were also known to have sacrificed in som e memorable way in order that the wom en received the care they needed as children. Siblings were described as doing without their sister, their parents, or even their hom es. Betty, age 59 who had po lio since age 2 years, described how her m other cried when she learned Betty was transf erred to a distant rehabilitation hospital. Her m other stated, \"I'm afraid she'll forget she has a fam ily if we don't go, too.\" So the entire fam ily, which in cluded a m other, a father and three siblings, m oved into an old farm house near the rehabilitation hospital where Betty was staying. The parents picked up odd jobs at the hospital and her siblings were of ten seen sitting in the car waiting to get a glim pse of her. Betty's m other also led the March of Dim es drive in her area. The sacrif ice by their f amilies brought the wom en a feeling of com mitment; they also voiced a strong sense of gratitude to all m embers of their fam ily. For wom en of Hispanic culture, the fam ily com munication was changed and m embers of the f amily had to m ake sacrif ices to m aintain a relationship with the child. Four of the five Hispanic par ticipants in the study described being taken from their hom es after the onset of polio where they stayed away for extended periods. Rosaria, age 63 with polio at 2.5 years, was m issed by her sister but when she returned hom e they could not speak to each other. The change from hom e to 105hospital environm ent resulted in a change of language for the entire fam ily. Antoinette, age 57 with polio at 15 m onths, stated that Well, I think it trem endously affected m y family because nobody spoke English before I got sick. I didn't speak Spanish. It always m ade m e cry but they all learned English for m e. They all learned to speak English because of m e and that was just overwhelm ing. W hen they went and picked m e up, I didn't recognize anybody. Antoinette's fam ily sacrificed to learn the English language but also sacrificed their plans for a large fam ily because An toinette was considered for adoption by wealthy Anglos. The fam ily had to change their plans to have several children so that Antoinette could have all the resources she needed. Parental Presence During childhood the wom en were c onscious of how their parents supported, protected, and pushed them during their long term therapy. The wom en were conscious of support when parents inte rceded on their behalf either in school related situations or in health related situations. Many parents had to dem and an education for their children. Others st ood up to physicians or nurses on their behalf. For exam ple, Antoinette, age 57 with polio at 15 m onths, described how her father was im portant to her when she said, \"But yeah, he was a m ajor player in m y life. Major. And it was to the la st. It was [Antoinette] and dad. I think probably the fact that he would always in tercede. He was always in the doctors' meetings. That m ade a difference.\" The wom en were conscious of parental protection when their parents made efforts to prevent further harm to them . This protection was wanted in som e situations but not in others. In fact, it was a double edge sword because if the 106protection did not seem warranted it wa s stifling to their sense of growing independence. For instance, Darlene, age 63 with polio since age 5 years, stated. \"Probably growing up with the effects of the polio. My parents held m e back a lot. I couldn't ride a bicycle because I m ight fall. Things like this. I was not equal to the other children.\" This was also seen when som e wom en were not m ade to do chores that siblings were doing around the house. Betty recalled that her siblings were m ade to chop cotton on the farm , but she was excluded from this type of work, which m ade her feel different and guilty. The wom en were conscious of bei ng pushed by their parents within a continuum of experiences. They were to ld to try what they wanted despite concerns about ability and they were told to com plete tasks despite any protests. The wom en translated these m essages into meaning they m ust be able to look out for them selves and not ask for help. For instance, Dorothy, age 62 with polio at age 10 years, described how she attem pted to let her m other wait on her as a child but was told that would not happen. She said, When I got hom e, why I got spoiled, babified and Mom didn't want to do that anym ore. So m other stood m e up against the wall. You're going to walk again because if you don't walk again, I'm going to spank you. So in order to not get a spanking, I walked. I could anyway, so. It was just nicer to have her waiting on m e. Another exam ple was from Elizabeth, ag e 55 who had polio since the age of 6 months. She described how her m other would not let her take handouts from people because she was to learn to do and get things for herself. This becam e her way of being in the world. Elizabeth exem plified this when she stated, \"The sam e thing m other did with m e. We've got to be out there and m ake it on our own. W e 107can't expect other people to do it. You've got to get out there and get it on your own; so [we] were pushed.\" There Are Things Worse Than Polio Poverty, abuse, and discrim ination we re considered worse than having polio. The experience of having an a ltered body and being in the world was secondary to being poor, abused, and/or discrim inated against. For som e, these negative experiences caused them to feel older than their peers. For others, it strained their relationships with fam ily and care providers. Poverty influenced whether or not the child would be accepted within their peer group or if they could afford toys, assistive devices, or clothes. In fact, Donna described being m ade fun of fo r wearing the sam e skirt to school repeatedly. She stated, I rem ember not ever being very happy. I m ean that has nothing .... I don't think that has anything to do with polio. I don't think. I don't know. But I don't ever rem ember being very happy. I rem ember that...I can see from old pictures the sadness in m y eyes. I am sure that's because of the way we lived. You know m y mother had to work two jobs....W e lived in a one-room house. W e were very poor. Childhood abuse was experienced in th e form of sexual, physical, and verbal abuse. This was often a 'secret ' problem that prevented them from enjoying their hom e life or from sharing th eir hom es with friends. As girls with disabilities, participants could not es cape an abusive hom e life by physically leaving as m ale siblings did. Pauline stated that the rehabilitation hospital provided the predictability that her hom e life did not provide. She had a verbally abuse alcoholic father who \"did not wa nt a cripple\" for a daughter. For Deborah, 108the hom e was also worse than the hospital. Deborah's f ather had a m ental illness that led him to force Deborah to do m any abusive things, including telling her to hit her m other for 'letting' her get polio. She stated that, I think that innocence, I think m y dad took that away. I think I felt innocent in the convalescent hom e you know free-spirited, fun loving but then when we cam e hom e to weirdness; I had to have an awareness of life that children don't have to have. Maybe that's why I started the newspaper and did goofy things like write notes to boys that I never could go out with. I knew that was m y attem pt to interject som e fun and silliness into my life. I don't know. I never felt constricted but it's a sense of responsibility that kids don't have a sense of responsibility. My dad m ade me think I was responsible for everything that happened and when you voice that on a child, you've lost the childhood. Although the m ajority of abusive situa tions were perpetrated by relatives, participants also described abusive situations in the hospital perpetrated by those caring for them . For instance, Janice descri bed being abused when she was in the hospital. There was one incident where I was a bad kid because I acted out the fact that m y parents were leaving m e all the tim e. I took Crayolas and m arked on it. There was a picture on the wall of a clown's face and I m arked up the clown's face probably acting out the anger. I was punished for it by a Catholic nun. She picked m e up and put m e in a barrel of dirty clothing in a closet and closed the closet door. Now I don't know if I told m other and dad the next day or however it was, but it was their way of punishing m e for acting out. For being a typical a child, I guess a two year old or three year old. The m emories aren't good. Being thrown into a trash can isn't exactly a pleasant m emory. The abusive situations were worsened when no help could be found. For instance, Patsy did not receive help from her m other when her step father m ade sexual advances. She didn't protect us from nothing. My step dad tried som ething with m e. I broke the phone over his head. I'm not talking about one of those plastic 109phones we have now. I'm talking about one of those old...it's a wonder I hadn't killed him . Really. It is a wonder. The next day, he tried again and I wasn't putting up with his bologna and she said, 'well, he's only wanting some fun.' I said, 'he's not getting it out of m e.' That is what she said. The betrayal felt by Patsy stayed with her a life tim e. The abuser, however, was never seen as com pletely bad. The wom en we re often left to feel anger and love for their abuser. Donna's statem ents about her m other's abusive acts are an exam ple. My m om was the best m om she could be with the disease that she had. She had three kids to support. She worked two jobs. There were days she could barely m ove. She was a bookkeeper. I was also the one she took her anger out on, too. I m ean you know you have to strike out. W hen som eone is hurt and you're angry, you have to strike out. Som ebody usually gets it. I was it. She didn't m ean to. I m ean I believe that in m y mind. I believe in my heart that if she had to do it over, she wouldn't do it. But she had to strike out. The experiences of abuse and poverty were often described as causing the child to m ature f aster than norm al. Do rothy recalled being sexually m olested by two step fathers and one great uncle. Th ese experiences aged her and left her unable to look people in the eye. She said that, I think I skipped a childhood to be an adult because I had a very short childhood. It seem ed like I changed after m y great uncle m olested m e several tim es, several tim es. W hen I would just cry and pitch a fit when my grandparents would want to go out there and take m e with them . They couldn't understand. I never did tell them why. Discrim ination, which was a way of life for the wom en during their childhood, was described as a greater probl em than polio. Janette, age 65 with polio since 13 years of age, was aware th at maintaining that way of life was a matter of survival. She knew that she was lim ited not because of polio but because of her race. \"You just couldn't do that because it wasn't for you.\" Alita, 110age 60 with polio since 1 year of age, described several form s of blatant discrim ination that affected her as a Chicano child. Blatant is when you go to a restaurant and there's a sign that says no dogs or Mexicans allowed. That's blatant. W hen you go to a m ovie theater and you can't sit downstairs. You have to sit upstairs. They have a special place for blacks and a special place for Mexicans. Anglos sat downstairs. That's blatant. Blatant is when you have an elem entary school for you and a school for the others on the other side of town. The instrum ents that the band used at the junior high that we had were old instrum ents that the other junior high had used up. W hen they bought new ones, they passed them down to us. That's blatant. There's a lot of exam ples of that kind of stuff but their m entality always was that's the way things are. ADOLESCENCE - 1952/1962 TO 1961/1971 Events that Changed a Time and Place During adolescence, age 13 to 22, historical events were identified by the wom en that either influenced the way they viewed society or inspired them to contem plate their position in society as wom en. The Korean and Vietnam Wars, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the shooting from the University of Texas Tower by Charles W hitman were all m entioned as events that impacted the way they viewed the worl d. The wom en's m ovem ent was identified during this tim e as a catalyst for decidi ng their position as wom en in society\u2014pro or con equal rights. The Korean and Vietnam Wars were frequently m entioned as significant events. Brothers, husbands, friends and other acquaintances participated in the wars and the wom en recalled feeling concern for the m en who went to war. Kathy stated, \"And we lost our innocence at that point, and then with the Vietnam War we were losing our innocence m ore and people were dying for the cause.\" W hen 111the wom en lost people they were close to in the wars, the losses were interpreted as m aturational and educational. They l earned further about the fragility of life and the unexpected nature of physical harm . Sarah, age 61 with polio since the age of 4, lost a relative during the Viet nam War. He was m issing in action and Sarah stated, \"You always, it's just, there' s no com pletion. No end to it. It am azed me how m any years that you still think a bout him and wonder what happened to him.\" The wom en also m entioned the assa ssination of John F. Kennedy as a salient event in history. Many felt it change d their view of governm ent at an early age. Alita, age 60 with polio since 1 year of age, described her reaction. Oh, m y God. That was just heartbreaking. I was at [college]. In the Mexican Am erican hom e, that's one of the things when you walk in to have the Virgin of Guadalupe and a picture of John F. K. He was an idol for the Hispanic com munity. At least that's m y perspective. Mexican Americans were f ascinated and I'm still . . . every tim e they run it on TV. I'm still convinced that there was m ore than one gunm an because his head flew backwards and so som ebody from the front shot him . It couldn't have come from the back. I don't care what they tell m e. They can't convince me otherwise. That was a heartbreaker. I guess in the first place because it was him and m ore im portantly because we would have som ething like that happen in our country. That was . . . when you see it in other countries. We call them uncivilized and all of that kind of stuff. And then this country where it could happen is just unbelievable. I'm proud to be an American. I think Am erica is the best country there is. There's a lot of things wrong with the system because I've seen it from being on the receiving end of discrim ination and the inequity. But I think what it has done. Som etimes I think what continues to be confirm ed to m e is that our governm ent is not our governm ent. The shooting by Charles W hitman grea tly im pacted Pauline because she was on the University of Texas cam pus at the tim e. The shooting brought out 112feelings regarding her vulnerability and f eelings of disdain towards the callous reaction of others to the loss of hum an life. I stood up. I was in the library of the business building and collected m y things and was just picking them up to leave when som eone cam e out of the office. W e have instructions that no one is to leave the building. There is a sniper in the tower. I started to go to the window to see if I could see anything and som ebody said if you can see him , he can see you. So I moved away from the window and wound up going to the basem ent. There was a close circuit T.V. Eventually it was over and we were allowed to leave and that was . . . I was kind of shaky walking from the business building towards Guadalupe. For weeks afterwards, people on sum mer vacation were on cam pus looking gleefully for bullet holes and blood stains. It just kind of all brought it back up again and I just found that so repugnant, so awful. The wom en's m ovem ent was considered of signif icance to the m ajority of wom en and m ost had a strong opinion about the phenom enon. The reactions varied from being strongly against th e wom en's m ovem ent to being very supportive of the wom en's m ovem ent. Others found m iddle ground by agreeing with som e but not all of the things done in the nam e of wom en's rights. It was common for the wom en to say \"You know they started with the equal rights thing. That was the very beginning of it, which I was for, but the way they were doing it. Somehow it just didn't seem right.\" For m any of the wom en such as Pauline, age 57 with polio since age 9, burning one's bra seem ed to be taking things a little too far. I thought it was pitiful and not helpful with wom en burning their bras. That just didn't help m atters at all. It m ade it easy to dism iss the im portant issues. Oh, these are just wom en going off half cocked burning their bras. But yes, the wom en's m ovem ent has helped quite a lot. Just that the m ore wom en who are out there accom plishing things, the better things get, too. 113Conscious of the Body's Improvement During the adolescent years the wom en were conscious of their bodies becom ing m ore functional, as in m ore capable of activities. The wom en becam e more conscious of their ability to perfor m their will with the use of their bodies. Many wom en were able to lose their br aces during this tim e period, which was in effect losing a sym bol of being disabl ed. During this tim e many of the wom en perceived that they were living their physical best. The Body Improves Adolescence was a tim e when the wom en's bodies continued to be limited. This ranged f rom limping that was exaggerated with f atigue to the inability to walk. At no tim e did the im pact of polio com pletely disappear f rom these wom en's lives but it did greatly dim inish. Many of the wom en continued with th eir long term therapy through m ost of their early teens, but by the end of their teen years m ost were seeing a difference in the function of their bodies. In other words, they were beginning to perform activities they were previously not able to perf orm or perf orming them with less fatigue. Joann, age 65 with polio since age 12, was deeply m oved by her increased abilities in her teens. She state d, \"And I will never f orget I guess one of the biggest events of m y life was when I was in church and it was af ter the surgery, several m onths later, I rem ember I could stand all by m yself. I had never been able to do that. W ell, here I was in church and I started crying.\" Most of the wom en contributed this success to their therapies and an increased level of 114energy. Frequently the wom en made statem ents such as, \"it seem ed like the older I got the m ore stam ina up until...\" The wom en's ability to use the body eff ectively to m eet the dem ands of the self was enhanced during adolescen ce. It required both energy and physical ability, which were f requently at their hi ghest levels. This led m any to describe their late teens and early twenties as their physical best. For instance, when Janice, age 57 with polio since age 3 year s, was asked when her physical best was she stated, I would say it was early, well either late high school or early in m y career. Because I really didn't have any fatigue com ing in until probably the early eighties. But I think that whenever I was first working and then doing things on the weekend...there was a tim e when I was in all sorts of different associations and different organizations, both sports cars and motorcycles and stuff. Losing the Braces During the adolescent years the wom en began to lose their braces, which included back and leg braces. For instance, Betty, age 59 with polio since 2 years, stated that she always used som e type of assistive device but beginning at age 14 years she no longer had to wear a b ack brace. Losing the back brace was important because it was uncom fortable; it was a nice feeling for the body not to wear the corset type brace anym ore. The braces were tight and restrictive, which had both m ental and physical affects. The braces were a sym bol of their impaired bodies; therefore, it was mentally liberating not to wear their braces . It did not m ean that their bodies were without im pairm ent, but it did m ean that without the sym bol of im pairm ent they 115were less likely to feel and be perceived as im paired. This also m eant they could wear som e of the shoes that other girl s were wearing at the tim e. Braces were often built into special shoes. So, by losing their braces they lost their sym bols of impairm ent and disability. For instance, Antoinette, age 57 with polio since 15 months, stated she felt liberated after her braces were rem oved. I thought gee, I'd like not being able to squeak. I'd like not having people know I'm com ing. I'd like to wear real shoes. So I decided I'd see how it goes and I was going to take them off. So we hunted around and hunted around because m y feet are different sizes. It was really hard finding a pair of shoes in the two different sizes. My m om found m e a pair of penny loafers and luckily at the tim e, that was kind of like at the end of the penny loafer age, but not too far to be really dorky. I wore these penny loafers. I remember going to class and com ing down the stairs one day and there was one of those little yellow signs in the hallway. You know caution, slippery floors or wet floors or som ething or other. I fell. I didn't get hurt and it was the strangest, strangest feeling because I fell down and I dropped m y books and nobody m ade a fuss. There was no big deal. It wasn't oh gosh, stop. [She] fell. Help her. Quick. It was none of that. It was oh gosh, that slippery floor got another person. It was the strangest, most liberating feeling. It was one of those, like it is kind of cool. So I just got up and nobody noticed. I picked up m y book. I looked around and nobody noticed and I just went on to m y class. Vanessa, age 56 with polio at 5 years of age, shared Antoinette's view when she stated, \"It was a hard surgery. It was a very painful surgery but it was worth it. For six m onths, I was in a cast and then a brace for a little bit longer. A couple of more m onths and then I could wear the shoes I wanted, which was nice because then you felt like you were part of everything.\" Becoming Conscious of Potential Ability During this period of increased ability the wom en becam e conscious that they could use their bodies to achieve their will. The wom en stated that their 116bodies were still lim ited, but the wom en were able to use their increased abilities along with strategies and devices to pl an for their futures. Although unsure of their exact potential for a career, m arriage, and/or children, m any found them selves eventually doing those things. In fact, the m ajority of wom en went to college, m arried, and had a fam ily. Others chose different paths. Regardless of what path they chose it was during the a dolescent years that they realized they could use their bodies' to influence their life course. For m any wom en their ability to achie ve and af fect their own outcom es came through their experiences, which in fluenced their perception of their physical abilities and their perceptions of th eir abilities to be in the world. In other words, the wom en learned they could do m ore and m ore things after they were out doing them , which led them to reali ze they could do even m ore. For Betty, this m eant learning to step up on a curb. She stated that, \"I finally succeeded (to step up on the curb). So when I, like I say, started school, I had a lot of steps to go up and to go down. But I had been able to m aster that skill and that's what got m e through school.\" Rosaria, age 63 with polio since the age of 2.5, was the first in her fam ily to attend college. She had attended a school for people with disabilities within her com munity throughout the m ajority of her life. She decided to becom e a teacher as a teenager, so after graduati on her m other went with her daily to a local junior college. Her success there built her conf idence over tim e. She realized she could attend a larger, distant college when the tim e cam e. Afterwards, she realized she could do other things on her ow n. She stated, \"I am very glad I went away to school. It helped m e to reali ze what I could do and what I couldn't do 117because I was by m yself. I did it.\" Kathy, age 62 with polio at age 12 stated, \"You know I figured out how to handle that. A nd I guess that is how m y whole life has been, how to do that. How to fit into the things that you can't, that other people fit into different than you. But you are the round peg for the square hole.\" Some wom en's knowledge of their pot ential ability cam e serendipitously as they becam e acquainted with others w ith disabilities. Betty, age 59 with polio since the age of 2 years, realized her pot ential to drive when she was a teen. She met a person with a spinal chord injury who could drive with hand controls. This made her conscious that people with di sabilities could do what everyone else was doing. She could drive when she becam e old enough. She said, \"But he could drive, and I was looking that car over good, too. In fact, I had said som ething about that, 'I was going to get a car'.\" Adolescence was considered the tim e in their lives when they m ight reach an unexpected, unknown potential. Goals were being set for their future, frequently keeping in m ind their knowledge of their physical lim its. Kathy, age 62 with polio since age 12, stated, \"I was going to college and I was going to get a degree because I knew I couldn't do farm work. I didn't want to stay on the farm and I wanted to get out of this town. And so I did.\" Darlene, age 63 with polio at age 5 years, knew that lim itations can be created through barriers placed before her. Her parents had not allowed her to be an active child because of her polio. She perceived that they were too pr otective of her. Once she becam e an adolescent, she quit school, left hom e and m arried in order to be independent. She stated, 118But then you think really, that's what m akes the younger people... you think you can change the world. You think. So if som ebody doesn't com e along and really stom p on you and tell you, you can't. You at least try. So you com e up with a lot of things that m ake a difference in a lot of ways. Know ing and Show ing the Body's Limits Despite im provem ents in their bodies and their ability to use their bodies to meet the dem ands of their will, lim itations rem ained that the wom en were m ore or less conscious of in their daily liv es. The wom en were unable to distance them selves com pletely from their im paired bodies. For som e this m eant being reminded of their im pairm ents by the occasional injury or accident, while for others it m eant the inability to access pub lic areas. Ultim ately, the wom en faced decisions about how m uch of their bodies they would conceal or display as impaired. A tension existed between know ing of a lim itation, being rem inded of a limitation, and letting that lim itation be known to others. Reminders of Limitations The wom en were often rem inded of the differences and lim its of their bodies and subsequently their ability to e xperience the world. Pauline, age 57 with polio since age 9 years, described her experience as a teen going to high school in Texas. She stated, It was hot. And if I did very m uch walking, then either the bottom part of the corset and/or the chin piece on the head traction could absolutely rub the hide off m y skin and it would bleed. It was hot and I did very m uch walking, the friction would just com pletely wear the skin off. That's to be avoided, needless to say. Others felt less discom fort as their br aces were lost and they went off to college, but their bodies continued to rem ind them of they were different. Martha, 119age 57 with polio since age 8 years, described her experience walking on a college cam pus. She said, \"I had problem s in college because m y knee would go out on m e. My right knee would just kind of quit. So what I would do is wrap it with ACE bandage and truck on.\" Charlotte , age 57 with polio since age 4 years, described her college years as lim ited wh en com pared to the activities of other adolescents. I went to [college] and taking prerequisites and just your regular English and stuff like that. But m y stam ina started leaving m e, and I had to work part tim e to go to college and so going to college and working part tim e, and studying, was very hard on m e. I got tired. Other people could just do it and party all night, but I couldn't do it. I m ean I still had dates and there were norm al things, they weren't like staying up late, 2 o'clock...that kind of stuff, it was just norm al going to the show and com ing hom e and doing something like that on the weekends. And I was tired, I just was tired. Injuries in the adolescent years were also a rem inder of the lim its of their bodies. Deborah, age 59 with polio since 3 months of age, had an accident as a teen while riding in a bum per car with her grandfather. I started seeing a decline you know. It's hard for m e to walk. W hy is m y foot dropping? And I'm falling m ore. W hy am I having m ore accidents in terms of the toilet? I had done m y time and how dare som ething else happen out of som ething as wonderful as being close to m y grandfather. Why is it that I can't have any fun? I just went into a really deep state of depression. I just I don't see what the point is. Injuries were especially disappointing b ecause they represented a set back at a time when the wom en were anticipating im provem ents. Hiding What Can be Hidden It was while discussing the adolescen t years that issues of hiding the impaired body were discussed m ost frequen tly. Since their experiences with their 120body continued to indicate som e level of disability the wom en were faced with letting others know in social situations. For som e wom en, the issue was irrelevant because they did not feel their disab ilities could be hidden. Som e continued to need their wheelchairs, braces, crutches, etc. For others, their im pairm ents were minimal. They did not perceive a need to hide the m inimal differences. Others saw the differences in their bodies as dist racting from their ability to be attractive wom en. They recognized that a high valu e was placed on the appearance of the body during the adolescent years. Deborah, age 59 with polio since age 10 years, described the way she saw her body as a teen. I was seeing a girl who lim ped a little bit, and who I thought was fat and not pretty. Just the whole deal like that, which is just that I had such a terrible inferiority com plex and everything because of what all I had been through when I was little. It stayed with m e. Dorothy, age 62 with polio since age 10 y ears, recalled that her feelings of inferiority and sham e led her to hide her scoliosis. Disability when I was younger, I would try to hide it. I was asham ed of my body because I had, from the scoliosis, a hum p on m y back. W hen I was a teen, it didn't show up as m uch as I thought it did. I was m y own worst critic, of course. I would try to; af ter we m arried and stuf f [married at age 16], I would try to dress to conceal you know. Back then it was popular to wear those little sleeveless vests and I don't know how m any of those I had to go with everything I wore. Even when I would put on a dress, it would be on a slant, the hem would. I had a friend help m e make a dress one tim e that we could even it up and it just didn't look right. I wore a girdle all the tim e. Those m iserable things to hold m y tummy in so I'd look halfway decent. The m orality and f ashions of the tim e period dictated that wom en wore dresses. This m eant that differences in leg appearance and/or braces could not be hidden. Throughout their teen years, som e wom en reported hiding their bodies in 121their cars. Sitting in a car would allow them to m eet boys at drive-in theatres or car hops without showing off the differen ces that dresses would not hide. The social change that allowed wom en to w ear pants was m ore than a wom en's rights issue; f or som e wom en with disabilities, it was a m atter of privacy. Finding a Voice in Relationships During adolescence the wom en began to learn to assert their will in relationships. This included relationships with authority figures, parents, and friends. In order to gain access to needed services, the wom en began to verbalize their needs to people with authority, such as school adm inistrators and physicians. Many asked for access to high school cla ssroom s and colleges, which increased their belief in their ability to change a nd participate in the world. Lena, age 62 with polio since the age of 10 years, described how she took the initiative at college to get the help she needed. The deans were always very nice but I was a talker. I would go up to the dean and tell him , well, how am I going to get up here? So he would always assign two guys. There were al ways two students who were always waiting to carry m e at the steps or whatever building I was going to use. It was hard. It was fun because the guys were real neat about it. Relationships with health care providers also shifted as the wom en contributed to som e of the decisions re garding their treatm ent. This was a large shift from being uninform ed, passive r ecipients of care during their childhood. Pauline, age 57 with polio since age 9 y ears, described her ham mer toe surgery as \"my choice\". Betty, age 59 with polio since age 2 years, was given a choice between surgeries to stiffen her knee or wearing braces. Her physician 122recom mended not having the surgery so sh e agreed. It was significant; however, because it was one of the first tim es she was given a choice. Although som e stated they did not date or socialize during high school, after high school m ost were enjoying a so cial life. They began to negotiate relationships with the opposite sex as we ll as develop lasting friendships. Alita, age 60 with polio since age 1 year, de scribed how she was under the im pression as an adolescent that she would never date. The physical part is . . . I never thought, never thought that any m an would be interested in m e. Because growing up that was kind of the experience you know. I never dated in school and things like that. I just never, never thought that m en married wom en with disabilities. I m ean if you see people with disabilities and they are m arried, you think m aybe they were already m arried when they becam e disabled because we are such a physical oriented, attractiveness kind of . . . and you have to look a certain way. You have to have a certain kind of body for a m an to even look at you. And for a m an to look at you and see the disability and see beyond that, I thought it would take a special m an. I never thought it would really happen. In college, Alita acquired several f riends, dated, and eventually m arried. Deborah, age 59 with polio since 3 m onths, had an alternative view of dating. She found that m en were attracted to her body becau se she had large breasts. She described herself as \"a sex crazed kid\" who was not about to let a m an stand her up. For her, her body's sensuality was not defined by her disability. Others m ade decisions to remain single despite m arriage proposals and long term relationships. One wom an had no desire for a husband or children. Disability, although considered by each wom an as she negotiated within relations hips, did not dictate whether or not a wom an dated or m arried. 123Several wom en stated that they m ade 'm istakes' in relationships during this period, but they also stated that th ey developed the ability to take risks in relationships. For instance, Cindy, age 56 with polio since 3 years, wrote the Lonely Hearts Club to find her husband w ho traveled across the country to m eet her. It turns out she forgot to tell him about her polio, but thankfully he stayed anyway. It was a relationship she valu ed. Other wom en married abusive m en. Some divorced them . Others stayed. Most im portantly; however, was the wom en's perception that they m ade choices to engage or not engage in relationships, and they grew as individuals based upon their decisions. YOUNG ADULTHOOD - 1962/1972 TO 1973/1983 Things Needed to Change During their young adulthood, age 23 to 35, the wom en described how society needed to change and m any perceived that they 'lived the changes' as they happened. W ork place inequality was freque ntly m entioned as a problem . Alita, age 65 with polio since age 1 year, knew of work force discrim ination personally. Certainly, I know that there's discrim ination. Go get the discrepancy between what university professors-- m ales versus fem ales get. I was treated that way. I told you about that one when I went and found out that I was m aking less m oney than the guy that was in the sam e office with m e. The m ajority of wom en were in the wo rk force and their feelings about job discrim ination dom inated m any discussions about the problem s they faced in society. The discrim ination that m any wom en described was two fold: access and attitudinal. The wom en had m ore dif ficulty getting to work when the buildings 124were a long distance from their park ing areas and few accom modations were made. Moreover, attitudinal problem s related to being a wom an and having a disability m ade the access problem s worse. For instance, som e wom en had to convince em ployers to hire them . Pauline, age 57 with polio since age 5 years, was one of those. The m an that I would be working for was fine with . . . he was glad to have found m e, was absolutely ready to hire m e. His boss though had some reservations because I had polio and he wasn't sure that I was going to be able to do the work. Stenographer, typing, filing, answering the phone. And this com ing from a man who had lost parts of his fingers, I think it was on his left hand, from a grenade in W orld W ar II. And so his left hand was im paired but it certainly didn't im pair his ability to work. Now why he was so reluctant to say well, you know, let's give this a try, I don't know. But he finally decided well, okay. Martha, age 57 with polio since age 8 y ears, experienced a problem with work surrounding her pregnancy. She was m ade to feel badly for her pregnancy during her professional em ploym ent. I guess by the tim e I went through that, I had been through two batches of men that I had worked with that I really had learned to keep m y problem s to myself. Because I had com e in joyously announcing that I was pregnant and was so tickled pink that I was pregnant and had the guy that I was working with call m e into his office and chew m e up one side and down the other. How dare I thank him for getting m e that job by getting pregnant while I'm working for him and on and on and on? And I managed to get out of there without crying, but barely. The wom en had personal experiences with work place discrim ination based upon their gender and disability but many rem ained am bivalent to issues surrounding the wom en's m ovem ent and th e Am erican's with Disabilities Act (ADA). Kathy, age 63 with polio since age 12 years, was denied an equal salary to the m en she worked with, which she perceived as unfair treatm ent. However, 125she stated she had both positive and negativ e feelings about work place problem s and the wom en's m ovem ent. I saw the good points [but] I think a lot of them were not to our advantage. Its like if you're Republican you're going to vote for the person no m atter what he represents, that's not m e. I'm not going to agree with the wom en's issues because... I'm not going to agree with som e of the issues because I don't think they're good, but I think the whole process is good. I think it's just the fact of m aking the i ssue of the fact that you're a fem ale, and being so sensitive to what happens. I think that's the thing, we've been too sensitive. I guess som e of that com es up in the so called.... W hen wom en feel like they've been m istreated sexually at work. And you have to rem ember when I started in pharm acy in the sixties; m en spoke, any assortm ent of fem ale critique, jokes that were anti fem ale. But I never felt that that was an insult to m e. Janice, age 57 with polio since 3 m onths of age, had been accused of getting a job because of her disability, which she said was unfounded. During her work history as a young adult, she was proud of succeedi ng prior to the ADA. She was a hard worker and f elt pride in her achievem ents. She had heard of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, but did not feel she needed it at the tim e. I did everything that I needed to do. Of course, ADA wasn't even in there but I don't think it was ever an issue. If it was m aybe I was naive enough not to see it. Maybe som e of the people . . . like the wom an that didn't want m e there m aybe she didn't want m e there because I was disabled. It didn't seem to be that. The am bivalent feelings about discrim ination against wom en with disabilities were highlighted when several wom en commented that people at least knew what they were up against then. In other wo rds, the discrim ination was blatant and honest. Now it is hidden. Pauline, age 57 with polio since age 9 years, stated, Nowadays it's hard to tell whether som ebody isn't saying what's really on his m ind out of fear of a lawsuit. Back when I was younger, particularly if you were interviewing for a job, they felt no, absolutely no qualm s, men or 126wom en, but I was m ostly interviewed by m en, about whether you were planning on getting m arried, whether you were planning relocation with your boyfriend or going to have children or any of those things. You just dealt with it. You didn't have to like it. You just had to figure out how to live with it. I Can Achieve The wom en were using both their self and their bodies to work toward attaining accom plishm ents during young a dulthood. The self, body, and sensation were integrated into a nexus, which allowed the wom en to see them selves as whole, not as separate from their bodies and/or sensations. This was when the wom en fully developed the knowledge th at achievem ent was possible. The wom en knew of them selves with lim its, but learned how to use and push the body to rise above those lim its. They were driven to prove them selves as capable in the world, not only to them selves but to others. It was im portant to show others their ability to pursue and achieve goals, to becom e independent, and to live adventures. As these were accom plished, the will to achieve was reinforced; therefore, the body was pushed further. The Nexus of Self, Body, and Sensation The wom en described them selves as being com fortable and accepting of their bodies during this tim e period. They discussed discom forts that were less severe then previous tim e periods; they were not inundated with negative stim uli. They also had becom e adept at usi ng and controlling their bodies, even as reproductive issues arose. Tabby, age 57 with polio at age 2 years, described the way she felt about herself during young a dulthood. She said, \"It didn't bother m e to know that I had differences in m y body and that sort of thing from other 127people.\" Rosaria, age 63 with polio sin ce age 2.5 years, felt that she and other people cam e to know her as her body over tim e without thinking of her impairm ent. As they were known over tim e as com plete persons, their lim itations or differences were not m eaningful in defining who they were as wom en. I guess they didn't see m e as disabled. I don't know. Because you tend, when you're around som ebody a long tim e, you tend to just, don't notice things like that.... I was able to get around the room . Lots of tim es, I'd misplace the cane. The kids would help m e find it. But I didn't have any pain or anything. Tabby, age 57 with polio at age 2 years, described life as norm al during this tim e period. She said, \"I think m y body was ju st doing all that it could do and have what I would call a norm al life. I was very happy. Everything was fine.\" The experiences of the wom en as uni quely fem ale were discussed during this period in their lives. They said they were using and controlling their bodies as sexual wom en with the possibility of repr oduction. All but one of the participants voiced satisf action with their sexuality during this tim e period despite som e of them having reservations about discussing issues of sexuality. For instance, Sarah was reserved in her discussion of sexuality. Her m other had not discussed such issues with her. She said it was typical of her generation not to know m uch about sex during young adulthood because people di d not talk about it like they do now. Several of the wom en volunteered that they had no com plaints about their sexuality. The advent of the birth control pill ga ve the wom en a sense of control over their bodies. It also gave m any a sense of control over their lives in general. 128Kathy, age 62 with polio since age 2 years, described it as a source of power for wom en. Well birth control, m en always had birth control, wom en never had a method. It gave the wom an a little bit of power in determ ining her destiny, as far as child bearing goes. That was part of your fem inist issue. W e finally had the power to say I can protect m yself too, without just expecting the m ale to be the only one that had som e means of protection. The wom en, who had children, expe rienced few problem s with their pregnancies and labor. Tabby, age 57 with polio at age 2 years, described pregnancy and childbirth as, \"Incredibly, incredibly easy. It's like I'm the express lane for checkout. It's rem arkable. I did have a little trouble with m y sciatic nerve in my left hip. Pregnancy was easy.\" This was not, however, the case for all of the wom en. Miscarriages and inf ertility added a separate layer to perceptions of physical com petency in the wom en's view s of their bodies. Miscarriages were especially difficult for them to unde rstand. The wom en didn't know what had contributed to the events and situational depression was frequently reported. The miscarriages were not perceived to be related to polio. The wom en described them selves as no different then other wom en in reproductive m atters. Judy, age 57 with polio since the age of 1 year, descri bed her depression due to her m iscarriage as situational and not related to her polio experience. The only tim e that I can rem ember really being depressed was when I had a miscarriage. There were four years between m y miscarriage and when my daughter was born and those four years, I was depressed, but that was for other reasons. It wasn't because of m y situation [polio]. Infertility, when children were wante d, was also dif ficult. Betty, age 59 with polio since age 2 years, experi enced prem ature m enopause. Her physician 129assum ed she didn't want children, possibl y due to her disability. She wanted further assistance from her doctor and he r inability to find com fort, explanation, and m edical advice contributed to her di fficulty with not being able to have children. She described being confused when a physician exam ined her body; she didn't know if her body was different in ways not related to polio. But I rem ember him looking at m e when I was laying there, he was just studying m y abdom en, and I had thought, \"W e'll I've never seen naked wom en before.\" And I do have a lot of hair, at that tim e it went from my navel down to m y pubic hair, and I had often wondered do other wom en have that too because with all your m agazines with people in bathing suits they don't have hair there. So I thought m aybe that's an abnorm ality, because he was sure looking at m y abdom en, but I didn't ask him , I wanted to say, \"W hat are you looking at.\" But he didn't say, so I often wondered does that m ean that I had m ore male horm ones in m e or what did that m ean. Overall, reproductive issues were a source of com monality with all wom en, not a source of difference. B ecom ing sexual beings, giving birth to children, and focusing on the body in ways unrelated to their polio im pairm ent was part of being a wom an, not a polio survivor. The only tim e anyone reported feeling different in relation to polio and their sexuality or reproductive abilities was when others, such as health car e providers, suggested or indicated a difference. Proving Themselves as Capable The wom en, capable of using their bodies m ore effectively as instrum ents of their will, were attem pting to prove them selves. They knew of their lim its and considered them as they lived their liv es, but they were determ ined to show them selves and others that they were ab le to m eet their goals. They wanted to 130show that they could do m any of the thi ngs that people without the effects of polio could do. Elizabeth, age 55 with polio since 6 m onths, stated that she would not take a job for Goodwill because she had to say she was disabled to sell products. She said, \"You didn't bring up your handicap or use it as a crutch to throw it out there in front of people. So th erefore, I didn't do it. I wanted to m ake it on m y own in what I considered a norm al environm ent.\" Proving them selves was im portant because the wom en wanted to show that their physical differences did not prevent them from becom ing succe ssful. Janice, age 62 with polio since age 3 years, also described her desire to prove herself. I think I was trying to prove that just because I'm disabled doesn't m ean that I don't know how to do that. I know that m y disability was. I was wanting to prove that I could do it all. I'm not poor, helpless, disabled, whatever. But I don't know where I was getting that from because other than m aybe the influence, again, of the those kids in elem entary school that were so cruel to m e that I kept feeling that I had to prove m yself or that part of the fact that I could do things. I would overcom pensate by doing other things. Some of the wom en stated that their desire to prove them selves was the basis f or being described as Type A personalities. They said they had a drive to do everything to perfection. As Alita, age 65 w ith polio since 1 year of age, stated, \"Som ehow it has to do with, I understand it now, the type A personality. I didn't want to be different from anybody else. I want ed to be different but I wanted to be better. I didn't want to be worse.\" Reinforcing the Will to Achieve Through young adulthood m any of the wom en began to achieve increasing levels of independence and have enjoya ble adventures. W omen who m arried also 131perceived an increased level of independence. They had lef t their f amily of origin to begin their lives with their husbands. Many were traveling, having children and enjoying their independence. W omen who went to college were graduating, starting careers, m oving into their own hom es and or traveling. Antoinette, age 57 with polio since the age of 1 year, desc ribed m oving out of her parent's hom e and buying a house. She stated her m other did not see her actions as those of a \"proper young wom an\", but Antoinette felt it gave her a high level of independence, which she enjoyed. Her m other wanted her to be \"educated but still be a Hispanic wom an who does what her m other says. She never saw the conflict there\", but Antoinette did. Ultim ately, she m oved acro ss the nation for a one year job. This proved her ability to be independent bef ore returning hom e. Jackie, age 62 with polio since 3 years of age, becam e a nurse in the arm y and went to Vietnam . This was a large turning point in her lif e that proved her capable and independent. These experiences fed their m otivation to achieve. Pushing the Body to Accommodate the Will to Achieve As their m otivation to achieve in a \"norm al environm ent\" grew with increasing levels of independence and experiences, the wom en increased their expectations of their bodies. At the same tim e, the wom en decreased their responsiveness to sensory input from their bodies unless it becam e overwhelm ing. Dorothy, age 62 with polio since age 10 year s, described her experience trying to be a superior housewife, which caused her to push herself too far. I would do the washing in the sink. W e were poor when we first m arried. And carry the wet clothes outside and hang them up and iron, I'm telling you. I ironed m y cup towels and pillow cases. I ironed m y old cotton bras. 132You nam e it. I just thought m y little fam ily had to have everything perfect. But then that was pushing it too far I see now. So by the tim e it would be evening or I'd put the kids down for a nap, I would have to usually read to them until they f ell asleep, and either I'd nap with them or I'd get up and just sit in an easy chair. Back then we had a recliner. I could get in and out of one then. I know I couldn't now. At age 29 Beatrice, age 60 with polio sin ce 5 years of age, pushed to m eet the demands of her busy life. She knew she was being hard on herself because she was only sleeping 4 hours per night. I kept falling when I was going to school. I just attributed it to I had two kids, I had a husband, I was going full-tim e to school and I was tired all the tim e. I just attributed all the falling to being so tired because I was horribly tired. I kept falling. Several wom en made statem ents such as, \"a nd I worked real hard to be that. And my body slowly weakened.\" Being Aw are of the Bodies Limits Over tim e the wom en pushed their bodies while evidence of decline began to appear. The evidence was in the form of falling, gait changes, bodily appearance changes, and/or declining en ergy levels. Frequently, the wom en did not notice these changes at the tim e becau se they were not responding to sensory input from their bodies until they were e xhausted or in a great deal of pain. Moreover, the evidence of their declin e was subtle and it cam e on gradually. Some wom en noticed the decline once it was obvious. Fam ily m embers, friends or physicians pointed out the evidence of decline to m any of the other wom en. As young wom en, they responded with strategies to dism iss or overcom e the decline. 133Noticing the Change Changes began to occur in the m ovement of the wom en's bodies, in the energy levels reserved to m aintain thei r activities, and/or in the appearance of their bodies. These changes were attributed to pushing to m eet the dem ands they had placed upon them selves. Typically, the wom en would say, \"There were people that knew m e for a long tim e and then one day they say are you lim ping? If I got real tired, I just couldn't hold it together.\" Judy, age 57 with polio since 1.5 years, found out her gait had changed when she went to a physician. I was having trouble. First of all, he told m e did you know that you're dragging your foot, your left foot? I said, no, I hadn't noticed. So he put me in a plastic brace just halfway to support m y ankle. And the m inute I started using that, I did realize that. Yes, m y ankle had been bothering m e. Addressing the Changes Once the wom en were aware that cha nges were occurring in their bodies, they responded with strategies to either dism iss or overcom e the changes. Som e wom en dism issed the changes by telling them selves that what they were experiencing was com mon to everyone or th at the change was an isolated or momentary problem . Beatrice, age 60 with po lio since 5 years of age, attributed her increased frequency of falls to bei ng clum sy. She told herself, \"And it won't happen again.\" Tabby, age 57 with polio sin ce the age of 2 years, described how she felt after working long shifts at a fa st food restaurant. She knew she was tired but \"everybody was tired at the end of thei r shift\". Sarah, age 61 with polio since age 4 years, described her early experiences as a m other of four and a teacher. She began to have less and less energy with occasional episodes of m uscular pain. 134I think at first you just figure everybody else is the sam e way. You just needed a little m ore rest and slow down for awhile and you'd be alright. When you get to next week and you don't have so m uch to do, and you don't have so m any . . . you don't have to figure grades. You don't have to get report cards out, well then you've got kind of a breather. So you kind of recuperate. During this tim e, it was also im portant not to adm it failure. Injuries or other problem s could be conquered if the wom en tried hard enough. The strategies for overcom ing the problem s were both physical and m ental. Many of the wom en attem pted exercises such as swim ming or walking in com bination with m ind control techniques or self-hypnos is. Deborah, age 59 with polio since 3 months of age described being injured after her husband threw her to the floor. She im proved by exercising on a stationary bike and knowing she would return to her previous life. Joann, age 65 with polio since the age of 12 years, described her efforts to im prove. So I did exercises to that effect. So I stayed hom e that year and he told m e it would take m e eight m onths but I did it in six m onths, four to six months, because I used hypnosis in order to concentrate and focus on the brain. One of the things he would have m e do when we went to his office would be he would pull out the skeleton and he would show what you were doing. In other words, he educated you. And at one point, I knew all the nam es of the m uscles. And then he had a therapist that he would tell and they had pinpointed the exercises and you did that exercise. He gave you about four or five m ore and that 's what you did at night. So it was very intense. Kathy, age 62 with polio since age 12, used mind control techniques to help her and her fam ily. These were strategies th at she learned during the 1960's. She said, \"Another thing about the 60s, you know all those m ind expanding ideas that went on. W e went to a lot of those things. Some are bizarre, som e unique, som e of 135them interesting.\" Kathy found som e techni ques that worked well for her, not just during tim es of change, but throughout her life. I did m ind control. W e all did, all of us, the kids, too. The thing I like about it was that it taught you, that you had the power in your own m ind to make things happen for good or for bad. And you had to decide how to make it good and not to use it to hurt other people. And one of the things that, the little poster things I had, was that every day was getting better and better. You were headed for the positive and if in your m ind you can conceive, you can achieve. And you use techniques to reinforce those ideas. The wom en who perceived decline o ccasionally turned to health care providers during these tim es of change , but f ew were satisf ied with the inform ation they received. Many sought help for falls and injuries, but others were less specific about what took them to see their doctors during this tim e period. Kathy, age 62 with polio since age 12, said \"I just realized I couldn't go as far and do as m uch as I had before\". Do rothy, age 62 with polio since age 10, was offended by the way the physicians she saw talked to her. The doctors around here were useless as far as that. They'd give m e pain pills. One doctor said, \"Now, now Mrs. Doe, you just need a nerve pill, a sleeping pill, a pain pill. I said, \"No, I don't. I want help. I want som ething that will m ake m e better.\" They would give m e shots of cortisone in this hip, and other things. The wom en did not feel that the phys icians they were seeing understood what it was like to age with polio; theref ore, m any were prom pted to seek help from the physicians who treated their po lio as children. Little inform ation was available on the late effects of polio or post polio syndrom e at that tim e. The majority of wom en continued with the m ental and physical strategies that they developed, while others had surgeries to correct problem s such as worsening 136scoliosis. During young adulthood, however, no one quit pushing them selves to fulfill their desired roles. Proving I Can: The Women's Role in Relationships As the wom en journeyed through young adulthood m any of their relationships began to dem and m ore of their tim e and energy. Frequently, the wom en married, and cared for children wh ile m aintaining their hom es and jobs. These relationships were im portant to the wom en. The high value the wom en placed upon their relationships com bined with their need to prove them selves as capable pushed them to give all they could to the people in their lives. Marriage: He got a Good Deal, too. Don't You Think? For som e wom en, the decision to m arry cam e easy. They m arried the first man they dated. Elizabeth, age 55 with po lio since 6 m onths of age, m arried a man she m et and dated in high school. Others dated several m en, but never married. Pauline, age 57 with polio since age 9 years, never m arried but had the opportunity. By the tim e she was a young adult she had decided that m arriage was not for her. There were two or three guys that I dated long enough to kind of, flipped across m y mind, \"Is this som eone I m ight want to m arry?\" But it's just that each tim e it was, \"No, I don't think so.\" Now one of them , I'm still in touch with him occasionally and his wife. But I was absolutely right. I just didn't think that m arriage was going to be in the cards with him as far as I was concerned. Gave him reasons why I thought it would be better for him to go ahead and start dating other people. Pauline also decided that the type of men she attracted were not suitable. She would rather be single then m arry a m an who pitied her. 137I discovered that I tended to attract either one of two different kinds of men. Either m en viewed m e as helpless and they were going to take care of me, strong willed and independent m inded as I have been since I was a small child, that wasn't going to go over very well in m y mind, or they viewed m e as being desperate. They would even say that they were willing to sacrifice them selves to give m e sex, that I wouldn't be able to get it otherwise. Now even if I were desperate to have sexual relations with somebody, I certainly wasn't so desperate that I was going to have it with someone with an attitude like that. Some of the wom en perceived that th ey were considered less capable as wives than wom en without disabilities. This irritated them . It also pushed them to work harder to prove them selves as wives. Betty, age 59 with polio since the age of 2 years, m arried a m an she dated se veral years. She was angered, however, when she perceived that other people thought her husband had done a good deed by m arrying her. Yet, in the back of her m ind she agreed. Well Joe m arried m e and people said, \"That Joe is so good...\" And he is. And I know in the back of their m ind thinking, \"W hy would he want to marry her? \" And I can rem ember a friend one tim e saying, \"Boy that Joe is really a fine m an,\" som ething about him marrying you. And instead of me com ing back saying, \"Yes he did.\" In m y mind I thought, \"Yes, that's true\". But I just cam e back with \"I think he's the one that got the best deal,\" or, \"He got a good deal, too. Don't you think? \" It just m ade m e mad. The wom en who m arried described how they pushed them selves physically to be good wives, which fre quently m eant doing household chores and providing m eals. The wom en were not w ithout any help, Kathy and Joann were able to com e and go out of the work force as needed, and Kathy's spouse and Joann's m aid helped them with househol d chores. The other wom en maintained their own households without assist ance during their young adulthood. Dorothy, age 62 with polio since age 10 years, sa id, \"I cooked everything from scratch. I 138wasn't going to feed m y family canned stu ff. I had a garden. I raised m y own food and I canned it and cooked it.\" The wom en wanted to prove they could m ake a nice hom e for their fam ily. Charlotte, age 57 with polio since age 4 years, was married several years before her husband left her. She rem embered working very hard as a young adult to be the best wife she could. But I did work very hard, working at work and then taking care of the children, and keeping a clean house, m eticulous house, laundry always done, always cooked. I really worked very hard. I always wanted to excel. I always wanted to do the best that I could possibly do and I did it in every thing I did because I wanted to be the best wife and the darn everything else. Despite pushing them selves to be the be st wives they could, they were not spared the possibility of dom estic violence. Four of the wom en interviewed lef t abusive spouses, while two rem ained with spouses who had a history of abusing them . Abusive m arriages dem anded m ore of the wom en than they could physically give. Two wom en left because they could not care for them selves while being m arried to abusive partners; the other two did not leave until their children were threatened. Patsy left an abusive spouse but raised her children in a homeless shelter where she perform ed Ch aplin duties. The wom en who stayed with their abusive spouses did so because they saw few options. After all, none of the wom en wanted to fail at m arriage. Janette, age 65 with polio since age 13 years, was desperate for help but could not find any. She said, \"I took an overdose of Bayer Aspirin one tim e because I thought with m e being beaten up by m y husband I just needed to die.\" One ni ght Janette retaliated and stabbed her husband out of frustration, but she was tha nkful that he survived and eventually stopped his abuse. She com mented, 139Well, this isn't the way you do it... But you know when you need help you didn't know... And you know years ago, wom en suffered a lot cause they were abused by m en and they didn't have any place to go. They had to take a lot of m ess and they didn't have the m oney to take care of their children. They didn't have, I guess the welfare, the food stam ps. So, what could they do but take a lot of this? And they were sick and hurting, hurting inside and having to deal with all that. Caring for Children: Feeling the Guilt, Loss, and Reward Just as the wom en felt the push to pr ove them selves in other aspects of their lives, m any of the wom en felt the push to prove them selves as m others. All but one of the wom en described fond fee lings of children whether it was their biological children or the children of rela tives or friends. As Sarah, age 61 with polio since age 4 years, stated, \"Babies and rosebushes, I'd take any am ount in any condition.\" Patsy, age 69 with polio sin ce age 9 years, stated, \"I raised m y kids. I kept them clean. I put them in church. They went to school every day. I didn't go anywhere if I couldn't take m y kids.\" A few of the m others described f eeling guilty f or not being able to give their children what they perceived as th e sam e experiences as other children who had m others without im pairm ents. Joa nn, age 65 with polio since age 12, knew that her ability to run af ter her children was lim ited. She described f eeling guilty when she lim ited their play because she was trying to m ake a safe environm ent for them . Well, you had to set your m ind that you had to know how you can m ake things safe for everybody. I felt a little guilty. I did feel guilty that m y children couldn't do what other children could. I felt like I m ean, you just couldn't go walk out the door out in the street and.... You had to m ake sure that everything was in a safe environm ent. That I felt very definite and I had to figure how. That you couldn't just... if one of them got hit in 140the head or som ething, you couldn't just run and go take care of it. I do know I did have guilt feelings there, definitely. The wom en used strategies to ensure th e children's safety. Teaching the children to walk early, teaching them self-reliance and independence as soon as possible, and teaching them to respond to their mother's threatening voice were all mentioned as strategies they used. Antoin ette, age 57 with polio since the age of 1 year, taught her children safety by analogy. She drove by a curb and hit a ball too close to the street. She stopped and s howed her boys how easily it could have been them if they had ventured into the street where she could not get to them . The wom en valued their role as m others and were devastated when their children were picked on because their m others had polio. This was som ething the wom en were less prepared to handle. Mart ha, age 57 with polio since age 8 years, described how her son was picked on b ecause she lim ped. He com plained of severe stom ach aches for days before she found out the real problem . Joe liked to be tucked in and so we were in here one night and he stared at me and I said, \"Joe som ething's obviously bothering you.\" And that day he was really bad and he said, \"I can't tell you.\" I said, \"There' nothing on this planet that you can't tell m e.\" He said,\" It'll just m ake you sad.\" And I said, \"Joe let m e worry about what it m akes m e. I think I need to know what it is that's got you so troubled. \"You won't get m ad will you?\" And I said, \"No, I won't get m ad.\" W ell, Donald was picking on him at school. \"Your crippled m other, your gim py m om, worthless m om...\" And Joe was taking it all internally. No m atter how hard the wom en pushe d them selves, not all of their children could be protected. Drugs and mental illness were dif ficult to battle. Charlotte, age 57 with polio since age 4 y ears, adopted a child who was m entally 141ill. The child later turned her aggression toward Charlotte, which she said \"zapped her strength\". Of course by then I had three children, a new born, a six year old, and a seven year old. But what I didn't tell you was she was born with m ental illness. That zapped a lot of m y strength because she was a very high maintenance child to take care of . She was brilliant and sweet, but on the other side she was psychotic and m ean and it was a very difficult tim e. W e had to start taking her to the doctor when she was seven. She was always ....it was a very difficult tim e. She was very hard, very hard... we had a lot of problem s with her, a trem endous am ount. That was very, very hard. So I had all that at the sam e time too. Dorothy, age 62 with polio since age 10 year s, lost her daughter to suicide after she becam e addicted to drugs. The event triggered grief that never eased. Her health began to deteriorate after the event as though her daughter took part of Dorothy when she died. My daughter com mitted suicide. She held a 12-gauge shotgun to her chest and then pulled her shoes off and pulled the trigger with her toe. That is what they determ ined. And us walking in and seeing it. She had called. We were at a friend's house. She asked to speak to m e and then she said, \"Mom ma.\" And I said, yeah? She said, \"Goodbye, I love you.\" and hung the phone up. I don't know if it was instinct or what but I started scream ing. W e got to go hom e. W e got to go hom e. Som ething's wrong. I remember it was in dead of winter. I ran out without m y shoes on. I remember that. You know when you go to a horror m ovie and you see the house and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger. W ell, that's the way ours was. The screen was unlocked. The door was locked. Joe used his key to get in. The door to her room was closed. W e found her laying on the floor with a candle lit and still had tears on her face. It m ade a m ess of her. I started scream ing to Joe. Don't touch her. Many of the wom en pushed them selves to be good m others for their children; som e wom en did not have child ren and strove to be good role m odels for other children. They all took the ro le seriously. The m ajority of wom en interviewed did not have children with m ental illness or drug problem s. Som e 142never m entioned that their children m ay have been teased because they had polio. Those that did described feeling pain becau se all of them pushed to do their best for the children. MIDDLE ADULTHOOD - 1974/1984 TO 1993/2003 With Time the Place Improved During their m iddle adulthood, age 36 to 54, the wom en were becom ing more conscious of the environm ental problem s associated with having impairm ents. They discussed their personal and public environm ent, which affected their work and leisure tim e. It was no coincidence that the wom en becam e conscious of these problem s around the tim e the Am erican's with Disabilities Act of 1990 was passed. None of the wom en were actively involved in lobbying for its passage; they were conscious only of the after effects. The wom en were able to com pare acce ss problem s prior to and after the ADA. Although problem s rem ained after th e ADA, they noticed considerable improvem ent in access at a tim e in their lives when they perceived increased accessibility needs. Elizabeth, age 55 with po lio since 6 m onths of age, began to experience m ore access to public places during her m iddle adult years. \"W e've done Southwest and we've done Am erican Airlines. I don't think years ago that they would have done that. See I even drive now since 1996.\" Elizabeth saw the biggest change in the beach areas where she and her husband like to vacation. It sounds funny to grade it only down there at Port Aransas but Port Aransas is where I've seen it the m ost. I m ean for years, everything is up on stilts because of the hurricanes and stuff. W hat about ten years ago? Well, there weren't that m any restaurants that didn't have steps and that were totally accessible. In fact, there were som e of them that we wanted to 143go in. Now this has been through the years. There have been a couple of times you know when we went to a restaurant [to] see if it's accessible. How do you get in? Well, there ain't nowhere. Having accessibility to travel and busine ss environm ents allowed the wom en to take jobs and prom otions they would not have been able to take years earlier. Elizabeth stated, \"I cam e along a lot further th an I ever really expected. But that is due to the tim es changing, the situations, the ADA.\" Being able to access public places also allowed the wom en to feel apart of their com munity. Janice, age 57 with polio since age 3 years, traveled due to her work responsibility and enjoyed being able to participate in after work activities. I know that there was a m eeting I went to in Boston, and one of the entertainm ent things was to ride on a boat. W ell, we went down to the pier and it was accessible, but the ram ps were real steep. But there were guys who m ade sure that you could get up there. If som ebody was in a wheelchair then they would carry them up. And that was great because then you could enjoy the things that everybody else can and that kind of stuff. Attention to accessibility at work extended into the availability of emergency services. Tabby, age 57 with po lio since age 2 years, described how emergency services changed to ensure that she was saf e. Initially, during an emergency Tabby was required to walk down stairs to safety. \"So I walked down from the sixth floor of that office building and out to m y car, which was parked close-by, but I hurt for three days after. My legs were sore, m y hip joints, m y knees, m y thigh m uscles, everything.\" Later, Tabby was told to wait in the stairwell for the fire departm ent. They knew to go find her and help her out. Although this spared her and others with disabilities from trying to find a way down the stairs, she did feel som e concer n about waiting for the fire departm ent 144during an em ergency. In the end if she need ed to she would help herself to safety. She said, \"W e were not going to barbeque up there on the 6th floor landing. W e were going to go down those stairs.\" Scooters were m entioned for the first tim e during this tim e period. These were used to dim inish the effects of fatigue and provide transportation while being fun for som e wom en. Antoinette noted that the scooters were \"m ore socially acceptable\" when com pared to wheelchairs. They allowed the wom en access to public places if the environm ent was adapted with ram ps and wide electric doors. W hen the environm ent was not adapted further frustration m ounted up. Janice experienced frustration when he r work restroom was not accessible to her in her scooter. And of course som etimes I kind of tease people at work, and say your office isn't com pliant, because it's hard to get into, because I have m y scooter at work and stuff. And whenever I com ment about som ething, because I know the public bathroom s on the floor of our new building did not have a button to open the doors into the bathroom . They had a handle that you turn and the doors were heavy to open. So it was very difficult, especially because I was starting to have m ore problem s, but I kept saying why didn't you put a button on the public bathroom s on our floor? And it was som e sort of like, \"well you know we did on this floor but not on that floor.\" So it took three years before they finally put a button to open and close the bathroom doors. The wom en becam e conscious of their accessibility needs at hom e during this tim e, too. Several wom en designed homes with their accessibility as the prim e focus. The floors were one leve l with no slick surfaces. The doors were wide and frequently sliding. Circular driv eways with large garages that allowed a van to open and a wheel chair lift to com e out with am ple room were incorporated. The cabinets were wheelchai r height as were m any of the light 145switches and other household am enities. Th ese are just a few of the accessibility designs incorporated into their hom es. Disability parking also becam e a focus of the wom en's stories. W hen the wom en used a van with a scooter or electric wheelchair to access a public area they needed am ple room to park and exit with their scooter or wheelchair. Other wom en, who did not use scooters or wheelchai rs, were in need of closer parking to enable them to enter and leave the building without injury or fatigue. Frequently, the wom en were annoyed when people without im pairm ents hindered their ability to park in disability parki ng. Pauline, age 57 with polio since age 9 years, felt strong enough about this issue that she becam e a volunteer ticket writer for parking violations in her city. I'm authorized by the city to write parking tickets and yesterday I wrote five in just under 5 m inutes in that one parking lot. There was one where I think it was a com bination of the way the person had parked. There wasn't as much navigation room as there was supposed to be and the scooter and I were kind of on an angle. I think it was a com bination of the angle and somehow when. .. . I don't think I exactly slid off the seat but I think it was just that as I started to stand up because it wasn't flat, I was a little bit off balance. So I landed on the asphalt and m anaged luckily to get back up on m y feet before I attracted a crowd. I went ahead and put the ticket under the windshield wiper and went on to the next one. The wom en were conscious of how their environm ent af fected their ability to live the lives they wanted to live, both in their personal and public activities. The need for accessibility was discusse d during this tim e period because it affected their work, hom e, and leisur e activities at a tim e when they were experiencing further physical decline. 146Willed to Success but Pushed to Decline It was during m iddle adulthood that m any of the wom en began to achieve success in their lives and careers, but they had pushed their bodies to unquestionable decline in order to achieve their goals. The dem ands of fam ily and work continued and the rewards they received through their achievem ents reinforced the need to push their bodies further. Over tim e, their ability to will their bodies to accom modate the will of the self was disrupted, their senses were inundated with pain and fatigue, and their em otions becam e labile. This was the time of further injury and of other hea lth problem s such as hypertension, diabetes, and pneum onia. Achieving Success The wom en were able to achieve success in their lives for different reasons and in dif ferent ways. W omen, such as Alita and Lena, f ocused on service to their com munities, as well as career success. For exam ple, Lena, age 62 with polio since age 10 years, dedicated herself to her career as a social worker with multiple com munity projects. I've got two that I put up on m y wall right now from when Governor Clem ents was in there because at that particular tim e, we started another group, the literacy classes. W e did so m uch on our own tim e. He, when one of the tim es that he cam e down, we did m eet with him . We took him out to lunch and off the record, away from publicity, newspapers and so forth. W e ordered lunch and we talked a lot. I was in the chair, but I put in 18 hours, the norm al things that everybody else did. Just because I was here didn't m ean I can't do what was there. There are two. I m ean I was going to throw them away and I thought no, I'll put them up for a little bit. They're from '87 when I was still working. I was still working, m y gosh, sometimes until 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock at night. 147Other wom en, such as Sarah, Elizabeth, and Kathy, m easured their success in their lifestyles or in their fam ilies' c ohesion. Elizabeth, age 55 with polio since 6 months of age, began to drive, travel and have new experiences, such as water skiing. The tim e that I can rem ember floating on cloud nine was the tim e when I went waterskiing over there at Sea W orld. It was arranged through the Warm Springs Foundation. I got up the nerve and we went and they had all these volunteers. They had the skiers, of course, from Sea W orld. Then they had all the therapists and all kinds of volunteers and everything and I mean they had every spectrum of people out there. I saw types of ski things like you never would have dream ed. They're going around the lake. But I literally rem ember at work, I was floating on cloud nine, higher than I had ever been. It even beat out Alaska and stuff like that. It was exhilarating. Kathy, age 62 with polio since age 12 years, toured Europe with her husband for 2 years. And then when we went again in 88 to 90. W e were free to do our things. We didn't have to worry about the kids, too. W e had a super tim e, super time. To m e, it borders on a religious experience cause if we saw a beautiful sunset; we could sit there and watch it. W e could find a place by the stream to park the car and watch it and just sit and watch the people, the different cultures, the different languages, the m odes of dress. You could observe. I loved it. Joann and Janice are exam ples of wom en who achieved a great deal of success within their jobs. Joann had two pate nts on inventions and owned a business distributing them . Janice was well known within her work field despite not finishing her college degree. But then also som etimes it's like I do things and whenever I would go to a meeting or a conference and they'd say, \"Oh, I've heard about you.\" And I'll say, \"You have? Good or bad? \" And they'll say, \"Oh, I hear you do such and such.\" I'm thinking oh. Yeah, I do. I m ean a typical exam ple is a several years ago I was asked to be on a National Advisory Board. W ell, 148being on that national advisory board, I was involved with som e very prestigious people across the country. ...All of a sudden, I was getting a presence across the country. No m atter the reason for their achievem ents or the way they defined their achievem ents, these fed their will to do m ore. The self was fulfilled through achievem ent. Af ter all, these wom en were doing what m any 'norm al wom en' were not. During this tim e of achievem ent m any of the wom en recalled feeling at their m ental best. Their m ental well-being was tied to their ability to achieve as well as their ability to put their situati on into perspective. Deborah, age 59 with polio since 3 m onths, described how her insecurities lef t her during this m iddle adult years. She said, \"It stayed with me, I don't have it anym ore, but its taken years and years to...probably when I was in my 40's when I realized what a cool person I was.\" Janice, age 57 with polio si nce the age of 3 years, felt better about her self because the environm ent was beco ming m ore inclusive. For the first tim e, she knew she deserved to be included in work activities. She said, \"Because I kind of thought I deserved that because I shouldn't be excluded.\" The change in m ind set was not reserved to work or leisure related achievem ent. This was also a tim e when the wom en who had previously stayed with abusive spouses described changing their attitude towards their abusers. Janette, age 65 with polio since age 13, stat ed she decided she was not going to let her husband abuse her anym ore. Well, when he would say you have to do this or that. I would say no. He said, \"W ell, if you don't pay the bills we are just going to let them . I said, \"Turn them off! I am not going to do it.\" I just decided I was going to be a 149strong person. I was working just like he was and if he wanted to leave just cause I wasn't doing all the things, he could just leave. Darlene, age 65 with polio since the age of 5 years, described how she learned to adapt to the anim osity she felt towards her alcoholic spouse. During her m iddle adult years, he had quit drinking and she began to adapt to their new relationship. She valued being m arried alm ost 50 years; this was an achievem ent to her. She also loved him . Although he was no longer an alcoholic, he continued to have many verbally abusive, controlling behavior s, which lef t Darlene to work towards acquiring peace in her life, which she described as \"peace at any price\". I think that's the way I can live with it. There's really not anything you can do about the past. If you dwell on it, you're just going to m ake yourself m iserable so I just try to leave it alone back there. Yeah. Peace at any price. Pushing the Declining Body Over tim e, the wom en continued to push their bodies until they could not do it anym ore. The wom en kept going after their bodies had told them they were too tired to continue. Janice, age 57 with polio since the age of 3 years, described how hard she worked during this tim e. My boss cam e to m e, he cam e to m e and he said, \"I need your help.\" And I said, \"Sure.\" Of course I was still working a 10-12 hour day. And he says, \"W e're going to have to do an all nighter to get this done.\" And I said, \"Ok, we'll do it.\" And we did. W e were there for two days, overnight. I m ean we just got food brought into us and we did it. It was a manual process because we had to m eet the deadline. And that satisfaction, I would not have done it any other way. And the weariness and the tiredness that we both felt. The wom en tried to keep going but they had pushed them selves too m uch. Antoinette stated, \"So I f elt it was tr ying to teach, trying to keep up with 150everything.\" Deborah, age 57 with polio si nce 3 m onths, confirm ed this when she said, \"Then m y health really started going down because I was pushing m yself too much. W ell, I was working long hours and not really catching up in m y rest and I was ignoring it.\" They pushed them selves year after year for various reasons. Charlotte, age 57 with polio since age 4 years, stated, \"She always kept saying, 'you need to leave it when you leave the office.' And I wasn't. I m ean I'd wake up in the middle of the night and write things dow n, and so m y whole being was involved in it.\" Som e wom en reported a sense of urgency during this tim e. \"I felt an urgency in the good tim es to do everything that I could do because I wasn't sure when the next bad tim e was going to com e up. It could be any day.\" The wom en pushed them selves until they perceived they had declined too much. Deborah, age 59 with polio at age 3 months, found that she was unable to get up f rom the toilet at work. This revol ution was incredibly dif ficult f or her as she asked a co-worker for assistance. Sh e said, \"It was m ortifying. It was awful mentally. I saw the enem y and it was m e.\" The physical, cognitive, and em otional symptoms indicated to the wom en that their bodies had declined in function. Their ability to will their bodi es to fulfill the will of the self was disrupted, their senses were inundated with pain and fa tigue, and their em otions becam e labile. These sym ptoms interf ered with their ab ility to do activities and m ade them aware of unwanted sensations and feelings. Charlotte described her work at a law firm . I was tired all the tim e and I would com e hom e and just f all across the bed. But at least I was paying the bills. ... But m y body couldn't hold up to and I had several physical collapses. I fell at work all the tim e because my legs would give out from under m e. I had no life, no social life, 151because I'd work, crawl hom e and m ake it no farther than m y big chair. And that's where I would wake up in the m orning. So anyway, it was determ ined that m y body was not holding up. Tabby, age 57 with polio since the age of 2 years, stated she was so fatigued she was f alling asleep at work. Her f atigue continued until she broke her leg then ultim ately retired on disability. I would lose track of what was going on. I, on a couple of occasions, I fell asleep during the conversations and would startle awake. Just nod off and I'd say I'm so sorry. I lost track of what you were saying. Can you tell m e that again? But then on the 25th of October of 2000, I was walking out of the house to go to work and I stepped in a little hole. Like a little flower bed but it's only about eight inches wide on the front step and the driveway and I broke m y fibula. Sarah, age 61 with polio since age 4 year s, described how the pain overwhelm ed her while she was a teacher. You just stayed tired. Then you got to where you did hurt so m uch you know. My hips hurt so bad and m y hands hurt. My neck and m y shoulder hurt so bad . I've tried everything. Even rubbing m y feet with m y left hand. But then if you get to using it a bunch, then that side gets to hurting. Feeling cold deep down into their bones was also described by alm ost all of the wom en. This feeling of being cold could not be relived by the usual m ethods of warm ing the body. It was described as the co ld one feels when they have the flu. The person can apply as m any blankets as they want but the cold f eeling will not go away. For exam ple, Sarah, age 61 with polio since age 4 years, described how she could not warm her extrem ities. I could not get warm and you felt like were kind of stupid sitting out here. I'd finally get to where I would take a bedroll and put it around m e. You've got on a cap and gloves, a coat, and sitting in a bed roll. These other people are sitting out here. They've on their coat and stuf f but they're not cold. I stayed cold. 152Many of the wom en also described em otional changes during this tim e. The exhaustion coupled with not knowing what the exhaustion was from set off numerous em otional reactions. Antoinette sa id she f elt that if she ever sat down, she would never stop crying because ther e \"was never any catching up place to get.\" Deborah, age 59 with polio since 3 m onths of age, was unaware of what caused the em otional changes and that scared her. And I was scared. I was very scared because I cried at the drop of a hat, and I didn't really realize that was exhaustion. I didn't know why I was crying, and it really upset m e that I was crying. That felt funny. But yeah I couldn't control it and it really, what really finally got through to m e, you can't even peel two potatoes in a row with out resting and crying. Rosaria, age 63 with polio since age 2.5 year s, began to have panic attacks as she tried to push her body to continue work while exhausted. It was that I felt like I just didn't have the control that I wanted to have. It was difficult getting things and I don't know . . . and on top of it, I was hurting. By that tim e, I was. Then I started having anxiety you know panic attacks. So it was just the stress and a little bit of everything. With the physical and em otional cha nges, som e of the wom en began to have problem s with cognition. Som e would describe problem s com municating while others stated they had m emory pr oblem s. For instance, Elizabeth noticed that she was turning her words around. So then it went from bad to worse, you know hours. And the fatigue started picking up and I m ean there would be tim es when I'm talking to my manager and I would say, I'd be telling her som ething or other and I look at her. Did I m ake . . . I knew I didn't say it right som ehow. Did I make any sense? Did you understand what I m eant? He said well, it didn't come out right but I know how you m eant it so in other words, it's a case of turning words around. 153Donna, age 56 with polio sine age 5 years, found that she could not concentrate well. She said she cut the lights in her f lower beds when she was trim ming the grass because she could not focus on the task. It was during the tim e that the wom en first described their experiences with other health problem s. The wo men frequently m entioned hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, osteoporosis, and lung disorders. Other diseases that were m entioned were thyroid abnorm alities, pernicious anem ia, m ajor depression, reflux, arthritis, m igraine headaches, m itral valve prolapse, im mune system disorders, breast cancer, dysrhythm ias, and rosacea. Several wom en mentioned having hysterectom ies for unknown reasons. Only two participants m entioned problem s with m enopause. The changes in their bodies were di sruptive but the wom en did not stop pushing them selves to be independent and productive citizens. Janice, age 57 with polio since age 3 years, recognized the difficulties but did not believe she could have done it any differently. It is kind of like, well, what else would I have done? Or would I have felt that I would have done the job right? But there are tim es when I'm hurting physically and I'm just thinking, \"Gees, why did I do this to m yself? \" But I don't know if I'd go back and do it differently. Even m aybe knowing the outcom e, I don't know if I would have done it differently because I was that way. It's just always like how Mother and Dad reared m e. No, they didn't raise m e to say, \"You've got to be the best; you've got to be the winner,\" and that type of stuff. But you've got to take care of yourself and make you own way. The ef forts the wom en put into their liv es were not regretted unless the wom en experienced difficulties at work that they perceived were beyond their impairm ents. 154Some of the wom en did have work related regrets. For exam ple, Tabby, age 57 with polio since age 2 years, desc ribed how she regretted working at a low wage job because it was not worth the effects it had on her body. She stated, \"I was m aking big m oney for som ebody else. That som ebody else didn't care about the little people. Big corporations just don' t, not that m uch. And it's true all over the world.\" Others, like Joann and Antoin ette, regretted their work only because they were treated poorly before their re tirem ent. Antoinette, age 57 with polio since the age of 1 year, described how her em ployer attem pted to rid the school district of all experienced teachers because they cost too m uch. This was upsetting to her because she felt the e ffects of age discrim ination at a tim e when she needed support from her em ployer to continue to work with her increasing im pairm ent. We got the feeling that the principal was serious when he said he wanted young, dedicated teachers. That's a hint. So we retired, six of us did.... But that's not right. Dam aging people's lives. Not recognizing the quality of people that work in your building and honoring them . If teachers don't honor each other, who will honor them ? Becoming Conscious of their Bodies' Needs The wom en realized they had not put their energy towards caring for their self or for their bodies. They had focu sed their attention on their work and families. They had spent years developing strategies to dism iss or overcom e their physical changes. Typically, the wom en kne w there was som ething different with their bodies, but were not aware of what it was or what to do. As Janette said, \"I mostly took care of them and I neglected myself\". Charlotte, age 57 with polio since age 4 years, stated, \"I was conscious of m y needs and very conscious that my needs were not m et. That tim e to me was a tim e of just getting through the 155day.\" This changed when the wom en stoppe d the activities of their daily lives so that could becom e com pletely conscious of and attentive to their bodies' needs. The wom en becam e conscious of thei r bodies needs because they could not achieve their will without their bodies. They recognized that their bodies were instrum ental in their lives. Beatrice, age 60 with polio since age 5 years, stated, \"Well, it pretty well gets to the point you just can't. W hen you can't walk from one room to the next, you can't. You break in a sweat. You just can't. You have to figure out that you're going to have to listen to som ebody besides yourself. I had to give in.\" Responding to their Bodies' Needs The wom en responded to their bodies' needs by decreasing their social activities, increasing the help they received from others, increasing their use of assistive devices, seeking help from post polio groups and specialists, and eventually m any retired from work. These responses were gradual and not without consideration. The need to continue to work despite their physical changes required that the wom en quit their social activities. Fo r exam ple, Janice, age 57 with polio since age 3 years; quit her com munity c hoir activities because of her declining abilities and dem anding work. They had the Com munity Choir. I tried out for that and becam e a part of that and really enjoyed it that one year that I was with it. But then the post- polio was starting to set in and it was too hard on m y job. I was working a 60 hour work week on m ore of m y own volition and trying to keep up with the com munity choir so I had to drop com munity choir. I had to drop community choir. 156Deborah, age 59 with polio since 3m onths of age, stopped doing activities around the house then her husband started doing th em. She said, \"It was like I can't. I stopped doing things just a little at a tim e and Joe would take up the slack and not say anything. It was like honey, I just can't do that today.\" By this tim e more inform ation was being distributed on post polio syndrom e (PPS). Many wom en sought out th e help from experts who m ight know how to help them with their sym ptoms of PPS. Others diagnosed them selves and sought help from other polio survivor s who knew about PPS. Antoinette, age 57 with polio since the age of 1 year, described her first encounter with a physician who was an expert in PPS. She was told she needed to retire and start using a wheelchair, which was not what she want ed hear. She and others would have preferred a cure. Research indicates is what they said. Research indicates. That was like wow, that's awful negative. Are you sure about that? They thought I should have a wheelchair and I should quit m y job and I should get them to take care of the children. Apply for all these social program s and I wasn't ready, Tracie. I just thought I was tired a lot and so after listening to that, I just started reading about it and I figured well, I'll go as long as I can. Tabby, age 57 with polio since age 2 year s, sought her inform ation from other polio survivors. She said, \"I had noticed that. You know that was at work. I just didn't have the stam ina, and frankly, I had been finally reading stuff on the internet about post polio. W ell, I've go that . I didn't know that's what that's from . Is that what I've got? \" Tabby responded by following the advice she learned from other polio survivors. 157 The wom en began to use m ore assistive devices when they felt the need. Some took the advice of health care provi ders or other polio survivors and bought the devices, but they did not use them until they saw the need. Antoinette, age 55 with polio since the age of 1 year, bought a scooter after being advised by her physician and realizing the tax credits she could receive when she purchased her vehicle. She described her experience when she selected her first scooter. I kept saying I'm not going to be sitting in it. W hat dif ference does it matter if it's a cushiony seat? It's going to be in the back of the car. So m y final word to him was I'm going to buy it, but I don't want it and he says okay and he put it in. He put in the lift. They m ade sure the lift was in a position so that I could use it. I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, put it in. Okay, that's great. I just took off. In all honestly for about a year and a half, it just bounced around in the back of the car. Eventually, the wom en used the assistive device that they felt helped them . Then over tim e the assistive devices they used would change as secondary problem s occurred because of how thei r bodies m oved with the use of the assistive devices. For exam ple, Alita de scribed how her body changed due to the use of different lifts in her shoes. What happened was and what I know now is when you have walked a certain way for 50 years of your life, you cannot change m y gait. Because when you change m y gait, it's going to show up in som e way. So they were forcing m y knee to change m y gait, by anything they did. W e don't know if the slipped disc cam e as a result. I think there was one thing they found out that was a result of the lift. They found that there was som e damage done where m y hip hit on that ball, when it com es around from my hip down to m y leg. It had pushed the bone up to the point that it's straight and there was som e dam age done there. The changes in their bodies due to the use of their assistive devices led the wom en to adapt with the use of different devices. For instance, wom en described using a m anual wheelchair or canes until their arm s and shoulders becam e 158weakened and painful from lifting their bodies. They would change and use an electric scooter until their shoulders were worn from being extended outward to steer the device. They would ultim ately m ove into an electric wheelchair because the arm s could rest while the hands m anipulated the joy stick control. The question of whether or not to retir e from work, at hom e and/or office, in order to prevent further decline wa s not an easy decision for m ost of the wom en. Only Elizabeth found it to be an eas y decision; she wanted to spend m ore time with her husband. Others debated the im pact of the decision. Did they have enough m oney or benefits to live into the future without working? Did they think they were of the appropriate age to l eave the work place? W ould they m iss the social interaction they had at work? Does my employer want m e to retire? Could I continue to work and take care of m yself? These were am ong the m ost com mon questions they asked of them selves. Sarah, age 61 with polio since age 4 years, described how she arrived at the decision that it would be a good idea to quit her teaching job. She felt that by not working she would have the tim e to care for herself m ore because she would always push herself at work as a teacher. If you have a job and especially the way we were raised and stuff, you do that job and you do it right and not only that, especially teaching school where you're dealing with kids, it needs to be done. You can't just slack off. You can't just let or I didn't think you could just let them go and you just . . . It needed to be for the kids' sake. It needed to be done that way. You needed to be there. So, not working just kind of gives you the freedom if you get up and you feel all that bad, unless it's som ething that absolutely has to be done or even then, you just kind of do enough to get you by on instead of thinking it had to be the whole. 159Pauline, age 57 with polio since age 9 y ears, described how she debated retiring. She was a single wom an and that m ade the decision a bigger risk for her long term future, but again the needs of her body won out. And if you'd have told m e I would have had to quit working by the tim e I was 38, I would have thought you were crazy. On the other hand, I got to thinking about it one tim e. I said well, they replaced m e at this place with 2.5 or three people and they replaced m e at that place with 1.5 people. In full-tim e equivalent, I've already put in alm ost my 20 years that they usually think of as a career. I had som e money in savings and then it helped when I went on Social Security Disability. It's still worrisom e but I'm lucky that I already own m y hom e but it's still scary. It's just how am I going to be able to m anage? I knew that if I really needed m oney, m y brother would help and m om probably would. She m ight m ake m y life hell if she did but I thought well, that could be okay. Martha, age 57 with polio since age 8 years, left her job as a scientist at the age of 39. W hen she retired she devoted herself to her fam ily and her health, but when she was em ployed she was m ade to feel badl y for trying to do that and work at the same time. I actually had the next to the last guy I'd work with had written m e up because I was getting reluctant to work the late hours and he thought I ought to be put in another job. And I have the item som ewhere around here that he wrote m e up because I was wanting to put fam ily and m y personal health ahead of the job. Needless to say you don't wait for someone at work to say, \"I think you ought to quit\", you go ahead and take care of it. So, I was actually 39 when I walked off the job. Threats from Increasing Dependency The wom en responded to their bodies' needs and these responses gave their bodies rest, but the responses al so threatened their perceptions of them selves. It threatened who they were raised to be from the tim e they were children. W hen the wom en donned their br aces and other devices, they again 160donned their childhood sym bols of disabilities. It m ade them question their ability to live the life they believed they were ra ised to live\u2014independently. Judy said, \"I was very unhappy when the doctor told m e I was going to have to go back into a brace. That I did. I cried for a couple of days over that.\" Rosaria, age 63 with polio since age 2.5 years, had pride in using a cane through her young adult years so when she was faced with using crutch es again, she knew she did not want to return to her past levels of dependency. That was one reason when I was working that I knew I had to do something because I knew I was having problem s but I was afraid to go to crutches because I knew once I went to the crutches, I would becom e dependent and I wouldn't be able to go back. Their responses to their bodies threaten ed their present view of them selves because it threatened their perceptions of their ability to perform roles. Antoinette who quit her job for reasons related to her body and her working conditions described her am bivalence towards the retirem ent. Everybody else is retired. That was just a strange feeling, a special group, but a strange feeling. I'm not sure if I'm used to it yet. I'm really getting off to the part about not having to go to work and not having to deal with the pressures of being a teacher but I'm not sure I'm ready to lose m y identity, as you know, like in fact, I still say I'm a teacher. The wom en felt the changes threatened their present identity because they did not want other people to redefine who they we re as wom en. For exam ple, they did not want others to def ine them as being ill or sick. Rosaria said, \"I didn't want people to say, \"Oh, well, you know she's... I don' t know. She's sick.\" The wom en were certain they were not ill. Finally, it threatened their future becau se it left them questioning who they would becom e and how they would be treated. They valued being independent 161and did not want anyone to feel sorry for them . Lena, age 62 with polio since age 10 years, said it best. I've never liked it when everybody would treat m e special just because I'm here. [In a wheelchair] No, if I don't feel sorry for m yself, then nobody is going to. I have no use for you. I'm sorry. Go feel sorry for somebody else or feel sorry for yourself. But don't treat m e special because I'm here. No. Charlotte questioned her decision to quit her work. She was having problem s falling at work because of fatigue and in stability. She m arried a wealthy m an that insisted she stop working, but after his d eath she m oved in with friends because she was left with nothing. We didn't have a prenuptial; I had given up m y job, and m y insurance and everything when we m arried. I was hesitant to give up m y job and m y security in that, and he was a very wealthy m an. And he said it's silly f or you to work. I want you to be able to travel with m e. I had som e counseling from different people and I finally did give up m y job when I married him . It was a fear thing, I m ean m e wanting to keep m y little thing over here so I'd be safe and I finally knew that if I m arried him I needed to trust him all the way so I did. So, I ended up with nothing. Most wom en who were m arried benefite d from being m arried when it cam e tim e to retire. Their husbands' incom e and bene fits provided for them , too. Alita said that she was unable to save while a single mother because her teacher's salary was not enough. She lived m onth to m onth. After her m arriage she was able to retire and live com fortably, som ething she would not have been able to do if she had not married. Caring for Aging Parents The wom en frequently told stories of caring f or their aging or ill parents during their m iddle adult years. These activities were stressf ul for the wom en 162because it required they balance caring fo r their parents with the usual activities of their lives. Som e were working duri ng the tim e their parents needed them . Rosaria described how her life at this tim e becam e a vicious circle. Anxiety attacks, yeah, anxiety, yeah, because I was working. I had the apartm ent. I was working. Then after work, I'd com e and pick up m om and go see dad until about 7:00 and then go back hom e and do lesson plans or grade papers or whatever and it was a vicious circle. But like if anything happened at the nursing hom e, they'd call m e first. Several tim es they'd call, he fell or he whatever, he's crying or whatever. So it was very stressful. Those last years dad was in the nursing hom e, it was real . . . on all of us. Or they'd call m om and I finally told them , don't call her because she gets upset and she has no way of getting there. Oh and then there was a period where he would call... He'd ask us, \"W hen are you taking m e hom e?\" But then som e days he would call and he would cry. It was very difficult for all of us. Then she'd worry and we knew we couldn't really do m uch except go and see what the problem was. It is unclear why the responsibility to care for their parents fell to the wom en. Many had siblings that could ha ve helped. Rosaria adm itted that she resented trying to care for her father while she was trying to work. She had a sister that was not as helpful. Rosaria said, \"There was a period where I kind of resented it. W hen I was working because I was working and then I had to worry, take care of everything here. I kept thi nking wait a m inute. She could do it just as well as I can.\" Despite the occasional feelings of resentm ent many of the wom en wanted to or felt an unbreakable obligation to car e for their parents. For exam ple, Candice also took care of her m other during this period. W hen asked why she felt it important to care for her m other who ha d Parkinson's disease she said, \"W ell, because she was m y mom. She had a tough marriage with m y dad. I just felt like it was m y responsibility and it just felt like I had to do it, needed to do it.\" Darlene 163felt a very sim ilar way when she said, \"But I was with them both when they died, that was im portant to m e.... I guess to say I've done all I can do.\" LATER ADULTHOOD (NOW ) - 1994 TO 2004 Expecting More from the Time and Place The wom en were living in Texas during a tim e of rem arkable progress in society but despite the progress the wom en believed that m any of the details that could have m ade life better were overlooked. Many of the wom en had access to the internet and to disability transporta tion; m any places were accessible now that were never accessible to people with disabilities in prior tim es. The difficulties, however, were in the details that were overlooked. Retrofitted buildings did not always consider the needs of people with disabilities, and m any wom en were segregated into unwanted areas when going to the m ovies, traveling, or attending school events. Buildings rem ained difficult due to slick floors, narrow walk ways, steep ram ps, low toilets, and unm anageable doorways. Frequently the wom en were prevented from enjoying activities such as shopping with children or friends. It was the tim e of the internet, which m any wom en took advantage of during their tim e at hom e. The wom en used the internet for shopping, inform ation, and com munication with friends. Sarah described why it was important to be able to gain inf ormation from sources such as the internet provided. I think where used to you thought like the doctor or whatever was the authority. The teacher was the authority, and in m ost cases, they probably did know a lot m ore than anybody else to now there's so m uch out there and so m uch m ore that if you don't know. That's when... if you don't have a little bit of knowledge of what you need to ask, need to know, 164you're really stuck like going to the doctor or anything else. So I think you've got to know. You've got to do a little m ore for yourself. Be a little more responsible for yourself because there is so m uch m ore knowledge there. I didn't think I would forget but the am ount of inform ation that's available to us now that wasn't. It just overwhelm s you of how m uch is out there. There's no way one person anym ore can know all of that so you've got to know for yourself. I think you've got to. Patsy used the em ail daily; she had creat ed a Christian website. She said, \"I wasn't on line Saturday at all and Sunday afternoon when I got on, I had something like 255 or som ething. Not junk m ail. It is regular em ails.\" This filled her days when she found little else to do b ecause she had m oved in with her sons where she found herself alone a lot. She also had difficulties with transportation. The wom en who lived in urban areas were fortunate because they frequently had access to transportation designed specifically for people with disabilities. The wom en had to apply f or the service with an application and letter from their physician validating their im pairm ent. The bus system s could be contacted to pick-up the wom en at their homes at a specific tim e then they would be assisted to the bus. The bus would take them to their desired destination at a low fee. Later, the bus would take th em back hom e. Urban areas were also equipped with taxis with lifts designed for wheelchairs or scooters. Few could routinely afford to pay a taxi though. These services were very im portant to m any of the wom en; however, m any wom en in rural areas were without sim ilar resources or services. Resources were needed in order to re main socially active during this tim e. For exam ple, Pauline needed two different vehicles to accom modate her wheelchair and scooter depending upon where she was going. 165 I got one of those (Buick) to replace a '79 Pontiac. There's a hoist in the back end of the Buick that will attach to either side of the seat so I could put the wheelchair in the back of the Buick. Then I also have a '96 full- sized Ford van and it's got lift equipm ent things on it for the scooter. So I have options. The scooter is great if I'm going shopping and stuff like that but if I'm going out for dinner or som ething like that, I'm probably going to load the chair in the back of the Buick. I do have to walk and stand to load and unload the chair but m ost of the tim e, that's what I'd rather do. If I just really don't think I want to be standing and walking then I'll just go ahead and use the scooter. It'll pick m e up and deposit m e inside the vehicle and all I have to do is transfer to the driver's seat and I'm on m y way. I can't put the chair in the van, in the full-sized Ford van. I can only put the scooter in the Ford van. If the wom en were unable to obtain these types of costly resources, they were unable to rem ain active, especially if they lived in rural areas where disability public transportation was not available. Difficulties were also reported when buildings were retrof itted f or people with disabilities. The wom en appreciated that people were attem pting to change their public buildings to give them access; however, they were frustrated when an accom modation was present that did not work. Pauline noted that, You just never know a place m ay say that it is handicap accessible and maybe it is and m aybe it isn't, and that's just so m uch effort...the logistics are just so m uch m ore com plicated than they would be if we didn't have this to deal with. But there are f acilities available now that weren't available back when I was a child. For exam ple, ram ps that are too steep cannot be walked up or ridden up. Alita said, \"I can't do that. My leg just... because it just doesn't com e off the ground very m uch. It's just hard. You have to r eally lif t it to go on a ram p and slant. I end up pulling up from my hip to get it up so if it's a ram p, I try not to do it.\" Janice described her problem with retrof itted bu ildings when she went to an older building looking for a restroom she could use. \"And I got up, went to go use the 166restroom , and of course, not all bath room s are ADA com pliant. So, you have to find one that is, you know because they're appropriately m arked.\" The wom en knew they needed to plan in extra tim e when trying to go som ewhere. It was never a good idea to wait until the last m inute to use the restroom . The wom en thought it would be nice if people with disabilities were consulted before retrofitting an old building. On several occasions the wom en not ed that som e places were accessible but once inside the buildings other pr oblem s occurred. Many wom en stated they were placed into special holding areas fo r people with wheelchairs. Deborah was escorted off a plane and her wheelchair was put into a sm all holding area facing the wall. She was told to wait until her ne xt flight. Needless to say she rebelled and began to tour the airport. Elizabeth critiqued the seating in m ovie theatres. But then I realized after a couple of years. See I wasn't getting the surround sound because I was sitting underneath it. And people were putting all their baby carriages there. So, finally one tim e I discovered how much greater the sound. I'd just go down to the... I m ean I'll do it at any place. But I'll just go down the isle where there's an end seat and I just nudge 2/3 of m y chair in. Yes, I stick out in the isle but even though it's a neighborhood theater, they've never, ever told m e I couldn't do that. It's a little dark. People com e in late, they m ight trip over the back of the chair a little bit but nobody has ever com plained. They don't tell m e anything. So I really don't care to sit at the back. One tim e I went to another theater. They had talked about wheelchair accessible. Yea, yea and they had m e down in front. I said no way. W ell, I sat through that one but never again. Judy had difficulty with being placed into a service lift, which put her on display for everyone to see when she went to her daughter's school recital. The lifts were difficult to m anage, m ade her dependent upon an operator, and em barrassed her because she was displayed in a noisy lift. 167I said, \"Have you checked to see if it's accessible for m e?\" She said, \"Oh, yeah. There's som ething, there's som ething.\" And the som ething turned out to be a lift. I hate lifts. Now, I won't go anywhere where there's a lift. I had to get on this lift and it sort of puts you on display and I hate that part of it. The lift m akes so m uch noise that wherever anybody is, they're going to turn around and look. I thought well, this is awful. They even have a class of . . . they have handicapped kids that are all in electric wheelchairs. Som e are electric and som e are push and som ebody has to push these kids. They can't do it them selves. How could they possibly do something like that when they have all these kids? Now granted, their classes are probably on the bottom floor but at som e point in tim e, you know these kids have to get upstairs for som ething. Other problem s occurred when the wom en would try to visit friends or family. Many friends and relatives did not have hom es that were accessible. The wom en found them selves no longer able to go to private parties because they could not get in the hom es. Betty would drive up to her sister's house and her sister would com e out to sit in the car so they could talk. Joann described how she would go sit in her friend's yard but was una ble to go in her hom e. In a tim e of so many accom plishm ents and conveniences the details that m ake life attainable for wom en with disabilities were being overlooked. Focusing on the Body As the wom en discussed their current lives, they told of focusing m ore upon their bodies. Their bodies were tired a nd in pain, which dem anded that they direct their attention to the physical as pects of being alive. They could not consistently control their bodies in th e way they had in earlier years. They enjoyed life by attending to their bodies while taking advantage of what their bodies could offer them through their senses and their m inds. 168The wom en described their pain w ith great detail. Many had m ultiple types of pain in different locations. Pauline described the pain as sim ilar to the muscle aches m any people feel after exercising for the first tim e, except the ache is 10 tim es m ore intense and lasts 10 tim es longer. Som e wom en had pain only when they were active, while others had continual pain. Judy described the experiences of having four different type s of pain in her thum b, shoulder, knee, and back. W hen we last spoke, her pain rem ained in her knee. Well, I have the pain in this knee. That it is, well, it is right above the, like below the knee cap, just barely above it. I guess it is where m y leg hyper extends. It is where the tendons, the m uscle, whatever, touches the, m aybe there is nothing there. So it is bone touching bone. I don't' know but it is. It is just a sharp pain but the m inute I am off of it the pain is gone. You would think it would linger but the pain is gone. Dorothy had continual pain that she took daily m edications for without relief. She said, \"I'm in terrible pain, today being one of them . ...I knew there would be pain but not like this.\" It worsened when she tried to go to bed. In the following text, she described her feelings of pain when she tried to go to sleep. Usually by 5:00 [pm ] I'm ready for a lay down because by then I'm in quite a bit of pain. Then we lay down and then the battle is on because of scoliosis. It just takes several hours for m y body to relax enough for sleep but I've got a hospital bed. The top com es up and the leg part does, too. So I have to keep it up like that and just gradually lower it as m y body will straighten out, the m uscles straighten out. Kenneth does m y . . . has to do my good leg. W hen I'm laying there with just the feet part up, he pulls it straight up in the air for that sciatica nerve and oh, that helps so m uch. Usually we don't get out of bed except for to go to the bathroom . I use m y walker. He helps m e get out of bed. I use m y walker. I have a potty chair and he holds on to m e. Darlene had severe pain that led her to have an elective am putation of her leg. The leg that was not im paired because of po lio had developed severe osteoarthritis, 169which was painful. She debated the am putation for several m onths. Then decided it was the only way to deal with it. She described how disappointed she was when the pain returned to other parts of he r body after her attem pt to perm anently rid herself of pain. Severe pain. I couldn't stand up. I couldn't sit. I couldn't lay . I just had to rotate all the tim e. And then I had the surgery and it was quite successf ul and I went about five years with nothing else. Then like I said, it was just snowball. I've had two surgeries on each shoulder, two on this hand, and two on this hand. I had four on that foot and then they am putated. They made two revisions on the am putation, another back surgery, m y neck three tim es. So it's just been constant orthopedic. The pain forced the wom en to focus on their bodies needs, which m eant decreasing their activity and trying different pain therapies. Darlene used a m uscle stimulator at all tim es, as well as, m ultiple pain m edications. Judy had been to a physical therapist several tim es. Martha st ated that her pain had im proved after she began to take m edications f or her arthritis. Nowhere near like I did. I m ean when I saw m y internist in the end of March when we were talking about what to do and which one of the medications or whatever their m agic acronym is for the stuff like Enbrel, and I had been on . . . we were talking about what I was taking. I was taking Vicodin two of them at a crack four tim es a day. Yeah, I don't have near the pain I had. I have taken Vicodin again but not on a regular basis. Basically, I'm not in pain per se it's just I'm lethargic. Weakness and fatigue were freque ntly reported problem s. Cindy had noticed that she was losing m uscle m ass. She said, \"It didn't start getting weaker until I started losing m uscle m ass. It was weak but it never was that weak. Lif ting my arm s to turn the air conditions on, lifting a skillet, I don't dare do anything with this hand.\" The wom en found it difficult to express what the fatigue felt like, except that it was overwhelm ing. Pauline sa id it was like recuperating from being 170bounced around in a cem ent m ixer truck. Charlotte described how the fatigue would hit suddenly and felt like all her blood was drained from her body. Oh, here's an exam ple. This is . . . I m ost wom en . . . older wom en my age will understand this. But you know how wom en will need to go to the bathroom to urinate but they will be able to hold it for a long tim e? But then there com es a point in their life when all of a sudden without any warning boom you m ade a big m istake by holding it that long. But you had no warning and it felt just the way it always felt before when your bladder was full. But you knew you had a certain am ount of tim e before the sphincter just totally wouldn't let you hold it anym ore. But when you get to a certain age, you don't have that control so it's like that, but you don't have a warning either. It's like that. It was like that. I still did everything like norm al. Still had the norm al feelings. W hen used to, I could m ake it until I got hom e or I could m ake it until I could get into a situation where I could rest. But then all of a sudden it started happening where boom . I didn't even have that prerogative, just everything went. Like som ebody has drained all the blood out of your body period. Controlling parts of their bodies was problem atic for several of the wom en. This was especially difficult when they were being assisted by other people. It m ay be expected that people can control where their extrem ities go while they are being lifted or m oved from one position to another. This was not the case for four participants in the st udy. Elizabeth described how her inability to control her leg m ade her vulnerable to injury because of her osteoporosis. And m y legs are the m ost sensitive. They're really the m ost sensitive because I have the least am ount of control. If som eone is lifting m e, you know I've got to m ake sure m y legs don't get bent the wrong way because I know if they would break, they'd never heal. That's m ainly the issue. When som ebody is lifting you, you know, you don't realize it. Most people have som e control. I'll put m y legs like this just so I'll have to pull over this one to keep it from getting som ehow . . . if som ething is too lim p, it can get left behind som ewhere. Believe it or not getting into vehicles and cars and dashes and seats and stuff like that, it's not real easy. It's not easy on the person lif ting either but still. 171Balance was another problem for the wom en, and it caused them to focus their attention towards their bodies. This was a frequent cause of falls so the wom en knew they could not dism iss th e problem . Patsy had a problem with balance and did not want to injure hersel f, especially her arm s. She said, \"Lord, don't let m e fall and injure this right arm again so I can't take care of m yself. I can't reach anything, nothing with this le ft arm . I can't take care of bodily functions with it because it won't reach.\" Charlotte had problem s with balance, too. She tried to help her daughter wash her dog, but fell when she lost her balance. The fall left her feeling useless and vulnerable. I mean it doesn't take anything. It takes nothing to m ake m e lose m y balance so I just fell straight back. Just full body straight back on m y back and I knew I was going to hit m y head, the back of m y head on the concrete. So I used m y neck as best I could to try to hold m y head up and my head did hit but not as hard at it would have. But in the process, I whip lashed m y neck. Anyway, I started crying like a baby and ran in the house. I didn't run but I m ean I went in the house. W ent and got in m y bed you know like it was going to go away. My arm s were bleeding and stuff like that. Finally, several of the wom en described breathing problem s. Jackie used a device to assist her breathing at night, which relieved her problem s. A year ago, however, when she was having the m ost difficulties with her breathing she thought she would not live m uch longer. Elizabeth said her breathing problem s were brought on by hum idity and eating too m uch. Not as a rule unless I, believe it or not, overeat. If we go out to eat and I eat too m uch, well, then that m akes it harder to breathe. The fatigue usually would m anifest itself in m y breathing. If it got hard to breathe, then that's where I would notice it the m ost. 172 The wom en were focused upon their bodi es, but that did not m ean they were without enjoym ent. The body could provide pleasurable stim ulation along with the noxious. Charlotte would go to a c hurch m ade of logs so she could touch and sm ell the logs, pleasures that m any people take for granted or do not consider embracing. Sometimes I'll drive down there if the day is pretty and the church is closed, of course, and it's not because it's a church that I go down. It's because it's like it's in the m ountains and it's these logs. Beautiful, very beautiful. I'll sit on a log outside of it and just look at it and look at the sun coming down, the rays com ing down through those pine trees. Som etimes I'll go up and em brace the log and sm ell the sm ell of a log. It rem inds m e when I used to be able to travel to the m ountain several tim es a year. W e loved log cabins and fires in the fire places there and stuff like that. The smell of the pine needles and all that, so I do that every once in awhile. I think it's strange. If som eone cam e up and saw m e hugging the side of a log, but it's not because I'm hugging it to get a hug. It's just because I'm hugging it so that I can feel it and sm ell it, and you know it takes m e back in tim e. I like it. I appreciate it a lot and it resem bles som ething dif ferent to me than I'm sure alm ost anybody else that drives up there. Many of the wom en continued to enjoy va rious activities, such as sex, gam bling, and boating. For instance, Dorothy a nd her husband would enjoy sex with caresses and with the occasional sexual ba nter. Betty said her sex life was very good. Kathy and her husband would go gam bling at a m oments notice. They also enjoyed traveling whenever they coul d. Jackie would go boating because she loved it. Because I want to do it. I've got that boat sitting out there. I no m ore need that boat than I need a hole in the head but I've always wanted one and I've got it. Its three years old now a nd only has, I think, 40 hours on it. If it goes out f ive tim es a year, that's been a lot, but it's there and it will be there. I'm not going to sell it. 173The wom en were focused on their bodies but that did not m ean they could not enjoy the pleasures of their senses. Working to Do the Simple Things Rosaria def ined disability as the need to attend to the details that other people took for granted. Lena believed that everyone had a handicap of som e sort or another. She added that, \"There's many things that you cannot do that other people can do but that should not br eak you down.\" These com ments seem ed fitting as the wom en discussed the way thei r ability to attend to the details becam e more challenging. The wom en's bodies were changed by age and polio but enabled by creativity. They figured out ways to do what was needed. The wom en told stories of being able to attend to m ultiple things at once. After all, m any took on m ultiple roles th roughout their lives. Now they found that they needed to focus on one task at a tim e in order to get it right. Of ten, that task was som ething m any took for granted, such as getting dressed. The detail of getting dressed in the m orning was a challenge for several of the wom en. The ability to will the body to ac tion was im paired so willing it to get dressed was a challenge. For instance, telli ng a leg to lif t upward so that the arm s could put on pants or a brace was difficult. Often tim es, their legs were heavy and the brace even heavier. The weakness and pa in would cause them to hesitate and the experience of getting dressed woul d becom e a lengthy endeavor. Janice described how it took effort for her to dress in the m ornings. First of all, a typical day, when I get up in the m orning, is it takes m e 2 hours to get ready to leave, because it's difficult for m e to m ove around. But I'll wake up around 7 o'clock, of course I'm very fatigued now, and 174especially with m y back injury, that it som etimes...to m ove to start moving in the m orning with m y arthritis and m y back injury it is very difficult to get around. But I get up, sit up, get the nerve up to get up and go to the bathroom ; of course, I have to go to the bathroom , go sit on the toilet. Because I don't have m y brace on, that walking into m y bathroom , the 6 feet that it is I guess to get there is difficult. I have to take a step at a time and hold onto the supports that I have and everything. Go to the bathroom and then get in the tub, and I have a shower seat that I use in the bathtub. If I don't have a shower seat I can't take a shower because I cannot stand up anym ore. So that's an effort, to get up, to stand up, to sit down on the shower seat and swing m y legs in and then shower. And then it's generally about 20 m inutes from whenever I go into the bathroom to when I'm through with m y shower, dry off and then walk back to the bed to rest. And then I'll rest there kind of cooling off, or just resting, I don't know, it can be 10 to 15 m inutes, or it can be 30 m inutes or m ore. ...My legs are heavy, so that's anther effort too, but it is. It's just an effort to get everything done. In fact, I happened to see... I think it was a TV show, not very long ago where they were showing a paraplegic who was dressing himself. And I was watching and I thought that's m e, you know, because we can't just jum p in; put our feet and legs in our slacks, or feet in shoes and stuff like that. It's just a very m ethodical thing. The other thing too is putting m y brace on, if I'm in a different environm ent, if I'm on a different bed, a different height of a bed, or sitting in a doctors office redressing, its very difficult to put a brace on, because I have to have a certain height a certain ability, because I have to lie back to do certain things. So getting dressed is an effort. Others reported dif ficulties with things like com bing their hair or putting on makeup. Dorothy would no longer wear m akeup because it was too difficult. She needed the energy for other things in her life. Judy said she cut her hair off short because she couldn't com b it anym ore. Problem s with willing their bodies to action required their m inds to find solutions for doing tasks that m any take fo r granted. It was essential to recognize the changes in their bodies and to work with those changes to find solutions so that life could continue. Lena describe d how she found a creative way to com b her hair once she could not lift her arm s to her head anym ore. 175Let's see if there's som ething we can do about it. So, if I'm not going to be able to lift up m y arm or a leg like I used to, well, let's find an easier way to do it. Let's try anyway. Like m yself now, it's hard for m e to com b my hair the way I used to. W ell, because m y up-reach it's harder for m e so what . . . I looked at m y dresser. I have a big jewelry box there on m y dresser and it's about oh, so high. I would say about one foot, two feet high. So I put it there. I raised m y arm and put m y elbow on top of the jewelry box. That raised up the arm to the level of m y hair so now I'm able to com b my hair but all I have to do is put m y arm a little bit higher. Look for solutions. It was typical f or the wom en to say thi ngs such as, \"Don't tell m e I can't, I m ay not be able to but that doesn't m ean I can 't.\" In other words, the wom en realized their bodies had lim itations that could not be pushed anym ore, but they could still find ways to do what needed to be done. Preserving the Body In order to survive, they could no longer push their bodies. The wom en did not see physical im provem ent possible in the way it was possible in their youth; therefore, their efforts to car e for their bodies were described as preservation. The wom en engaged in strategies to preserve them selves by being organized and by conserving their ener gy. Pauline had put a baby picture of herself in her room as a rem inder that sh e needed to care for herself and that she deserved that care. W hen asked to explain she said this. That's probably the biggest way is being kinder to m yself, m ore forgiving of myself. I said to a num ber of people would you say those things to your best friend? Well, of course not. Never. Unthinkable. Then why in the world would you say those things to yourself? You need to learn how to treat yourself at least as well if not better than you would a friend. W e expect to take care of infants and sm all children. But we're not sweet little babies anym ore and we're expected to look out for our self. Unless you're declared m entally incom petent by a court of law, adults are expected to take care of them selves. Even if you're m arried, you really can't expect 176the other person to take care of you. You hope that that person will be supportive and encouraging and will give you hugs when you need them and so on but it's not a given. It's m uch m ore mentally healthy for m e if, and therefore, I feel better physically as well as m entally, if I don't do the negative self talk. If I am kinder to m y body by not dem anding that I continue to do things that I used to do. That I can still be an independent person and not take care of everything, every tim e for everybody. The wom en described the need to preven t further decline; they wanted to preserve as m uch of their physical ab ilities as they could. The wom en described during young and m iddle adulthood how they had pushed them selves to decline; therefore, during later adulthood they were describing the need to preserve their bodies to prevent further decline. It was the opposite of what they had done before. Jackie said she had to pres erve her body because pushing it would only result in f urther decline. Yeah, it hurts too m uch when you don't. I m ean you just... and every tim e you don't, you lose all those nerves and all that stuff. It doesn't rebuild and get you back. You just go downhill further because you never com e back. You never get to that point where you're really rested and they say on the literature that your nerves just don't com e back. If you over do it, you've overdone it. The key to preserving their bodies was in being organized and by conserving their energy. Being organized was im portant because energy could be preserved if things were put in order. In other words, the wom en could easily find things if they knew where they were. Looking for things took energy. Moreover, the environm ent needed to be organized so that the wom en could negotiate their way through their hom es. Antoinette m ade this clear when she described walking in her hom e. She said, \"I know exactly how far point A and point B are. I have the 177furniture arranged just so I can reach out and hold onto things as I walk.\" Kathy described how she organized her kitchen to preserve her energy. For m yself, that is a big deal. If you don't have to walk 6 feet to do things, only 2. You know, what's the problem ? So, you can ask m y husband about that. (Laugh) cause when we m oved into this unit, the kitchen and bath cause they were so sm all. And when I did m y kitchen I wanted m y work space to be over there in the corner back there. So the refrigerator, the sink and the stove is all over there in the corner. And the refrigerator needs to be over there all over across to the sink. You know the clean area is over there in that corner. And I think it looks better. So that is one of m y many talents. Organizing space. Preserving their bodies also m eant that lifestyle choices were m ade that enabled them to conserve energy. The wom en conserved their energy by planning activities. It did not m ean they could not do anything. It m eant that they had to choose what they wanted to do and plan that activity so that it did not cause harm to their bodies. Kathy described this when she said, \"It m ay take m ore thought or planning or energy to do som ething. But if I really want to do som ething I'll figure out a plan and do it.\" Antoinette described this strategy when she said, \"I think I plan m ore than I used to. Surpri ses are not fun. I have to pace m yself so generally speaking, if I'm going to som e place that I've never been before, I will try to get their earlier.\" Conserving to preserve the body m eant resting when needed. The wom en described how they needed to respond to their bodies before they becam e tired. This would allow them to continue wit hout feeling pain and fatigue. If they waited too long they would be debilitated for several hours to several days. Lena was a f irm believer in pacing herself with interm ittent periods of rest. 178Listen to your body. If your body tells you you're legs are tired, you're ready to take a rest. W ell, rest. W hat's wrong with stopping for a m inute? Then you can continue on to whatever you were doing. That's our m otto. Listen to your body. That will help you. That will help you conserve what you have until the end. There were tim es when som e wom en would push them selves despite knowing that it m ight cause them physical harm . Charlotte's daughter had the flu and she was asked to travel to her hom e to care for her. She said she knew it would be hard on her but she did it becau se she could not say no to her daughter when she was in need. Then on a very few occasions, but on som e occasions, I can just do several things in one day, a couple of days in a row. But it's never because I choose to. Like last week, last Friday I cam e in from Austin. I had gone that Monday because m y little girl, m y 25-year-old had the flu. She had 102 fever and she had . . . they had taken to the em ergency room and given her an IV to get fluids in. My daughter, m y other daughter had taken her hom e. But m y other daughter had to work the next day. She had to and so there was no one to take Katy to the doctor and go get her 7-Up and get her stuff she needed. So I drove to Austin. I just went in and got a couple of cans of soup and som e Sprite and that's all I got to take with m e so that when I got there, you know I could feed her and stuff, which I did. Then later that afternoon, I took her to her doctor. I drove in traffic. W hen we got back from the doctor, I was extrem ely tired. She laid down and I laid . . . I don't rem ember but I know I woke up in the big chair and I had been asleep for a couple of hours. W ell, I had forced m yself, forced m y adrenaline, forced m yself to do that because that was m y baby and I needed to take care of her. The next day, I rested a lot that day. The next day I really rested all day and then on Friday, I drove hom e. I cam e on home and went to bed. So then for several days after that, I cried a lot. I was very depressed and very exhausted. I knew I had overdone it but I was willing to do it f or her. I'm always caref ul not to do that f rivolously. Darlene described a sim ilar situation when she went to care for her daughter after a surgery. The wom en felt that caring for their children in need was a worthy 179sacrifice; they did not push them selves wh en they did not feel the sacrifice was worthy. Conflicts betw een Self and Body Over tim e, the wom en saw how their bodi es were changing as they rested more. For m any, the changes were hard to accept and they debated their decisions to preserve their bodies with rest. W hat they saw in the m irror conflicted with what they wanted for them selves. Charlotte said, But it's hard if you're busy all the tim e and you feel good as you're getting older and you stay busy. You have a lot of friends and a lot of support things. You don't spend all that m uch tim e on accidentally leaning down over a m irror where you can see everything falling forward. You know the force of gravity and you look like you're 80. ...som etimes when you're tired, you notice wrinkles or you notice or I notice things that I wouldn't have given a second thought to before because I would have been too busy to even be seeing them . Moreover, not everyone was preserving them selves; som e wom en said their bodies were continuing to decline. For instance, weight gain was a problem and the wom en struggled with how they would prefer their bodies to appear and what their bodies could do. The weight gain did not look good and it m ade using the body even m ore difficult. They rem inded them selves that there were consequences to pushing them selves. J udy described her struggle with weight gain after trying to rest m ore. Just ... It doesn't work anym ore. It doesn't do what I want it to do. W ith the loss of mobility com es this gaining of weight. Probably and I think some of the pills they give you m ake you gain weight. Especially this last year, I probably gained in the past year and half...I have probably gained 30 pounds. And so it seem s that you know that I am carrying m ore weight around that I am not used to carrying that m akes it harder to do anything. That is one reason it wears m e out, but it doesn't m atter if I eat or don't 180eat. I just don't lose weight. And people always tell you well you need to exercise. W ell, if you exercise this you are going to hurt that. So you have to be it is easier not to exercise to not have another ache and pain where you have been dam aged trying to do som ething. The wom en also found m ore tim e to noti ce the changes that had occurred with age. For Judy there was a m oment when sh e looked in the m irror that she realized that she had aged. It was during later adulthood that she was given the tim e to notice how her face had changed. She had not just changed with polio, she had changed with life. My eyes are getting to where to put m y make up on I need a m ake up mirror. To be able to do m y eyes and everything because I just can't quite see anym ore. And they had these; they had these light-up m irrors that you turn on. And you could... these things were m agnified so m uch that you could see every single flaw on your face. And I just, m y gosh, is this, do I really look that bad? I know I have got the dark circles under the eyes. That is probably a hereditary thing. I went, m y gosh. I didn't know m y skin looked that bad. The conflict between the self and the body continued when the wom en felt sudden surges of energy. These energy su rges could be deceiving because the wom en could feel the energy in their m inds but it would not last long if they tried to respond to it with their bodies. More over, if they responded to the energy surges by doing m ore than usual they would hurt m ore than usual. Donna said that she felt energy but if she tried to do too m uch the energy left her. She said, \"It's just like a car that runs at a speed and then it just puts the brakes on and that's what I'm like. The brakes are on. I put them on. My body, whether it's m entally or physically, has put them on and I can't go.\" She said that if she tried to push herself there were consequences such as she described below. 181I had a real hyper day like well, let's get this done. Let's get that done. And then the next day, m y muscles in m y body I was controlling them because I looked in the m irror but it felt like I couldn't control them Have you seen people . . . I known you've seen them but they have a leg kind of throws out when they walk? That's what I felt like I was doing but I wasn't. I tried to go for a short walk to calm the m uscles down or whatever I was trying to do to them . I had to turn around and com e back. Charlotte described the energy as a deceptive drug. It's a high. I've never done drugs or anything that give you a high. I just think that's what a high would feel like. It's alm ost surreal you know. It's so neat. It's not like being polar where you're having a m anic high. It's like everything is just so good and happy and you feel so good. There's almost nothing anybody can tell you that would upset you. You think. Not true, but you think that. You just think of all these things you want to do in that day. You see when you're driving down the street, I see places that I think oh m an, I'd love to stop in there and just look. But I never ever do that because I don't have the energy to walk and do that. But when I'm feeling like I have energy and everything I'm just thinking oh, I want to stop there and there and there and there and just see what's in there. The wom en lived with the conflict about the best way to care for them selves. The wom en wanted to age as well as they could. They attem pted to preserve the function they had at the time and they knew their bodies declined despite their attem pts. They believed, howev er, that their bodies were declining at a slower rate then they would if they had continued to push them selves. In response to this conflict, three participan ts attem pted to exercise in controlled ways believed not to cause pain or fa tigue. Another participant started a high protein diet. Others were reluctant to try other ways of caring for their bodies. After all, they found few health care pr oviders who knew of polio so they found few whose advice they would take. Polio was part of who they were even if health care providers did not acknowledge that part. 182There was, however, a conflict for the wom en in regard to how m uch they would let polio represent their experien ces. For instance, Cindy believed that all of the physical changes she experienced ove r the years were due to the effects of polio. During Cindy's first interview she explained that m ost of her current physical problem s were polio related, cau sed from pushing herself to m uch. Her second interview was done in the hospital af ter she was found to have an infected ulcer. She said she no longer believed that all of her health problem s were related to polio, although som e were. She wished she had seen a physician sooner instead of waiting to see a polio expert. Regretfully, she died a m onth later. Relating w ith the Interdependent Self As the wom en aged they realized a need for interdependence, which was an acknowledgem ent that no one does everything by them selves. It was the ability to give and receive within their relations hips while valuing both acts. The levels of interdependence varied depending upon the needs of the wom en. For instance, Cindy had a high level of interdependence as she needed som eone to be available at all tim es. She was unable to transfer on and off her toilet without assistance. The f ollowing f ield note was written the day of her f irst interview and it highlights how she needed help and am iably accepted it. When I knocked on the door she said, Tracie, com e on in. So she's obviously expecting m e. But she tells m e to com e in and have a seat, that's she's on the pot. I com e in and sit down. She said that she needs to wait for her neighbor to com e over to help her off. I asked if I could help her and she said, \"W ell, you're probably not big enough.\" She said, \"Com e here and let m e look at you.\" She said, \"You're tall enough but you're not big enough.\" She said, \"He's com ing anyway.\" And she had her cell phone. Not cell phone, but cordless phone with her and she had just called 183him. A larger m an com es over, who is her next door neighbor and helps her get off the com mode and onto her electric scooter. Jackie was also interdependent but on a lo wer level. She had a network of friends that she em ailed every m orning. If they did not receive an em ail from her they would call her. If she did not answer th ey would com e to the house to check on her. She felt very com fortable with this t ype of assistance. In response, she did the same thing for them . The wom en described the need to accep t that others could help them and that by letting others help them it did not take away from who they were as wom en. In fact, letting people help was a means of letting others feel good about them selves. For instance, Antoinette discussed how she cam e to know that letting others help her was the right thing to do. It's an opportunity for them to know what it's like to help som ebody and feel good about it. I even like to help people because there are people that are older than I am and less able to get around than I am . It m akes m e feel good so surely I'll m ake som ebody who has nothing wrong with them feel good. Pauline also described her experience with com ing to realize that others could help her. What can I do for you? Well, if you tell them then you'll get exactly the present that you need. It will be the right size and everything. The first time that I really needed to ask for help, or decided that I would, was one of those fluorescent light bulbs in the kitchen had burned out. There is a step ladder that I can still use because it's got a nice wide tread and I can manage to clim b two or three steps on it but it's hard. I just thought well, I'm just going to ask the neighbor who lived catty-cornered across the street if he would com e over and change the bulb for m e. He had volunteered if I ever needed anything to just let him know. So I asked him if he would be willing and able to do that and he said yes. He's about 6' '3\". He stood there on the floor, reached up, m oved the little Plexiglas thing over and he changed the bulb in about 2 m inutes. I thanked him . He said 184no big deal. No big deal to you, real big deal to m e. He was glad to give me that present. All I had to do was be a cheerful recipient. I just decided after that, there was no reason for m e to spend that m uch energy and effort and feel bad for the next two or three days just because I m aintained m y independence and changed m y light bulb when he could com e over and do it in 2 m inutes with very little ef fort and glad to do it. Despite knowing that others m ight benefit from giving to them , som e wom en found it difficult to accept help. Afte r all, they were raised to do for them selves. For exam ple, Joann felt it diffi cult to ask for help from people. She said, \"But now I'm working on it. It's som ething that you really do have to work on yourself to ask people to help you. They would just be glad to. It's no problem for them but it's a biggie for m e.\" W omen also found it difficult to accept help when they knew that the people they as ked also needed help. The wom en had once been the prim ary caregivers f or their f amilies and wanted to keep that role. For instance, Dorothy's husband, who was suffering from several chronic illnesses, would do the m ajority of hous ehold chores. She felt he was doing her job at a tim e when he needed rest. Yes, and right now it's extrem ely hard. I'm going to tear up again. He's in the early stages of Parkinson's. Here lately his blood pressure has gone up. I feel bad because he's having to do the things that I should be doing and he tells m e, \"No, don't feel bad about it. You did it all these years. I quit work. I retired. You didn't quit.\" He retired from work to take care of m e but I still f eel guilty seeing him . He's having a lot of arthritis setting up in his back. He's just 66. He's got diabetes and I just feel real guilty that he's doing m y job but he doesn't want m e to feel that way. W ell, because I know he's hurting and in pain, too. I guess because that's the way I've done with m y family. My husband and kids are m y life. I've done everything for them and I think I still ought to be. He keeps telling m e, \"No, that's not the way it is. It's m y turn now.\" W hen I see him stretching his back or rubbing Ben-Gay or som ething on them , I thought his back wouldn't be hurting if I was doing that job. But he says, \"W ell, yours 185would be hurting worse.\" So, he doesn't m ind and I'm glad of that, but I still f eel guilty. I just can't get over not f eeling guilty. I want to do it. Others wom en, such as Sarah, could not ask for help and were annoyed when their fam ily m embers did not help wit hout being asked. They felt their fam ily members should know that they need help a nd do it. At the very least, they should quit asking them for help. The wom en felt their fam ily m embers should know to pick up after them selves and that they were not able anym ore. Frustration mounted when this did not occur, high lighting the im portance of com municating their needs to others. Two of the wom en were very frail due to the effects of polio and osteoporosis; therefore, they required caref ul assistance when they received help with things like m oving. The wom en had to negotiate their need for assistance with their need for careful assistance. Their bones were fragile due to years of immobility. They knew that falls and twis ts could result in injuries that took months to heal. Elizabeth described how she was guarded when others helped her. I'm cautious. I don't know how to say this. There are tim es when people are lifting m e or putting m e up on the lift. You know well, wait until I tell you I'm ready to m ove it because once upon a tim e, I wasn't very high off the ground but yes, the lift went up before I was ready and I did dum p out on m y face. Lena had been injured due to an accident that occurred when a public transportation em ployee assisted her into a seat. The em ployee grabbed her legs to push her back in the seat, which resulte d in a broken leg. She said, \"They pushed down below m y knee and we all heard the pop. It was the tibia and the knee, too.\" It took several m onths for the leg to heal. She required surgery and a cast. 186 The wom en also acknowledged a c onflict between people who did not have a disability and those who did ha ve a disability. The wom en knew that people without disabilities were unaware of what actions would be seen as offensive and what actions would be seen as helpf ul to people with disabilities. Kathy described this situation in detail. I see a few cases, what's happened to disabled people, som etimes when people offer assistance the individual that needs the assistance either doesn't want it, or thinks he can do it him self and there's one or two incidents, where the disabled person will just scream or yell at, or just, \"Leave m e alone,\" kind of thing, as opposed to being gracious and accepting the offer, or explaining graciously you know, \"That's fine I'm ok.\" Because the public is trying to help, and they don't think they need the help, or want the help. Or they're just angry period with their position. I've seen that happen in a few cases. And people just jum p back, \"Sorry.\" And again it's too m uch attention m aybe being given to the disabled, but coming with good intentions from the person who's giving it, because when they're being scorned or yelled at or not grateful of the person, then they'll com e back and they'll sue...I don't know. It just seem s to be not a complete understanding on both parts. But I've witnessed a few, which it's too bad, because this guy he goes up to this lady to be nice, to be assistant, and they don't want it, \"I can do it m yself.\" Without fail, the wom en said that the way to handle this situation was to ask if the other person wanted help and not to take it personally if they did not. W hen asked how she wanted people to treat her, Darlen e said, \"The first thing off the top of my head is like a norm al hum an being.\" Antoinette added her opinion on people who m ight want to help her, \" They don't want to offend m e and it shouldn't be. Being nice should not be a secret. You know. If you look at m e and em pathize that should m ake you feel good because that's softness in you.\" They also m entioned that as they aged they wanted m ore help but that had its lim its. In other words, they wanted help but only the help that their bodies 187needed because they wanted to rem ain as self-reliant as possible. As Joann said, \"But I guess the real fear is that som e day I'll probably be totally dependent on other people. I think that's the real f ear.\" For these wom en, every activity they gave up could put them closer to com plete dependence. SUMMARY These wom en knew that im pairm ent had a personal m eaning to them and a meaning to society. The m eaning changed with age and affected their lives in ways that restricted their ability to act out and be accepted in the roles they chose for them selves as wom en. In their youth th eir im pairm ent m eant they had to try harder. They pushed to prove them selves independent. As they aged it m eant they needed to value and to conserve the function they had. They had unease about their response and societies' response to their increasing im pairm ent with age. After looking back on her life Antoinette said, \"Lucky. You know how lucky to not see all this other stuff because it is a burden. I can tell you that. It's a burden. You know som etimes, I just really, like gosh, can I just have a lim p period and that's all? Can I just, please, just ha ve a lim p?\" She knew that polio was m uch more apart of her than having a lim p. In sum mary, the wom en's perceptions of their environm ent in childhood through later adulthood evolved from a tim e and place where people did for them selves to a tim e and place where obs tacles to independence were im proved for those with disabilities but rem ained a problem for those who have aged and no longer have the energy to overcom e less obvious barriers. Their sense of hum an agency had evolved from a childhood wher e few had the ability or knowledge to 188overcom e im pairm ent to later adult hood where new strategies had to be developed to incorporate the needs of their bodies and sensations with the needs of their selves. The self or body could not exist without caring for the other despite their desires to continue previous ways of life that were based on pushing the body to m eet the dem ands of the self. Finally, their relationships evolved from childhood where they were pushed and enc ouraged to be independent to later adulthood where they learned to becom e interdependent to m aintain their ways of life. 189Chapter 5: Aging, Impairment, and Gender Chapter 5 contains the findings of the three exploratory questions: the exploration of the m eaning the wom en asso ciated with aging, the exploration of how the wom en adjusted to the changes they associated with aging, and the exploration of how the wom en's gende r im pacted their experiences and adjustm ent to aging. THE MEANING OF AGING Few planned their lives to be the way they turned out, and in the end, they played the cards they were dealt. This was the over all m eaning of what it was to age with a disability. It was m ore com plex and m ore interesting as their lives were detailed, but this was the overall gist of how the wom en viewed aging. No one planned to get polio. No one planned to have a disability or grow old with increasing im pairm ent, but they did. Thei r ingenuity was seen in how skillf ully and fully the wom en lived their lives with the effects of polio from childhood to the present. In other words, how they played the cards. The specif ics on how skillf ully they lived their lives over tim e were captured when they were asked to reflect upon their life course and relate what aging m eant. The wom en discussed how agi ng and polio could not be separated as embodied experiences; they were cha nged by both in appearance and ability. Their bodies had changed in real and abstract ways, which left them to feel out of synchrony with the life they had expected or the life they had seen for others aging without im pairm ents. As they ag ed with polio, their bodies changed in 190unique and often unpredictable ways, which m ade aging seem relative to the wom an's perception of self and body in tim e and space. Ultim ately, they saw aging as a journey that changed them in form , perception, and ability. Moreover, aging m eant their bodies were slowing dow n, but they m aintained, as they had always done, that the m easure of their success was in their m ental response to their declining physical abilities. The following was a report of the them es and sub-them es that em erged out of the discussions surrounding the m eaning of aging for wom en with childhood onset polio. There were four m ajor them es: Aging and polio: It's Just Part of m e, a Slowing Down, the Particulars of Ag ing, and the Journey that Changes You. Two of the them es, Aging and Polio and th e Particulars of Aging were com posed of two and three sub-them es, respectively. Aging and Polio: It's Just Part of Me The usual changes of aging and the affects of polio were difficult to separate in the context of which experien ces affected the wom en the m ost or in what way over tim e. Darlene said that po lio could not be separated from who she was. She said, \"I've lived w ith it all m y life. It's just part of me.\" Antoinette called polio a tree root that broke into every aspect of her life's foundation. Kathy said, \"And it rem inds of, you read that book, James the Giant Peach , I believe it is, or see the film ? It's the little boy in a peach and he's getting around. He does all these travels and wonderful things and all that. It's kind of like that som etimes, a fashion of either a nightm are or a fantasy kind of thing that took off.\" As the wom en reflected upon the m eaning of aging, they described how polio was part of 191their lives and how it affected their embodied experiences. The experience of aging and polio were described using two sub-them es: Im pacting the Body's Appearance and Ability and Disrupting Chronological Meaning. Impacting the Body's Appearance and Ability The wom en spoke of differences in their bodies over tim e. They described how the body had changed in appearance and ability from when they were younger and they described how their body m ight have been when com pared to family members. The wom en spoke frequently of how their bodies had changed over tim e, both due to polio and due to age. Muscle s that were affected with polio would often shrink in size, and decrease in st rength. Cindy pointed out that her right hand was sm aller than the left because the m uscles were atrophying. Alita lifted her pants leg to show her calf . She said it was m uch sm aller than it was 2 years prior. Donna said, \"My body changing is a slap in the face because I've always been petite and still am in the height but not around. And the lack of things bothers m e. Like I squat down to do som ething and I've got to pull m yself. W ell, that's crazy.\" Charlotte noticed m ultiple changes in her body. My body is a big blob of fat, no m uscle tone. My legs are all m isshapen. Now, the bones have changed shape and they're knock-kneed, gnarled, and weird. The m uscles are atrophied. I have nice eyes but m y eyes don't look nice anym ore because of fatigue, strain. But on m ornings when I wake up and I'm rested, I have very beautif ul eyes, but the f atigue will eventually m ake them bags under m y eyes and they just look... the eyelids kind of drop and they're not pretty anym ore. My hair healthy but thin. I can't do anything with it because it is thinning there and I don't know what to do about that. 192Other wom en saw specific physical di fferences between them selves and how they thought they would have appear ed without polio. The m ost frequently reported difference was in height. Polio ha d affected the height of several wom en because the virus dam aged their leg growth or caused severe scoliosis. Patsy said that she was 7 inches shorter than she should be because of her scoliosis. Tabby also discussed how polio m ade her shorter. She said, \"I u sed to be 5' '1\" when I was in high school. The last tim e I was m easured, which I think was when I was 4''11\". I would probably be at least four inches taller. I would probably be 5' '4\" had I not had the polio and the scoliosis.\" It was clear that appearance was im portant to the wom en and that aging had threatened how the wom en viewed their appearance. Som e were upset with the change and som e were not obviously concerned. Others were m ore accepting of the changes despite wishing they had not occurred. W hen asked if her appearance was im portant, Dorothy replied, \"Yes, it is. It's im portant to m e but not as m uch, I guess, as it used to be. Like I say, used to I wouldn't let anybody see m e without m akeup and everybody sees m e without m ake up now, but I still wish I could put on m ake up every day.\" Some wom en saw their changes in a ppearance as a negative aspect of aging. Alita brought out m any of the nega tive aspects of aging and aging with polio in the text below. I don't like som e of the things. I don't like m enopause at all because the dryness. My skin is changing. Although a lot of people tell m e I don't look 60, I don't like the changes. I don't like the whole m enopause bit. Vaginal dryness. Dryness in general. My eyes, I don't produce tears. My eyes dry up. My skin is . . . these little . . . has these brown areas on it you know the changes in pigm entation. Just not being able to do som e of the things that 193you used to do. Not being able to wear pretty clothes even a shoe with a heel. I guess that has to do with the po lio but I think I know a lot of friends who don't have polio that can't wear their heels anym ore, so just a lot of things. I'm a fun person. I love m usic. I love to dance. I love to do all those things and I can't do them anym ore. I can't drive at night anym ore because I can't see very well. I have got a cataract or two up there in m y eye that interferes with m y night driving. I see halos. I guess I think about it in a negative way. I don't know of anybody. I think they're lying; people are lying if they say they like getting old because I don't. Donna m ade a sim ilar statem ent when sh e said, \"I'm fuller. I have lines. You know how wom en get these jowl-looking th ings? I see that.\" Beatrice noticed these changes, too and she did not like them . She said, \"It stinks. I m ean, you know what? What's good about aging? You get wrinkles. W ho wants them ? Your hair turns grey. W ho wants that? I do everything to cam ouflage it that I can.\" Not everyone saw the changes in their appearance and abilities in a negative m anner. Som e of the wom en we re pragm atic about the changes while others m ade jokes. Martha said, \"I us ed to keep m y hair colored and I don't anym ore. I'm glad it's that silver stu ff and not that old yellowy stuff. Thank goodness I have natural curly hair so I don't have to worry with a blow dryer or curling iron or any of that because I c ouldn't do it.\" Janette was content with the changes she saw in the m irror, but sh e joked about her husband's reaction. She said, \"My husband said one day, 'you know, you need to tint your hair. Its part gray and part black. You ought to have it one color. You need to decide which color you want.' W ell, you dirty old m an. You want too m uch.\" The wom en did not know how they would have aged without polio. Martha only knew her own experience and could not relate that to any other experience. W hen asked how it felt to age with polio she said, \"I don't have a 194clue. I don't know how I woul d feel if I was som ebody else. I have no idea. It's just m e.\" The only way the wom en knew to com pare their experience to what it might have been without polio was to com pare it to other wom en in their fam ilies. By relating their bodies to the bodies of their fam ily m embers, the wom en could see a disruption from their genetic potential. For instance, several wom en reported that their m others were able to do m ore than they were able to do. Betty compared herself to her m other. Well her m other lived to be 98. And I keep thinking, \"Oh gosh if we can live to be that old.\" And I want to, and it is distressing to know that she can get around and she can bend over and pick up things off the floor where I can't do that anym ore. I can't get things out of the vegetable drawer down there, because it's so low. I can't get the oranges out. I have to really get in a different position to try to get down there. But her m other was that way. W hen Grandm a was in her 90s she could stand with one foot on the floor and the other foot in the sink if she wanted to wash her foot off. So she is real lim ber, so that is som ething that she can do. And Karen, Karen (sister) is that way even though she's had cancer. Martha also saw that she was different th an other wom en in her fam ily. She said, \"I'm never going to do what m y ancestors have done because they were very busy, active physical people for all of their lives. And they lived to ripe old ages.\" Disrupting Chronological Meaning The wom en talked of discord betw een their views of them selves as wom en, their appearance, their physical ab ility, and their chronological age. Their experience of being 60 years of age was not what they perceived as the norm al experience of a 60 year old wom an. They did not feel that the aforem entioned aspects of them selves were in agreem ent. Jackie said, \"I was thinking I was getting older. But I wasn't that old to really go through all these changes that no 195one knew what. W ell, we'll put you on th is. W e'll put you on that. It didn't work.\" Donna com mented on how her age a nd financial planning did not correlate with what she was expecting. She sa id, \"...even though I was putting m oney aside, that was for when I got old, not today. That was m y thoughts, you know.\" Antoinette spoke of being likened to the age of an older distinguished dentist, which caused her to be bem used. She sa id she was, \"Feeling very conflicted because I didn't think of m yself as be ing old. I felt like I was retiring young. But now apparently, I look like everybody else. An adjustm ent, isn't that strange? \" This was also evident when Charlotte spoke of how she viewed her aging body. That's hard to take. In your heart, you know it's not what m akes a person. It's not what's im portant, but for m e, it's not so m uch what other people think as it is I feel like I'm in a strange body. It's like som etimes I don't recognize m e. It's like I don't go out in a crowd and think, \"Oh, I'm so embarrassed by the way I look.\" I don't think that at all. Because m ost of the tim e I look better than m ost of them a lot of tim es. But I just don't feel right in m y own skin because m y body has changed so dram atically in a year and a half that I have to get used to m e. It's a change. For m any of the wom en the discord the felt led them to believe they were different than those who had aged without im pairm ent. The wom en said they felt different than other people because they had experienced at earlier ages what others m ight never experience. They were developm entally changed from their expe riences with polio. They knew about the hardships of life earlier than other people knew of them . They said they were less na\u00efve, em otionally and m entally stronger than people who did not have the experiences they had with im pairm ents. Elizabeth said she was prepared for the issues associated with aging, such as gaining benefits, caring for her body, and overcom ing aging stereotypes because she had been doing it m ost of her life. She 196said, \"So m any of them they get, as they becom e seniors, they becom e disabled. Then a lot of them , that's late in life for them to start thinking about, oh, gee, what should I do about this or that? Where we'v e been looking at it, thinking about it, and doing it for a lot m ore years.\" Lena had a sim ilar view when she said, \"W ell, I've been learning to deal with loss m ost of my life, more so than m ost. I kind of got a head start on that one. I lost a lot a long tim e ago.\" Slow ing Dow n Many of the wom en said that agi ng was slowing down. By slowing down, the wom en meant they could not do as m uch as they could when they were younger or they could not do things as qui ckly as they once could. W hen asked what aging m eant, Jackie said, \"Slowing dow n. The things that I used to be able to do, like I can't kneel that m uch or ge t up when I kneel. That kind of aging.\" When asked what aging m eant, Darlene said, \"less active, less energy. But other than that, it doesn't bother m e that I'm getting older.\" Kathy also hinted at this when she said, \"Aging is the slowing, th e slowing of your ab ilities to function as you do when you rem ember.\" Slowing down was also a cognitive re sponse to changes in their bodies. For instance, slowing down to com pensate for being off balance was very common. Antoinette was able to go faster when she did activities in her youth but she had to slow down as she aged to com pensate for being off balance. So it's an adjustm ent for me. I used to be very, within m y disability, I was very agile. I could do a whole bunch of stuff like you know I could go down the hall and as I went down the hall, I could turn real quickly and go some place else. Or you know just you know flick a light switch off or on or whatever and m ake it around the corner. I knew exactly when to lean on 197a door jam and pivot m yself so that I really wasn't working that hard. I was using physics to m y benefit you know. You can see in m y house, the places where I put m y hand. You can tell. The paint is sort of worn right there. I would reach out m y hand, touch the door jam at a certain place, and just pivot m y weight around rather than m aking a com plete turn. I just use physics and I would be turning the other direction. Now, I find m yself having to really concentrate because if I don't, I m iss the door jam , which is not good, which is not good. Slowing down did not m ean becom ing disabled or becom ing ill. The wom en did not equate aging with diseas e or disability. Illness had occurred at younger ages, and disability had occurred on various levels throughout their life. Aging was part of a decreasing response ra te from the self in response to the body and subsequently, to the dem ands of liv ing. Antoinette described how everyone slowed as they aged, including her. She pe rceived herself perpetually slower than those without disabilities. I rem ember as a teenager thinking okay now when I get old, m aybe I didn't think about when I get old. I thought about when they get old then they'll walk as slow as I do. Maybe they won't be that interested in doing things that are athletic and we can finally be on a par. And gosh, didn't that surprise m e when I not only had them get old, but I got old, too. I'm still behind the curve and they still have to wait f or me. That was a bumme r. The wom en perceived a slowing of the body and the self frequently had to slow down in order to com pensate for changes in their bodies. Their response to the slowing of the body did not m ean they were old or without purpose. Aging may have m eant slowing down but it did not m ean being old. Old was som ething for other people, none of the wom en iden tified them selves as old. Moreover, as the wom en journeyed through life, they received, if not em braced, new roles. With the new roles cam e different res ponsibilities and different challenges. The 198wom en's ability to accept new or changi ng responsibility in concert with the slowing down was a m easure of their wisdom and m aturity, an indicator to them they had aged well. For instance, Kathy described this in great detail. I have always thought in a m ature fashion but I am not sure that is the thinking of a 65 year old or 50 year old or som ething like that. To m e age has nothing to do with it. It is just being responsible, respected, for mother, grandm other or that type of thing. That type of individual because with each of these events in your life som ething com es a long with it. Another responsibility and if you accept that responsibility then to m e that is a m ature attitude. Rosaria affirm ed this when she said, \"I guess you adjust as you go along. I have adjusted a little bit at a tim e. I know I get in and out of the car differently than I used to. I get in and out of the house differently...\" Alita said, \"I just hope that I can accept things... That I'll be able to age gracefully and die when m y time comes.\" Janette added, \"Sort of on the surface, just getting older, m arching into the next year and the next year. Aging, I think, is gaining wisdom .\" It was common for the wom en to say things such as , \"aging to m e is not the num ber. It's how you feel inside. It's what you m ake your life. How you m ake life your life, I think, is im portant.\" The Particulars of Aging The wom en's experiences of decline in m iddle and later adulthood brought on discussions of advancing age. W hen they found them selves unable to will their bodies to action, m any pondered, \"Is this aging? Am I getting old?\" Healthcare providers, inexperienced in th e care of polio survivors, often told them , \"Yes, you are getting old. W hat did you expect? We all age.\" Other healthcare providers, knowledgeable in the care of polio survivors, told them , 199\"Yes, as a m atter of fact, you are aging faster than people your own age without polio. W e estim ate your body to be at leas t 20 years older than your chronological age.\" The wom en pondered and discussed th ese issues about their aging bodies, which resulted in three sub-them es: Th e Individual Aging Body with Polio, The Unpredictable Aging Body, and The Relativity of Aging. The Individual Aging Body with Polio Many of the wom en noted an inconsiste ncy in the statem ent from health care providers who said that their bodies were years older than their chronological age. The wom en knew that at 55 years of age, their theory would have put their adjusted age at about 75. The wom en we re not isolated. They knew how the bodies of m any 75 year old wom en appeared; they knew what m any of the 75 year old bodies could do. Their bodies were not consistently sim ilar in either way. Some 75 year old wom en appeared very old to them while others appeared young. Some 75 year old wom en ran in the Seni or Olym pics while others were long deceased. This led m any of the wom en to denounce that com parison in favor of the individuality of aging. The individuality of aging was prom inent in the interviews with m ultiple wom en. For exam ple, Martha had sat down with her pictures from childhood through young adulthood. She discussed each one. She also told of how her friends and relatives, pictured along with he r, had aged in different ways than she had aged. She believed that aging was di fferent for different people. She said, \"Well, I was talking to m y mother one day on the phone. She was bem oaning the fact that she could not do at 60 what he r mother had done at 60. I just sat there 200going okay m om. Well, I wish I could do at 40 what m y mother did at 40.\" The field notes written f or that discussion highlight the im pact of that interview. First, I could see from looking at the pictures this really healthy, beam ing, beautiful child. And then a sad adolescent-type, prepubescent girl with this Milwaukee brace just staring off into the distance. Then I could see this really, really attractive younger wom an. It rem inded m e som ewhat of Nicole Kidm an with the reddish kind of hair and then dark sunglasses, 50's-type style. The tight pants, skinny body fram e and then getting married. Kind of an intelligent, eager, awkward young wom an. Then I'm looking at her and she's just now is very obesely frail. I don't know if that makes sense. A wom an who is relatively young but fading so, so quickly and yet so m entally alert and having so m uch potential. So with this lady, aging just is. It's not any particular state at any one tim e. It's not any one particular experience at any one tim e. It just is. It's just what you do. Aging was an individual jour ney, which was different than what other people did or what other people would do and the diffe rence rem ained within them for a lif e time. The Unpredictability of the Aging Body The wom en's thoughts about the aging process and their aging with the effects of polio led m any to belie ve it was unpredictable. Aging was unpredictable; who could have predicted how their bodies would age? Kathy said, \"Nobody knows what it's going to be.\" Donna confirm ed this when she said she did not believe that anyone could ha ve known how her body would change over the years. Charlotte described the unpred ictability of aging with polio in the passage below. I think this disease is insidious in that when you get cancer you pretty well know what to expect. W hen you have heart disease you pretty well know what to expect. But when you had polio when you were young, you went through hell for a good long tim e but then you got okay. Or what you perceived as okay and norm al for a very long tim e. You kind of had your 201life planned out in your m ind when all of a sudden. Boom . The sam e disease knocks you down again. I know people can have recurrences of cancer and the sam e thing happened but you expect that. But nobody expected this. It's just such a shock to know that it can be that debilitating. The Relativity of Aging The aging process could only be know n by the one who experienced the process and that process was interprete d based on the person's experiences with their body in space and tim e. As the wom en aged, the m eaning of changes in their bodies was relative to the degree of ch ange they experienced. The degree of change was em phasized, or accentuated enough for conscious thought, when the wom en were with certain people, at certain places, or doing certain things. In other words, certain m oments brought out the sense that the body had changed from what it once was. W hen Darlene saw that her peers had changed with age, she realized she had aged, too. She said, \"Probably not until I turned 60 and it was just like wow. W here did the years go? I seen m y friends and they're gray-headed. I'll look in the m irror and go oops.\" Dorot hy talked about how her perception of aging changed as she changed; the m eaning of aging was relative to her own age. She said, \"W ell, used to it m eant by the tim e you hit 40, you were ready for the rest hom e. But now that I'm 62, I don't feel that old. Aging doesn't m ean old, old to me anym ore, but I do feel that agi ng now m eans getting to do less and less of the things that I used to do all the tim e.\" The Journey that Changes You Aging was an em bodied journey from birth to the present, and throughout the journey different levels of self understanding and ability were reached. Their 202understanding of aging was based upon their bodily experiences within the world. The wom en had the capacity to objectify a nd store their experiences, bring these to the present and use them to influen ce their future; with this knowledge they grew older. As Sarah com mented, \"You s ee m ore and m ore I guess of it. Maybe that's what m akes the difference, rather than that just being your first tim e to experience it.\" Or As Pauline said, \"I have handled lots of situations and I'm still here.\" Lena em phasized this point tim e and again. I think just by everything that you go through. Life experiences that you go through. That's one rem ark that I've been m aking to you over and over again that you try and learn from the experiences that you go through and something else com es up that's different but it m akes you stronger and then you becom e not so naive. You learn to ask questions to yourself, analyze yourself. Ask questions to the doctors and to the nurses and you learn as you go. Every day we're a little bit older and I think just life in itself. And that's what I keep telling you. The journey was evident in how the wom en's perspectives had changed over tim e and in how the wom en adapted to the changes associated with aging. The wom en saw the effects of aging in how their perspectives had changed over tim e. Their journeys had changed how they viewed their bodies, their selves, and their world. Their views ha d shifted on issues such as racism and disability. Their perception of how wise they were had grown. Their perceptions of how big buildings were had dim inished. Their spirituality was stronger. For exam ple, Janette said, \"I know I have grown. I have grown spiritually. I still have that hum an side. Som etimes I cry or get pessim istic or worry about things. But it isn't like it was before, I am able to pick up the pieces and go on.\" Joann confirm ed this view. She said, \"As a chil d, you just kind of sit back and wait, you know, for people to do things for you and make you better. As an adult, I know 203now that you're the one that can m ake it better for yourself. It starts with you and how you approach it. How you deal with it.\" Lena said, \"So now at this stage of the gam e, as old as I am now or m ore, I think first.\" The change in perspective was also noted when Cindy m entioned in the hospital before she died that disability had changed f rom when she was a child. She had m uch m ore to live f or as an older adult. Summary The m eaning of aging could not be separated from the m eaning of aging with polio. The wom en saw changes in th eir bodies that were the result of both polio and aging. Given the com bined aff ects of aging and polio, the wom en knew they were aging in a m anner that was out of synchrony with those who did not have im pairm ents. The wom en could see a nd feel changes that were not reported by friends or relatives, which added to the unique experience they perceived. Aging m eant that had slowed down but th e wom en measured their achievem ent in aging in their m ental ability to overcom e their physical challenges. They saw aging as a journey that had changed th em in form , perception, and ability. The them es that represented this journey were : Aging and Polio: It's Just Part of Me, Slowing Down, the Particulars of Aging, and the Journey that Changes You. ADJUSTMENT TO THE CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH AGING Many of the wom en spent tim e contem plating the best ways to adapt to the changes experienced with aging. The following section was designed to describe the changes, the consequences of the changes, and the strategies used to overcom e the changes. 204The wom en described prim ary changes that they recognized over the years and that required them to adapt to the ch ange in them selves. These changes were physical problem s and required that the wom en recognize and respond to them . They were problem s such as physical and m ental fatigue, pain, changes in balance, and increasing lim its to dexterit y. The wom en described consequences to the physical changes. These were physical, psychological, and social results of the prim ary physical changes. They were consequences such as falling, m aking mental m istakes at work, having anxiety a ttacks, or not being able to m ulti-task anym ore. Due to the consequences of th e physical changes the wom en had to plan strategies to address either the problem s directly or to address the consequence of the problem . These were strategies such as changing an activity, resting m ore, retiring from work, or using assistiv e devices. Exam ples of the changes, consequences, and strategies were listed in Table 12. Many of the wom en mentioned that they also experienced secondary changes due to the strategies used to compensate f or the initial changes. These were changes such as obesity and isola tion. The consequences of these problem s could com pound the problem s related to the consequences of the initial problem s, which led to f urther strategies to com pensate for the problem s. Exam ples of further problem s, consequences, and strategi es with aging were presented in Table 13. The ability to f ind strategies to adapt to the changes of aging was based in their ability to find synchrony between thei r perception of their self and their abilities to act on their own behalf . In ot her words, the wom en could adapt to 205changes based upon four things. First, depending upon what they accepted as a change or a problem with aging. Sec ond, depending upon what they had available to them as an adaptation. Third, dependi ng upon if that adaptation was consistent with the im age they wished to present, a nd fourth, if they were able to use that adaptation in a m anner that gave them purpose or enjoym ent. Lena said \"Aging, like you say, it's learning to take your age as it com es. Yes, things get a little bit harder, especially f or us that have po lio. W e get a little weaker. W e're a little bit tired but then you find things to do that you can do at that stage of your life that you still enjoy.\" 206Table 12: Changes, consequences, and strategies. Primary Changes Consequences Strategies Physical Fatigue Decreased tim e on projects Unable to m ulti-task Rest breaks Planning and organization Mental Fatigue Mistakes m ade when on task too long Frequent breaks Post-pone im portant decisions Pain Stopped or altered activities Massage, exercise, medications, and assist devices Balance Problem s Falls Fear of falls Assistive devices Walking on even & textured flooring Planning and knowing lay out of surroundings Decreased Dexterity Do fewer com plex activities that require full range of motion Assistive devices for reach Asking for assistance Changing groom ing practices Change clothing types Portable assist devices Decreased Muscular Strength Less lif ting Decreased ability to clear lungs with diaphragm Decreased ability to push self in chair or pull self up from toilet Ask for assistance Pneum onia shot Breathing aids Portable devices, such as toilet seats and ram ps Temperature Shifts Decreased desire to go out Layering with m ultiple clothes Heating pads 207 Table 13: Secondary changes, consequences, and strategies. Secondary Changes Consequences Strategies Obesity Type 2 Diabetes Further decrease in strength Further change in clothing style Ulcers Surgeries Exercise Resignation Altered appearance Decreased desire to go out in public Decreased self-esteem Cut hair short but stylish Dye hair Ask for assistance Fractures Hospitalizations, surgeries, and f urther m obility impairm ent Hire assistants Fewer sexual experiences Marital conf lict Sexual banter or other means of intim acy Isolation Fewer people to provide assistance when needed Com puter contacts via internet Telephone conversation Side Effects from Medications Falls, weakness, balance disturbances Change m edications &/or use alternative therapies Emotional and psychological disturbances Crying, anxiety, and nervousness Decrease m ental stim uli 208 THE INFLUENCE OF GENDER ON AGING WITH POLIO The m eaning of aging with im pairm ent was intertwined with the m eaning of being wom en. The wom en could not com partmentalize their experiences with aging, gender, or im pairm ent; just as their bodies were perceived and given meaning as im paired so were they pe rceived and given m eaning as wom en. The meaning of being wom en aging with im pairm ents was derived out of their embodied experiences as a whole. As Patsy said, \"I just love being a wom an but I don't have to be frilly, I don't have to be anything that I'm not. I can't be anything else but m e.\" Throughout the st udy the wom en related how the m eaning of being wom en was entangled with the meaning of aging and this influenced their ability to adjust to the changes they experienced. The wom en's gender inf luenced their ability to adjust to the changes that occurred with aging. Their gender influenced their adjustm ent by influencing their ability to find synchrony between their per ception of self and their abilities to act on their own behalf. From the wom en's discussions of how their gender influenced their adaptation to aging two them es with sub-them es em erged that were related to each other by the varyi ng tension perceived between them ; one them e was never independent of the others . The two them es were: Perceptions of Self and Discrepancies in W omanhood. Perceptions of Self The wom en spoke of how they per ceived them selves as having both feminine and m asculine characteristics. These characteristics were perceived as 209both negative and positive qualities and im pacted their ability to care f or them selves. The ability to f ind a balance between the two was im portant in order to be self -sufficient wom en. The com monalities were categorized into three sub- them es: My Masculine W ays, My Fem inine W ays, and The Balanced Self. My Masculine Ways The m asculine self was discussed frequently when the wom en spoke of what kind of people they were raised to be. These characteristics rem ained with many into adulthood. Masculine characteristics were described as strength, playfulness, and independence; the wom en thought the characteristics atypical for wom en. Janice said, \"I was always a tom boy growing up. I think also because of my disability, m other and dad always want ed m e to be independent.\" Jackie and Tabby m ade sim ilar statem ents when they said they grew up as tom boys. Tabby said, \"But I guess I kind of prided m yself in being tough. You know, well, that maybe part of that tom boy thing. My br other didn't want m e to be crying, you know. Be tough. You can hack it. You can m ake it. And so m aybe that's part of the difference.\" Kathy said she was a to m boy that never acted out the typical female roles. She becam e a pharm acist at a tim e when few fem ale pharm acists existed. She wanted to be able to care fo r herself, and she was not sure she would ever m arry. The m asculine characteristics enabled them to be strong and independent at a tim e when they were unsure of their futures. The m asculine characteristics were a gui de to self-sufficiency, but did not provide them with the ability to do what they wanted. Their bodies rem ained impaired. For instance, as children they may have viewed them selves as tom boys 210but were not always allowed to play ball with the other children. As adults, they may have been strong and independent but were not always com mended for acting that way. For instance, Janice de scribed how she was perceived as too strong a wom an, which m ade work difficult. She said, \"But now it's kind of like, and then in the last m aybe 10 to 15 years or som ething, I seem to feel m ore so where this ego centered world of m en is... They feel threatened because of m y strengths.\" Deborah was told by a work m anager that she cam e across too strong. In other words, the m asculine traits, whic h enabled them to adapt to im pairm ents, were seen as inappropriate traits in competitive situations, such as in childhood games or adult work places. My Feminine Ways Their f eminine self was discussed in relation to their ability to be compassionate, to be creative, and to nurtu re. These were characteristics that the wom en discussed as being part of their fem inine side as well as part of their role as wom en. They all discussed som e variation of their ability to be com passionate, to create, and to nurture. These char acteristics allowed them to express them selves as wom en and adapt to ch anging environm ents and their changing impairm ents. For instance, Tabby saw hers elf as having creative characteristics. She said, \"Its cooler for a wom an to be creative. I just knitted m y granddaughter a cap, a winter cap. I had seen a girl with one sim ilar at W endy's. It was a cream - colored band with a green frog at the top of the cap and I said, oh, that is cool.\" Alita described having nurturing f eminine characteristics. She said, \"I've always been this way and it's too late to change. I think you either are or you're not. I 211think it's a character thing that you have. Some of us are giving people and som e of us are not. Som e of us givers, som e of us takers.\" Donna believed that m any of her fem inine traits were learned by wom en of her generation, not an essential part of being a wom an. She said, \"The younger wom en are m ore into num bers than the older wom en. The older wom en deal m ore with having com passion and being understanding. \" Judy thought being a wom an was special because she enjoyed being pregnant and being a m other, which allowed her to nurture children. Judy said, \"I always, I always enjoyed bei ng a wom an. I thought it was great to be a wom an.\" Many of the wom en valued their fem inine characteristics; they f elt like they possessed f eminine traits but their impairm ents threatened their ability to express them selves as fem inine. In other words, m any saw their fem inine characteristics as being enacted through th eir bodies and the enactm ent could be altered by their im pairm ents. W hen they we re unable to enact the characteristics it threatened their belief in their abilities as wom en. Charlotte said, \"I never had any problem s with m y sexuality. I don't m ean se xuality; I just m ean feeling like a girl. I always felt fem inine. I always felt like... I didn't have problem s that way. I just felt inf erior over all.\" Later, Charlo tte described how m en would not allow them selves to love her because of her im pairm ents. I always knew that they did like m e or they wouldn't have been asking m e out. But then when the deficits started com ing up and it becam e more apparent, they didn't want to date anym ore... I m ean it's possible somebody could fall in love with m e and m arry m e with this, but you have to get to the point to fall in love. Men, m ost men that I've gone out with my age and a little older, they don't want any baggage in their life. 212Joann said an im paired body was harder to display as fem inine because she was expected to physically enact her fem inine characteristics. For exam ple enacting feminine characteristics was done by wear ing m ake up, wearing certain clothing, or wearing high heels. For exam ple, Betty said, I wanted to wear pretty clothes. I was the chubby, fat one that didn't have a waistline that couldn't wear hand m e downs. I would just love to have had their hand m e downs because to m e that had beautiful skirts and blouses. I always had to wear a dress because I didn't have a waistline and my clothes would tend to fall straight down walking the way I did. So I never...I got new clothes but I always wanted what they had. Enacting fem inine characteristics was described again when they accepted caregiver roles, which were difficult. The act of care giving required physical involvem ent. Alita described the physical re quirem ents of being a caregiver to her mother. But it was a lot of picking her up. She fell in the bathroom . I had to pick up. She insisted that she had to take a tub bath. She would get in there and I kept saying you can't get out m om. Once you sit down, I have to get you up. She'd get m ad and she wanted to do it. So she'd stand there and then she couldn't get up so then I had to pull her up. All the things I wasn't supposed to do. Joann and Betty said that not doing caret aking and nurturing activities threatened their fem ininity. The Balanced Self The wom en described a need to balance their m asculine and fem inine characteristics to fit their needs to be wom en who could achieve and be independent while be nurturing and com passionate. The balance between the characteristics created equality within the self that enabled them to be self - 213sufficient. Janice described how the f emale and m ale traits balanced her ability to care for herself. I just kind of think there's an equality there that I've had to be lonely, I've had to be the guy and the girl. The tom boyness, I m ean m y dad teaching me how to put chains on a tire and how to change a tire, and all those kinds of things because I was the son that had died, I was the son that he didn't have. But then also they wanted m e to be independent so where did the line stop. Maybe I would not have been as strong, you know, as capable to take care of m yself. So you just never know. Alita was able to com bine her f eminine and m asculine characteristics and enact them with her body. She rem embered being satisfied with her ability to do that; she took her independence and com bined it with a com fort in displaying her feminine body as a free wom an. She said, I didn't wear a bra for a long tim e. I had nice little firm ones and I didn't wear . . . and I still hate bras. That's the f irst thing that com es off when I come hom e. It was just a liberator. Disco. You kind of you could dance by yourself. You didn't have to have a partner. You could just dance. W omen and wom en danced together. It was fun but it was probably m ore than anything associated with for m e was liberation, freedom . In a lot of ways as a wom an, in a lot of ways as a Chicano and a lot of ways is just being proud of who I was and what I was. Being happy about all of it. Donna described herself as having both m asculine and fem inine traits. She said she was criticized f or having both, and it was not until she was over 50 years of age that she felt com fortable with these characteristics. You don't know if you're m ale, fem ale. You don't know what your gender is or anything because all you've done is responsible for everybody else. And played whatever role you had to play to get it done. So I will never lose a lot of m ale characteristics because I grew up with them but I no longer am worried about whether about oh, what am I trying to say? I don't feel like a bad person anym ore. 214Charlotte said that her children saw her as the weaker parent until she was able to combine both her fem inine and m asculine characteristics to show she could be nurturing as well as strong and independent. She had to assert herself to get what she needed for herself because in her late r years there was no one left to care for her but herself. Discrepancies in Womanhood The wom en had a personal view of wh at it was to be wom en, which m ay or m ay not have been the way they lived their lives. Tension occurred when the wom en perceived their lives as contrary to their ideal vision of wom anhood. In order to illustrate the wom en's ideal view s verses the actual lives of the wom en and how that af fected their ability to adap t to changes with aging f our exam ples were presented. The first exam ple was Betty. She wa s som eone who had a discrepancy between her ideal view of being a wom an and her own experience. Betty wanted to be a housewife and a painter since ch ildhood. She said, \"But as a kiddo, a child, a young child, I really didn't have a goal. I wanted to be a housewife.\" Later, she added, Well, I really wanted to do m ore cooking and quilting....I never had really wanted to be a career person at all. As a child m y ideal was to be a hom e maker and to do art. I always felt like....I had an aunt that did som e painting, and in m y grandm other's house, above her little old door in the kitchen was this little picture of a canoe and a little stream and m ountain and som e trees and a m oon, it was a night scene. And I just thought oh, to be able to paint like that. Betty becam e a teacher and taught until she retired. She never thought she would work as long as she did but her husband was unable to m aintain steady 215employm ent. They always needed the extr a incom e. Betty also wanted to be a mother but was unable to conceive. The di screpancies between her ideal of what it would have been to be a wom an and her actual experiences created a tension. She worked out strategies to adjust to those discrepancies. For instance, she talked of inspiring her cousin to be an artist, a nd she brought in foreign exchange students in order to understand the experience of parenting. Overall, she said, \"You learn to adjust and you learn to accept things as they are.\" W hen she did not develop a strategy contrary to her view of bei ng a wom an she suffered. For exam ple, she could not leave the house because the lif t on her car was broke. She was waiting for her husband to have it fixed. It was not he r role to have their vehicles serviced. It was not the role of a wom an to take charge and call som eone to com e to her home and fix the lift. A second exam ple of a wom an who ha d a discrepancy between her ideal and actual developm ent as a wom an was Pa tsy. She wanted to be a wife and a mother. She was both. The discrepancy cam e when her husband left her and her second husband abused her. She had to work and live in a shelter with her children. This was not her view of wo manhood. She said her view of being a wom an was one who was m arried and gave herself to a husband who respected and cared for her. As far as being a wom an, I think a wom an should be loved and respected but I think she needs to be under the um brella of her husband. She should not have all the burdens put on her. I think that's the reason that God said that we're to be obedient to our husbands and not for him to step on us or slap us around or be our boss. To be our helpm ate. I think you're supposed to be as the husband is the head of the house, you're supposed to be in a place of honor. W e don't need all the responsibilities of everything that sometimes we put our self in there and that responsibility of. As far as 216wom en's rights, yeah. I think we have rights. W e have rights to have fresh air. To breathe. W e have rights to raise our children in a Godly m anner. In a manner that they should be safe and not scared every m orning. Do we have rights to our own bodies? To a degree. Bodies are not ours. If we're married, our bodies belong to our husbands. Patsy adapted to this discrepancy by rea lizing that her experiences as a wom an were unlike those that she wanted. She knew she m ight never exist as her ideal wom an and it was a continual struggle. She continued to seek an ideal partner but was prepared to care for herself. She said, \"I see it as a life struggle. I told Joe the other day...I said buddy I've got m y talons out, you better behave yourself, meaning as sweet and gentle as I like to be I still have that part in m e that, you know, leave m e alone or I'll rip you to pieces.\" The third exam ple of a wom an with a discrepancy in her view of wom anhood and her actual life was Charlo tte. Again, she wanted to be a housewife and a m other. Her life did not work out that way as she aged. Her first husband left her. Her second husband died after 1 year of m arriage. She was living with friends on a fixed incom e. She saw wom en as the weaker sex who needed to be cared for by a spouse. In an ideal world, the m an is the head of the house. He works. He provides so; therefore, the wom an would have a provider. That's in an ideal world. We're talking about physical needs, em otional needs. W omen are usually, even though W omen's Lib doesn't like to hear it, usually thought of as the weaker sex. Earlier in life, Charlotte had adapted to the discrepancy by working because life demanded it, but her health prevented he r from continuing to work. She was far removed from her ideal wom an because she was unable to be m arried and cared for by a spouse and she could not work to care for herself. Ultim ately, she had to 217accept the discrepancy and negotiate governm ent program s in order to receive enough financial assistance to pay her bills and survive. I think that each day is a challenge to find som ething that you can do and do well and accom plish som ething. I think everybody has to have that feeling every day that they've done som ething. I try to find those things every day, som ething. Types of things that I have to look for are so different from what other people do or what I used to do. It's very different. It's very difficult to . . . I used to have been able to get up and put som ething on in the crock pot before you go to work. Then work ten hours, com e hom e and have friends over and eat what you cooked in the crock pot, and play a gam e of cards. You know just a full day to where you have to just really negotiate your day. You have to give and take. The final exam ple was of a wom an whose lif e was sim ilar to her ideal view of being a wom an. Jackie never wanted to m arry or to have children. She wanted to have a career and to have a hom e. The ideal wom an was independent and strong but able to care for others. She becam e an arm y nurse. You don't need a m an to, you know, be a wom an...I just didn't have the endurance to continue but I could do everything. But no, I knew I could be self-sufficient. I didn't want children. I didn't want to take care . . . I didn't want to cook and clean for som ebody else. I don't even do it for m yself. I have a housekeeper you know. No. Never. Jackie planned her life around her ideal of what it was to be a wom an. Then I realized okay, I've got to have a future. I've got to take care of myself. I don't want to get m arried. W hat retirem ent am I going to have? Social Security? Forget that. You couldn't live off of that so that's when I thought well, okay, m ilitary is pretty good. Ten years is the point you either stay in or you get out. Then I realized okay, I've got to have a future. I've got to take care of m yself. I don't want to get m arried. W hat retirem ent am I going to have? Social Security? Forget that. Jackie's strategies f or adjusting to the changes with aging coincided with her ideal of wom anhood. She had the resources she needed for health care through the 218military and she said her needs f or nurturi ng were m et in her relationships with her cats and her nieces. Summary In order to adapt to the changes associated with aging the wom en had to balance their perceptions of self as being both m asculine and fem inine. These characteristics allowed them to be str ong and independent wom en who could ask for what they needed to survive while nurturing their bodies and those they cared for in their lives. At the sam e time the wom en's ideal views of being wom en influenced their experience in the world. In other words, their ideal view of what it meant to be wom en and live as wom en in the world were used as criteria for which to judge their lives. The wom en were trying to act in ways consistent with their views of what a wom an was; they were frustrated if they had to act out their lives in ways that did not coincide with these views. Overall, there was a tension between their ability to balance percepti ons of them selves and perceptions of what a wom an should be. They struggled w ith this tension while adapting to ever changing im pairm ents that dem anded they continue to assert them selves in order to survive. 219 Chapter 6: Summary, Conclusions, & Recommendations This chapter sum marizes the study, provides conclusions, and m akes recom mendations for future studies. Speci fically, an overview of the purpose, research question, m ethodology, data anal ysis techniques, and findings are provided. This is followed by a discussi on of conclusions drawn from the study findings. Finally, a discussion of reco mmendations for future studies, nursing practice, and health policy is detailed. SUMMARY The purpose of this herm eneutic phenom enological study was to explore and convey an understanding of the m eaning of aging for wom en with childhood onset disability. This was a qualitative lif e course study of aging for wom en who had im pairm ent related to paralytic polio at age 13 or younger. It was the intention of the researcher to gain descri ptions of the experiences wom en had with growing up and growing older with im pairm ents. The researcher also intended to gain a herm eneutic phenom enological descri ption of the changes associated with aging, a description of how they adapted to those changes, and a description of how perceptions of gender inf luenced their ability to adapt to the changes associated with aging. Thirty-two wom en were interviewed two to four tim es over a 6 m onth period for a total of 96 intervie ws that lasted approxim ately 1 to 4 hours each. These interviews were transcribed into nearly 4,000 pages of double spaced text. Of the 32 wom en who particip ated in the study, 25 were chosen for 220the final analysis of the lived expe rience of aging with a childhood onset disability. The wom en's descriptions were analyzed and presented using herm eneutic phenom enological m ethods (Cohen, Kahn, & Steeves, 2000). For purposes of gaining an understanding of aging produced from the vast am ount of text, the life course was broken down into childhood (0 to 12 years), adolescence (13 to 22 years), young adulthood (23 to 34 years), middle adulthood (35 to 54 years), and later adulthood or now (55 to 65 years). W ithin each period of life, areas of the life course paradigm , which included the environm ent, their individual perceptions of self, and their relations hips with others, were used as an organizational and sensitizing f ramework to give structure to the lif e course. Them es and sub-them es that described the changes associated with aging and how they adapted to the changes were descri bed, as were the them es and sub-them es that described how their gender im pacted their experiences. Findings indicated that their ch ildhood was characterized by feeling peculiar, which represented the way the in fection disrupted their existence as the children they m ight have otherwise been without polio. Being peculiar m eant the wom en were special, distinctive, and odd, which represented the way the wom en felt within their bodies as they were unabl e to m ove or will their bodies to action. It also represented how they lived in the world. The peculiarity of their bodies was em bedded within a tim e and place that dem anded people do for them selves in order to survive. During this tim e, the wo men interacted with healthcare providers who frequently treated them as uninform ed objects. They rem embered parents 221who sacrificed for them while pushing th em to do for them selves as m uch as humanly possible. As adolescents, the wom en becam e conscious of a growing potential f or a traditional or norm al life. Th ey were also becom ing adolescents in a tim e when people learned the need to question authority; therefore, these wom en learned to assert their will within their relationships. They learned to assert their will in order to gain access at a tim e when access was not a legal right. As young adults the wom en began to achieve within the roles they had chosen. Their bodies and experiences were no longe r perceived as peculiar. They were demanding excellence from them selves in every relationship they had. The wom en's achievem ents fed their desire to do m ore with their lives during a tim e when wom en were f ighting f or equality in environm ents that were openly discrim inatory. Middle adulthood was ch aracterized by the wom en achieving success while pushing their bodies to declin e. The decline threatened their past, present, and future identity. It could not be ignored. During this tim e, many of the wom en felt a com mitment to also care for ailing parents. In later adulthood, the wom en were focused on preserving thei r bodies through efforts to conserve energy. They were no longer pushing them selves to achieve. They were preserving their bodies to do what m any took for granted. They no longer had the energy to overcom e obstacles in the environm ent that they took for granted as younger wom en. They were learning to relate to others as interdependent wom en. It was no longer a tim e and place where pe ople did for them selves. W ith age the wom en learned that people do for each other. 222The m eaning of the changes they a ssociated with aging and how they adapted to those changes were described with f our them es: Aging and Polio: It's Just Part of Me, Slowing Down, the Par ticulars of Aging, and the Journey that Changes You. The wom en saw and felt cha nges in their bodies that were the result of both polio and aging. Aging m eant that had slowed down; they were no longer able to sustain the efforts it took to push their bodies to overcom e obstacles in their daily lives. Given the com bined affects of aging and polio, the wom en knew they were aging in a m anner that was out of synchrony with those who did not have im pairm ents. The wom en's e xperiences were not sim ilar to those reported by friends or relatives, which added to the unique experience they perceived. They saw aging as a journey that had changed them in form , perception, and ability. The wom en consider ed the m eaning of aging within the context of their ability to overcom e continued im pairm ent by changing roles, activities, and perspectives on life. Succe ss in aging was based on their ability to find synchrony between how they perceived them selves and their ability to act on their own behalf. Finally, how gender im pacted their experiences was considered in the context of aging and im pairm ent. Two them es em erged from their stories: Perceptions of a Balanced Self and Discrepancies in W omanhood. Again, adapting to the changes associated with aging was based on the wom en's ability to find synchrony between how they percei ved them selves and their ability to act on their own behalf. Their gender was larg ely perceived as having both m asculine and fem inine characteristics. They were ra ised to be independent, self-sufficient, 223nurturing, and com passionate beings. They had to balance these characteristics to assert what their needs were in society while nurturing and being com passionate to them selves and those close to them . At the sam e time the wom en had views of what it m eant to be wom en. Those who lived lives dif ferently f rom their perceptions of what it m eant to be wo men found adapting to the changes with aging m ost dif ficult. Exam ples were provided to illustrate this point. In sum , this was a study of the meaning of aging for wom en with childhood onset disability due to paralytic po lio at or before the age of 13. Thirty- two wom en participated in the interviews, while the stories of 25 were used f or the herm eneutic phenom enological analysis of aging. The life course was detailed from childhood to later adulthood. Moreove r, the m eaning of aging and the influence of gender on adaptation to the changes associated with aging were described. Overall, the wom en com mitted th eir energy to living a f ull life. They adapted to increasing im pairm ent and unforeseen events through various strategies over the lif e course. They chose strategies that allowed them to maintain their perceptions of them selves while acting on their own behalf to fulfill the roles they wanted as wom en. DISCUSSION This was one of the first known qua litative studies to integrate the experiences of gender, aging, and disability within a life course paradigm in a sample of wom en large enough to reach saturation. The lived experiences of the wom en from childhood to later adulthood we re analyzed into them es and sub- them es in order to give others a cl earer understanding of their life course 224experiences and the m eaning they assigne d to aging. The findings indicated that age and gender interacted over tim e to in fluence the wom en's ability to adapt to their changing bodies. The wom en perceived changes in their bodies and in their perspectives of self growth. The wom en were able to adapt to the changes with aging by finding synchrony between their per ceptions of self and their ability to act on their own behalf. The wom en percei ved that their gender im pacted this process because the balance between m asculine and fem inine characteristics was a salient aspect of their selves and because the m eaning of wom anhood was a marker they used to judge their selves. Im pairm ent did not necessarily dam age their ability to act on their behalf or to becom e their ideal wom en. Many other lif e circum stances, m any of which m ay be common to wom en without disabilities within society, com bined with their im pairments to inf luence the m eaning they gave to aging and how they adapted to aging. This herm eneutic phenom enological study provided evidence for the assertion that f unctional decline with ag e for wom en with disabilities m ay not be a purely biological necessity (Stuifbergen & Becker, 2001); behavioral components were perceived to have b een influenced by their psychological, social, and environm ental circum stances, which m ight have influenced the rate and tim ing of decline. In other words, th ese circum stances were perceived to have affected their life choices and their subs equent health. The wom en gave specific exam ples of how their perceptions of their psychological, social, and environm ental context im pacted their d ecisions of how to care for their bodies. For exam ple, the wom en grew up in an environm ent where people did for 225them selves and they were encouraged to be independent by their parents. Subsequently, the wom en grew up with a strong desire to be self-sufficient wom en. Over tim e, their will to achieve was a strong push for them to continue despite physical consequences. Moreover, the wom en pushed them selves to fulfill multiple roles in order to f ulfill their n eed to be wom en in this society, while frequently ignoring or not being able to attend to their health. At first glance one m ight discern that wom en with im pairm ents should not push them selves to achieve, especially wh ile fulfilling m ultiple roles, but this m ay not be a reasonable recom mendation. It should be considered that the wom en chose their m ultiple roles within the def ined cultural expectations of what it was to be wom en. The wom en were not spectator s to the culture in which they aged; they were participants within their cu lture succeeding in their culturally assigned roles to the best of their ability. The wom en stated they did not regret pushing them selves; they valued their achieve ments after experiencing decline. One cannot expect wom en with disabilities to ta ke on fewer roles or strive for fewer achievem ents within society in order to pr eserve their bodies. W hat would they be preserving them for? After all, their ability to adapt to change was based upon their ability to find synchrony between thei r perception of self and their abilities to act on their own behalf; the wom en bala nced perceptions of their self with perceptions of what it was to be wom en. Fulf illing m ultiple roles and becom ing independent was part of their adaptation to aging across the life course as wom en. It would be reasonable to recom mend that wom en with disabilities live the lives that balance their perceptions of achie vement in wom anhood with their perception 226of their bodies' needs; not to live lives contradictory to their perceptions and expectations as wom en. Achievem ents were a factor in both the satisfaction they found in life and in their desire to push their bodies. Th e wom en were able to achieve num erous career-related awards. They also repor ted working longer hours and doing extra work in order to prove them selves as cap able. This had a high cost but m any said they would not have done it any other way. It is a concern, however, that a wom an with a disability would perceive the need to work this hard in order to maintain or gain em ploym ent. The wom en's intrinsic push to work harder than others without im pairm ents m ay lim it their tim e in the work force and there are few societal resources available to s upport wom en who leave work at an early age. It was the purpose of this research to convey an understanding of how wom en with disabilities age. As the r eader m oved through the descriptions, I hoped he or she would com pare the aging pr ocess of these wom en to their own. In doing this, one m ight ask how different a nd how sim ilar their experiences were from those of wom en with disabilities described in this docum ent. In com paring this research to prior findings of agi ng wom en, sim ilarities were found in wom en of a sim ilar age and in wom en of an ol der age. For instance, Rossi (1980) found that wom en of the baby boom er generation m ay experience strain in their lives as they try to live their daily lives during times of social change. Although the exact nature of their lives was different, the wo men with polio also experienced strain as they tried to live their lives during tim es of change in disability and wom en's 227rights. For instance, the wom en acknowledged the strain in com munication and interaction that exists between people with and without im pairm ents. Som e also reported discontent with the wom en's ri ght m ovem ent because its principles clashed with the way they wanted to live their lives as wom en. There were sim ilarities in these wom en's experiences and the experiences of the elderly wom en described by Day (1991). The wom en in Day's study described independence and ability as im portant factors in their well-being. The wom en were balancing health problem s with their desire for independent living. They did not want to be burdens upon thei r children in their old age. Few wanted to live with other people and those that di d were frequently less content. This was similar to m any of the experiences de scribed by the wom en with polio. The wom en in this study did not wish to be a burden upon their children or fam ilies and those that lived with f riends or children voiced discontent with these situations. A dif ference in the wom en with polio, however, was that they were 20 to 30 years younger when they described these experiences. The wom en in this study com pared th emselves as wom en to their ideal wom en when they discussed the m eaning of aging. Many of their lives as wom en were different than their ideal view of wom anhood. This finding was consistent with self-discrepancy theory as desc ribed by Higgins (1987) and Heidrich and Ryff (1993). According to Heidrich and Ry ff successful aging is related to how well people's views of their ideal self matches with their view of their actual self . This study contributes to that theory by showing how views of an ideal gender may contribute to successful aging. 228This study supported the conceptualization of paralytic polio as an experience of disability not chronic illn ess. The wom en were raised f rom childhood not to take on a sick role iden tity; therefore, the wom en did not view aging with polio as aging with illne ss. Many studies (Charm az, 1991; Lewis, 1992; Thorne, 1993) have relied upon chronic illness perspectives to situate the experiences of their participants. This study provides evidence that wom en with polio have experienced their lives as im paired but not always ill. Perceiving the self as dif ferent but not ill was a prom inent aspect of their disability experiences. Their perceptions of not being ill f acilitate d their norm alization into various roles as adult wom en. Many of the wom en did not know their bodies without the effects of polio because they were inf ected at such early ages. There was an altered ability to use the body but the body was not ill. The body could be used to its full potential. The lived experience w ith a life-long disability, such as those related to polio, m ay be dif ferent than the lived experience with a chronic illness over the life course. This study contributed to the understa nding of life course im pairm ent due to paralytic polio. From the previous research with 15 polio survivors by Wenneberg and Ahlstrom (2000) it was lear ned that polio survivors m ay progress through the acute phase with severe illne ss, the rehabilitation phase, the phase of stability, the phase of functional loss, and the phase of new dependence on technology as they age over the life cour se. The current study of wom en aging with polio reported here added to that knowledge by conveying how those phases may blur or overlap. The wom en's abilities m ay have declined over tim e with 229increasing im pairm ent but the salient role s and social obligations within their lives were the factors that defined these phases in their m inds. In other words, a phase of stability was stable if the self and the body were able to achieve the wom an's desired end within her chosen roles. Instability within the body was over looked if achievem ents were attained. Once im pairm ent becam e an obstacle to achievem ent then the phase of decline was perceived. The wom en adm itted knowing that changes in their body were happening long before they verbalized knowledge of decline or sought help for d ecline. The phases of decline described by W enneberg & Ahlstrom (2000) were de fined by these wom en as relative to their ability to f ulfill their roles as wom en and this varied over the lif e course. Living in the world was an em bodied experience for the wom en. Having had polio was an experience in our so ciety that was perceived through their bodies. The experience of self as disabled was not a separate experience from any other experience in their lives. As wom en, they journeyed through life in their bodies, which were im paired due to the effects of polio from a young age. From these experiences the wom en saw their bodies from within a continuum of ability, which had changed for them as it does for everyone. One em bodied experience the wom en had that was worse than having polio was abuse. Abuse was a frequently reported occurrence during the life course of these wom en. The wom en were not recruited for a study of abuse nor were they specifically asked if they were abused. The occurrence of life tim e experience with abuse was sim ilar to the findings of Young and colleagues (1997). They reported that 62% of their participants had experienced abuse in 230their lives. In the current study, 64 % repor ted som e type of abuse over their life course and of those 16% reported bot h childhood and adulthood abuse. These wom en reported childhood sexual, physical, and verbal abuse by parents, relatives, or healthcare providers and of adult physical and sexual abuse by marital partners or healthcare providers. Their stories of abuse were told as pa rt of their life course experiences as wom en with childhood onset disabilities and should be understood within that context. The abuse was contextualized within their em bodied experiences as wom en. Although quantitative studies have ex amined the incidence of abuse, few studies have exam ined the experiences of life course abuse in aging wom en with disabilities. Instead, abuse is of ten com partmentalized into dom estic violence, childhood abuse, or sexual violence agai nst wom en. The stories told by these wom en indicated that the abuses were all attacks on the self and body regardless of the labels given to them at any certa in point in tim e. The wom en in this study described feeling less self-esteem and probl ems with trust af ter the abuse. It m ay be helpful to study different types of a buse in order to acutely treat the wom en and stop the perpetrators; however, wom en aging into later adulthood with disabilities m ay need to deal with m ultiple types of abuse f or different reasons. Many of the perpetrators are long deceas ed, and the problem may not be ongoing abusive situations. This does not m ean the problem s are gone. Many aging wom en with im pairm ents m ay need to adjust to the psychological issues surrounding the various abusive situations they have faced as they age, especially if they experience increasing vulnerability with age. 231As suggested in the literature, the wo men were capable of integrating both positive and negative experiences in order to gain m eaning in their lives (Hulbert & Lens, 1988). The wom en reviewed their liv es to find experiences that helped them to gain m eaning in aging. This proce ss helped them to m ake their lives their own. Frequently, the wom en would find growth by com paring negative experiences in their youth to positive e xperiences in later adulthood. The wom en also com pared positive experiences in their young adulthood to negative experiences in later adulthood to dem onstrate their ability to adapt to the problem s. The wom en would point out how they had changed in perspective, ability, and wisdom . The wom en experienced developm ental change with age; as the them es over the life course were reviewed it was clear that their age influenced the way they adapted to their disability. Their im pairm ents were varied both in severity and in im pact upon their individual lives. Yet, the response to the im pairm ent changed in com mon ways for the group over the years. Personal and social views of their age influenced their reaction and the reaction of others to their impairm ents. For exam ple, the wom en were encouraged to be independent as children but encouraged to be m ore dependent as older adults. They were no longer treated as na\u00efve, uniform ed objects to be cared for by those with authority as they were when they were young. If the wom en perceived they were being treated this way they asserted their disdai n for this treatm ent. At the sam e time, as older adults they were expected to seek out help when needed. The wom en's perspectives of them selves and their bodies also changed. They knew to think 232before they acted and to act on their ow n behalf. It was clear that the wom en perceived developm ental changes over the years in them selves and in the reaction of others to them . The experiences reported with agi ng over the life course contained commonalities that em erged within each category of life (childhood to later adulthood). These were not, however, c onsidered fixed age categories for experiences. For instance, som e wom en experienced decline earlier than others, while som e wom en entered the work f orce at different tim es. W hat I reported was the com mon experiences that em erged. In other words, as the wom en viewed aging from different perspectives these com mon experiences em erged within each category. Further reports using case studies methods will allow for the analysis and reporting of individual differences within the participants' experiences. In Gadow's (1982) phenom enological treatise on aging and illness, she posited that aesthetic m eaning could be found in old age as the elderly viewed their aging bodies. In this study of agi ng with polio, m eaning was found in their experiences; they found m eaning in thei r achievem ents and trium phs over their life course. In later adulthood, the wom en also found the need to acknowledge and value their bodies' contribution to the lived experience. Many were committed to im proving their bodies' condition. After all, they could not exist in the world without their bodies. These wom en did not view them selves as old and many did not like the changes they saw w ith aging in their bodies. They did not find aesthetic value in the appearance of their bodies, but they found a value and commitment to preserve their bodies. 233Putnam (2002) posited that current ge rontological theoretical fram eworks hold potential f or being linked with disability theories to guide research on aging with a disability. Based upon this researc h, Baltes and Baltes' (1990) theory of selection, optim ization, and com pensation could be adapted to understand the experience of wom en aging with chil dhood onset disabilities. Baltes and Baltes focus their theory upon how an individual activity is continued by an aging person with age-related decline. I would suggest that in order to adapt this to a gerontological fram ework for wom en with life long im pairm ents, it m ust be considered that com pletely new tasks m ay need to be selected over the life course as abilities change. The environm ents of the wom en must be optim ized with age due to changes in disability with age. Moreover, the wom en must continually compensate for changes in their bodi es by using various accom modations. For wom en with childhood onset im pairm ents, selection, optim ization, and compensation is a life long dynam ic pro cess that m ay require creativity and flexibility in order to select new activities, build optim al environm ents, and compensate f or changing abilities. The theoretical foundations behind the concept of successful aging (Rowe and Kahn, 1987) did not allow for an unde rstanding of the aging experience of these wom en living with im pairm ent related to polio. The wom en frequently experienced lif e altering events and m anaged m ultiple roles that m ay have contributed to their physical deteriora tion. These wom en were interviewed about their lif e course experiences, which indicated that m any adapted to m ultiple traum atic events in their lives with varying levels of residual effects. It would be 234inappropriate to judge one wom an as ag ing m ore successful than another wom an based upon researcher defined health-re lated criteria. A m ore appropriate theoretical concept for understanding outco mes related to aging with disabilities would be resiliency. According to Gattuso (2003), resilient aging is a process of integrating loss and growth over tim e in order to cons truct a self -image that af firms to the wom an that she is well despite sustaining mental and physical injuries to her body and m ind. W omen aging with im pairm ents may acquire an ability to construct memories of the loss they experienced into evidence that they are able to sustain enum erable problem s, both physical and em otional, and rem ain productive and positive m embers of society. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH This research indicated that interventi ons adapted to im prove the health of wom en aging with polio should be tailored to their need to fulfill roles as wom en while fostering the preservation of th eir bodies. The goal of the intervention would be to turn their w ill to achieve in a positive direction that m ight benef it health as well as im prove quality of life. For instance, one of the wom en adapted to the changes with aging by inventing adaptive devices for other wom en with impairm ents. She patented two inventions , sold them , and used them for her own needs. It is not suggested that all wom en do this. It is suggested, however, that interventions be designed that fulfill both the needs of the body and the self. Being told to quit work and rest cannot be the only intervention for wom en who have dem anded m ore over their life course. 235Limited tim e in the work f orce m ay have considerable af fects on quality of life from a social and f inancial perspective. During the tim e of these interviews, the wom en and society were not prepared f or early retirem ent due to disability. Although m ost of the wom en were able to qualify for disability social security benefits, this was stated to be ar ound $500.00 per m onth. If the wom en did not work long enough for an em ployer with retirem ent benefits or were not m arried to someone who had a retirem ent package they reported a lim ited incom e. Moreover, two wom en had invested m oney for retirem ent but lost it in the recent recession; therefore, they were unable to benefit from those efforts when they retired. The wom en described increasing m edical and health-related needs which included m edications, assistive devices, personal assistants for groom ing, house cleaning, and/or lawn care, and physical therapy at a tim e when they were going on a fixed incom e. Future studies shoul d address how wom en with im pairm ents may best plan for retirem ent, which m ay occur at earlier ages for these wom en than for other m en and wom en in our culture. The wom en in this study com pleted a demographic form that asked about employm ent status. A large portion of the sam ple indicated they were retired when they com pleted the f ill in the blank f orm. Others indicated they were unem ployed due to their disabilities. During the course of the interviews all but one of the wom en indicated that the reason they left the workforce was because of their increasing im pairm ents. This has im plications f or survey research on work and wom en with disabilities. It is m ore so cially desirable to state that the reason for unem ploym ent is retirem ent. Over tim e, with increasing age, the person m ay 236claim retirem ent status instead of une mploym ent due to disability. Along with employm ent status, researchers m ay want to ask the reason the person left the work force and at what age. This study was lim ited to the age cohort between 55 to 65 years of age. It relied upon the m emories of the lived e xperience of growing up and older with impairm ent. Future studies should study various cohorts separated by varying ages. There is also a need for longit udinal studies that follow wom en with disabilities over the life course. Longitudinal studies could docum ent objective and subjective descriptions of change with aging. Future studies should also com pare these findings to other groups aging with childhood onset im pairm ent. One m ight study the experiences of m en aging with im pairm ent. Studying a group of m en aging with polio m ight indicate differences in how gender affects experi ences between sexes. Moreover, studying wom en with other types of im pairm ent might provide needed inform ation on the similarities in the aging experiences acro ss disability types. This could lead to interventions for wom en aging with various im pairm ents. Two possible groups to study would be those with juvenile onset rheum atoid arthritis and those with congenital cardiac abnorm alities. Both of th ese groups have been neglected in the literature f rom a life course perspective. Another needed area of research is with m inority populations aging with childhood onset im pairm ent. I was able to recruit five Hispanic and two African American wom en for this study, but m ore we re needed to interpret the life course experiences of the different cultural groups. Based upon the work in this study, 237saturation would be possible after approxim ately 15 to 20 participants in each group. Life course descriptions of the lives of wom en with disabilities of fer the reader a chronology of perceptions that may indicate critical tim es that m ay benefit from intervention (Frank, 1996). Acco rding to these wom en, they began to experience decline in their young adult hood. They also experienced num erous falls and accidents during this tim e that led to further health problem s. It would be beneficial to study wom en with other t ypes of disabilities to see if there are commonalities in this experience. If there are com monalities, interventions to prevent accidents and decline in young adulthood m ay postpone further decline in later adulthood for wom en with m ultiple types of physical im pairm ents. This would be an im portant area for further research. Another critical tim e in the wom en's lives was during later adulthood when they began to lead interdependent lives. Many of the wom en found asking for assistance dif ficult. Som e verbalized that they wished their f amilies would know to do things without being aske d. Other wom en found it easy to ask for assistance once they began to realize th eir ability to barter f or services. For instance, they had to realize they had som ething to offer the person helping them . Interventions developed to help wom en with disabilities adjust to giving and receiving help m ight be critical to psychological adjustm ent during later adulthood. 238RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE & P UBLIC POLICY An im portant finding of this res earch was that wom en aging with impairm ents experience m any of the sam e roles and social pressures that wom en aging without im pairm ents experience. The problem was that m any of these issues have been neglected or unexplored in wom en with disabilities. How they experience their lives and what affect va rious social problem s have on their lives has only recently been included in such initiatives as Healthy People 2010. Women with and without disabilities have com monalities in experiences, therefore, there is reason to include and adapt our health care guidelines to include wom en with disabilities within all policie s written f or wom en. Moreover, it is the responsibility of all wom en to push for soci al change to ensure that wom en with disabilities have im proved lives as they live out m any of the sam e social roles and obligations as wom en without defined im pairm ents. This position m ay appear to be wit hout controversy but fem inists have historically argued for social change based upon anti-essentialist argum ents because essentialism pushes wom en into a lesser or different category. These argum ents against essentialism have led to further questioning of the m eaning of gender. The anti-essentialist argum ent posits that wom en do not represent one united group (Tong, 1998). The m iddle class white wom an's identity is not the identity of the black wom an (Collins, 2000) or other wom en separated by class, nationality, and /or race. Moreover, wom en were separated by sexuality, age, and disability. W omen have been left wit hout a united reason for grouping together, 239for calling them selves to action, and fo r studying their situation because wom en are said to have dif fering identities. At first glance, I began to think that no theoretical or philosophical perspective could unite wom en without re verting back to an essentialist view. Multiple identities of being wom en were needed to prom ote discourse on wom en in dif ferent situations. In other words, wom en with disabilities needed to be separated as a group in order to discuss their needs. If wom en were united by commonalities that did not allow f or differences, those com monalities would be equal to stereotypical essentialist characteristics. The special needs of wom en with disabilities would not em erge if they were not separated out as a group. In other words, wom en would be described as being stereotypically alike in som e fundam ental way and their individual needs would not em erge. Women's m ultiple identities allowed people to see wom en in dif pr omoted wom en's social position. Yet, the question would always arise as to w hose voice was being heard and whose voice was being answered (Alcoff, 1991-92) . If the voices of wom en without impairm ents were heard as different than the voices of wom en with im pairm ents, whose voice would be the loudest and whose voice should health care researchers and providers listen to when m aking health care and policy decisions? Is it practical or beneficial to have separa te health care policy decisions for wom en with and without im pairm ent? Furthe rmore, when individual m edical care becom es a question of social causes that im pact the body, which guidelines for health care do practitioners f ollow? Can guide lines be designed to apply to a large 240diverse population or would our entire health care system have to revert back to standards that each health care provider decided upon within the context of each interaction? This would place the person seeking care in a position com pletely vulnerable to the ability and m ind set of the practitioner diagnosing their body without any guidelines that specify what should be done. In order to advance m y position on the combined efforts of wom en for the good of wom en with and without im pairments in a postm odern discourse, the concept of positionality as posited by Alco ff (1997) was used. W ithin this view, the wom an was not an essentialist being but a socially constructed person that has been defined by her self in the socio-historical context that situates her (Alcoff, 1997). The anatom y and the society do not se parately define the sex or gender (p. 351). The wom an was defined by her pe rception of wom anhood com bined with her culture's influence on her perception set within an evolving point in tim e. This definition of wom an em erged not as an objective label but as a position from which to take action as a united group (Alcoff, 1988). This view does not dem and that only one identity be that of wom an. It acknowledged that society com bines with the individual to create a force that defined the wom an. W omen of all abilitie s could com bine to f ight problem s existing in an area based on their gender b ecause the society has categorized them as that object, wom an, and their iden tity has been changed due to that categorization. Society defines the subject and the subject responds to it as it develops that identity. 241Young's description of a social collective (Young, 1994) was also important for use in this argum ent. To understand wom en in relation to a collective without placing them into a category of com mon attributes, Young (1994) used Sartre's serial collectivit y. This work described how wom en, who were a series, com bined as a group ove r a self-conscious purpose that united them . When wom en were a series, the objects that surrounded them united the wom en. W hen wom en were a group, the purpose behind an action united them . When wom en were a series their id entity was not def ined by m embership in the series (Young, 1994), and they were interchangeable people. This m eans that wom en com e and go in the series of wom en like a group shopping at the grocery store. They do not take on gr ocery store identity and any wom an doing her shopping there can be a m ember of the series. However, if the grocery store began to hike prices and the wom en unite d as a group to com bat that inflation they would take on a com mon purpose and form a group. This would be independent of their separate iden tities of race, sexuality, or abilities. Through this analogy using Sartre 's serial collectivity (Young, 1994), wom en could becom e a group com bating a problem , such as those experienced by wom en aging with paralytic polio. Using the concepts of positionality and serial collective, I can assert that wom en and wom en with disabilities should be viewed as a group with com mon interests. They should unite to help one another to overcom e com mon health and social problem s, such as obesity, sexual abuse, and depression. For purposes of health care wom en must unite in their efforts to gain the best possible health. This m eans that guidelines in wom en's health should not 242be viewed as com plete by any wom an without being com plete for all wom en. For instance, m ultiple resources are available for practitioners on osteoporosis prevention. General guidelines often do not include ways to prevent osteoporosis in wom en with disabilities. These types of guidelines f or wom en with disabilities have been published in separate jour nals. Practitioners m ust look for these guidelines separately. This type of sepa ration of wom en's health care guidelines must cease in order for all wom en to gain equal access to the best possible care, and all wom en must unite to push for e qual access to health care for all wom en, which include those aging with life long im pairm ents. Building upon the first recom mendation, a second policy recom mendation is related to the use of age entitlem ents for the distribution of retirem ent benef its. Chronological age is the basis for social security benefits despite am biguous indications for it as a m eaningful reason to distribute benefits. Using the age of 65 excludes benef its for wom en with disabilities who retire due to increasing impairm ent that prohibits their continued pa rticipation in the work f orce. Most of the wom en in this study were able to gain m inimal benefits from disability insurance; however, the process was de scribed as hum iliating and taxing on their already stressed abilities. Moreover, m any of the wom en pref erred to describe them selves as retired, not unem ployed due to disability. They indicated f urther disability-related stigm a when leaving the work f orce despite adm irable work histories that should have been praised. All wom en should consider the ramifications of the current policy. Social security retirem ent should be work and 243ability graded not an age entitlem ent that som e may never reach and others can work far past. A third recom mendation for those con cerned with policy is the use of wom en who have lived a significant portion of their lives with im pairm ents as consultants in environm ental accom modations built for persons with disabilities. Accom modations are intended for people w ith im pairm ents. Moreover, they m ay be an expense to the person installing them . Accom modations that do not help persons with im pairm ents or hum iliate them during use are not an ef fective m eans for im proving access to the environm ent; therefore, before installing an adaptation consult a knowledgeable and sensitive person with im pairm ent. After all, there is an em otional and utilitarian aspect to each accom modation. Som ething m ight work to provide access but break down th e spirit. This recom mendation would be crucial for hospitals and clinics. Duri ng accreditation procedures hospitals and clinics could be graded downward for not having a disability access review board that contains a person aging with a disability. Moreover, hospitals and clinics should routinely assess their environm ents on both em otional and utilitarian aspects of their accom modations. There is no excuse for inaccessible hospitals and clinics. Finally, policy m akers m ust consider that the sam e environm ental accom modations m ay not m eet the needs of the sam e wom an as she ages. The wom en in this study described how thei r energy and agility were greater during their youth than in their later adult year s, which m ade it easier to use assistive devices and access places when they were young. As they aged, they slowed and 244becam e less agile. Based upon this inform ation, it is recom mended that accom modations be based upon a policy of l east resistance within m ultiple m odes of access. In other words, architects should consider accom modations that require the least am ount of energy but useable by those using electric wheelchairs, manual chairs, crutches, and/or braces. The sam e applies for any public area or utility, such as retrofitted buildings, park s, doors, toilet paper dispensers, and sinks. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS According to Toom bs (2001) studi es that convey phenom enological experiences of disability provide \"inva luable inform ation about the everyday world of those who live w ith disabilities\" (p.248). This inform ation can guide therapeutic intervention, such as how \"bes t to address the personal, social, and emotional challenges\" (Toom bs, 2001, p. 248) . Healthcare providers should read this study of the lived experience of agi ng with polio as a source from which to compare the experiences of their own patients. This m ay help the provider to understand their patient's response to their recom mendations and actions. The ability of wom en with polio to ad apt to changes with aging should be encouraged in m eetings with health care providers. The wom en in this study prided them selves in their ability to m entally strategize to create new ways of doing usual activities of daily living. Other wom en with life long disabilities, such as polio, should be encouraged to strategize and suggestions should be m ade that may help them as they adapt to th eir changing environm ents. Health care providers should not consider their role as the leader of the encounter. The wom en 245were often upset by physician who did not listen to how they had adapted to multiple changes along their life course. Healthcare providers should consider them selves f acilitators of adaptation to change. Health care providers offering interventions designed to prom ote the health of wom en aging with the effect s of paralytic polio m ight proceed by highlighting how the wom en might reap th e rewards of continued achievem ents in their lives if they prom ote their health. Health prom otion at the expense of their roles as wom en was not reported as a m otivator f or wom en with disabilities. Currently the wom en described being told by health care providers that if they do not stop their current activities they will c ontinue to decline and not be able to perform any activities. The wom en felt threatened by negative im ages of decline with age. It is difficult to know if these images affected their health as suggested by Levy (2003). Health care providers shoul d work with the wom en to find out how good nutrition, exercise, and rest can be negotiated into their existing lives using positive im ages of those who have ag ed well instead of negative im ages of certain decline. Obesity was a com mon problem for the wom en after they tried to conserve their physical abilities by using assistive de vices and pacing them selves in their activities. The wom en were not given any clear guidelines f or how to conserve energy without gaining considerable we ight. The weight gain caused further impairm ent and disability, which led to co -morbid conditions and social isolation. It is recom mended that health care providers gain dietary and exercise consults for those converting to the use of wheelchairs for m obility. 246Finally, health care providers should carefully weigh the long term consequences of therapeutic interventi ons prior to recom mending them to wom en aging with polio. Interventions m ay be im plem ented to help one aspect of their life or their body but have negative conse quences on other aspects of their lives. For instance, a lift provided to balance leg length m ay alter the hip m ovem ent causing serious joint dam age or f alls. Moreover, quitting work m ay provide the wom an with tim e to rest but cause the wom an to be hom eless or without the ability to pay for m edications. These recom mendations should be carefully weighed before given to wom en aging with im pairm ents. CONCLUSION Almost 100 years ago Dr. W ade Frost of the United States Public Health Service wrote, \"Few diseases present a m ore com plex problem than does acute anterior poliom yelitis\" (Frost, 1911). Frost was aware that the disease challenged neurologists, biologists, orthopedic surg eons, pediatricians, pathologists, and epidem iologists. Today, the disease baffles m ore people than those who endeavored to cure the disease during th e first half of this century. Polio has becom e a concern for nurses, physicians, gerontologists, social workers, public policy m akers, and all those who care a bout how our population ages because no society can afford to neglect those who we re affected by any disease regardless of its im mediate threat to current or f uture generations. Today, the problem is not how to cure polio but how to support persons with im pairm ents over the life course. The first step in this process is to understand what their experiences have been through the years and what they m ean today because the wom en bring these 247experiences forward as a basis for thei r interactions today. How we understand and care for those who age in ways not predicated by past experience puts our humanity to the test (de Beauvoir, 1970/1996). This study was a step in the understanding of aging for wom en with childhood onset disabilities. This study offers the reader an understanding of aging with disability not previously provided in the literature. This herm eneutic phenom enological study was presented as an analysis of the life course experiences of aging as reported by 25 wom en aging since childhood with im pairm ents due to paralytic polio. The findings indicate that adaptation to the changes associated with aging were dependent upon the wom en's ability to fi nd synchrony between perceptions of self and their ability to act on their own behalf . Perceptions of age did inf luence their reaction and the perceived reaction of others to their im pairm ents. The wom en pushed them selves to achieve within the roles they perceived as salient to their lives. The wom en viewed their im pairm ents as part of the self not a disease or illness and aging was an em bodied, individualized experience of slowing down. They viewed aging as a journey that changed them in form , perception, and ability. Future studies are needed of wom en with other types of life long impairm ents and wom en from various cultural groups. This study could also be repeated in a group of m en. Healthcare po licy m akers should consider integrating recom mendations f or wom en aging with di all wom en's health guidelines. 248APPENDICES 249Appendix A: Review Board Materials 250INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD APPROVAL 251INFORMED CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH School of Nursing The University of Texas at Austin You are being asked to participate in a research study.

Hartford Building Academ ic Capacity, Am erican Academ y of Nurses, and the University of Texas Harrington Dissertation Fellowship What is the purpose of this study? The purpose of this study is to understand the experience of aging for wom en who experienced paralytic polio at or before age 13. If you agree to participate, you will be one of 15 to 45 wom en age 55 to 65 who will be interviewed at least three times about the experiences they have had with aging. I am also interviewing two 252wom en age 45 to 54 and two wom en 66 to 75 to highlight experiences of the cohort under investigation. What w ill be done if you take part in this study? If you agree to take part in this study, I will ask you to com plete two form s about your back ground, such as m arital status, age, and num ber of children; as well as questions about the effect polio had on your body. This will be m ailed to you prior to the first study and will take approxim ately 15 m inutes to com plete. Then I will interview you at least three to five tim es about how you experienced changes in your life and body as you aged. Each interview will take approxim ately 1 hour but m ay take up to 2 hours depending upon how m uch inform ation you would like to share. I will audiotape your answers and m ake notes about your responses. This will take up a total of 4 to 10 hours of your tim e over approxim ately 6 to 10 weeks. What are the possible discomforts and risks? There are no m ajor risks to this study. There is the possibility that som e of the questions m ay cause you to recall events that will cause em otional distress. You need not answer any questions that you wish to avoid. If you feel that you need help after the interview dealing with any issues, I will tell you about places you can contact for help. What are the possible benefits to you or others? You will receive $10.00 per interview as com pensation for your tim e. There will be 3 to 5 interviews; therefore the com pensation will be no m ore than $50.00.

Sincerely, Tracie Culp Harrison Doctoral Candidate School of Nursing, the University of Texas at Austin 259Appendix B: Data Collection Instruments 260INTERVIEW QUESTIONS Interview One: I find the best way to learn about how you have experienced the changes associated with aging is to start fr om the beginning. You m ay want to refer to the chart you com pleted before I arrived. It can help to rem ind you of events or experiences that were im portant to you over your life. At tim es I may ask you for further detail about certain things you m ention. It is up to you to tell m e as m uch as you feel com fortable with. Right now, I want to focus on the signi ficant changes that have occurred in your relationships over tim e, but also those things that have influenced those relationships. So let's start back when you were a kid and what your relationships were like with parents, siblings and friends. Tell m e what those relationships m eant to you and how they affected you over tim e. Sometimes it helps to tell m e a story about a significant relationship as an exam ple. Then we can work forward to today. Interview Two: 261 Last tim e we spoke, we talked about your relationships and how those changed over your life. Is there anything you would like to add that you didn't talk about last tim e? Again, you m ay want to refer to the chart you com pleted. Today I want to focus on the significant changes that have occurred in you and your ability to do the things you want. So, let's start back when you were a kid and what type of activities you engaged in and how you were able to do those things. Tell m e what those changes m eant to you? Som etimes it helps to tell m e a specific story that describes how the changes affected you or to show m e pictures of how things have changed. From there we can work forward to today. Interview Three: Last tim e we spoke, we talked about you and how you have changed in your abilities to perform certain activities. Is there anything you would like to add that you didn't talk about last tim e? You m ay want to refer to the chart you com pleted before the first interview. Today I want to focus on how you feel society has changed around you and how that has affected you as a wom an. Yet again, I want 262to start back when you were a girl. Do you recall what it was like to be a girl with a disability and what types of opportunities that were offered to you? Again, you m ay want to tell a story of what it was like to be a girl who had polio or show m e pictures that you can describe. From there we can work forward to today. Right now I would like you to think about what aging m eans to you. Now, think back over your life. W as there ever a tim e when you felt aware that you had aged? Please tell m e about this tim e in your life. 263DEMOGRAPHICS 1. How old are you? ________________________________________________________ 2.
