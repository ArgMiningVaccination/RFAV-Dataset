Upon some research, I came across M. Graham paints which are supposed to be non-toxic due to using no solvents, but walnut oil instead. Is M. Graham the healthiest paint to use? Are there others that are as non-toxic? Of course, lowest odor would be best, since I have a sensitive nose. Thanks for your help in advance!October 17, 2015 at 1:44 am [#1240858](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/page/7/#post-1240858) [Trustyj](https://www.wetcanvas.com/members/814250/)Default There may be others on the site who can better direct you but I think all oil-based paints are the same as far as toxicity. Walnut oil isn't any more or less toxic than linseed or safflower for instance (all of them are food safe). The pigments have varying toxicity but most are safe if you use common sense like washing hands, not eating/drinking/smoking in the studio and not sanding your paintings. The M. Graham line promotes walnut oil as a way to paint without solvents. This is possible to do but I don't think its necessary. The solvent I usually recommend is Gamsol.October 17, 2015 at 2:47 am [#1240814](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/page/4/#post-1240814) [JCannon](https://www.wetcanvas.com/members/810866/)Default MookieKat, M. Graham makes fine paint, but their marketing is deceptive nonsense. They would have you believe that their use of walnut oil makes their paint uniquely \"solvent free.\" The company's ad copy implies \u2014 without directly stating \u2014 that linseed oil (used by many other paint companies) is a solvent. That's not true. Linseed oil is NOT a solvent. Linseed oil is an oil, just like walnut oil. A tube of Winsor & Newton Artist's oil paint made with linseed oil is every bit as \"solvent free\" as any product made by M. Graham. Linseed oil is as healthy as walnut oil \u2014 maybe healthier. Linseed oil is also called flax seed oil, and is sold in health food stores; many people drink a spoonful every day as a dietary supplement. Walnut oil is not sold as a health food. (But it's great on salads.) Now, it is true that linseed oil which has been exposed to the air goes rancid after a while. Guess what? The same is true of walnut oil. It's perfectly okay to paint with rancid oil. Just don't eat it. Since EVERY brand of oil paint contains rancid oil (unless you just made a fresh batch for yourself), every tube of paint may be considered toxic \u2014 if ingested. It's okay to smell it and to get it on your skin. If you don't care for the smell of linseed oil, you should buy M. Graham's products. Most people think that linseed oil has a very subtle and pleasant smell. Please understand that there is a difference between \"I don't like the smell of that stuff\" and \"It's TOXIC! I'm DYING! Call the Center for Disease Control!\" Many people on Wetcanvas will tell you that there are certain pigments which are inherently more toxic than others. This is true: Lead white is an obvious example. There is some concern over the Cadmiums. Personally, I feel safe enough using these colors, because I don't make a habit of eating paint. As others have pointed out, Titian used lead white, and he did not exactly die young. At any rate, this particular discussion is about oils and solvents, not pigments. ALL tubed oil paint is solvent free, so don't choose M. Graham's products on that basis. (Mind you, they do make good paint.) If you want your studio to be completely solvent free, simply don't buy any turpentine, OMS or Oil of Spike. That's it. You're good to go. (I have not used W&N's water-mixable Artisan line, so I don't know about what goes into that stuff.)October 17, 2015 at 5:58 am [#1240771](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/#post-1240771)Anonymous lowest odor would be best The smells associated with the binding oils used for paints are generally reported to be detected in the following order of strength, from the one with the strongest smell to the one with the least smell. 1- linseed- most 2- walnut- less 3- safflower- lesser 4- poppy- least I find the smell of all of the oils to be extremely low and not detected when painting. I have to stick my nose right up to the tube to even detect the smell, but when I do, to me it is an attractive, nutty kind of odor that is pleasant and not harmful, but that is just me, I know some others do not like it at all. A brand that may be worth trying for you is Blick (safflower, actually made by Sennelier). Blockx are made mostly with poppy, however they are a bit more expensive than something like Blick. Charvins use poppy and linseed. Are there others that are as non-toxic? Do not be concerned with any brand of traditional oils as being any different in the least as far as being healthy, all of the oils used in paint making are equally healthy, or non toxic. They are all edible and they all come in food grade versions. I like walnuts on a sundae or in banana bread, and poppy bagels myself, I use safflower oil in cakes, breads, and cooking, linseed (or flax) is touted as being extremely healthy to eat.October 17, 2015 at 6:39 am [#1240776](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/page/2/#post-1240776) [Gigalot](https://www.wetcanvas.com/members/188351/)Default Walnut oil is non-toxic. But oil rancidification products are extremely toxic. Rancid oil emits high amount of toxic fumes formed with aldehydes, ketones, low molecular weight organic acids. Avoid to hung drying oil painting into living rooms or bedroom.October 17, 2015 at 7:37 am [#1240820](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/page/5/#post-1240820) MGraham's marketing tactic is feeding off the idea that oil paint by definition requires a thinner, except theirs of course. This is deceptive, and more importantly, it isn't true, you can use any oil without thinner. As far the oils themselves, yes they're safe, you can find safflower in the \"healthy food section\", it's used as a cooking oil, margarine, instead of butter which is full of saturated fats. All of the oils are safe. Linseed has a little bit of a smell, safflower less. If you have a large painting, let it dry somewhere out of the way, it can give you a headache if it's large or multiple paintings, as long as you ventilate it's no big deal.October 17, 2015 at 8:08 am [#1240821](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/page/5/#post-1240821) their marketing is deceptive nonsense.

Only Mussini gives you enough luminosity, only them, no others, nada: Schmincke Mussini Fine Artists' Resin Oil Colors are the only oil color that uses the formulas of the great masters to provide unparalleled brilliance and luminosity in your paintings Williamsburg has better color because they don't exceed the famous five gallon rule, as we know, six gallons and the paint is no good: Colors are made in small batches no larger than five gallons at a time to ensure the highest level of control. Pigments are carefully ground to enhance the beauty and luminosity specific to each Rembrandts are so intense and so rarely seen anywhere!: Rembrandt Artists' Oil Colors... have a noticeable brilliance and color intensity rarely seen anywhere in the world and my personal favorite, Vasari actually emits light, I don't think any brand can top that claim!: Expect paint that glows from across the room, fiery, gemlike color emitting its own light, to set your work apart from all the others, each and every time.October 17, 2015 at 9:22 am [#1240764](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/#post-1240764) [Ben Sones](https://www.wetcanvas.com/members/52399/)Default It's perfectly okay to paint with rancid oil. Just don't eat it. Technically, it's perfectly okay to eat rancid oil, too. It won't hurt you, it just doesn't taste great. But you probably shouldn't eat paint whether the oil is rancid or not.October 17, 2015 at 9:26 am [#1240822](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/page/5/#post-1240822) paint that glows from across the room, fiery, gemlike color emitting its own light lolOctober 17, 2015 at 9:36 am [#1240765](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/#post-1240765) [Ben Sones](https://www.wetcanvas.com/members/52399/)Default Hello, sounds like normal marketing to me.

Where other companies make their paint using machines, Blockx mills all of their paint by hand (-operated machines). Many of these examples are good paints that I would recommend, but the promotional copy is always a little ridiculous.October 17, 2015 at 12:30 pm [#1240757](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/#post-1240757) [karenlee](https://www.wetcanvas.com/members/43657/)Default Someone mentioned that \"any oil paint can be used without a thinner.\" I believe the writer meant any oil paint can be used without a volatile organic compound (aka VOC) thinner, such as turpentine. Some paints are thicker, or more viscous, than others; thick, dense paints are more brushable when an oil thinner such as walnut oil is used. So you may want to use a thinner but turps etc are not necessary; light oils and gels accomplish the same purpose.October 17, 2015 at 1:32 pm [#1240859](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/page/7/#post-1240859) [Trustyj](https://www.wetcanvas.com/members/814250/)Default I've never gone solvent-free but Tad Spurgeon goes into detail about how to do it on his website. His website has some good info, but be prepared to pick and choose what you take from it. Specifically, I would avoid his techniques that require the use of lead.:angel:October 17, 2015 at 2:55 pm [#1240766](https://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/topic/traditional-oil-paints-which-are-most-non-toxic-least-odor/#post-1240766) [AnnieA](https://www.wetcanvas.com/members/901503/)Default ...Since EVERY brand of oil paint contains rancid oil (unless you just made a fresh batch for yourself), every tube of paint may be considered toxic \u2014 if ingested.

Hey Mookie and JCannon, I thought something that JC said probably ought to be clarified. While it's true that oils aren't toxic, it did appear to me that Mookie was asking about paints, and with that as the question, some of JC's reply, it seemed to me, wasn't entirely clear, as paints are a mixture of oil and pigment, and some of those pigments are indeed toxic (as you did note, JC). To be a little more clear, Mookie, there's debate about whether it makes sense to try to paint with a non-toxic palette. While many of the pigments in question are toxic when inhaled, but aren't necessarily absorbed through the skin, some painters do not worry about them while others avoid them out of a general caution. Almost everyone agrees that paints that contain lead are very toxic; some continue to use them because they are in love with lead's handling qualities, and take what they feel are sufficient care in its use. And then there's also the issue of impact on the environment, although it's apparently a very, very small one. Anyway, if you search the forums you'll find lots of theads discussing the toxicity of artist's paints here at WC, and different painters have different takes on the issue. My own take is that it's a somewhat unresolved issue, and since I frequently find smears of paint on my face and arms after a painting session, I'm considering moving toward non-toxic alternatives. But in the end, I guess it's up to each individual artist to decide.
