[PATIENT TESTIMONIALS](https://www.newage-dermatology.com/testimonials-from-our-patients/): doctor and staff are exceptional and very conscientious I have been a patient at New Age for years now, and all of my family members are also patients. I have had moles removed, gotten peels, and botox injections. I have been extremely happy with every procedure done, and would highly recommend to anyone. The doctor and staff are exceptional and very conscientious. Most recently, I got a peel and botox and am so happy with the results of both. I have bought superior products for skin care and hair care also that they offer. I would never even consider having a different dermatologist than Dr. Chiritescu. I love this practice and staff! 2019-07-15T00:21:01+00:00 I have been a patient at New Age for years now, and all of my family members are also patients.

Although I've gotten fillers before, I was scared of getting botox. I worried about looking \"frozen.\" After talking it over with Dr. C - I decided to give it a try and I was amazed! The injections are pretty painless and the results were better than I imagined. My friends had been commenting that I looked tired even though I felt great. After a few botox injections I looked like I felt - refreshed - and natural. Dr. C is a skilled injector who understands that I want to look good for my age and to continue to age gracefully. 2019-07-14T22:55:13+00:00 Although I've gotten fillers before, I was scared of getting botox.

The staff is wonderful and always willing to answer any questions I may have. https://www.newage-dermatology.com/testimonials/i-always-feel-at-ease/ subtle youthful refresh Dr. \"C\" is so insanely talented when it comes to the administration of Botox. She is committed to keeping clients (me) look natural - no frozen look, nothing drastic. In fact, people notice SOMETHING, it was always \"did you change your hair\" or \"did you lose weight\" people never guess something with my face but can simply say \"well, you look great.\" This is the response you want! Subtle improvement. She is always precise and knows exactly where to target and never pushes more than what is needed for a subtle youthful refresh. I wish I'd have done this sooner for myself and will never go without it again. Only way I'd consider stopping is if Dr. C wasn't available or she didn't refer me to someone as good and talented as her. 2019-07-14T22:25:46+00:00 She is always precise and knows exactly where to target and never pushes more than what is needed for a subtle youthful refresh.

A friendly reminder: CareCredit typically does deferred interest on qualifying purchases of $200 or more, so if the balance isn't paid in full by the end of the promo period (typically 6 months), CareCredit applies retroactive interest from the date of the original purchase. Minimum monthly payments might not pay off the balance in full before the end of the promo period, so calculate how much to pay each month to do so.
