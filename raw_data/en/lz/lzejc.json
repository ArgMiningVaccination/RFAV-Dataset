Homeopathy=''Homeo'' meaning ''similar'' and ''pathos'' meaning ''suffer'' or ''disease'' Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine in which practioners treat patients using highly diluted preparations/formulations obtained from natural source that are believe to cause healthy people to exhibited symptoms that are similar to those exhibited by the patients. History The concept of ''Like cures like\" of homeopathy was first made by Hippocrates about 400 B.C. During the 15th to 16th centuries, the Swiss physician and leading medical reformer, Dr. Theophastus Von Bombast (1493-1541), rejected the principle of opposite acting remedies and stated that same must be cured by same. 17th century, the first precise enunciation of the fundamental homeopathic principle was given by a Danish physician, Dr. George Stahl. He wrote \"I am convinced that disease will disease yield to and be cured by remedies that produce similar affections\" 1835- 1st homeopathy medical college was opened in Allentown, Pennsylvania Discovery of the modern system of Homeopathy Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, Founder of modern Homeopathic treatment Born on 10th of April 1755 in the town of Meissen in Saxony (eastern Germany) Doctor of Medicine degree in 1779. Stated-there is exits a law in medicine which he called as \"Law of Similar\" and introduced a new principle called similia similibus curantur meaning like disease are cures by like medicine- like be treated by likes. He gave the name- Homeopathy, which was came in print in 1807 \"Discovery of Like treats like\" It was in the year 1790, when Dr. Hahnemann was going through a work of translating a book from English to German written by a distinguished Scottish physician, Dr. William Cullen \"A treatise on Materia Medica\". It was an account of a drug-Cinchona or peruvian bark, which had been used for the tratment of malaria. For several days he took different doses of drug and carefully noted the symptoms: Symptoms: His feet and fingers tips became cold He became drowsy His heart began to palpitate His pulse quickened He experienced trembling in all his limbs with a thirst And redness of cheeks. The symptoms lasted only for a few hours and recurred each time he repeated the dose. Thus the drug-Cinchona, when taken by a healthy person induced symptoms similar to malaria, the very disease the drugs was used to cure. Today this principal is known as the \"Law of Similars\" and is the basis for the use of the term homeopathy (\"similar suffering\"). He concluded from this experience that effective drugs must produce symptoms in healthy people that are similar to the diseases they will be expected to treat. Hahnemann and colleagues began to test various substances to determine the types of symptoms they produced. These results suggested to Hahnemann what the drugs would be useful to treat. With reduction of the dose to infinitesimal levels by multiple serial dilutions of ten or hundred fold . Soluble compounds or liquids were diluted in alcohol; insoluble materials were serially diluted by grinding with lactose. Theory And Basic Concept The doctrine of \"Similia Similibus Curantur\" is the basic foundation of Homeopathic medicine. Homeopathy is based on Seven Principles 1. Individualization 2. Principle of similar 3. Principle of simplex(single dose) 4. Principle of minimum dose 5. Law of proving 6. Law of Dynamisation 7. Law of vital force. 1. Concept of individualization It stated that no two individuals in the world are alike and the disease affecting the two individual cannot be similar. Although, a no. of dividuals may possess the common symptoms, the individual response to the same disease would be different from person to person. thus the medicines used to cure some disease in different individual are different. 2. Principle of similar/law of similar It stated that the treatment of a disease by a medicine which produces similar symptoms in the healthy individual. By introducing something in the body, that causes the same symptoms as that of the disease, it activates the body's immune system. The immune system therefore removes whatever was causing the original symptoms. 3. Principle of simplex This principle states the use of only single, simple medicine at one time. Even, the patients may have no. of complaints, only a single medicine is selected from Matria Medica As far as possible combination practice is avoided in homeopathy 4. Principle of minimum dose It stated that lower the dose of the medication, greater is its effectiveness In Homeopathy, substances are diluted in a step-wise fashion and shaken vigorously after each dilution (known as Succession) and banged ten times against a solid object. This type of dilution process is known as Potentisation. This process is believed to transfer the \"spiritual essence\" to the water it is diluted in. The \"water\" is supposed to have a \"memory\", thus this theory is also called \"memory of water\" 5. Law of proving The method used for determining which remedies were suitable for specific disease was called proving. To prove a remedy, a group of healthy people are given a dose of the substance daily and each person carefully recorded the symptoms Such first recorded proving was published by Dr. Hahnemann in his 1796 publication \"Essay Principle\". Then in 1805 \"Fragment Viribus\" Medica Pura\" contained Law of Dynamization and Dilution Dr. Hahnemann recognized that the use of substances that cause symptoms similar to an existing disease would acutely aggravate the condition and present other side effects. Thus he advocated the dilution of the substance to the point where the symptoms were no longer present. Liquids are diluted with alcohol (ethanol), water, or alcohol/water mixtures, whereas insoluble powders are diluted with lactose (milk sugar). Dynamization and Dilution Dilutions are performed as ten or one hundred fold steps. Dilutions of 1:10 are designated in the U.S. by the Roman Numeral X - 1X = 1/10, - 2X = and Dilution Dilutions of 1:100 are designated by the Roman Numeral C - 1C = 1/100, - 2C = 1/10,000, - 3C = 1/1,000,000, etc. Dynamization The process of dilution combined with succession to increase healing potency runs counter to the modern principles of Pharmacology. Conventional practitioners and homeopaths generally agree that the amount of active substance present in a homeopathic remedy is too small to have an effect on its own (this is why they can be marketed over the counter as harmless). 7. Law of Vital force It stated that \"Life\" depends on an important and undetectable \"Vital Force\" which runs through the body known as Vitalism which if disturbed will lead to illness or disease. Homeopathy medicine restores the vital energy balance and stimulates the body's own healing response. Vital forces has ability to react and adopt to internal and external causes. Diagnosis Homeopathy usually collect an extremely detailed case history Patients are asked to describe their medical history & current symptoms The major symptom's location, sensation, modality is investigated Presence/absence of symptoms according to changes in weather, season, time of day, etc. recorded Detailed information about patient's mood & behaviour , likes & dislike, responses to stress conditions, reactions to food, etc recorded All this study helps to build up a \"symptoms picture'' of the patient. This \"symptom picture\" is the \"drug picture\" mentioned in homeopathic Materia Medica and finally treatment is started Treatment Practioners always attempt to give single medicine which corresponds with the patients general symptoms. Two patients with identical diagnosis may receive different medicines Some treatment consist of only 2 or more doses while some are prescribed as a regular daily dose for 2-6 weeks Progress is viewed from time-to-time (follow up) Suitable alteration are made in medicine & dilution If the symptoms changes during follow up, prescription is changed although diagnosis remain the same. In case of recurrence, treatment is replaced with the higher potency Homeopathy practioners mostly treat chronic & resurrect illnesses such as rheumatism, asthma, migraine, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, psychological disorders, etc. 1. Serial dilution Serial dilution is the process for reducing the toxicity of the original crude drug in a sequential order Increases the potentisation To get single molecule Serial dilution is one of the core foundational practices of homeopathy 2. Succussion Succussion is a process of potentisation, by which preparation of medicine takes place by the use of a liquid vehicle like alcohol or water, by shaking in definite method. Vehicle for succussion: Alcohol is used in most of the cases, except in cases where the medicinal substances are only soluble in water 3. Trituration Trituration is a process of potentisation, by which preparation of medicine takes place by the use of a solid vehicle like sugar of milk, by grinding in definite order Drug substances are triturated up to 3C or 6X. These are then converted to a liquid potency and further potentisation is carried out by the process of succussion. Vehicle for Trituration Sugar of milk is used for the process of trituration because the preservative properties of sugar of milk are superior to cane sugar and most other substances. Its crystalline particles are very hard and gritty and hence are of great use in grinding down the particles of drugs during trituration. Serial dilution, Succussion & tituration is supposed to increase the effectiveness of the drug after dilution These three steps are combined together is known as potentisation process. For preparation of Homeopathy potencies of liquid drugs three major scales are used: 1. Decimal scale: the first potency of this contains 1/10th part of original drugs 2. Centesimal scale: the first potency of this contains 1/100th part of the original drugs 3. Millesimal scale: the first potency of this contains 1/1000th part of the original drugs Centesimal scale or \"C-scale\" was created by Dr. Hahnemann which includes diluting a substance by a factor 100 at each stage. One part of the mother tincture (original/non- diluted remedy) is diluted in 100 part of water or alcohol. This is know as 1C dilution. Therefore, 1C potentialzed solution is 1 part mother tincture in 100th part of water/alcohol 2C potentialzed solution is 1 part mother tincture in 10,000 of water/alcohol 3C potentised solution is 1 part mother tincture in 10,00000 of water/alcohol Why use homeopathy? Homeopathy is gentle and effective system of medicine. Homeopathy gives long lasting to permanent cure. Homeopathy treats the patient as a whole and not just the disease. Homeopathic remedies are gentle, non-toxic, harmless, safe and without any side-effects. Unlike Antibiotics, homeopathic remedies do not disturb digestive system nor do they lower the immune system (Body's resistance). Homeopathy is friendly to children, young and old. In most of the cases homeopathy can avoid surgery. Homeopathy is very effective in various allergic disorders in addition to other diseases of all kinds. Homeopathy is a gift of God as well as blessings to the ailing human beings. Homeopathy is a boon (helpful or beneficial) in the hands of qualified doctors (Classical Homeopaths) who strictly follow the rules and instructions laid down by Dr. S. Hahnemann in his book \"Organon of Medicine\". Mixopathy (combines different systems of treatment) has no place in homeopathy. Homeopathy is equally effective and safe to human beings, animals and birds. Homeopathic remedies do not have expiry dates, provided they are kept properly. It is founded upon the steadfast pillars of truth and will ever more be so. Homeopathic treatment is given to correct the root cause of the illness. Homeopathic medicines are administered in minute doses that act gently and stimulate the body's self-healing response. Homeopathic remedies are all natural medicines. Homeopathic treatment is ideal to optimize the body's natural defences against microbes. With the appropriate homeopathic treatment, people recover from infectious diseases, even the most serious ones, gently and rapidly. Homeopathy works in harmony with the immune system, unlike Allopathic Drugs which suppress and destroy the immune system. Homeopathic remedies are not addictive - once relief is felt, patient should stop taking them. Controversies Because of its use of highly dilute medicines. For the homeopathic practitioner the main problem is to find the medicine which most closely matches the disease and the type of patient. The homeopathic medicines sold in most pharmacies in the UK are in 6c and 30c dilutions. While the 6c dilution is likely to contain molecules of the starting substance, it is extremely unlikely that a 30c dilution does. Such dilutions are called 'ultra-molecular'. Memory of water is just one of several theories under consideration as to the mechanism of how homeopathy may work. Much more research is needed in this field. Risks/Effects Certain homeopathic products (called \"nosodes\" or \"homeopathic immunizations\") have been promoted by some as substitutes for conventional immunizations, but data to support such claims is lacking. many homeopathic remedies are highly diluted, some products sold or labelled as homeopathic may not be highly diluted; they can contain substantial amounts of active ingredients. Like any drug or dietary supplement that contains chemical ingredients, these homeopathic products may cause side effects or drug interactions. A systematic review found that highly diluted homeopathic remedies, taken under the supervision of trained professionals, are generally safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions. However, like any drug or dietary supplement, these products could pose risks if they are improperly manufactured (for example, if they are contaminated with microorganisms or incorrectly diluted). https://www.drhomeo.com/side-effects-of- homeopathy/ Crude drugs/minerals "}
