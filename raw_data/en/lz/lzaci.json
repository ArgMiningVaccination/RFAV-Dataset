Along with that, acupuncture is one of the basic treatment methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). This type of pain relief is an excellent alternative for that experiencing neck, joint, and back pain. Some patients have even found relief for their headaches with acupuncture.

When compared to other types of treatments, acupuncture is significantly cheaper. Despite the benefits, there is some controversy surrounding these treatments and their effectiveness. Many medical professionals still believe in acupuncture treatment, and there have been encouraging studies demonstrating the pain-relief abilities of this method. In most situations, patients who are recovering see faster results with their recovery. [Acupuncture](https://innergatepdx.com/acupuncture/) is known to reduce inflammation and increase circulation to help in the healing process.
