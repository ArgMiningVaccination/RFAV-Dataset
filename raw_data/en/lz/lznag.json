Nutrition - good food. Everything - environment, all what we do, work, nutrition, affordability factor (may not have insurance upon retirement and until Medicare eligibility age, or try to get Med-Quest or pay out- of-pocket; ability to pay for medication). Maintain good health - eat healthy, exercise. Change of lifestyle after a major medical emergency. Emphasis on fitness and health; is not emphasized enough between ages of young adult to elder. Having a major health event (heart, cancer) makes you prioritize health. Young adults not faced with a lot of medical concerns and health issues. Some young adults do not have insurance or know their benefits from health insurance. They don't check it out ahead of time or take the time to find out. When you are going to retire then you take the time to find out what you are going to need. Not aware what is available until you go to try it; ex: went to first exercise class to be with (participant's) mother at the senior center and discovered benefit of it. Not communicated enough to public. Exercise enhances mental, physical, spiritual, and social well-being. End result is when people become physically and mentally healthy, it increases participation of community. Other comments: Communication - Need to know what is in your health plan and what is available and be aware of anything concerning your health. WHAT STRENGTHS OR GOOD THINGS DO WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT CAN IMPROVE HEALTH? Health promotion groups (ie. Ho'ola Lahui Hawaii) provide information and opportunities for fitness. o Ho'ola used to have the Great Weigh Out program where groups of people would challenge each other; they would provide classes on nutrition. Community does not know what is going on at the neighborhood centers -- how to share information with community. At the senior centers, they learn how to do home gardening and then seniors share their crops with each other. Congregate lunches at senior centers. Seniors eat smaller portions; when they purchase a lot they bring and share with others. It is the local culture. Culture of sharing, need to go back to the old days, taking care of each other. Need to educate people about this and how people would exchange or share items with each other; losing this culture. Holy Cross Church has a health ministry called Fitness for Christ where they bring in speakers to learn about health issues. They also have exercise classes; free to community. Community gardens - some church members share their land with other members to use as a garden. Need more communication of all community activities. Community does not know what is going on at the neighborhood centers - how to share information with community, like a central clearinghouse?? There seems to be a lot of good, free activities that community does not know about. How do we share this information? KAUAI'S COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT Appendix B: Primary Data from Kauai's Focus Groups \u0001 \u0001 133WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES TO HAVING GOOD HEALTH? Know what is out there/resources. Neighborhood center bulletin boards are inside but when it's closed no one can get that information, it should be outside of the centers with a list of activities. Information should be available where people go. Financial - need monies to set up communication and support programs. Federal dollars could be cut and it could have the trickle down effect to the people who provide services and communicate with others. Linkages to programs may be affected. Lots of people are technologically challenged in accessing information from the web, etc. Newspapers are not enough. Seniors do not have access to the internet at the neighborhood centers, which are not set-up for wi-fi so even those with computers cannot access the internet when they are at the centers. Holy Cross Church has internet access therefore people can use it to access You Tube and other programs. Need to know where to go to find information on activities. WHAT ARE YOUR VISIONS, IDEAS, OR IMAGE OF A HEALTHY KAUAI? Need baseline information: o How many people are exercising (baseline) and try to increase participation o What are the age groups of people who exercise o Kinds of activities should be appropriate for all ages and levels Make environments around activities pleasant to look at (have flowers, landscape); makes you feel good as you walk or participate in activity (places to rest, nice ambiance, walking maze (Koloa has one), meditation areas. Nana's House serves the homeless population; have safe transitional place for homeless to stay in for 2-3 months to regain strength post-delivery (for newborns and post hospitalization). Drugs/alcohol-related rehab program for post incarceration and safe housing. Concern expressed that sometimes you want to empower people but the individual may be stuck in an unhealthy environment and not able to help themselves. Elderly feel bad and want to help, but they know they cannot take them home. Koloa Union Church thought of allowing some homeless to park their car in the parking lot and have the use of the bathroom facilities (but they must leave by 7 a.m.); neighbors did not want this. Loss of sense of community. Have a place where all needs are met: bathroom facility, shelter, community support. Homeless/ addicts must take ownership and community should have a sense of stewardship. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY TO LOOK LIKE IN 10 YEARS? More elder care facilities and services. Do we currently have adequate/affordable housing to accommodate seniors? More affordable senior housing and retirement communities. No homeless. Affordable housing for everyone. 0% drug problems; need more rehab programs as a step toward 0%. Every 4 year old should have a preschool experience. Pollution free environment; GMO - stuff put into air and food; repercussions will impact generations. Reasonable, cost effective methods toward environmental issues (contain pollution); i.e, cost to do these methods increase and come back to community. KAUAI'S COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT Appendix B: Primary Data from Kauai's Focus Groups \u0001 \u0001 134 Increase community confidence toward Kauai's health care facilities and providers. People seek health care by going to Oahu vs. seeking health care on Kauai. Local health care facilities should strive for most competent health care providers. Have various specialty health care providers on Kauai; there is a cost to get them to Kauai, cannot pay them enough. Can promote the other benefits of coming to Kauai (ie. the beauty of the island). WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO HELP YOU ENJOY A HEALTHIER KAUAI? More transitional housing for homeless in other communities (Westside people don't want to live in Lihue) - #1 7 votes (tied) Better communication - #1 7 votes (tied) o Need a clearinghouse or resource directory geared for all - where health-related activities are located, cost; senior centers have a weekly calendar in the newspaper, there should be a calendar that everyone can access. o Have an organized resource directory that is user friendly. More youth activities and facilities (ie. skateboard park) - #3 4 votes o Centralized youth activities/facilities (east, west, central) to bring youth together, provides better control, programming, promotion, accessibility; have it near bus routes. Affordable medical coverage. 2 votes Increased safety and sense of security. 1 vote o More police, fire, EMS. Free bus services for youth. More education to tourists/visitors to prevent drowning. o On airplane before arrival, have signs on beaches of how many people have drowned; tourists don't think clearly. Accessibility to health facilities. o Transportation options beside paratransit. Concern expressed that what if you get sick and need to get to doctor right away? You have to be registered for paratransit. o Hours of services, availability. More affordable senior housing/community housing. KAUAI'S COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT Appendix B: Primary Data from Kauai's Focus Groups \u0001 \u0001 135TALK STORY GROUP - Paanau Village, Phase II WHAT DOES GOOD HEALTH MEAN TO YOU?

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES TO HAVING GOOD HEALTH? Old age Not having a group exercise program (for older adults). Culture of smoking, ie. when pregnant, with children pretending to smoke. Abusive behavior at playgrounds. People settling problems with physical violence. Lack of paternity; nuclear family breakdown. People not being kind to each other. Addictions - drug, alcohol, cola, junk foods. Treatment of food should bring out the flavor, done with love and has to be nutritious. Trickle effect of sick children - parents sending sick child to school and making others sick; lack of child care affects employment, or workers are sick and going to work. Example cited: workers being sick in restaurants and serving others. WHAT ARE YOUR VISIONS, IDEAS, OR IMAGE OF A HEALTHY KAUAI? Helping each other. Learning other skills. Safety, happiness, clean living, make it a beautiful place and healthier Kauai. Electric cars; quiet traffic; no carbon monoxide, have clean air. More facilities to accommodate aging - care facilities that is affordable. More solar energy. If 10% of everyone's wealth was spent fiscally then it would solve socio-economic issues.

This tool is an inventory of the various resources and assets in Kauai that contribute to individual and community health. Assets Mapping: Kauai Island was created by the Kauai County Subarea Health Planning Council (KCSAC). The KCSAC began this effort in late summer of 2012. Members of the KCSAC inventoried the community and compiled and organized the material collected to present the various assets in Kauai's communities. While KCSAC gave special attention to identifying the resources available in communities; KCSAC recognizes this map is not an all-inclusive one as there are many more formal and informal resources available that are not documented. This tool does show, however, the extent of resources and assets availab le to individuals and communities that support health outcomes.

cultures; an island of distinctly individual towns and communities, each with its own unique history and character; a community which values its historic places and where people practice and draw strength from ancient languages and cultural traditions; a rural place whose population size and economy have been shaped to sustain Kauai's natural beauty, rural environment and lifestyle; a community which cares for its land and waters, leading the way with best management practices in the development of roads and other public facilities and in its land development and environmental regulations; an agricultural center, producing a wide range of crops, food, and forest products for local consumption and export; a resort destination where visitors are welcomed, supported with adequate facilities, and provided with a variety of cultural and recreational opportunities; a resort destination whose government and industry leaders respect the island's residents and their need to have a community life where visitors are not always present and who find effective ways to protect residents' customary use of special places for religious and cultural observances, fishing, gathering, hunting and recreation; and an island whose government supports the labor force and small business owners, firmly holding to essential policies and regulations while eliminating unnecessary
