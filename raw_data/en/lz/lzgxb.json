Many chronic patients who do not respond well to conventional allopathic therapies can now be referred to this centre in the same hospital. Even those patients who are availing of treatment in other hospitals can come to Safdarjung Hospital,\" said medical superintendent Dr BL Sherwal. This centre will help in developing integrated standard protocols of patient care and spreading awareness among patients about a healthy lifestyle. Services like specialty OPD, panchakarma therapy, free ayurvedic medicine dispensary and dietary consultation will be offered at the centre. For the time being, 10-12 medical staff will handle the services. Dr Sherwal noted that it had been seen that ayurveda often benefitted patients suffering from chronic orthopaedic problems, neurological/skin disorders while their treatment continued with allopathy drugs. \"We are clubbing allopathy with ayurveda in this integrated medicine centre; both the systems will work together. In some cases, it has been found that both types of treatment can be carried out simultaneously. The aim is to see the synergistic action of ayurveda and allopathy drugs,\" said Dr Prashant Kumar of the dravyaguna department. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, who inaugurated the department on Tuesday, said that the central government had decided to open such integrative centres at all government medical establishments, especially at all AIIMS, across the country. \"Opening such centres will help in initiating co-location of practitioners of the Indian system and the modern medicine, thus harmonising both medical systems and providing joint multidisciplinary care to the patients,\" he said. Some of the health complications that have seen better results by clubbing ayurveda and allopathy drugs are skin diseases such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema and leukoderma, and rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, neuro-muscular diseases, and paediatric problems like cerebral palsy and growth retardation.
