Key Facts Vaccines work by reducing the odds of hospitalization, death and severe illness and although vaccines aren't 100% effective at preventing infection\u2014like a [breakthrough infection, ](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/breakthrough-covid-cases/)when someone who is up to date on vaccines but catches Covid\u2014they reduce the risk of infection and transmission. Transmission: A November 2022 [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.08.22278547v6.full-text) examined the spread of the omicron variant in California state prisons and found that participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine were 24% less likely to infect close contacts than those who were unvaccinated, those who had been previously infected were 21% less likely to spread the virus and participants who were previously infected and vaccinated were 41% less likely to pass on the virus. Boosters: An April 2022 [study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2119451) published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that although Covid vaccines provided protection against omicron and its subvariants, the administration of a bivalent booster greatly increased protection, though it waned over time. Boosters efficiency: Pfizer-BioNTech's bivalent booster (which protects against both the original coronavirus strain and the now prevalent omicron variant) is more effective at protecting against Covid than the original, monovalent vaccine (which only protected against the original strain), according to a November 2022 [study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.17.516898v1). Long Covid: [Long Covid](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-long-covid) is new or lingering symptoms following recovery from a Covid infection\u2014symptoms include brain fog, loss of smell or taste, fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, depression and palpitations\u2014and an August 2022 Lancet [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00354-6/fulltext) found that vaccination reduces the risk of developing long Covid. Safety in children: A Jama Pediatrics [report](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2800744) found that messenger RNA vaccines (like Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) were safe in children aged five to 11, and efficiently protected against hospitalization, severe symptoms, the development of other diseases like multisystem inflammatory syndrome and the risk of myocarditis occurrences was only 1.8 per one million. News Peg A [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/380/bmj-2022-074035) published on Wednesday found that two completed doses of an mRNA Covid vaccine (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) are very effective at protecting against the delta variant and moderately effective against omicron. It also found that mRNA Covid vaccines in pregnant people are linked to lower hospitalization rates in infants six months and younger, who are not eligible for any Covid vaccines. Infant vaccine effectiveness from two maternal doses against delta was 95%, and 97% against hospitalization due to the delta variant. Infant vaccine effectiveness from two maternal doses against omicron infection was 53%, and 73% against hospitalization due to omicron. Big Number 3.2 million. That's how many deaths have been [estimated](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations), in a research report by the Commonwealth Fund, to have been prevented through vaccines, along with 18.5 million hospitalizations, between December 2020 and November 2022. Key Background There are four Food and Drug Administration approved and authorized [Covid vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html): Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, Novavax and Johnson bivalent booster in the [third phase](https://ir.novavax.com/2022-11-08-Novavax-Phase-3-COVID-19-Omicron-Trial-Supports-the-Continued-and-Future-Use-of-Novavax-Prototype-Vaccine-as-a-Booster) of trials and both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have FDA authorized created [bivalent boosters](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-bivalent-vaccine-boosters), which protect against the omicron variant, the dominant strain in the U.S. As of last week, 81% of the U.S. has [received](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-booster-percent-pop5) at least one dose of the Covid vaccine, about 69% are fully vaccinated and around 15% have received the updated bivalent booster dose. In June 2022, the CDC [expanded](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0618-children-vaccine.html) its vaccine recommendation to include young children aged six months to five years\u2014the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are the only ones approved for young children. There are over one million Covid-related [reported](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home) deaths in the U.S. alone. In 2020 and 2021 Covid was the third leading [cause of death](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/covid-19-was-third-leading-cause-death-united-states-both-2020-2021) in the U.S. and accounted for one in eight deaths. Covid can also pose a financial burden for those who are hospitalized. An [analysis](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/cost-of-covid-19-hospital-admissions-among-people-with-private-health-coverage/) found that the average cost of hospital fees due to Covid in 2020 was $41,611. How Do Covid Vaccines Work There are three different types of Covid vaccine and each function differently. The first (by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) are [messenger RNA](https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/vaccines/mrna-vaccines/) (mRNA) vaccines. The vaccines use mRNA, which helps give instructions to the body's cells, allowing them to create small parts of the Covid virus that creates an immune response in the body. Johnson & Johnson's [viral vector vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html) uses a harmless, modified version of a different virus that's from the same family as the common cold, not the one that causes Covid, which is injected in the body and delivers DNA to the body's cells. The DNA then instructs the cells to produce copies of the spike protein that's on the Covid virus, which helps the immune system look out for similar proteins and prepare antibodies to fight off Covid. The vector virus delivers important information to the cells and helps them fight against the virus that actually causes Covid. Lastly, Novavax's [protein subunit vaccine](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-novavax-protein-based-vaccine) contains pieces of the spike proteins found on the coronavirus, and also contains an adjuvant, which helps the immune system respond to the spike protein. Once it learns how to react to the spike protein, the immune system is able to make antibodies and attack the virus. Common Misconception: Vaccines Were Made Too Quickly Covid became an identified growing threat by March 2020, and by December 2020, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization to the [Pfizer](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19) and [Moderna](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-second-covid) vaccines; [Johnson & Johnson's](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-third-covid-19-vaccine?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) EUA followed closely behind, getting authorization in February 2021. The [Novavax](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-novavax-covid-19-vaccine-adjuvanted) vaccine received EUA in July 2022. Researchers have been studying severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2014two diseases associated with coronavirus and similar to the virus that causes Covid\u2014since 2003 and 2012, respectively, [according](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/Community_Resources/Vaccinations/Print-Materials/Fact-Sheets/Development_English.pdf) to the Connecticut Department of Health, and [mRNA](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/therapy/mrnavaccines/) vaccines have been researched for the flu and rabies, so scientists were able to immediately begin working on mRNA Covid vaccines once the SARS-CoV-2 genetic code was made available. \"The gold standard test of a new vaccine\u2014the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial\u2014is required by the FDA for considering approval of any new vaccine, regardless of how rapidly it has been developed,\" Dr. H. Dirk Sostman, executive vice president and chief academic officer of Houston Methodist, [said](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/dec/how-was-the-covid-19-vaccine-developed-so-fast/) in a statement. So, each vaccine went through the necessary steps needed for FDA approval. Adverse Events From Vaccines (Regardless of adverse events, it's still recommended those eligible should get the vaccine as the risks associated with getting Covid while unvaccinated greatly outweigh the risk of adverse events from the vaccine.) [Myocarditis](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html)is the inflammation of the heart and happens as a result of the immune system's response to an infection or another trigger. Symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain and a fast or irregular heartbeat. It can be diagnosed via chest x-ray, an ultrasound of the heart, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or biopsy, blood test or electrocardiogram. According to the American Heart Association, treatment can include anti-inflammatory medicine or beta-blockers. It typically affects young men and they notice symptoms a few days after receiving a Covid vaccine and is more common after the second dose. Myocarditis due to Covid vaccination is rare, with a [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788346)finding that only 1,626 of participants out of 192,405,448 were diagnosed with the disease. Myocarditis can also be caused by Covid infections, but the results are more severe. A [study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2022.951314/full)found that the risk of contracting myocarditis was seven times higher in infected people than those who received the vaccine. It's also more common amongst people infected with Covid, with an American Heart Association [study](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.059970)finding that the risk of developing myocarditis immediately following a Covid infection is higher than it is in the weeks following a Covid vaccine. [Anaphylaxis](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html)is a rare adverse event from getting the Covid vaccine and happens in about five cases per one million vaccine doses administered. It is a severe allergic reaction and can occur after any kind of vaccine. Symptoms include swelling of the throat or tongue, a rash or hives, a drop in blood pressure or difficulty breathing or wheezing. If a person had a severe allergic reaction to the first dose of the mRNA Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, they may be able to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, [according](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html)to the CDC. Anaphylactic reactions are not mutually exclusive to Covid vaccines. Anaphylaxis can happen following [any vaccine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4783279/), or can occur because of other factors, like an allergic reaction to something eaten. [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html)in people who've gotten the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is very rare, though men over the age of 50 are more at risk. GBS causes the immune system to damage the nerve cells, which results in muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. [Symptoms](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/guillain-barre-syndrome-fact-sheet)include difficulty swallowing, abnormal heartbeat or blood pressure, severe pain (usually at night), difficulty with vision and eye muscles and digestion issues. GBS is also a [reported](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/guillainbarr-syndrome)reaction to other vaccines and can be triggered by a number of things, like surgery, injury or a viral infection. [Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-04-23/03-COVID-Shimabukuro-508.pdf)after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also rare, making up just four cases per one million doses administered. It causes blood clots in blood vessels and low platelets (blood cells, which help form clots). Symptoms include chest pain, weakness or numbness on one side of the body, pain and swelling in an extremity and a sudden change in mental status. It's diagnosed mainly through blood tests and imaging. Though also rare, thrombosis also occurs as a result of Covid infection. It's [reported](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00314-0/fulltext)there's a 3% to 6% increase in the risk of developing arterial thrombosis following infection, and a 2% to 3% increase in the risk of getting venous thrombosis. News Peg The FDA is looking to [recommend](https://www.fda.gov/media/164699/download) a simplified Covid vaccine process more akin to the flu. This includes immunization schedules, streamlining the vaccine composition and periodic updates on vaccines. The FDA will annually assess circulating strains of the virus and decide in June which strain to select for the fall, similar to the flu vaccine process. Further Reading [F.D.A.
