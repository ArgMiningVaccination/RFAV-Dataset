[Efalon Acies Audio](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/513162231/Efalon-Acies-Audio) Reviews for Spiritual Healing 5 ratings5 reviews - Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5This particular audiobook has lots of awesome material. I don't believe the word \"amazing\" does this specific book justice. There needs to be a better word, and I am going to keep searching, because it deserves something good to be said about it. I think the first number of chapters were my favorite ones, because the whole concept that the title talks about, gets explained. All of the fundamentals are there. Later in the book, more depth gets included, and I believe this is what makes it so great. - Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5The 5 stars should really be 6 stars. Yes, that's it. You heard me. I think it's so good that it ought to have 6 stars. This audiobook was worth paying attention to, in my personal opinion. This is the ultimate combination of a terrific narrator and a terrific author, who partnered and decided to turn this into a valuable item. Good for them. - Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5The author definitely knows how to explain it perfectly. Despite of the writer's understanding about the idea, the storyteller was still the element I was most amazed with. This is what actually sold me on the book. Let me think for a minute ... how should I say this? It was professional, uncomplicated, and understandable. With that being stated, yes, I do highly recommend this book. No doubt about it. - Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5This the best audio books I have listened to, and that is exactly why I am taking a tiny minute to write a review about it. Good! Have you ever before listened to a book such as this? I know I am definitely not the best of testimonial writers, but this deserves appreciation. The writer and narrator have clearly put so much time and energy into these audiobooks. - Rating: 5 out of 5 stars5/5I can most likely mention ten things why I recommend this audio book, but my time is important, so this rating might not be very long. Incredibly good. That's what I think. Not only did this particular book sound like it was excellent quality, but it also showed me important aspects of life, and about this theme in particular, of course. So, it absolutely deserves a few hard-earned stars. "}
