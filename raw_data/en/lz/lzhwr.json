Some of the medications that your child takes for their IBD may weaken their immune system, making it easier for them to get common and uncommon infections. To protect your child against these infections, it is very important for them to be up-to-date on their vaccinations. Children with IBD should generally follow the rec - ommended vaccination schedule of the American Academy of Pediatrics (www.aap.org). However, there are a few important points to remember about vaccines for children with IBD:Live vaccines are not recommended for IBD patients taking certain medications that weaken the immune system. Some vaccines are only available with weakened live virus. However, these kinds of vaccines can cause infections in anyone that takes certain medications, other medications that weaken the immune system. This also includes patients who took these medications within the past three months or plan to take them in the next four to six weeks. You should discuss with your healthcare provider whether it is safe for you child to receive these kinds of vaccines. For an updated list of recently approved IBD medications, please visit http://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/ assets/pdfs/recently-approved-treatments.pdf . vaccine (FluMist\u00ae)\u2014The nasal spray version is a live virus vaccine. The injected vaccine (shot) is not a live vaccine. Measles, Mumps, Smallpox Yellow Fever Oral Polio\u2014The version taken by mouth is a live virus vaccine. The standard injected vaccine (shot) is not a live virus vaccine.Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, can have a tremendous impact on the health of your child. This discussion guide highlights some of the things that you can look out for and do, to keep your child's health on the right track. Speak with your child's healthcare provider to see what steps you can take together to ensure the health of your child\u2014now and in the future. 2 Inactivated vaccines are recommended for all patients with IBD, regardless of the medications they are taking. Inactivated vaccines are not live, and include: Diptheria as a \"shot\" or injection is an inactivated vaccine. Flu vaccine (Influenza): The version given as a \"shot\" or injection is an inactivated vaccine. It is recommended annually. Your child should be tested for hepatitis B and tuberculosis (TB) before taking any anti-TNF your healthcare provider finds that your child is not immune to hepatitis B, the hepatitis B vaccine may be given. Even if initial TB testing is negative, your child may receive continued annual TB monitoring for as long as she/he is on the medication. IBD patients on medications that suppress the im - mune system should receive the pneumonia vaccine between the ages of two years and older. There are two types of pneumonia vaccines, Prevnar-13 and Pneumovax-23. Prevnar-13 is typically given to all children in infancy as a three dose series. For chil - dren ages two to five years who have not completed the series, or have not received Prevnar-13, they should complete the series. Pneumovax-23 should be given once when first starting the immune sup - pressing medication and repeated every five years. However, there must be a minimum of eight weeks between receiving Prevnar-13 and Pneumovax-23. For children two years and older, if previously unvaccinated with Prevnar-13, they should receive it once followed by Pneumovax-23 at least eight weeks later. Pneumovax-23 should be repeated every five years as long as on immune suppression.Bone Health Active IBD can affect the normal development of your child's bones in many ways. Active IBD can: Slow down bone growth and affect the structure of the bones Delay puberty, which is a time of rapid bone growth Decrease energy levels and physical activity, which are important for normal bone and muscle development Decrease appetite, which means your child might not be eating enough foods that contain the nutri - ents their body needs to build muscles and bones Stop your child from eating certain foods that are high in vitamin D (like milk, cheese, and yogurt), which the body needs to absorb calcium from the diet Prevent the intestines from absorbing the nutrients it needs to form bones and muscles Who is at risk for low bone mass? Research has shown that children with IBD who have disease that remains active for long periods of time may have poor nutrition, delays in growth and 3 puberty, low levels of certain blood proteins (like albumin), and thinner, shorter bones. Taking steroids (like prednisone) for more than three months can also affect bone formation and growth. If your child is experiencing any of these things, they should be tested for low bone mass. How do we measure bone mass? There are several ways to measure bone mass. The most common is called a bone density scan (also referred to as \"dual X-ray absorptiometry\" or DXA). This test takes an X-ray of the whole body using a very low dose of radiation. It takes about 10 minutes, and is completely painless. How often should my child be tested? Your child's healthcare provider may request that their bone density be checked when they are diagnosed with IBD. If their bone density is not normal, they may be re-tested no sooner than six months later to see if the medications and/or improved nutrition are having a positive impact on their bone density. What if my child has low bone mass or low bone density? There are many ways to improve your child's bone density. However, the best method depends on your child's specific situation. Therefore, you should talk to your child's healthcare provider about the best way to deal with it. Options could include the following or a combination of the following: Getting your child's IBD under control with other medications, without using steroids Optimizing their nutrition Using calcium and vitamin D supplements (if vitamin D level is low) Encouraging exercise that involves walking, run - ning, and jumping (called weight-bearing exercises) In some cases, it is helpful to partner with a pediat - ric endocrinologist to make sure that the low bone mass is not caused by something else, like another condition or disease. Your child's bones and muscles are important. Work with your healthcare provider to ensure that your child will reach their full growth potential! Pubertal Development Having IBD, along with poor nutrition, may delay pu - berty in boys and girls. As a result, a young girl's first menstrual period may be delayed, and periods may be skipped or become irregular. In some patients, symptoms (such as diarrhea and abdominal pain) may become worse just before or during menstrual periods. If you have concerns about your child's pubertal development, discuss them with your child's pediatrician or pediatric gastroenterologist. Colon Cancer Colon cancer is a cancer that starts in the colon (also known as the large intestine). There is an increased risk in anyone who has IBD that involves the colon\u2014 this includes people with ulcerative colitis and people with Crohn's disease of the colon (Crohn's colitis). The risk of colon cancer starts to increase around eight to 10 years after IBD symptoms appear, and increases more quickly after that. While this may sound scary, colon cancer is highly treatable when caught early. Keeping your child's IBD under control and ensuring a healthy lifestyle can play a key role in decreasing their risk of colon cancer. Follow these recommendations to lower the risk: Get tested. Most colon cancers that are caught early are completely treatable. For this reason, screening for colon cancer is the best way to reduce the risk of colon cancer. Your child should start getting colonoscopies eight to 10 years after they first started experiencing IBD symptoms, 4 with a follow up colonoscopy every one to two years after that. Talk to the healthcare provider about when and how often your child should get a colonoscopy. Take IBD medications. The risk of colon cancer may be lower in people whose IBD is better controlled with medications. However, there is no research that shows one medication is better than another at preventing colon cancer. Therefore, be sure your child is taking their medications as prescribed by their healthcare provider. Eat a well-rounded diet. A well-rounded diet, with lots of fruits and vegetables, is associated with a lower risk of colon cancer in people without IBD. High fiber diets appear to have a benefit as well. These diets are generally recommended, but check with the healthcare provider to see if a high fiber diet is right for your child, particularly if they have Crohn's disease, because roughage (the undigested part of fiber) can be a problem if they have a narrowing of their intestines (known as a stricture). Eat less red and processed meats. Eating lots of red meat or processed meats (ex. hot dogs, ham, bacon, sausage, and some deli meats) may be associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. This does not mean that your child can't eat meat, it just means they should eat it in moderation. Some experts recommend limiting red and pro - cessed meats to one to two times per week. Get enough vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to inflammation in the intestines and colon cancer. Taking vitamin D supplements to keep your child's vitamin D level normal is recom - mended. At this time, it is unclear whether having vitamin D levels above normal is helpful. It is im - portant to speak with your child's healthcare pro - vider before you give your child any supplements. Avoid tobacco. Tobacco is known to increase the risk of several types of cancer, including colon cancer. This is true for all types of tobacco, including smoking, chewing tobacco, dip, and second-hand smoke. Exercise. Regular physical activity is associated with a lower risk of colon cancer. Get screened more frequently if your child has primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is a disease of the liver that causes scarring of the bile ducts. The risk of colon cancer is much higher in people with PSC. For this reason, it is recommended that those with PSC should get a colonoscopy one to two years after diagnosis and continue screening every one to two years. Skin Cancer There are two main types of skin cancer, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). People with IBD have an increased risk of melanoma. Azazan\u00ae) and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP or are both associated with an increased risk of NMSC, also known as basal or squamous cell cancers. If your child is taking any of the medications listed above, an annual skin exam by a dermatologist is recommended. The good thing is that skin cancer is mostly pre - ventable. Ultraviolet (UV) light damages the skin and is the main cause of skin cancer. The two biggest sources of UV light are sunlight and tanning beds. Avoiding UV light is the best way to prevent skin cancer. If your child is exposed to the sun, 5 experts recommend using sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or above, and re-applying every two hours. Using indoor tanning beds is not recommended. Cervical Cancer Women with IBD are at greater risk of cervical can - cer. At this time, we do not know if the higher risk is related to IBD, medications to treat the diseases, or a combination of both. A vaccine is now avail - able to prevent human papilloma virus (HPV), the virus that causes most forms of cervical cancer. The American Academy of Pediatrics now recom - mends this vaccine for all children (girls and boys) as part of the routine schedule of vaccinations. HPV vaccination is recommended for all pediatric IBD patients. The HPV vaccine is safe for IBD patients taking medications that suppress the immune sys - tem. The HPV vaccine requires three doses, and can be started as early as nine years old. Tobacco Use Current smokers have twice the risk of developing Crohn's disease than those who have never smoked. For those with Crohn's disease, smoking increases the risk of disease flares and the risk of surgery. If your child smokes, they should consider joining a program to help them quit or talk with their health - care provider about using anti-smoking agents, such as a nicotine patch or medications. A resource that can help: http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/ quit_smoking/cessation/index.htm Even being around tobacco smoke increases the risk of Crohn's disease or more severe disease. Therefore, caregivers of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease should stop their tobacco use. Electronic cigarettes (known as e-cigarettes) may also contain chemicals that are harmful to your child's health and are not recommended. Eye Health Some people with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis may develop eye problems. However, most of these are treatable and do not pose any significant loss of vision. Therefore, an eye exam by an ophthalmologist (a healthcare provider who specializes in diseases of the eye) should be conducted at diagnosis and then again based on symptoms. If you notice that your child has any type of eye irritation or inflammation, bring it to your healthcare provider's attention.Psychosocial Health Children and teens with an illness such as IBD face more challenges and stress than other children their age. They often deal with complicated medica - tions, medication side effects, frequent healthcare provider visits, hospitalizations, bloodwork, poor growth, delayed puberty, and even surgery. Several studies have shown that many adolescents with IBD are depressed, and when depressed, their anxiety may increase, which can cause their IBD to be more active. Therefore, it is very important to look out for symptoms of depression in your child. Symptoms of depression in children include: Sadness or hopelessness Irritability, anger, hostility Tearfulness or frequent crying Withdrawal from friends or family Loss of interest in usual activities Poor school performance Changes in eating or sleeping habits No longer enjoying activities that were previously a source of pleasure 6 If you suspect that your child may be experiencing depression, you should discuss your concerns with your child's physician. Consider working with a local mental health provider who has experience helping children adjust to and cope with a chronic illness. If you are concerned for your child's immediate mental health and/or safety, take him or her to the nearest emergency room immediately. Self-Management Sticking to a treatment plan (adherence) can be difficult for both children and adults. Treatment plans are different for each child, but typically include: taking medications as prescribed, follow - ing a specific diet, and making and keeping medical appointments as scheduled. Young children need their parents' help with taking medications, eating properly, and attending appointments. However, as children get older, they should gradually start doing these tasks on their own and take greater responsi - bility for managing their disease. For example, they should learn how and when to take their medica - tions, as well as scheduling their own healthcare provider appointments. Help your child understand why it is important to follow the treatment plan. Figure out ways that you and your child can remem - ber to take medications, such as using a pillbox, taking medication at the same time of day every day, or setting reminders or alarms on a cell phone. Once they start taking on these responsibilities, it is important that you monitor them to ensure that they are following through. Blood and Stool Tests It is important that your child gets regular blood and stool tests. How frequently these tests are done depends on your child's disease as well as the med - ications they are taking. Blood and stool tests may be performed to: Check certain levels that suggest if IBD might not be well controlled Determine how your child's body is responding to certain medications Monitor for unexpected responses to some medications Assess for infections Help monitor nutritional status and if your child might require additional vitamins and minerals It is important to get these tests done as often as recommended by your pediatric gastroenterologist.The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation provides informa - tion for educational purposes only.
