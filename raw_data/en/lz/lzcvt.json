Next time you head for that second cup of coffee, consider holding off - it might do more harm than good! Everyone reacts differently to caffeine. Although some people can have several caffeinated drinks during the day without experiencing any effects, others can feel a difference after just one cup. Even if you don't feel caffeine affects you, your body still absorbs the caffeine, which can lead to unhealthy effects. So why do people consume caffeine? Because caffeine is a stimulant, some benefits can include: While these effects are felt directly after consuming caffeine, they often do not last and can end up causing many more negative effects than beneficial ones. Caffeine can greatly impact your short-term and long-term health. After consuming caffeine, you may feel negative effects such as: In addition to these unpleasant symptoms, long-term use of caffeine can also lead to medical conditions like osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is defined by the CDC as \"a skeletal disorder in which the bones weaken and risk of fracture is increased.\" Caffeine drains calcium from the body, which is used for bone growth and is responsible for keeping our bones strong. Caffeine can also lessen the body's ability to absorb vitamin D. A lack of vitamin D can cause symptoms including fatigue, bone pain, and muscle pain or weakness. If you regularly consume caffeine, it's also important to be aware of the impact on your mental health. As mentioned above, caffeine can contribute to conditions like anxiety or depression. Because caffeine is a stimulant, it can lead to symptoms that can parallel panic disorders and other symptoms of anxiety. It can also temporarily increase levels of dopamine and serotonin, which are hormones in our bodies responsible for making us feel happy. This can lead to dependency and cause withdrawal symptoms. Paired with its effect on sleep patterns, you may cause more harm than good by having a second or third cup of caffeine during the day. So next time you head for a cup of coffee, tea, or soda, remind yourself that while it may give you that burst of energy, it's likely a crash will follow!
