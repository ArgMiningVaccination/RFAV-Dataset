After nearly two years of uncertainty and unease, people seem to be craving the serenity and healthy boost [a wellness trip](https://www.vogue.com/article/destination-wellness-wisdom-from-around-the-world) can provide. A recent [survey](https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Travel-Agent-Issues/Amex-survey-wellness-travel) from American Express found that 68% of world travelers are likely to plan their next trip around improving their well-being\u2014and the travel industry is listening. In the past year or so, there's been a slew of new wellness hotel and spa openings around the world, all of which answer our craving for rest and relaxation. Because who wouldn't want to treat themselves to a little TLC after the ~time~ we've had? (That said, make sure to check travel restrictions and requirements well ahead of your trip.) Read on for the best new wellness trips to book this year, from tropical getaways to mountain adventures, so you can start 2022 off on the right (moisturized, tension-free) foot. Best for communing with nature: Joali Being, Maldives Though it's hard to imagine not feeling amazing in the Maldives, there hasn't been a resort there specifically dedicated to the wellness cause\u2014until now. [Joali Being](https://www.joali.com/joalibeing/), opened in November 2021, was designed to help you reconnect with yourself through reconnecting with Mother Earth. Tucked into the lush coconut palm groves of Bodufushi, a secluded private island in Raa Atoll, the 68-villa property is surrounded by crystal-clear lagoons and beautiful beaches so unspoiled, they'll make you feel more fresh and free just by looking at them. But Vitamin Sea is not the only natural healer here. Joali Being also has all sorts of incredible wellness facilities that harness the power of the earth, from an overwater meditation deck to an outdoor sound therapy oasis to an herbology center led by a resident herbalist who creates natural treatments inspired by traditional Anatolian remedies. Consider signing up for one of the property's specialty immersion programs, which offer various workshops, classes, and treatments focused on their four pillars of well-being\u2014mind, microbiome, skin, and energy\u2014and range from five nights to three weeks. Best for a dose of Vitamin D: The Standard, Hua Hin, Thailand In December, [The Standard](https://www.standardhotels.com/hua-hin/properties/hua-hin) opened an outpost in Hua Hin, a seaside city just a few hours from bustling Bangkok. With 171 rooms and suites and 28 pool villas, the property\u2014The Standard's first in Thailand\u2014has all the usual offerings the playful brand is known for, from colorful decor to a lively pool scene. But it's also big on the wellness front. The spa is focused on integrative medicine, with an emphasis on meditation, breathwork, and energy healing practices (think vibrational sound bowl ceremonies and crystal and quartz-infused oils). Thai-inspired massages are also a highlight, of course, though the standout must-try treatment is the DIY Mud Lounge, where you lather yourself with healing essential-oil-infused clay and sunbathe on the private beachfront lawn. Like most Standard hotels, the food is tasty, too, with a mix of Thai, Italian and American bites, plus a juice bar for living the green life. And for a true Thai fitness experience, head to the gym, where there are all sorts of workout classes taught by local instructors, from Muay Thai boxing to tai chi. Best for a rainforest retreat: The Well at Hacienda AltaGracia, Costa Rica Could this even be a wellness travel story without Costa Rica on the list? The country is world-renowned for its luxurious wellness offerings, and [THE WELL at Hacienda AltaGracia](https://aubergeresorts.com/altagracia/) certainly fits the bill. As a collaboration between beloved New York City-based wellness center The Well and Auberge Resorts, the new 50-casita well-being resort, opened in November 2021, [is the epitome of holistic luxury](https://www.vogue.com/article/a-visit-to-the-well-at-hacienda-altagracia-costa-rica). Set among 180 acres of lush Costa Rican rainforest, the retreat provides a high-end blend of eastern and western therapies, from energy healing to lunar gong baths to craniosacral facials to an immersive riverside meditation at a nearby stream. All treatments begin with a purifying local clay treatment and herbal exfoliation at the property's pi\u00e8ce de resistance, Casa de Agua, a sunny, greenhouse-style relaxation room that overlooks the sweeping treetop canopy below. Though simply chilling in your casita is enough to feel totally immersed in nature, the resort also offers lots of guided excursions to help you explore the surrounding tropical forest and wildlife even further, including a stargazing session led by a local astrologer. TL;DR: With eight treatment rooms, five seasonally-inspired restaurants, a hydrotherapy tub and thermal suite, an assortment of mindful movement classes, and endless potential for outdoor adventures, The Well at Hacienda AltaGracia truly has everything you need to leave feeling better than you did when you arrived. The only hard part? Actually leaving. Best for a digital detox: Willka T'ika Wellness Retreat, Peru Sometimes you just need to disconnect, and [Willka T'ika](https://willkatika.com/) is one of the most incredible spots in the world to do so. Located in Peru's Sacred Valley of the Incas, near Machu Picchu and other ancient ruins, the 26-room boutique hotel is surrounded by the Andes mountains and was created in part to honor Pachamama, the Andean deity who represents Mother Earth. With such a strong focus on nature, it should come as no surprise that Willka T'ika doesn't have TVs or phones in the rooms, and only offers Wi-Fi in designated areas\u2014perfect for a soul-reviving digital detox. And while the property has been a staple in wellness circles since it opened in 1995, they launched a new seven-day \"Essential Wellness\" program earlier this year, designed to help you restore your body, mind, and soul during difficult pandemic times. Each day of the program targets one of the seven chakras, or energy centers, of the human body through traditional Andean healing ceremonies, vegetarian farm-to-table meals, immunity-boosting juices and teas, yoga, breathtaking hikes, and time spent in their beloved Seven Chakra Gardens. Don't miss the coca leaf reading with Layka, a traditional Andean healer who's been with the property for more than 20 years. Best for a healing soak: Sky Lagoon, Iceland Chances are, you've either been to Iceland or know someone who has. The secret's definitely out on the country's life-changing potential, especially its naturally healing geothermal waters. But there's a new spa on the scene that's worth planning another trip around if you've been already (and worth factoring into your first-timer's itinerary if you haven't). [Sky Lagoon](https://www.skylagoon.com/), opened in March 2021, is built into a cliff just 15 minutes outside of Reykjavik town and is meant to honor authentic [Icelandic bathing culture](https://www.vogue.com/article/iceland-swimming-culture-guide). Like its now-competitor [Blue Lagoon](https://www.vogue.com/article/retreat-luxury-spa-water-massage-skin-health-blue-lagoon-iceland), the long-standing must-visit spa on everyone's Iceland bucket lists, Sky Lagoon embraces the country's geothermal waters\u2014but it also has its own signature skin-care line and offers sweeping panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean from its breathtaking infinity pool. The treatment to get here is the Seven Step Ritual, which takes you through a series of traditional bathing experiences, from a cold glacier pool to a bright sauna to a warm waterfall shower, all of which leave you feeling like a softer, silkier, cleaner, and more rejuvenated version of your old self. Bonus: If you can go soon, you may be able to catch the Northern Lights while you're there\u2014peak viewing season in Iceland is October through February. And while the spa does not have accommodations, there are plenty of hotels in nearby Reykjavik to book. [101 Hotel](https://101hotel.is/) is a favorite among design lovers, and [The Reykjavik EDITION](https://www.editionhotels.com/reykjavik/) just opened in November 2021 with 253 rooms and a rooftop perfect for processing your epic adventures. Best for a breezy seaside getaway: Gurney's Montauk Resort & Seawater Spa, New York In March 2022, the [Gurney's](https://www.gurneysresorts.com/montauk) you know and love is relaunching with a serious upgrade: a newly-renovated seawater spa. Designed with the help of Alonso Balaguer Designs, best known as the creator of the acclaimed [Aire Ancient Baths in Manhattan](https://www.vogue.com/article/bathhouse-for-one-private-spa-experience), the 30,000-foot spa will have more of a Roman bathhouse feel. Upgrades include co-ed relaxation rooms, eucalyptus-infused steam rooms, a heated stone bench, a traditional dry sauna, and four new bathhouse-inspired pools: a caldarium (warm pool), a vitality tub (hot tub with jets), a very cold plunge pool (meant for a quick dip), and a cool bath (slightly warmer than the cold plunge; meant for a 10-15 minute soak). The treatment rooms are also getting a major makeover, featuring new indoor/outdoor spaces that let you feel the breezy ocean air on your skin as you're being pampered. Even the ocean-fed saltwater pool\u2014the only one of its kind on the East Coast\u2014is getting a face lift to match the rest of the spa's new look. Book early, because this iconic 158-room Hamptons spot fills up fast. But once you get there, it's time to chill out, hit up the new spa, and enjoy the legendary property\u2014not to mention a post-plunge cocktail. Best for getting grounded in ancient wisdom: Et\u00e9reo, Auberge Resorts Collection, Mexico Located in Mexico's Riviera Maya, the stretch of land from Canc\u00fan to Tulum that was once home to ancient Maya civilization, [Et\u00e9reo, Auberge Resorts Collection](https://aubergeresorts.com/etereo/) is as much a cultural hub as it is a place to beach. Opened in December 2021, the new 75-room hotel\u2014whose Spanish name translates to \"spirit\" or \"heavenly\"\u2014highlights traditional wellness wisdom throughout its various offerings. The SANA spa menu, for example, includes detoxifying Mayan clay wraps, a massage that incorporates sacred Mayan healing stones, and an \"energy purification ritual\" that uses Mayan crystals, metal, vibration, smudge smoke, and local herbs known for their mystical properties. The property also offers traditional cooking classes and workshops, as well as weekly spiritual rituals led by the in-house shaman, Yaotekatl, who will guide you through ancient Mayan practices. The beachside sunset fire meditation is especially transformative, as the Maya viewed fire as a bridge between earthly and otherworldly realms. Gather around the flames for a blessing from Yaotekatl, and then cover yourself in local Mayan clay to connect to the earth before rinsing off in the ocean under the moonlight. For more cultural lessons, be sure to visit some nearby ruins\u2014the hotel offers a guided trip to the ancient city Chichen Itza, or you can rent a car and go on your own. Best for actually catching up on sleep: Rosewood Miramar Beach, California Is it a bit counterintuitive to go somewhere just so you can sleep? Yes. But is it a great idea nonetheless? Also yes. Welcome to 2022, where nothing really makes sense and the world's a bit dazed and confused and we're all just trying to get by. Rosewood gets this. In January, they're launching a new global wellness program focused on rest called \"Alchemy of Sleep.\" Designed specifically to promote quality rest, the program takes a holistic 360-degree view of sleep and offers all sorts of treatments and activities that target the different areas that affect your bedtime habits, from sleep-inducing treatments like CBD massages, to nutritional consultations to help you learn which foods impact sleep the most, to movement-heavy activities meant to regulate your circadian rhythm (think sun salutation yoga to help produce sleep-regulating melatonin, and sleep release meditation to unwind and settle your body and mind). As part of the program, guests also receive a curated sleep box filled with scented oils, tea blends, linen mists, and silk masks. \"Alchemy of Sleep\" will be offered at 20 Rosewoods around the world, though the 160-room [Rosewood Miramar Beach](https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/miramar-beach-montecito), located right on the beach in Montecito, is particularly noteworthy as they are also launching three new Bryte Sleep Suites. The suites feature restorative beds with circadian climate technology that heats or cools the mattress according to your core body temperature (and you can even divide up the bed so you and your partner have your own separate settings). Best for a tropical transformation: BodyHoliday, St. Lucia Thanks to its pristine beaches and crystal-clear emerald waters, St. Lucia is already a pretty solid spot to clear your mind and feel at peace in the world. But check into [BodyHoliday](https://www.thebodyholiday.com/), the Caribbean's first destination spa and one of its most well-known retreats, and you will feel even more balanced and zen\u2014especially now. The 155-room healthy living hotel recently debuted four new wellness programs in response to the pandemic: the boost your immunity program (focused on prevention over cure), the COVID convalescence program (meant for COVID survivors), the wellness rehabilitation program (designed to help you get back in the wellness zone if you fell out for a bit due to ~these times~), and the corporate well-being program (focused on those suffering from burnout). Each program can range anywhere from five, seven, 14, or 21 days and is highly customizable, with a range of mix-and-match treatments like ocean swimming, bike riding, beach volleyball, tai chi, Reiki, Ayurvedic therapies, Bhutanese healing, chanting, hypnotherapy, holistic nutrition, and more\u2014it all depends on what your goals are. The programs all include consultations with experts, including pre-arrival meetings if you like, so the experience can truly be whatever you want it to be. Just don't forget to do a bit of nothing, too\u2014you are in the tropics, after all. - The [Best Celebrity Wedding Moments](https://www.vogue.com/article/best-celebrity-weddings-in-vogue?utm_content=footer-recirc)in Vogue - Vogue Editors Share the [Best Bedding for a Better Night's Sleep](https://www.vogue.com/article/best-bedding-editor-picks?utm_content=footer-recirc) - Gabriella de Givenchy Wore Her Family's Haute to [Wed on the Cliffs of Capri](https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/gabriella-de-givenchy-capri-wedding?utm_content=footer-recirc) [Dreamy Airbnb Cabins to Fantasize About](https://www.vogue.com/article/dreamy-airbnb-cabins-to-fantasize-about?utm_content=footer-recirc), From Finland to the Catskills - Sign up for Vogue's shopping [newsletter The Get](https://www.vogue.com/newsletter/the-get?utm_content=footer-recirc)to receive the insider's guide to what to shop and how to wear it "}
