{"title": "Malnutrition for Scleroderma", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "The foods we eat affect our health in many ways, for better or for worse: fruits and vegetables are beneficial foods that provide our bodies with energy and essential nutrients, whereas processed \"junk foods\" such as cookies, potato chips, and sugary sodas are essentially devoid of nutrients and potentially harmful to our bodies in large amounts. This holds true regardless of age or current health. However, when one is facing a potentially debilitating chronic disease such as scleroderma, in which fatigue, digestive difficulties, and nutrient deficiencies are commonplace, a high-quality, nutritious diet must take center stage to enhance quality of life and successful management of symptoms. While there is no one \"diet for scleroderma\" per se, as there is much variability in symptoms and severity from person to person, establishing a balanced diet with special emphasis on foods that fight inflammationand provide energy, protein, vitamins, and minerals is paramount. Systemic sclerosis is a condition in which the immune system over-stimulates the collagen producing cells of the body causing inflammation and an excessive buildup of collagen, leading to hardened skin and fibrosis of internal organs such as the lungs, digestive tract, and blood vessels. While there are no specific foods or nutrients capable of reducing collagen production, the foods you eat can have a positive impact on your disease condition by fighting fatigue, inflammation, and digestive dysfunction. Even if you try your best to eat a healthy diet, people who suffer from scleroderma are at increased risk of malnutrition. Malnutrition in scleroderma is either caused by inadequate intake of nutritious foods or from poor absorption of nutrients from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Someone who eats less due to difficulty chewing, swallowing, and/or preparing his or her own food may suffer from inadequate nutrient intake, thereby causing excessive weight loss and malnutrition. However, someone suffering from extensive GI involvement may be eating enough food, but is unable to absorb the nutrients properly, resulting in specific vitamin or mineral deficiencies, with or without obvious symptoms. Therefore, it is important for everyone with scleroderma to have their nutritional status monitored regularly and to eat healthy foods throughout the day from all the different food groups. Substantial weight loss over a period of 3-6 months can be an indication of inadequate nutrient and calorie intake. Measuring your weight at home at regular intervals can be a simple step towards monitoring your risk of malnutrition. Symptoms of malnutrition: - unexplained 10% or more weight loss over a 3 month period - weakness and muscle wasting - excessive or new onset fatigue - increased susceptibility to infection (weakened immunity) - delayed wound healing - brittle nails and excessive hair loss - excessively dry and flaky skin The symptoms described above are also related to the underlying scleroderma and may be difficult to distinguish from malnutrition. New or worsening symptoms (such as worsening fatigue or excessive weight loss) may indicate malnutrition. Laboratory tests to diagnose malnutrition: - protein malnutrition: blood tests to assess total protein, serum albumin, serum pre-albumin - specific vitamin/mineral deficiencies: blood tests to assess serum iron, ferritin, total iron binding capacity, zinc, and B-12 - small bowel bacterial overgrowth: blood tests to assess serum folate, carotene, and/or vitamin D levels (see attached article by Dr. Khanna) If you are under-eating due to difficulties chewing or swallowing, try these suggestions: - blenderize or juice fresh fruits and vegetables - make homemade smoothies using fruit, yogurt, 2% milk, Carnation Instant Breakfast and/or whey protein powder - include soft, moist protein sources at meals and snacks such as cottage cheese, scrambled eggs, yogurt, fish, chicken with gravy, ground meats, macaroni and cheese, and lasagna. If you have lost an excessive amount of weight, consider the following to help restore weight and nutritional status: - have your physician rule out small bowel bacterial overgrowth and gastroparesis. - liberally add sources of healthy fats to your diet by way of olive, canola, and peanut oils; nuts, seeds and nut butters; avocado; fatty fish; and oil-based salad dressings yogurt, 2% milk, 1-2 Tbsp. peanut butter, 1-3 tsp. canola oil, Carnation Instant Breakfast and/or whey protein powder - consider including a high-protein liquid nutrition supplement (such as Ensure Plus or Boost Plus) between meals 1-3 times per day; if not tolerated, try Boost Breeze, a high protein juice-based alternative - eat every 2 hours to maximize calorie and nutrient intake General Diet Recommendations: - Eat small, frequent meals every 3-4 hours. If you have been experiencing excessive weight loss or can only eat small amounts at one time, consider eating every two hours to maximize nutrient intake. - Choose fresh, whole, minimally processed foods, without preservatives, artificial ingredients, or hydrogenated oils. If there are \"chemical\" sounding names in the ingredient list, avoid it. In general, the shorter the ingredient list, the better. - Add antioxidant rich, anti-inflammatory herbs and spices liberally to foods such as basil, rosemary, oregano, cinnamon, ginger, paprika, cayenne, turmeric, and curry powder. - Cut down on added sugars. (Natural sugar found in fruit, milk, and yogurt is not a concern unless it causes GI distress.) Check ingredient lists for stealthy terms indicating added sugar such as sucrose, evaporated cane juice, fructose, brown rice syrup, honey, agave nectar, molasses, corn syrup, and maple syrup. - Consider taking an over the counter multivitamin/mineral supplement containing 15 mg zinc, 10-18 mg iron, vitamins A, D, E, and K, folate, and B-12. If specific nutrient deficiencies have been identified, extra supplementation may be required. Taking a probiotic supplement such as Align or Culturelle may help restore intestinal function and help with symptoms of bloating and distention. - Drink fresh, filtered water that has never been exposed to plastic. Use a water filtration system at home and drink only from glass or stainless steel containers. Aim to drink half your body weight in water each day.

Low FODMAP food guide: To resolve problematic gastrointestinal symptoms such as severe gas, bloating, discomfort, diarrhea, and/or constipation, consider removing foods containing wheat or dairy (lactose) from your diet, one food item at a time, as such foods are often difficult to digest. If removing wheat and/or dairy products does not provide relief, the adoption of a low FODMAP diet may prove beneficial. FODMAP is an are sugars and other carbohydrates found in a variety of foods that tend to be poorly digested and absorbed by the gut. These components are easily fermented by bacteria in the intestine, resulting in abdominal pain, gas, bloating, diarrhea and/or constipation. When foods rich in FODMAPs are removed from the diet, aggravating gastrointestinal symptoms will often resolve. | | FODMAP Category | | Foods to avoid | | Foods to choose | | Oligosaccharides: Fructans & Galactans Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) | | all wheat & rye containing grains | | corn tortillas, grits, oatmeal, unsweetened corn or rice cereals, white rice, barley, rice noodles | | Disaccharides: Lactose | | milk and milk products such as yogurt, cheese, pudding, ice cream, custard | | lactose-free milk & milk products | | Monosaccharides: containing excess Fructose | | strawberry, loganberry kumquat, grapefruit, lemon, lime, mandarin, orange, tangelo ripe banana, jackfruit, kiwi fruit, passion fruit, pineapple, rhubarb | | Polyols | | apricot, nectarine, plum, peach | | None A one-on-one consultation with a dietitian is recommended to ensure that this restrictive low FODMAP diet will adequately meet your nutritional needs.

Managing specific scleroderma-related issues: REFLUX/HEARTBURN: eat small frequent meals to avoid overfilling your stomach; avoid eating within 2-3 hours of bedtime; avoid foods that may aggravate symptoms such as citrus fruits, tomato products, greasy fried foods, coffee, garlic, onions, peppermint, gas-producing foods (such as raw peppers, beans, broccoli, raw onions), spicy foods, carbonated beverages, and alcohol. If you carry extra weight around your midsection, weight loss may also improve symptoms. Use a sleep wedge or elevate head of the bed to elevate your head and torso to prevent regurgitation of stomach contents into airways. DECREASED GI MOTILITY/CONSTIPATION: exercise, such as walking, helps move food through the digestive tract; eat a high fiber diet with 100% whole grains, fruits and vegetables; take a daily probiotic supplement (such as Align or Culturelle) and/or eat yogurt with active cultures regularly; increase fluid intake. INFLAMMATION- increase antioxidant intake by choosing deeply colored fruits and vegetables (especially dark green, deep yellow, orange, red, purple, and blue); eat fatty fish, ground flaxseeds, and walnuts for omega-3 fatty acids; eat vitamin E-rich foods such as nuts, seeds, and extra-virgin olive oil; consider taking a 1000 IU Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) tablet with your fattiest meal (to allow for better absorption). FATIGUE- eat small, frequent meals to provide continuous energy and keep blood sugar from dipping low; increase fluid intake; participate in 30-60 minutes of moderate daily exercise such as walking, bike riding, pool exercise, pilates, yoga, or tai chi. Sleep for 7-8 hours each night. If iron levels are low, which is typical of someone with chronic disease, discuss additional iron supplementation with your doctor. If you currently take an iron pill, swallow it down with a juice containing vitamin C to allow for better absorption. POOR CIRCULATION/RAYNAUD'S- exercise will increase circulation to areas suffering from limited blood flow; if you suffer from finger ulcers, eat animal sources of protein with zinc and iron (such as beef and pork) to accelerate wound healing. TIGHT, THICKENED SKIN- eat foods rich in vitamin E such as nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and canola, olive, and peanut oils; consider taking 5 mg (5000 mcg) biotin supplement, which may help skin and nails.
