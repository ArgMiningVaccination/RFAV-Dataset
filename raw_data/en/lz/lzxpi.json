Is it any wonder that at age ten, I had a vision of going to the jungle and being a doctor amidst a forest of leaves, barks, and vines? At the age of twenty, I realized my youthful vision when I ventured to the jungles of western Mexico where I first learned about the use of foods and plants for healing. I lived in a coastal jungle village where there were no conventional doctors, and I was fortunate enough to get sick with almost everything possible because it gave me a chance to learn about the numerous subtropical diseases not to mention the accidents, bites, and many maladies no one could name I encountered during my first few years there. I learned about using herbs for healing as much from trial and error as from the women of the village. In essence, I served as my own laboratory, and I came to believe that this is a valuable way to learn about your health. When I returned home to Boston ten years later, my grandmother Esther, who had just entered her ninth decade, told me that I came from a long line of women hailing from Romania who used herbs and foods as medicine. She shared with me all manner of healing treasures about our foremothers I had never known before. Apparently, healing was in my blood. I have now been working as a healer, a clinician, and a health educator for over forty years. One of the things I always remind my students is that we started healing each other thousands of years ago, way before universities and credentialing bodies said that we could, and we have also had wise elders to whom we could turn for advice and new knowledge. This book is designed to serve as a wise elder resource for you to consult time and again for trusted guidance. Yet remember, too, that there may be times when seeking the help of a licensed health professional or specialist will be necessary in treating serious, unremitting health concerns.
