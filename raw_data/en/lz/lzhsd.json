Internet of Things (IoT) sensor system technology is currently being developed to gather large volumes of personal data so that TCM, specifically herbal pharmaceutics, can be applied to treat acute and chronic diseases alike utilizing low cost, safe, and effective treatment protocols that have been prescribed in clinical practice for thousands of years.
