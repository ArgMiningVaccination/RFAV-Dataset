The current strategy of in- fluenza vaccination does not prevent the pandemic out- breaks and protection efficacy is reduced or ineffective if mutant strains emerge. It is of high priority to develop effec- tive vaccines and vaccination strategies conferring a broad range of cross protection. Th e extracellular domain of M2 (M2e) is highly conserved among human influenza A vi- ruses and has been utilized to develop new vaccines induc-ing cross protection against di fferent subtypes of influenza A virus. However, immune mechanisms of cross protection by M2e-based vaccines still remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we review immune correlates and mechanisms con- ferring cross protection by M2e-based vaccines. Molecular and cellular immune components that are known to be in-volved in M2 immune-mediated protection include anti- bodies, B cells, T cells, alveolar macrophages, Fc receptors, complements, and natural kill er cells. Better understanding of protective mechanisms by immune responses induced by M2e vaccination will help faci litate development of broad- ly cross protective vaccines against influenza A virus.[Immune Network 2015;15(5):213-221]Keywords: Influenza virus, M2e, Universal vaccine, Im- mune mechanism INTRODUCTION Influenza viruses are enveloped, single-stranded, neg-ative-sense RNA viruses and belong to the family Ortho-myxoviridae. Influenza viruses are classified into main types A, B, and C. These main antigenic types are differ- entiated not only on the basis of antigenic differences in their nucleocapsid (NP) and matrix (M) proteins, but also with respect to the number of gene segments and viral pro- teins, host range and capacity to cause disease (1). Influen-za B viruses are restricted to human hosts. Influenza A vi- ruses that have many different hosts including humans, birds, and pigs are divided into subtypes based on hemag-glutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins on the sur- face of the virus. At present, 18 different HA (H1-H18) and 11 different NA (N1-N11) molecules are known to ex-ist (2). The gene 7 among 8 segmented genes of influenza A virus is bicistronic, encodes both M1 and M2 proteins. The M2 protein is derived from the co-linear (M1) transcript by splicing. M2 is an integral membrane protein, whose Immune Mechanism of M2e- mediated Cross-protection Yu-Na Lee, et al. IMMUNE NETWORK V ol. 15, No. 5: 213-221, October, 2015 214membrane-spanning domain also serves as a signal for transport to the cell surface. M2 protein is also known to be a proton-selective ion channel to control the pH of the Golgi during HA synthesis and responsible for the acid-ification of the viral interior during uncoating and mem- brane fusion (3,4). The 23-amino acid sequence in the ex- tracellular domain of M2 (M2e) is well conserved among human influenza A viruses although there are few residue changes among non-human host species such as avian and swine influenza A viruses (5-7). Especially, the MSLL-TEVET sequence (aa 1-9) in M2e was found to be con- served at a rate of over 99% among all influenza A viruses (5,8) because these residues are shared with those of M1. Therefore, M2e-based vaccines may be developed into at- tractive candidates for a universal influenza vaccine with a broad spectrum of prevention. M2e itself is known as a very poor immunogen. Even live influenza virus infection generating strong humoral and cellular immunity is not effective in inducing M2e- specific antibodies in a mouse model (9,10). Therefore, previous studies have focused on increasing the immuno- genicity of M2e using a variety of carrier vehicles or in combination with various adjuvants. Examples of carrier vehicles for M2e antigens include hepatitis B virus core particles (11-13), human papillomavirus L proteins (14), phage Q-derived protein cores (15), keyhole limpet he- mocyanin (16), bacterial outer membrane complexes (12, 17), liposomes (18), cholera toxin subunit (19), flagellin (20), and virus-like particles (9). Adjuvant formulations that were reported with M2e antigens include complete or incomplete Freund's osome (26). Also, recombinant live vectors expressing M2e antigens that were tested in animal models are to utilize adenovirus (16) or modified vaccinia virus Ankara (27). Most studies described above reported that M2e-based vaccines even with potent experimental ad- juvants can provide survival protection but are not capable of completely preventing weight loss after lethal challenge with different strains of influenza A virus. Thus, studies on the protective efficacies by M2e-based vaccination, in- volving a certain degree of body weight loss, suggest that M2e immunity-mediated cross protection is relatively weak. Despite extensive reports with M2e-based vaccines, the mechanism studies of cross protection by the immune re-sponses induced by M2e vaccination have been relatively rare. Most licensed human vaccines are based on the in- duction of neutralizing antibodies. However, M2e im- munity confers protection through non-neutralizing im-mune mechanisms. In this article, we have reviewed the possible immune mechanisms of M2e-mediated protection. M2e ANTIBODIES AND ANTIGENIC BINDING PROPERTIES The M2 protein is not only expressed at a low level on the virions but also shielded by the larger and more abun- dant surface HA and NA glycoproteins (28). Immunization with whole-inactivated or split influenza vaccine in mice was not effective in inducing M2e-specific antibodies (10, 22,28-30), probably because shielding effects by HA and NA proteins might prevent the access of M2e to immune effector cells. In contrast, the M2 protein is expressed at high levels on the plasma membrane surfaces of virus-in-fected cells (31,32). Mouse anti-M2e monoclonal antibody 14C2 has been reported to reduce plaque sizes of some influenza A virus strains in vitro but not other strains (A/PR/8/34, A/WSN/34) (32). Moreover, passive immuno- therapy with 14C2 monoclonal antibody reduced human influenza virus replication in the lung of mice (33). M2e vaccines either in carrier vehicles or in adjuvant formulations were shown to induce M2e-specific anti- bodies conferring survival advantages but not being able to prevent weight loss upon lethal infection. M2e vac- cine-induced M2e antibodies are highly effective in bind- ing to M2e peptide antigens but show low or no reactivity to M2 protein antigens on influenza virions (9,34,35). M2e vaccine immune sera were shown to be reactive to M2 proteins expressed on the surfaces of infected cells (34- 35). In general, M2 immunity provides weak protective ef- ficacy, which might be due to the fact that anti-M2e anti- bodies cannot neutralize the virus in vitro (33,35,36). IMPROVED CROSS PROTECTION BY HETEROLOGOUS M2e DOMAINS PRESENTED ON VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES Although M2e sequences are highly conserved in human influenza A viruses, there are minor variations in the M2e sequences derived from avian and swine influenza A vi- ruses (5). In a strategy to overcome these M2e sequence Immune Mechanism of M2e- mediated Cross-protection Yu-Na Lee, et al. IMMUNE NETWORK V ol. 15, No. 5: 213-221, October, 2015 215Table I.

Recombinant M2e5x VLP vaccine has several unique features using ge- netic engineering techniques, which are different from oth-er M2e vaccines. (i) The M2e5x protein contains heterolo- gous M2e sequences with a linear tandem array of con- served M2e sequences derived from human, swine, and avian host origin influenza A viruses for broader cove- rages. (ii) The oligomerization domain of general control nondepressible 4 (GCN4) to stabilize oligomer formation was genetically fused to the C-terminal part of M2e5x. (iii) The signal peptide from the honeybee protein melittin was added to the N-terminus of M2e5x, which is known for efficient expression on insect cell surfaces (37). (iv) Finally, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains were replaced with those derived from HA to take advant-age of its high levels on influenza virus, expecting for effi- cient incorporation into VLPs. Immunization of BALB/c mice with M2e5x VLP ex- perimental vaccines effectively induced M2e antibodies that were highly reactive to M2e antigens of human, swine, and avian influenza viruses. Serum antibodies induced by M2e5x VLP immunization were found to be highly reactive with different influenza viruses including H1N1, H3N2 M2e5x VLP vaccine was dem-onstrated to be highly efficacious in conferring cross pro- tection against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 subtype viruses by 100% protection with preventing severe weight loss in the absence of exogenous adjuvants (9,10). In addition, im- mune sera were found to be sufficient for conferring cross protection against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza virues in na\u00efve mice (9,10). is significant to provide strong evi- dence that M2e-specific antibodies can have cross pro- tective roles although these M2e antibodies lack in vitro virus neutralizing activity. However, it is difficult to com- pare the efficacy of different M2e-based vaccines that were reported by other laboratories under different conditions.Immune Mechanism of M2e- mediated Cross-protection Yu-Na Lee, et al. IMMUNE NETWORK V ol. 15, No. 5: 213-221, October, 2015 216MECHANISMS OF M2e-BASED VACCINES IN CONFERRING CROSS PROTECTION AGAINST INFLUENZA Multiple mechanisms might be involved in conferring pro- tection by M2e-specific antibodies. It was suggested that M2e-specific antibodies could perturb crucial interactions between the M1 and M2 proteins and subsequently inter- fere with the interaction of the M1 protein with the HA protein, the NA protein, and the nucleocapsid complexes, thus interfering with virus assembly and causing growth restriction (7). Moreover, anti-M2e antibodies bind strong- ly to the virus-infected cells, proposing indirect mecha-nisms of protection. Non-neutralizing totoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytolysis (CDC), preventing the release of viral particles into the extra- cellular fluids, and/or enhancing the uptake by phagocytic cells. Potential immune mechanisms by which M2e-based vaccines or M2e antibodies confer protection are summar- ized in the Table 1. Roles of Fc receptors in conferring cross protection by M2e antibodies Neutralization of virions is believed to be the primary function of antibodies in anti-viral immunity (38-43). It is also known that Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages plays a pivotal role in clearance of influ-enza A virus-infected cells (44,45). Previous studies have shown that anti-M2e antibodies passively transferred could mediate protection against influenza infection in vivo (13,46). Given the fact that anti-M2e antibodies are non- neutralizing antibodies, FcR-mediated opsonophagocytosis by macrophages be essential anti-body-mediated El et al. dem- onstrated alveolar macrophages and FcR-dependent elimination of influenza A virus-infected cells are crucial for protection by anti-M2e IgG using passive immuniza- tion experiments in wild-type and FcR common chain deficient (FcR /) mice models as well as a conditional cell depletion and adoptive transfer protocol (47). More- over, Song et al. also reported that cross protection against influenza A virus by M2e-immune sera is mediated by dendritic cells and macrophages as shown by depletion ex- periments using clodronate-liposomes (20). To better understand M2e immune-mediated protection, antibody levels and protective efficacy were compared be- tween FcR / and wild type BALB/c mice that were immunized with M2e5x VLP (48). M2e antibodies in FcR / mice were induced at similar levels and showed equal protective capacity as observed in wild type BALB/c mice. However, M2e5x VLP-immunized FcR / mice were much less protected than M2e5x VLP-immunized wild type mice after lethal challenge. In contrast, FcR / mice that were immunized with inactivated influenza virus effectively induced hemagglutination inhibition (virus neu-tralizing) activity and were well protected. These studies indicate that HA-based vaccines inducing virus neutraliz- ing antibodies confer strain-specific protection in an Fc re-ceptor independent mechanism whereas M2e antibody- mediated cross protection requires Fc receptors (48). In line with this mechanism, immune sera with M2e anti-bodies showed much less protective efficacies in FcR / mice compared to those in wild type mice using a modi- fied passive immunization approach (10,30). Taken togeth-er, a possible explanation is that M2e-specific antibodies are contributing to protection via FcR expressing host im- mune cell-dependent mechanisms because these antibodies cannot directly neutralize influenza A virus. Alternatively, anti-M2e antibodies may promote the adaptive response by enhancing uptake of antibody-bound virions via dendritic cells and macrophages which are not by themselves suffi- cient for protection. It is also possible that immune-com- plex activated dendritic cells and macrophages further antiviral IFN- -secreting T cell res- ponses. Roles of natural killer cells in conferring cross p r o t e c t i o n b y M 2 i m m u n e r e s p o n s e s The FcR subunit is known to be required for antibody- mediated phagocytosis by macrophages and for natural killer (NK) cell-dependent ADCC (35). In mice, contra- dictory findings have been reported with regards to the in-volvement of ADCC by NK and/or NK T cells in M2e- mediated protection (35,49). Jegerlehner et al. proposed an important role for ADCC by NK cells in acquiring anti- M2e immunity (35). Meanwhile, other studies (49,50) ar- gued for a different immune mechanism by M2e-mediated protection rather than NK cell-mediated ADCC. Consider-ing several differences in experimental protocols, it is dif- ficult to reconcile contradictory findings on the role of NK cells in the M2e-mediated protection in mice. Recently, it Immune Mechanism of M2e- mediated Cross-protection Yu-Na Lee, et al. IMMUNE NETWORK V ol. 15, No. 5: 213-221, October, 2015 217has been reported that human NK cell-mediated ADCC against chemokine secretion from NK cells were the presence of human anti-M2e monoclonal an-tibody Ab1-10 (51). Thus, it is likely that NK cells may contribute to M2e immune mediated protection via multi- ple mechanisms. Roles of complement protein C3 in conferring cross protection by M2e vaccines Complement can also play an essential role in virus elimi- nation (52-54). Beebe et al. reported that complement can bind to influenza virus in the presence of virus-specific an-tibodies (55). Moreover, the classical complement pathway can be activated by antigen-antibody immune complexes, ultimately leading to CDC. However, the role of comple-ment in M2e-mediated immune response is also controver- sial. Jegerlehner et al. demonstrated that the complement component C3 is not critica l for anti-M2e antibody-media- ted protection by intraperitoneal passive transfer of M2e- immune sera (35). In contrast, Wang et al. suggested that complement is required for reducing lung viral loads in in-fected mice using passive immunization of human an- ti-M2e monoclonal antibodies in C3 / mice model (56). This discrepancy might be due to the differences in experi-mental protocols. The IgG2a isotype antibody is known to be involved in binding to FcRs more effectively than IgG1 isotype (44,57-59). Mice were immunized of M2e-specific IgG1 approximately 10-fold higher than that of M2e-specific IgG2a isotype antibody (23). It is pos- sible that a profile of specific IgG isotypes might play a role in differential effects on the dependency of FcRs or complement. Further studies are needed to better under- stand the possible roles of complement C3 in conferring protection by using an appropriate vaccine that can elicit a T helper type 1-biased antibody immune response. Roles of M2e-specific T cell responses in conferring M2e immunity by vaccination Optimum protection against influenza A virus requires anti- body production by B cells as well as cytotoxic cellular and soluble cytokine mechanisms mediated by T cells (60). Activated influenza-specific T cells have been shown to be associated with protection against influenza in human studies (61,62). Several studies have shown that M2e-spe- cific T cells can mediate protection against influenza in- fection in vivo (16,19,30,48). Eliasson et al. have demon- an M2e-specific CD4 T cell but not CD8 T cell response was induced in BALB/c mice that were intranasally immunized with protein fusion vaccine (CTA1-M2e-DD of cholera toxin subunit A1 and a dimer of the D-fragment of Staphylococcus aureus protein A) in the presence of immune stimulatory complex ISCOMS ad- juvant (19). Anti-influenza CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity is also known to contribute to recovery from influ- enza infection in mice (63). Other studies have demon- strated the presence of MHC class I or II restricted epitopes in M2e in mice or human (64-66). Although it is not clear why there is discrepancy in T cell responses among differ- ent studies, differences in immunization protocols such as the platforms of vaccines and adjuvants, strains of animals, routes of immunization and with or without adjuvants may affect the differential outcomes of immune responses. Specific T cell depletion approaches in vaccinated mice are often used to determine the roles of T cells in confer- ring protection. In a previous study of M2-DNA and ad-enoviral vector vaccines (16), BALB/c mice that were im- munized with M2-DNA prime and M2-recombinant ad- enovirus treated with CD4, CD8, or CD4 plus CD8 antibodies prior to viral challenge. M2-DNA/ad- enovirus immune mice with depletion of both CD4 and CD8 T cell but not either single CD4 or CD8 T cell showed significant lower efficacy of survival protection in- dicating the roles of CD4 and CD8 T cells in conferring M2 immunity (16). Using a similar approach, Kim et al. have reported differential effects on the roles of CD4 and CD8 T cells in mice that were immunized split vac- cine plus M2e5x VLP (30). Split-M2e5x VLP immune mice with depletion of CD4 T cells showed significant more weight loss than the CD8 T cell depleted mice, in- dicating that CD4 T cells appeared to play a greater role than CD8 T cells in conferring cross protection (30). Of course, severe weight loss was observed in Split-M2e5x VLP immune mice with depletion of both CD4 T and CD8 T cells, providing further evidence that both CD4 T and CD8 T cells play an important role conferring cross protection via M2e-based vaccines. In line with these above studies, M2e5x VLP immune FcR / mice in- M2e-specific IFN- -producing CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as lower lung viral titers Immune Mechanism of M2e- mediated Cross-protection Yu-Na Lee, et al. IMMUNE NETWORK V ol. 15, No. 5: 213-221, October, 2015 218compared to those of na\u00efve FcR / mice post challenge (48). Therefore, it is likely that M2e-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell immunity plays an important role during re- covery from illness caused by influenza virus infection if immunogenic M2e vaccines are used to induce T cell immunity. SUPPLEMENTED VACCINATIONS WITH A REALISTIC GOAL OF CONFERRING BROADER CROSS PROTECTION Developing a truly cross protective single shot universal vaccine might not be a realistic goal due to the extremely high genetic and antigenic differences among influenza vi- ruses as well as the relatively low immunogenicity and ef- ficacy of conserved antigenic targets. To overcome the low immunogenicity and efficacy of M2e, most animal studies were carried out using M2e-conjugate vaccines in a range of high doses (40 to 100 \u00b5g per mouse) and multiple im-munizations in the presence of potent adjuvants inap- propriate for human use. A more realistic approach for inducing broader cross protection would be to supplement current platforms of strain-sepcific HA-based influenza vaccines with a highly conserved antigenic target vaccines such as M2e. Song et al. (2011) demonstrated that an inactivated influenza vac- cine supplemented with M2 VLPs can significantly im- prove cross protective efficacy by preventing weight loss and conferring protection against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza viruses (29). In a recent study to further support the concept of supplemented vaccination, co-immunization with licensed split vaccine plus M2e5x VLP significantly improved the efficacy of cross protection compared to that of split vaccine alone (30). Also, immune sera from sup-plemented vaccination were shown to confer improved cross protection in na\u00efve mice (30). In real world, most humans have a certain level of pre-existing immunity to influenza either by vaccination or natural infection. To mimic this heterogeneity with pre-existing immunity, mice that were previously immunized with split vaccine were subsequently immunized with M2e5x VLPs and evaluated to assess the cross protective efficacy against hetero- subtypic viruses (22). Subsequent supplemental immuniza-tion with M2e5x VLPs significantly enhanced the cross protective efficacy of pre-existing HA immunity (22). To further move forward this concept of supplementation with a conserved M2e epitope vaccine effi- cacy of M2e5x VLP supplementation should be tested in a more relevant ferret animal model. CONCLUSION Influenza viruses are continuously evolving, introducing various mutations to the surface glycoproteins HA and NA, or transferring new HA and/or NA genes from other species stains to human influenza viruses. Current vacci-nation is based on immunity to HA, mainly aiming to in- duce vaccine strain-specific neutralizing antibodies. When the prediction of a circulating strain in the next season is well matched with a chosen vaccine strain, the efficacy is sufficiently high. However, current strategy has a major drawback of being unable to protect against a new strain with an antigenically different HA. The concept behind developing universal vaccines is to utilize the highly conserved antigenic target such as M2e and to make it immunogenic sufficient enough for induc- ing protective immunity. However, the protective immune mechanisms of the immune responses induced by M2e vaccination remain to be fully elucidated and further stud- ies are needed for a better understanding. It will provide highly informative insight into developing novel new vac-cines if we better understand the immunological mecha- nisms of how universal vaccines work and what immune components involve in the protection against different strains of influenza A virus. Based on mechanistic under- standing, it is expected that effective and safe M2e-specific influenza vaccines will be developed for prevention of sea-sonal and pandemic influenza in near future. A caveat is that most human vaccines were licensed by proven criteria of inducing neutralizing antibodies. As re-viewed above, protective immune mechanisms by which M2e immunity works rely on the induction of cross pro- tective non-neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. Due to the nature of M2 immune-mediated protection, de- veloping standalone broadly cross protective universal in- fluenza vaccines to completely replace the current annually updating influenza vaccination program would be an ideal goal. Instead, an achievable approach will be to develop simple vaccination of supplementing strain-specific current influenza vaccines with a highly conserved M2e antigenic target in an effective platform such as VLPs.
