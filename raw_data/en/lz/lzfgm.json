Before then,therapies such as homeopathy,acupuncture, osteopathy and herbal medicine had dedicated adherents but wereconsidered distinctly suspect and unconventional.In 1914 the General Medical Council issued awarning notice to newly qualified doctors, directingthat there should be no associating with unqualifiedpersons or collusion with therapists usingconventional or alternative therapies withoutappropriate qualifications and registration with theGMC. 1 The 1980s saw mushrooming interest in and practice of alternative therapies with medical andnursing journals such as The Practitioner and Nursing Times devoting increasing space to them. The BMA and House of Lords commissioned variousinvestigations. Although significant evidence for theefficacy and safety of such therapies did notemerge, official attitudes changed surprisingly. In1991, Stephen Dorrell, Minister of Health, issuedGP guidelines for the use of such therapies andrelationships with alternative therapists. Recent surveys suggest that almost half of the population in the UK use alternative therapies andover half of GPs practise or advise such treatments.Interest in alternative medicine has been closelyparalleled with an interest in the New Age andHolistic Movement. Alternative medicine has beencalled its 'medical arm'. Definition The terminology has changed significantly over the years. When it was realised that alternativetherapies could not replace conventional medicine,particularly in serious disease, 'alternative' gave way to 'complementary'. The term 'holistic' alsobecame fashionable, implying treatment of thewhole person (body, mind, emotions and spirit). Atpresent 'Complementary and Alternative Medicine'(CAM) is generally being used but is now beingsuperseded, particularly in the USA, by the term'Integrative Medicine'. Precise definition is very difficult. In the UK these therapies are described as 'those which arenot widely used by orthodox medical professionalsnor widely taught at undergraduate level in medicaland paramedical courses'. 2A similar definition applies in the USA. However, these definitions arebecoming blurred as an increasing variety oftherapies are now being used in NHS primary carecentres, wards and outpatient clinics. CAM falls broadly into three categories: 1. Therapies such as acupuncture, yoga, reflexology and homeopathy, which have roots in eitherEastern religion (T aoism or Hinduism) or in theconcept of vital life force or energy. This is thelargest group, often having New Age associationsand therefore needing careful investigation froma Christian perspective. 2. Medicines based on herbs such as St John's Wort and Ginko Biloba. These do not have spiritualassociations in themselves; after properevaluation, they could become part ofconventional pharmacopoeia. 3. Systems of medicine such as naturopathy, ayurvedic medicine and Rudolph Steiner'santhroposophical medicine include perfectlysound advice on diet and lifestyle but arecombined with one or more therapies from thefirst group. 4 TRIPLE HELIX IISPRING 03feature - A Christian perspectiveGeorge Smith introduces a series on a growing phenomenon KEY POINTS T he rise of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)has been fuelled bydisillusionment withorthodox medicine and religion andmysticism and theunderlying aim 'vital byvarious somealternative future, each needs beevaluated biblically. it involved?Alternative medicinefeature Why is it so popular? 1. Disillusionment with Orthodox Medicine. Despite the pursuit of clinical excellence, there are problems in theNHS: inadequate finance and staffing,long waiting lists, postponement ofoperations and prevalence of resistantbugs (MRSA) in hospitals. Faults in thesystem contrast with easy access toalternative practitioners who give moretime to patients, though at a price!Unfortunately, the personaldoctor/patient relationship has becomesomewhat rushed and remote: reassuringtouch has become less frequent than theclick of a computer keyboard! 2. Iatrogenic Illness. This is understood as illness caused by doctors and theirtreatments and includes the toxic effectof drugs, allergic reactions, dosagemistakes and addiction to tranquilizers. 3. Royal Patronage. The Royal Family's interest in alternative therapies can betraced back to the use of homeopathy byAdelaide, wife of William IV , in the earlynineteenth century. Homeopathyappears to have been practised by theMonarch until the present day andPrince Charles has been a strongadvocate of this and other alternativetherapies, drawing considerable attentionto them during his term as President ofthe BMA. Much media attention has alsobeen focused on other members of theRoyal Family as well as prominentfigures in public and political life whouse such therapies. 4. Religion and Culture. As a result of increasing transmigration between Eastand West, ethnic groups settling in theUK have brought their traditionalcultures with them including methods ofhealing based on their religious beliefs. 5. Holism. By definition, holistic medicine includes caring for spiritual ill health. Inthese days, there is a greater awarenessof the supernatural and spiritual, makingthe concept of 'whole person' medicineattractive. For Christians, this meanscare under the direction and power ofthe Holy Spirit. Therefore, we need tobeware of any opposing spiritual forcesbeing involved through alternativetherapies and therapists. Comparison of essential principles Conventional medicine is based on the facts of anatomy, physiology, biochemistryand pharmacology. Diagnosis depends uponsymptoms, signs and scientific investigationssuch as blood tests and X-rays. The aim is to find a specific cause for the disease.T reatment aims to be evidence-based with ascientific evaluation of efficacy, dose andtoxicity. Valid clinical trials are veryimportant and law strictly regulates it. It isessentially non-spiritual. Alternative medicine is based on healing systems or concepts, folklore and 'individualrevelations'. It is frequently rooted inEastern religion, mysticism or vitalforce/energy. The diagnosis is essentiallynon-scientific (except when the practitioneris medically qualified) and may involvedivination, the occult, astrology, dowsing 'healing power' oftenrelates to energies within oneself.Essentially, it involves a spiritual dimensionbut the concept of 'God' is of a cosmic forcerather than a personal Father God. It islargely not regulated by law. The underlying aim of treatment is to achieve a balance in the flow of energy:different cultures and therapies give thesedifferent names. The ch'i of acupuncturewith its two components (yin and yang,representing negative and positive energy) isthe most widely known. In assessing individual therapies, there are some suspicious phrases: life force,cosmic/vital energy, flow of energy, blockedchannels, lines of force, meridians, chakras,potentisation and natural magnetism. Novalid scientific evidence has been presentedfor the existence of meridians, energycentres or chakras. Practical assessment of alternative therapies needs to be considered from bothmedical and Christian perspectives, applyingchecklists to each therapy. Medical Checklist 1. Does it have a rational, scientific basis? Do the claims fit the facts? 2. Does it work? Is there consistent, reliable evidence? 3. Is it safe? Are there significant side effects? Christian Checklist 1. T aking into consideration the lack of scientific evidence available, can it berecommended with integrity? 2. What are its roots? Is there an eastern religious basis (T aoism or Hinduism)? Is it based on life force or vitalism? 3. Are there any specific spiritual dangers involved?

Due to the admixture of techniques, rituals, medicines and belief systems involved in varioustherapies, it has been argued that standard forms ofinvestigation and clinical trials (such as randomisedcontrolled trials) cannot be applied to CAM. Butwhat is the alternative? In the first British University Department of CAM at Exeter, Professor Edzard Ernst and his colleaguesevaluate clinical trials and correlate information bymeta-analysis with meticulous care producing FACT , a quarterly journal, as well as holding a yearlyinternational conference. Whilst investigations showvarying degrees of promise, there is little conclusiveevidence. When alternative therapies appear to work,this may be due to inaccurate diagnosis, naturalremission, concurrent use of conventional treatmentsor to the placebo effect, when the patient may feelbetter without significant improvement in thepathological process. Professor Ernst believes thatthere is 'an astonishing and embarrassing lack ofknowledge and information' on the subject of CAM,even that relating to the most fundamental question:'Does CAM work and is it safe?' 4 A 1986 BMA investigation into CAM concluded that the evidence for efficacy was scanty.5This view was reiterated in 1997 when Health Watch interviewed Professor J Howell, chairman of the BMA's Board ofScience and Education. The careful review in Which? Guide to Complementary Therapy is prefaced by the warning, 'Many complementary practitioners are wellaware that they still have to prove to the world thattheir therapies work'. 6 Investigation of individual therapies produces little convincing evidence for their effectiveness.There are a few apparent exceptions such asacupuncture for dental pain, nausea and vomiting aswell as chiropractic and manipulative treatment forback pain. St John's Wort seems helpful fordepression and Saw Palmetto may improve prostateenlargement but unwelcome side effects have beenobserved. Is it safe? The popular view of CAM is that its therapies are advertised as being natural, safe, free from sideeffects and perhaps 'God given'. Complete safety isby no means assured. Some medicines (such as someChinese herbal preparations and aromatic oils) havebeen demonstrated as having toxic properties,particularly on the liver. Physical complications suchas pneumothorax may arise from acupuncture.Cerebrovascular accidents and neurological damagehave been recorded following chiropractic and othermanipulative therapies. Whilst these complicationsmay be uncommon, a particularly worrying aspect ispossible delay or incorrect diagnosis, especially ifserious organic disease is missed and conventionaltreatment delayed. T ragedies do occur as a result.The 1997 Which? Guide states, 'Complementary medicine can be extremely harmful if used as asubstitute for proper diagnosis and treatment'. 7From a Christian perspective, there are other important considerations. Some therapies have rootsthat clearly arise from Eastern religious beliefs: forexample, the acupuncture of T aoism and the yogaof Hinduism. Whether these roots are accepted asimportant is controversial but the Bible clearlyteaches that roots are important: 'A good treecannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot beargood fruit'. 8Some Christian pastors and counsellors have observed 'spiritual ill health' (manifested asanxiety, depression, fear, lack of Christian assuranceand interference with prayer life and Bible reading)in those who become involved with these therapiesor therapists. There may also be evidence ofdemonic oppression. Conclusion A salutary note was sounded in the New England Journal of Medicine : 'It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a freeride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine -conventional and alternative. There is only medicinethat has been adequately tested and medicine thathas not, medicine that works and medicine that mayor may not work. But assertions, speculation andtestimonials do not substitute for evidence'. 9 Alternative medicine is a challenge to Christian doctors and other care providers. Rather than beingprejudiced, we need to be informed about therapiesthat are so popular and about which we are oftenasked. We need to respond with truth, integrity andbiblically based attitudes. Many of our patients areclutching at straws and we should be sensitive tothis. Fundamentally, we need to ask whether thereis a vacuum in our own practice of whole personcare, a void that is being filled by alternativetherapists and New Age practitioners. We are calledto heal the sick and to preach the gospel: surely thisis biblical holistic medicine! 'Finally brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue,and if there be any praise, think on these things...and theGod of peace shall be with you.'
