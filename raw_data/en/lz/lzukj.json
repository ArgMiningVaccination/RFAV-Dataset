Certain factors influence our state of wellness, including nutrition, physical activity, stress coping methods, good relationships and career success. Each day we work toward maximizing our level of health and wellness to live long, full and healthy lives. The pursuit of health, personal growth and improved quality of life relies on living balanced life. To achieve balance, we need to care for our mind, body, and spirit. If any of these three areas is consistently lacking or forgotten about, we will not be at our optimal level of health. We are constantly challenged with balancing each of these three areas throughout life (G. Anderson, 2008). Promoting this \"Mind-Body-Spirit Balance\" is as important as maintaining it. Our personal trainers and fitness instructors at the YWCA guide and motivate our members to improve their level of health and wellness through physical activity. We demonstrate positive health behaviors that assist in improving our own health and the health of others. One of the practical approaches is to encourage our friends, family members, and colleagues - AKA our circle of influence - to start being physically active and consume healthy nutrition regimens. YWCA Fitness on 25th is a coed facility providing a range of fitness experiences in a welcoming environment to achieve your individual health and fitness goals.
