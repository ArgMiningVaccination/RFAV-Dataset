One that only uses high-quality, natural ingredients while actually tasting good? Here we are. Colostrum is fondly known as \"Mother's First Milk\" because it is the very first substance that the newborn receives before the production of \"milk\". Colostrum is loaded with all the benefits necessary to sustain life and, furthermore, contains the Mother's antibodies that help protect the helpless newborn from the environment's assault. Without Mother's antibodies to protect the newborn from pathogens, the newborn would quickly succumb. Colostrum Powder is an extremely concentrated powdered form of bovine colostrum and is the first choice in providing your pet with passive immunity (immunoglobulins IgA, IgM, IgG, lactoferrin) during times of stress, illness, and/or periods of recovery or for general immune function support. A 100% pure form of \"mother's first milk\", just better! Freshly collected, concentrated, and tested for guaranteed immunoglobulin levels Pure bovine colostrum in every 1/4 teaspoon Collected from strictly controlled US-origin dairy herds that are fed diets free of meat by-products, hormones, antibiotics, and pesticides Processed in USDA licensed & inspected human food processing plants Ethically collected from hours 12-24 Especially useful during times of increased stress and periods of normal recovery and/or general immune function support Not sure which product is right for your pet?

Your pet is a member of the family, and you're continually striving to provide the best possible nutrition. However, a typical diet may not constain all the essential fatty acids your pet needs for optimal health. Research shows that most pets are usually deficient in EFA's. A high quality, single-source fish oil, rich in essential fatty acids, can make all the difference to your pet's continued health and well-being. Wholistic Wild Salmon Oil is the finest grade of human-grade, wild, deep-sea salmon oil. Derived from wild, free-swimming Alaskan salmon caught directly from the ocean, there is no other substitute. Unlike farm-raised salmon, wild salmon are not subject to the possible pollution or contamination often found in commercial farming streams, penned ocean cages, or other closed communities. Cold-processed body oils are captured through a patented cold-processing method designed to ensure purity and freshness. Enhanced with pure, natural Vitamin E! What is Omega-3? Omega-3 is a polyunsaturated fat that is liquid at room temperature. Fat is an essential part of any diet, yet not all fats are the same. Saturated fats, such as those found in meats, are \"bad\" for health. Unsaturated fats, such as those found in fish, are \"good.\" Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids are both \"good\" polyunsaturated Salmon oil delivers Omega-3 fatty acids in the body-ready form of DHA and EPA (docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid). Essential to life and good health, Omega-3 fatty acids help protect your pet. These essential fatty acids are key to good health but cannot be manufactured by the body. Omega-3 must be obtained from the diet. Your Pet's Health Is In the Balance Omega-3 and Omega-6 both work together to promote health. Maintaining an appropriate balance is important. Omega-3s, primarily found in fish oils, help support normal cardiovascular function. Omega-6s support healthy, supple skin. An ideal balance between Omega-6 and Omega-3 is approximately 5:1 or lower However, the high consumption of saturated fats in modern diets can boost the ratio as high as 30:1. This improper balance may lead to serious health issues. In addition, essential fatty acids found in plant oils must be broken down to become available for metabolism. This breakdown process can sap as much as 80 percent of the essential fatty acids. In some cases, pets may not be able to convert plant fatty acids into the DHA and EPA they need. That's why feeding a high quality fish oil with \"body-ready\" essential fatty acids such as Wild, Deep Sea, Salmon Oil can make a significant difference in your pet's health. **Due to a low catch in wild Salmon, we are temporarily discontinuing 32-ounce sizes. We believe in only providing the very best wild salmon oil to our customers. We will not compromise our quality and hope you will understand. We are hopeful for a better fishing season and to reinstate these sizes in the future. Please note that changes in color from bottle to bottle are perfectly normal. Our oil is sourced exclusively from wild-caught salmon and the color may vary depending on where and what type of food the fish were feeding on before being caught.

Digest All Plus enzyme complex: aids in maintaining normal, healthy digestive health. What are green-lipped Mussels? Green-Lipped Mussels are shellfish native to New Zealand. They get their name from the brownish, green color around the lips of their shells and are the largest species of mussels. Miracle on the half shell Research has shown that green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus) to be exceptionally beneficial for dogs needing targeted hip and joint support. Harvested in the pristine waters of New Zealand, this is the only mussel species containing a unique blend of nutrients known to promote joint health and mobility. Perna mussels are rich in glucosamine, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), hyaluronic acid, and chondroitin sulfate, all of which contribute to the viscosity of the synovial fluid and help joint lubrication. These highly shellfish also contain valuable Omega-3 fatty acids, which help promote joint comfort, plus additional components to help maintain proper joint function. Our green-lipped mussels are cold-opened and freeze-dried at low temperatures to ensure optimized levels of bioactivity. Not sure which product is right for your pet? Read our post: A natural building block of cartilage. It influences the production of hyaluronic acid, a main constituent of synovial fluid that lubricates joints and allows bones to move smoothly past one another. In healthy pets, the body is able to synthesize a sufficient amount of its own glucosamine to keep the existing cartilage healthy, but when an animal ages or there is damage to the joint cartilage, the body may not be able to produce enough to keep up with the body's increased needs. A rich source or sulfur, which is required for most body functions. Sulfur is the fourth most abundant nutrient in the body and is stored in nearly every single cell with the highest concentrations being found in the skin, hair, nails, cartilage, and joints. The sulfur found in MSM is functionally and structurally important to 150 compounds within the body, including tissues, antibodies, enzymes, and hormones. Because mineral depletion of the soil is an on-going concern, dietary sources such as meat, eggs, and fish may not be adequate for maintenance levels and certainly are not adequate for therapeutic levels. Referred to as \"nature's miracle\", bee pollen consists of 35% protein, which is almost entirely usable by the body without any added breakdown or metabolism needed. It combines 22 amino acids, B-complex and folic acid, vitamin C, polyunsaturated fatty acids, enzymes, and carotene, which are all of the major antioxidants so far discovered. Bee pollen also contains a number of vital trace elements that the body cannot manufacture on its own. These include iron, zinc, manganese, copper, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Spirulina is a completely all-natural, highly nutritious microscopic salt-water plant containing over 100 nutrients. It has the most remarkable concentration of nutrients known in any food, plant, grain, or herb and is the largest protein food source with over 60% all-digestible vegetable protein (3-4 times higher than pork, beef, or fish). Spirulina also contains the highest concentration of beta-carotene, vitamin B-12, iron, and trace minerals, and the rare essential fatty acid, GLA. Rich in glucosamine, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and hyaluronic acid. This combination provides natural forms of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, EFAs, and antioxidants Ester-C\u00ae is a patented form of Vitamin C that is \"body-ready\" and found to be four times more readily available to body tissue than basic Vitamin C. There is an increased demand for Ester C\u00ae during times of stress such as heavy exercise or injury. Being an important constituent of connective tissue, Ester C\u00ae also serves as a chondroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immune responsive substance. Ester-C\u00ae is very easy on the stomach lining.

Bifidobacterium longum: one of the most significant forms of \"friendly bacteria\", Bifidobacterium longum is needed for maintaining a healthy and balanced intestinal tract. It inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria and also boosts the immune system by producing lactic acid in the intestines. Lactobacillus acidophilus: Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the best-known friendly bacteria and is needed for maintaining a healthy and balanced intestinal microflora. It produces lactic acid in the intestines, which suppresses harmful microbes and aids in preventing yeast overgrowth by increasing acidity. A pro-biotic bacterium, it also boosts immune function, increases an animal's resistance to infection, enhances the digestion of lactose and aids in the production of vitamins and enzymes. A prebiotic that helps stimulate the production of friendly bacteria in the GI track. Fructooligosaccharide also aids in the production of essential nutrients and absorption of calcium in the body. Inactive Ingredients: Produced from white fish native to pristine New Zealand waters. Fish protein powder is a highly absorbable source of predigested protein offering supreme palatability and a full spectrum of amino acids for proper growth, development, and maintenance. Fish protein provides 90% protein while eliminating concerns of beef contaminants or BSE when using beef liver. Lecithin is a key building block of all cell membranes, affecting its structure and integrity. Without lecithin, cell membranes would become hard and rigid. As such, lecithin protects cells from the destructive effects of oxidation. As a component of bile, lecithin also keeps fats emulsified, thereby keeping fats in the body properly balanced and maintained. Lecithin also promotes cell communication for proper cell and organ functioning. A rich source of essential fatty acids, Omega-3 & Omega-6. Flaxseed promotes normal cell functioning and the production of hormone-like substances necessary for energy metabolism, cardiovascular, and immune health.

Help with the elimination of flatulence and loose stool Digest-All Plus for healthy digestion & nutrition Every living organism depends on enzymes for survival. In nature, wild animals continually replenish digestive enzymes through the ingestion of freshly killed prey. When enzymes are not present in the right amount, your pet may be unable to properly digest their food, which could effectively rob them of valuable nutrients. Eventually, your pet may become enzyme-deficient and vulnerable to disease. The lack of digestive enzymes may eventually cause nutritional, digestive, and immune-related problems that can lead to severe disease states. Not surprisingly, glands and major organs suffer most from enzyme deficiency. Of the three major classes of enzymes, digestive enzymes are responsible for breaking down food into its constituent nutrients for the body to utilize. Different enzymes break down different foods. When enzyme stores are low, it is harder for the digestive system to break down fats, protein, and carbohydrates. Poor digestion can cause pets to suffer from constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, and more. Wholistic Digest-All Plus is a unique enzyme blend of pure, freeze-dried, plant, and plant-based enzymes with added maximum concentrations of prebiotics and probiotics. Formulated for maximum digestive support! An Advanced Formula with Proven Results Digest-All Plus contains a concentrated and potent blend of digestive enzymes, prebiotics, and probiotics that support a healthy balance of normal gut flora. Human-grade, plant-based, and non-GMO enzymes with added prebiotics and probiotics within Digest-All Plus help your pet unlock valuable nutrients in their food. This all leads to an optimally functioning and balanced digestive system. Ensure Long Term Health for Your Pet When foods are not properly digested, the nutrients that your pet would have obtained are not fully absorbed. By replenishing your pet's enzymes at every feeding, your pet may avoid potential long-term health problems while unlocking valuable nutrients in both their food and other added supplements. Supports Proper digestion Healthy immune function Healthy intestinal tract function Normal Gut Flora Healthy weight management Help with the elimination of flatulence and loose stool Ingredients & Analysis Guaranteed Analysis per gram(min): 1 scoop = 1/4 teaspoon = 1 g (scoop included) Crude Fiber (max) 2% Moisture (max) 7% Protease* an essential nutrient by the AAFCO dog and cat food nutritional profile. Ingredients: Click on the ingredients to learn more Protease (dried Bacillus subtilis fermentation product) is a digestive enzyme that breaks down peptide bonds found in proteins into the building blocks of amino acids, which can then be easily absorbed by the body through the intestinal walls. In addition, protease decreases the alkalinity of blood, which can help protect against calcium-deficiencies. Amylase (dried Aspergillus niger fermentation product) is a digestive enzyme that helps break down sugars and starches (complex carbohydrates), which are then converted into monosaccharides used by the body for energy. Cellulase (dried Rhizopus oryzae fermentation extract product) is a digestive enzyme that breaks down cellulose fiber into glucose, which is then used by the body for energy. It is also important in the construction of cell membranes. Hemicellulase (dried Trichoderma reesei fermentation product) is a digestive enzyme used to help digest plant materials. Lipase (dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation product) is a digestive enzyme needed to help break down fats and form essential fatty acids needed to ensure viable cells. Lipase promotes healthy cholesterol levels, maintenance of healthy weight and promotes the process of cell permeability, ensuring that the body can assimilate nutrients. Bromelain (dried Ananas comosus fermentation product) is a digestive enzyme found in pineapples that helps break down proteins into amino acids. It can be used to treat a number of conditions, but is primarily effective in the reduction of inflammation. Papain (dried Carica papaya fermentation extract product) is a digestive enzyme found in papaya that breaks down peptide bonds in proteins into amino acids which are then available for use by the body. Plant-based Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the best-known friendly bacteria and is needed for maintaining a healthy and balanced intestinal microflora. It produces lactic acid in the intestines, which suppresses harmful microbes and aids in preventing yeast overgrowth by increasing its acidity. A pro-biotic bacterium also boosts immune function, increases an animal's resistance to infection, enhances the digestion of lactose and aids in the production of vitamins and enzymes. By helping to maintain digestive flora, lactobacillus acidophilus can also be used to help prevent diarrhea. One of the most significant \"friendly bacteria\" needed for maintaining a healthy and balanced intestinal tract. It inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria and also boosts the immune system by producing lactic acid in the intestines. Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) is a prebiotic that helps stimulate the growth and activity of the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum.

But as time takes its toll on a pet's skeletal system, our pets can begin to \"slow down\" and show signs of aging. Joints are constantly undergoing normal remodeling through a process of \"wear and repair.\" It is the damage to the cartilage matrix that allows elbows, hips, and other joints to become weak and to lose elasticity. Hip & Joint Soft Chews are a synergistic blend of proven nutraceuticals and antioxidants to help combat this process and provide superior joint support and comfort for healthy hips and joints. A Synergistic Blend of Nutraceuticals Glucosamine is a natural building block of cartilage that can help to prevent cartilage degeneration. Glucosamine also influences the production of hyaluronic acid, the main constituent of synovial fluid, the lubricating liquid between joints that allows bones to move smoothly past each other. Chondroitin sulfate helps protect joints by inhibiting the degradative enzymes that destroy articular (joint) cartilage. Without inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels in the joints, calcification occurs, and the body becomes unable to heal damaged joint tissues. Chondroitin decreases the degradation of cartilage as glucosamine rebuilds it.

They get their name from the brownish, green color around the lips of their shells and are the largest species of mussels. Miracle on the half shell Research has shown that green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus) to be exceptionally beneficial for dogs needing targeted hip and joint support. Harvested in the pristine waters of New Zealand, this is the only mussel species containing a unique blend of nutrients known to promote joint health and mobility. Perna mussels are rich in glucosamine, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), hyaluronic acid, and chondroitin sulfate, all of which contribute to the viscosity of the synovial fluid and help joint lubrication.

Our green-lipped mussels are cold-opened and freeze-dried at low temperatures to ensure optimized levels of bioactivity. Not sure which product is right for your pet? Read our post: A natural building block of cartilage. It influences the production of hyaluronic acid, a main constituent of synovial fluid that lubricates joints and allows bones to move smoothly past one another. In healthy pets, the body is able to synthesize a sufficient amount of its own glucosamine to keep the existing cartilage healthy, but when an animal ages or there is damage to the joint cartilage, the body may not be able to produce enough to keep up with the body's increased needs. A rich source or sulfur, which is required for most body functions. Sulfur is the fourth most abundant nutrient in the body and is stored in nearly every single cell with the highest concentrations being found in the skin, hair, nails, cartilage, and joints. The sulfur found in MSM is functionally and structurally important to 150 compounds within the body, including tissues, antibodies, enzymes, and hormones. Because mineral depletion of the soil is an on-going concern, dietary sources such as meat, eggs, and fish may not be adequate for maintenance levels and certainly are not adequate for therapeutic levels. Referred to as \"nature's miracle\", bee pollen consists of 35% protein, which is almost entirely usable by the body without any added breakdown or metabolism needed. It combines 22 amino acids, B-complex and folic acid, vitamin C, polyunsaturated fatty acids, enzymes, and carotene, which are all of the major antioxidants so far discovered. Bee pollen also contains a number of vital trace elements that the body cannot manufacture on its own. These include iron, zinc, manganese, copper, calcium, magnesium, and potassium.

Mix in your pet's regular meal. Daily amount may be divided amongst meals. Amount can be adjusted according to individual pets needs. Your pet is a member of the family, and you're continually striving to provide the best possible nutrition. However, a typical diet may not constain all the essential fatty acids your pet needs for optimal health. Research shows that most pets are usually deficient in EFA's. A high quality, single-source fish oil, rich in essential fatty acids, can make all the difference to your pet's continued health and well-being. Wholistic Wild Salmon Oil is the finest grade of human-grade, wild, deep-sea salmon oil. Derived from wild, free-swimming Alaskan salmon caught directly from the ocean, there is no other substitute. Unlike farm-raised salmon, wild salmon are not subject to the possible pollution or contamination often found in commercial farming streams, penned ocean cages, or other closed communities. Cold-processed body oils are captured through a patented cold-processing method designed to ensure purity and freshness. Enhanced with pure, natural Vitamin E! What is Omega-3? Omega-3 is a polyunsaturated fat that is liquid at room temperature. Fat is an essential part of any diet, yet not all fats are the same. Saturated fats, such as those found in meats, are \"bad\" for health. Unsaturated fats, such as those found in fish, are \"good.\" Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids are both \"good\" polyunsaturated Salmon oil delivers Omega-3 fatty acids in the body-ready form of DHA and EPA (docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid). Essential to life and good health, Omega-3 fatty acids help protect your pet. These essential fatty acids are key to good health but cannot be manufactured by the body. Omega-3 must be obtained from the diet. Your Pet's Health Is In the Balance Omega-3 and Omega-6 both work together to promote health. Maintaining an appropriate balance is important. Omega-3s, primarily found in fish oils, help support normal cardiovascular function. Omega-6s support healthy, supple skin. An ideal balance between Omega-6 and Omega-3 is approximately 5:1 or lower However, the high consumption of saturated fats in modern diets can boost the ratio as high as 30:1. This improper balance may lead to serious health issues. In addition, essential fatty acids found in plant oils must be broken down to become available for metabolism. This breakdown process can sap as much as 80 percent of the essential fatty acids. In some cases, pets may not be able to convert plant fatty acids into the DHA and EPA they need. That's why feeding a high quality fish oil with \"body-ready\" essential fatty acids such as Wild, Deep Sea, Salmon Oil can make a significant difference in your pet's health. **Due to a low catch in wild Salmon, we are temporarily discontinuing 32-ounce sizes.

Ingredients & Analysis Active Ingredients per scoop*: *1 scoop = 1 teaspoon = 4 grams (scoop included) Shark Cartilage (source of chondroitin sulfate) 1080 mg Glucosamine Sulfate (shrimp and crab) 1000 mg MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) 800 mg Total Omega-3 Fatty Acids 282 mg Total Omega-6 Fatty Acids 76 mg Calcium Ascorbate 30 mg Ingredients: Click on the ingredients to learn more Chondroitin sulfate helps protect joints by inhibiting the degradative enzymes that destroy articular (joint) cartilage. Shark cartilage, which is primarily composed of chondroitin sulfate, is best known for its anti-angiogenesis properties. Without inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels in the joints, calcification occurs and the body becomes unable to heal damaged joint tissues. Chondroitin decreases the degradation of cartilage as glucosamine rebuilds it. Our shark cartilage is obtained exclusively from legalized fishing methods. A natural building block of cartilage. It influences the production of hyaluronic acid, a main constituent of synovial fluid that lubricates joints and allows bones to move smoothly past one another. In healthy pets, the body is able to synthesize a sufficient amount of its own glucosamine to keep the existing cartilage healthy, but when an animal ages or there is damage to the joint cartilage, the body may not be able to produce enough to keep up with the body's increased needs A rich source or sulfur, which is required for most body functions. Sulfur is the fourth most abundant nutrient in the body and is stored in nearly every single cell with the highest concentrations being found in the skin, hair, nails, cartilage, and joints. The sulfur found in MSM is functionally and structurally important to 150 compounds within the body, including tissues, antibodies, enzymes, and hormones. Because mineral depletion of the soil is an on-going concern, dietary sources such as meat, eggs, and fish may not be adequate for maintenance levels and certainly are not adequate for therapeutic levels.

Organic Sunflower Lecithin A key building block of all cell membranes, affecting its structure and integrity. Without lecithin, cell membranes would become hard and rigid. As such, lecithin protects cells from the destructive effects of oxidation. As a component of bile, lecithin also keeps fats emulsified, thereby keeping fats in the body properly balanced and maintained. Lecithin also promotes cell communication for proper cell and organ functioning. Lipase (dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation product) is a digestive enzyme needed to help break down fats and form essential fatty acids needed to ensure viable cells. Lipase promotes healthy cholesterol levels, maintenance of healthy weight, and promotes the process of cell permeability ensuring that the body can assimilate nutrients. Protease (dried Bacillus subtilis fermentation product) is a digestive enzyme that breaks down peptide bonds found in proteins into the building blocks of amino acids, which can then be easily absorbed by the body through the intestinal walls. In addition, protease decreases the alkalinity of blood, which can help protect against calcium-deficiencies. Amylase (dried Aspergillus niger fermentation product) is a digestive enzyme that helps break down sugars and starches (complex carbohydrates), which are then converted into monosaccharides used by the body for energy.v Hemicellulase (dried Trichoderma reesei fermentation product) is a digestive used to help digest plant materials.CellulaseCellulase (dried Rhizopus oryzae fermentation extract product) is a digestive enzyme that breaks down cellulose fiber into glucose which is then used by the body for energy. It is also important in the construction of cell membranes. Bromelain (dried Ananas comosus fermentation product) is a digestive enzyme found in pineapples that helps break down proteins into amino acids. It can be used to treat a number of conditions, but is primarily effective in the reduction of inflammation. Papain (dried Carica papaya fermentation extract product) is a digestive enzyme found in papaya that breaks down peptide bonds in proteins into amino acids which are then available for use by the body. Lactobacillus Acidophilus Plant-based Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the best-known friendly bacteria and is needed for maintaining a healthy and balanced intestinal microflora. It produces lactic acid in the intestines, which suppresses harmful microbes and aids in preventing yeast overgrowth by increasing its acidity. A pro-biotic bacterium also boosts immune function, increases an animal's resistance to infection, enhances the digestion of lactose and aids in the production of vitamins and enzymes. By helping to maintain digestive flora, lactobacillus acidophilus can also be used to help prevent diarrhea. Bifidobacterium Longum One of the most significant \"friendly bacteria\" needed for maintaining a healthy and balanced intestinal tract. It inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria and also boosts the immune system by producing lactic acid in the intestines.

Because minerals are most effective when acting synergistically in the presence of other minerals, Wholistic Sea Coral Calcium is able to deliver the most highly available and utilizable form of calcium because of its natural composition. Containing 38% calcium & 72 trace minerals, it is especially high in calcium and effectively enters the bloodstream for full utilization, unlike any other calcium supplement. Because of concerns with iodine and lead presence in Japanese waters, Caribbean origin coral is of higher quality than its Japanese counterpart and, of course, Wholistic Sea Coral Calcium is gathered from the top parts of the reef to preserve the precious integrity of the reefs and ocean life. Sea Coral Calcium vs. Bone Meal Sea Coral Calcium is a salt of calcium derived from fossilized remains of free flowing coral reefs. It is composed primarily of calcium carbonate, with small amounts of magnesium and 32 trace minerals. Because sea coral calcium contails all trace minerals, it is a more bioavailable and effective form of calcium. Sea coral minerals also do not contain pollutants such as heavy metals, chemicals or fertilizers. Bone Meal is whole bone that is ground into a fine powder and is subject to very high temperatures during the manufacturing process. Bones, by nature, are high in lead and mercury. Bone meal can therefore, be high in heavy metals and is not as bioavailable as sea coral calcium. Benefits Delivers Total Body Support Helps strengthen the immune system Easy to digest and highly absorbable Supports healthy bones & muscles Helps regulates body pH Ingredients Guaranteed Analysis per scoop: 1 scoop = 1/4 teaspoon Calcium carbonate 1200 mg Ingredients: Coral Calcium (Calcium carbonate) Especially high in calcium, containing 38% calcium and 72 trace minerals that act synergistically for complete effectiveness.

The stuff always smells good and seems edible to me...lol. Not always the case with anything dog food related. All my dogs have been having a clean bill of health at the vets (excellent really) so I think things are going well! I like having this organic supplement as a little bit of reassurance that my pups are getting everything they need. My 5 yo golden retriever loves this stuff mixed into his food. He has been using it for about 2 years now, and I have noticed a significant difference in his mobility. He used to struggle with his joints after playing fetch for long periods, but this has helped him so much, especially as he's aging. It's never too early to start a large breed dog on joint supplements! He also has a sensitive stomach, but this has never given him a problem and has kept him regular. We have been using this salmon oil for years and the quality of the oil is consistently good. I have never put it on my dogs food only to have them back away from their dish which has happened with other brands. When a pug refuses to eat their food, you know there is a problem. Wholistic Pet Organics Wild Salmon Oil is the only one we buy now. It keeps their coats shiny even during the long upstate NY winters. I originally began giving it to one of our dogs who had terrible allergies. It did not cure his allergies but he loved the taste, didn't itch as much and his coat was so stunning even our vet commented on it. This product is simply amazing. I have struggled for a few years to get my 5 year old German Shepherds allergies under control, both seasonal and food. This has helped me tremendously! He only eats once a day and we use it everyday for him - if we go more than 1 day without it the difference is insane! I will never take him off this supplement - worth every penny! I purchased this for my female following her second UTI as a youngster. Since starting this several years ago, it has been essential to her urinary health. While my girl still suffers from the occasional UTI due to excessive licking, at times, this product ensures her consistent urinary health. This will forever be a part of her supplement regimen, as will other Wholistic Pet Organics supplements. I have been using Run Free Soft Chews for all of my Black Labs. We lost our oldest one a year ago at the age of 14 years and 7 months. She still took long walks through the wood and played with her 10 year old sister. I attributed her long and healthy life to the addition of Run Free Soft Chews. Our 10 year old takes them and still hunts upland birds. We have a 5 month old puppy and have her started on Run Free Soft Chews already. I would definitely recommend! I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I discovered it's benefits by accident. I am a professional dog groomer. I was bathing a Golden Retriever that was prone to having hot spots. I was bathing him in a hypoallergenic shampoo that, of course, didn't have a smell to it and the dog was a bit stinky. I loved the smell of Heavenly Herbal Shampoo and so I put a few squirts of it in with the hypoallergenic shampoo I had mixed up. When my clients returned for their dogs next appointment, they requested I use the same shampoo as I'd used before because it had cleared up his hot spots! I This product is amazing! We had been back and forth to two different vets after our puppy had diarrhea multiple days a week for weeks on end, keeping us up at night. They would prescribe antibiotics or a probiotic, but nothing was working. Until we tried Digest All Plus. After a few days, he was no longer waking us up and not needing to frequently go outside to use the bathroom. We even recommended it to our friends who had similar issues and similar results! Thanks for a great product!

Our vet suggested glucosamine supplements for our huskies recently. These are the first ones I've found that I don't have to hide in peanut butter to get my picky huskies to eat them. I'm also happy to find a product that's manufactured in the USA. It took a bit to get my dog to take their multivitamin, but mixed it in some food and now all good. They also take a calcium supplement for the homeade food. Excellent products and the organic ingredients give me peace of mind. Love "}
