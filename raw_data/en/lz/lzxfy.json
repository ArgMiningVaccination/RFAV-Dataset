Founded by Dr. Justin Hoffman, Premier Integrative doesn't offer a 'doc-in-the-box' approach to naturopathic medical services. You won't be treated out of a van or given any prescription before testing. Our integrative medical clinic requires all new patients to receive a consultation prior to any service. Why? Because underlying conditions and/or current medications could interact negatively with new treatments. To protect the health and safety of each patient, our new patient consultations always address the patient's health concerns, any medications they are taking, and any underlying health issues they may be facing. It may also include recommended further testing and investigative work, depending on the patient's needs. Our goal is to help our patients overcome difficult symptoms and discover healthy treatments for the root problems \u2014 using the best of both integrative and traditional medicine. "}
