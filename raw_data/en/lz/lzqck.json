Kate, 44 My health was extremely worrying. I had severe hypertension, high sugar blood levels, depression, extreme bowel problems and insomnia. I looked like a Sumo-wrestler, just without the athletic ability. I had tried all kinds of diets from A-Z. . The blood test results, carried out, showed catastrophic results: 90% out of all my blood values were out of range. 90 percent! - I started with Metabolic Balance\u00ae with a weight of 157 kg. After just 5 months I weighed an incredible 102 kg. This was unbelievable! Despite my professional workload, I kept on losing weight and all of my blood values were soon back on track. Nearly two years after starting with Metabolic Balance\u00ae programme, I was able to take part in a half marathon. I have also participated in several triathlons and I have run countless kms in preparation. Today I weigh around 93 kg and have sensational blood values. I am still able to maintain my weight without difficulty, even though I am not keeping 100% to my plan. I just try to stick to most of the 8 principles. Myrian, 29 I began Metabolic Balance\u00ae when I kept putting on weight. At the end of 2011, I had acid reflux after each meal. My family doctor explained that, due to my weight, the acid in my stomach was being forced upwards and prescribed me medication against it. Straight after the appointment, I still couldn't believe, that at 26, I needed to take medicine for a condition caused by being overweight. - To this day, I have not used the prescription and decided instead to to change my life. I became aware of Metabolic Balance\u00ae through my colleague. I then researched it on the internet and searched for a coach. Next, I quickly made an appointment. How did you feel before Metabolic Balance\u00ae? Psychologically, I felt terrible. I became withdrawn and had lost my positive attitude towards life. This negative energy spread all around me. As I was already suffering from the consequences of being overweight, as described above, I knew it was time to change. On top of it all, I now also had high blood pressure. Why Metabolic Balance\u00ae? The thing that convinced me was the supervised nutrition plan. I had been looking for a specific plan to tell me how to eat properly for years, as well as a coach to support me through it. I was convinced that if you want to lose a lot of weight, you cannot do it alone. Or at least I couldn't do it on my own. Although Metabolic Balance\u00ae seemed quite expensive at first, it is a lifetime investment that more than pays for itself. My conscience also helped me through. When I thought about how much I had spent, I knew that I had to see it through. How did you find the programme? Initially it felt like like a detox. I was freezing cold and my skin was itching. I had to study the food list and work out where to find all the foods. Thankfully I got used to it quickly. Some people around me didn't understand why I was doing it, but there were also many who offered positive words of support. I pushed through Phase 1 and 2. In Phase 3, I had a few set-backs, but now I just follow the basic principles of Metabolic Balance\u00ae and still eat the foods from my plan. I felt the success immediately, and after 2 months I had already lost my first 10 kg. The rest of the weight just carried on dropping off. What is the biggest change since starting Metabolic Balance\u00ae? The biggest change for me was not gaining the weight back again! Before, I just used to watch the scales going up, no matter what I ate. Even after a long vacation, I can till manage to maintain my weight. This is my biggest success. I also just want to move around more and try out different sports. When you eat like this you have a yearning to be more active. Barb, 71 In my 40's I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or a severely underactive thyroid gland. Even though I was taking pills to substitute the missing hormones and was eating normally, I was still getting bigger and bigger. I was very unhappy. My doctor suggested that I try Metabolic Balance\u00ae to rebalance my metabolism. - How did you find the programme? The nutritional change was very difficult for me and my body really struggled. At times the suffering was so intense that nothing else mattered. Weak circulation, feeling cold, dry skin and tiredness. Nothing though, was as bad as the unhappy times I had experienced prior to this, so I endured the pain. All the time, my doctor and coach stood by me. Then finally I managed the metabolic adjustment and from then on things were fine. What is the biggest change since starting Metabolic Balance\u00ae? There has been no change now for the last 10 years. I have worn the same dress size (38) for all this time and I feel younger than ever. But my tastes in food has changed.

You want to start living a life that feels right for you You would like to cultivate a better relationship with food, learn whats right for your body and get your zest for life back You are done with fad diets and yo yo dieting The Four Phases of Metabolic Balance \u00ae Cleansing/Detox - prepare your body The first phase lasts two days. Your body becomes attuned to the new way of eating. In this cleansing phase, only light meals are eaten and the additional colon cleansing, supports the adjustment process. When the stomach and digestive tract are emptied, the body feeds itself from within, from the fat reserves (keto metabolism). Hunger is minimised. During this phase it's very important to drink lots of water and rest. Strict Phase - for change The body needs time to detoxify and to adjust your metabolism in order to get back into a healthy balance. Therefore, the second phase lasts for at least 14 days. We also call this the \"detox phase\". Your nutrition plan contains a delicious selection of fresh fruits and vegetables that are right for your body . A healthy diet, with the foods that are beneficial to you, supports detoxification almost entirely by itself. Relaxed - experiment and learn From here, it will get easier. No one can achieve a goal through constant restriction. Therefore, in Phase 3, you experiment with foods that are not on your list. In this way you can learn which foods you can eat again, without the old symptoms, such as bloating, heartburn, tiredness or headache. Of course, the \"off plan meals\" are considered a highlight in phase 3. On these days, you can relax with the Metabolic Balance rules and simply eat what you feel like. Live your life - cruise control for a good life Once you have spent time understanding how the different foods make you feel, your metabolism has reset, and your weight regulation is visible in so and many more ways than a number on the bathroom scales. You feel good, sleep well and your rejuvenated appearance gives you new self-confidence. Stay focused! Over the last few weeks and months, you have learned which foods are best for you.

Frequently Asked Questions - No. Metabolic Balance nutritional plans are not available without the support of a certified practitioner. We believe a fundamental requirement for your long term success is having the right support to guide you on your health journey. - While Metabolic Balance is an excellent program to do for preconception care, it is not suitable to do if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. This is due to the detoxification that will happen over the 12 weeks. - You don't have to worry about protecting your data. We only use your data to create your individual nutrition plan and do not pass it on to third parties. After two years, the following data will be deleted from our system or made unrecognisable: title, first name, last name, street, telephone, fax, cell phone and email address, date of birth, PDF file of the nutrition plan. - I am not able to offer payment plans for Metabolic Balance - Metabolic Balance requires your most recent blood test results. In order to generate your personalised nutrition plan, certain markers must be included. This is why more often than not you will need to get another test done. - If you have an eating disorder or have had one in the past, or if you have issues around distorted eating then Metabolic Balance is probably not the right program for you. My naturopathic consultations would be a much better fit. Teenagers, elite athletes, bodybuilders or strict vegans are also not suitable for Metabolic Balance.
