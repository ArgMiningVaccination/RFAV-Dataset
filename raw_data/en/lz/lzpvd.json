She attended the University of Houston and graduated in December 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology and a minor in Medicine in Society. During her time there she was a part of the Honor's College, a Residential Advisor and the Program Chair for her college's Natural Science and Mathematics Student Leadership Board, where she strived to create a community within her college and with the surrounding area. As the daughter of immigrants and as she learned more about the surrounding community in Houston as well as the social determinants of health from her minor, she began to notice the struggles that many face with health care that arise from factors outside of the clinic. She went on to shadow in the Harris Health System, which are low-income clinics in the Houston area. While there she shadowed an OB-GYN and saw a variety of patients who each brought their own narrative and was drawn to the way that the physician, she shadowed, was able to cater to her patient's needs. Something that she and her family had not always experienced in their own health care. Daniela also conducted research on Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis and other kidney diseases and through her work she was able to learn more about the health disparities related to kidney diseases. It was these experiences that turned her to the importance of social determinants and pushed her to seek out how she can better combat them as a physician. She is excited to build upon what she has learned and continue to better understand the patient through the Urban Health Scholar's program and hopefully begin to do what she can to address the inequalities in the health care system. Outside of school Daniela enjoys learning to cook new meals, spending time with her cat, Lil' Mamas, watching movies, drawing and painting. Kevin S.
