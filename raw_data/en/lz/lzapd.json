Functional medicine goes deeper. Functional medicine is a holistic approach to healing that involves research and testing to identify root causes of pain and then provide solutions that incorporate therapeutic healing techniques. Medical massage is a part of functional medicine that alleviates the buildup of tension and trigger points. Medical massage reduces stress and pain as part of a larger holistic treatment plan. Functional medicine is an approach to achieve sustainable well-being for the body and mind. It allows patients to recover from disease by going beyond the superficial and identifying the deep-rooted causes of pain. The holistic style brings a systematic approach to healing. To better treat our patients, we also offer science-based laboratory tests that analyze the genetic predispositions that influence their health. In this way, functional medicine carefully turns over stones in a search for the origin of illness. Then prescribes a unique course of action to restore long-lasting health. Medical massage is an important part of the functional medicine modality. This form of therapy helps to revive circulation in the body and promotes a healthy immune system from the inside out. Medical massage can alleviate the pain points that lie deep within us and address physical, mental, and emotional pain at its source. Here we'll explain some key elements of functional medicine and how medical massage can rejuvenate the body back to its optimum state of being. What makes functional medicine unique? Unlike typical western medicine, functional medicine is not a temporary solution to simply numb or dull the pain and make it more tolerable to live with. Rather, functional medicine applies therapeutic treatments to achieve sustainable freedom from pain and disease, addressing it at the core cause. Functional medicine starts with scientific testing. In this way, we can go far beyond the surface of pain symptoms by: Gathering information and look at the whole picture Considering each body system in conjunction with one another, not separately Identifying where the illness stems from The functional approach also invokes a team of unique bodyworkers and holistic health practitioners to work together. Specialists with different areas of expertise collaborate to curate a personalized plan. The result is a holistic remedy that weaves together each approach's strengths. Why choose functional medicine? [Functional medicine](https://www.eacuwell.com/functional-medicine) is unique to you and your body makeup. Through the integrative approach, you receive a personalized roadmap. It will encompass a variety of therapeutic interventions to address your pain points based on your nutritional and biological makeup. We believe that you are unique, and so is the constellation of attributes that create your pain. Thus, our treatment plans are designed just for you. Functional medicine to reduce stress Functional medicine accounts for the impact of stress in a way that western medicine often overlooks. Our immune system suffers when prolonged and excessive stress builds in the body (and heart). Excessive stress can compromise the immune system, which is the body's natural ability to cure itself. Disease exacerbates our experience of pain and makes the rejuvenation process more complicated. By choosing functional medicine, we simultaneously address the root causes of pain and alleviate stress, recognizing the stress that can be an agonist to much of our disease. Typically, western medicine and its symptom-treatment based methods have been at the forefront of the U.S healthcare industry. While these treatments help mitigate pain symptoms, they do not offer a solution that ends the problems at their source. They also don't account for intensified dysfunction caused by high stress levels. Integrative medicine looks at the big picture and accounts for stress as a trigger for chronic pain. What is medical massage? Medical massage is a service provided to functional medicine patients that targets the source of pain identified during testing. This type of bodywork helps to clear away accumulated masses of tension. Therapists are guided to address the ailments based on the treatment developed by a collaborative team. [Medical massage](https://www.amtamassage.org/publications/massage-therapy-journal/massage-therapy-and-integrative-medicine/) goes beyond providing simple (and fleeting) relaxation. Instead, it targets overused joints and muscles to open blockages within the body, both physically and energetically. We minimize the build-up of physical tension on a neuromuscular level through this type of body work. Patients are matched with [licensed massage therapists](https://www.eacuwell.com/about-us) who use deep tissue massage techniques on the body. They stimulate those places that carry excessive strain. Once matched with an LMT, and regularly receiving medical massages, the therapist will develop a deeper understanding of your problem areas. Then, they can help you to work through them. The resulting massages will be more effective and contribute to total body healing. Medical massage as a holistic healing modality Functional medicine recognizes that relaxation-oriented massage is unlikely to offer a profound or lasting solution to your chronic pain. While on the other hand, medical massages are incorporated into a larger treatment plan, to promote well-being that lasts. Chronic illness cannot be cured by taking pills or non-natural medications. This only leads to a long-term dependency to alleviate pain. By including medical massage in your functional medicine health plan, you take an active approach to total well-being. Medical massage as a way to reduce stress [Medical massage](https://www.massagemag.com/all-functional-medicine-doctors-are-not-alike-34767/) as a treatment contributes to overall stress reduction and healing. Massage is used to stimulate and clear away the tension points over time. Repeated application of pressure is applied to deep muscle and connective tissue. Through this technique, the body can slowly and steadily adjust and release hidden stress and tension. It is also a way to address how stress impacts the immune system. It can improve general body circulation and encourage the lymphatic system's natural movement when applied effectively. The reduction of stress leads to better immune system function, allowing the body to use its built-in self-healing properties. Common applications for medical massage Most people can benefit from medical massage. However, those experiencing the following diseases, ailments, or pains are encouraged to consider adding medical message into their integrative medicine regime: athletic or sport injuries arthritis and joint pain back pain chronic pain circulation issues immune issues lymphatic issues mental illness trauma Medical massage is also an effective post-operative support tool because it supports the immune system and natural body circulation. Holistic health for the long term through medical massage Mainstream medicine only addresses and treats the symptoms of pain and disease. However, functional medicine goes much deeper, getting to the root of the cause. With the support of medical massages prescribed as part of a holistic treatment plan, patients can achieve a pain-free lifestyle. If you experience chronic pain, functional medicine that encompasses medical massage may be the solution for you.
