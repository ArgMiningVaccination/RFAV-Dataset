Avedon is currently writing a book on Tibet to be published by Alfred A. Knopf. By John F. Avedon r. Yeshi Donden pressed the three middle fingers of his right hand gently along the inside of William Schneider's left wrist, bowed his head and appeared to listen to the pulse. The 52-year-old patient smiled, visibly perplexed. The physician before him wore neither white coat nor name tag. He asked no questions and carried no charts or instruments. Dressed in the maroon robes of a Tibetan monk, head shaved, a turquoise-studded charm box bulging beneath his orange shirt, he seemed to have materialized out of another time and place. For almost a minute, Dr. Donden remained motionless, deep in concentration, fingers arrayed on Mr. Schneider's left arm. He then examined the patient's other arm, quickly palpating the radial artery as if to confirm his findings. After ushering Mr. Schneider into an adjacent room, Dr. Donden gestured for him to undress, whereupon he pressed selected points along the patient's spine. With each touch, Mr. Schneider cried out in pain. Dr. Donden nodded sympathetically and had him get dressed. Reseated in his living room at the University of Virginia's guest faculty housing, Dr. Donden offered his diagnosis of William Schneider, a man he knew nothing of and had met only minutes before. ''Many years ago you lifted a heavy object,'' said Dr.Donden, speaking through an interpreter. ''At that time you damaged a channel in the vicinity of your right kidney. Because of this, the normal flow of wind through your back was blocked, causing it to accumulate in inappropriate spots. There is bone deterioration and the disease has now become quite severe.'' William Schneider appeared stunned. For three years, he said, he had been suffering from acute traumatic arthritis of the cervical and lumbar regions along the neck and lower back, which caused constant incapacitating pain and forced him to give up his job. But he was even more astonished by Dr. Donden's ability to reconstruct his past. ''In 1946,'' he said, ''I injured my back lifting a milk can out of a cooler. I was in bed for a week, and when I finally got out, I re-in- FIRST JUMP jured myself and was in bed for another week. That must have been the start of the whole problem.'' It was a simple enough diagnosis, one perhaps that many physicians could deduce by taking X-rays or using other modern techniques. Dispatched by the 14th Dalai Lama - the supreme temporal and spiritual ruler of the Tibetan people who has lived in exile in India for the last 21 years - to share the discoveries of his 1,200-year-old art, Dr. Donden has been astonishing American doctors and patients alike. The Dalai Lama's 51-year-old personal physician spent three months in the spring of 1980 at the University of Virginia. His methods appear to be equal parts old-fashioned country doctoring, scholarly learning, primitive practice, religious counseling and common sense. His diagnoses and treatments combine delicate and extensive pulse readings, herbal remedies, acupuncture, meditation and spiritual teachings of this 1,200-year-old art. Though Dr. Donden's claims have been greeted in this country with a mixture of curiosity, wonder and skepticism, some members of established centers of medicine and science are beginning to take a serious look at them. Their interest stems partly from scientific curiosity and partly from the hope that some aspects of these Tibetan healing arts can have a place in Western medical practice. Spurred by the success of an experiment on a small number of cancerous mice whose tumors shrank and whose lifespans were lengthened when treated with Dr. Donden's cancer medications, the University of Virginia allocated funds for a small research project to investigate these findings further. And Dr. Herbert Benson, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, is planning to lead a research team next month to the Tibetan Medical Center in Dharmsala, India, to look into Tibetan treatments for hepatitis, diabetes and hypertension. While these projects do not imply an endorsement of the Tibetan techniques, they are part of the West's increasing interest in holistic approaches to health care. American physicians are beginning to recognize that cultures less advanced in modern medical techniques may still possess effective treatments. Although many Western physicians remain unconvinced by claims that lack observable documentation under controlled conditions, others are frankly intrigued and argue that Western physicians - and ultimately their patients -can benefit from the application of treatments that have been unknown to the West or were abandoned with medicine's long climb into the modern era. The diagnostic methods of Tibetan medicine have been particularly provocative. ''Dr. Donden often makes a correct diagnosis by a system of reference and techniques entirely different from ours,'' explained Dr. Gerald Goldstein, a professor in the University of Virginia's medical oncology department, after observing the Tibetan physician at work. ''He uses all of his senses as his medical instrument. Our patients have been very impressed.'' Dr. Richard Selzer, an assistant professor of surgery at Yale University, said he was practically ''spellbound'' when he first witnessed a demonstration of the Tibetan's unorthodox diagnostic techniques, but was unconvinced that what he was seeing held any scientific validity. ''Dr. Donden drew a chair up to a patient's bed, pulled a shawl over his head while he felt his pulse for about l5 minutes, and then he closely examined a urine specimen,'' Dr. Selzer recalled. ''His subsequent diagnosis was correct in a way, but it was cast in such highly ambiguous language, it could be interpreted in many ways. It was as if he was a human electrocardiogram machine interpreting the component parts of the pulse beat.'' Harvard's Dr. Benson, whose longstanding interest in the use of meditation to treat high blood pressure led him to write ''The Relaxation Response,'' also has not seen any conclusive evidence of Tibetan cures for degenerative diseases that defy Western medicine. ''Western scientific documentation of their claims is nonexistent,'' he said, but added that it would be wrong to dismiss them without investigation and that he suspects the ''cures'' may well depend on psychosomatic factors. ''What we have defined as the placebo effect, which encompasses the beliefs and expectations of both the doctor and patient, as well as the doctor-patient relationship,'' he said, ''is very similar to what Dr. Donden himself describes as part of his work. With his emphasis on compassion, he indeed capitalizes on such healing aspects.'' Other Western physicians take a similarly hard-eyed look at the claims made by Dr. Donden and others. Such skepticism derives from the recent popularity in the West of a suspect branch of medicine - an unorthodox view that rejects established theories in favor of extravagant claims, which, they say, may actually injure patients. Dr. Gerard Burrow, currently director of endocrinology at Toronto General Hospital, agrees with Dr. Benson. On the staff at Yale when Dr. Donden visited in 1974, he says he has the utmost respect for the Tibetan physician. ''I think Tibetan medicine has a great deal to offer Western medicine in terms of the physician-patient relationship,'' said Dr. Burrow. ''But I think that Western medicine has much more to offer in terms of the diagnosis and therapy of specific diseases.'' Ultimately, the confidence of Western physicians in Tibetan medicine will depend upon controlled experiments that can confirm the many claims of cures. ''The impetus for this exchange is clear,'' continued Gerald Goldstein. ''More than one-third of our pharmacopoeia comes from plants and microorganisms. These are just the sort of materials Tibetans have acquired experience with over centuries of use.'' Dr. Donden views the purpose of his mission to the West in broader terms. ''If Western medicine can come to understand the Tibetan presentation of the human organism, I feel it will be of inestimable value. Our medicine has many proven cures for diseases that Western doctors currently don't understand or have incorrectly identified. Because the Tibetan system is scientific, as scientists they will see just what is of value and what is not.'' Tibetan medicine defies neat description in Western terms because it is so closely integrated with Tibet's ancient culture, herbal medicines and, purportedly, the word of Buddha. Founded on four root texts known as the Medical Tantras (supplemented by several hundred commentaries), it was brought to Tibet in the eighth century. From that time on, it developed independently: first in a line of physicians in attendance at the royal court; later, in a more widespread fashion, through Lhasa's two medical colleges, Chakpori and Mendze Khang. SECOND JUMP The four Tantras delineate 84,000 diseases grouped into 1,004 separate categories, for which 2,000 mixtures of herbs and minerals are listed as remedies. They attribute the cause of all illness, both physical and emotional, to imbalances among three essential humors that govern the human body: wind, described as light, rough, cold and energetic; bile - oily, acrid and hot, and phlegm - cool, heavy, gentle and sticky. To diagnose a patient, Tibetan doctors analyze nine aspects of the urine by smell and 12 of the pulse. The latter procedure involves considerable delicacy, necessitating years of training and is radically different from Western physicians' measure of the heartbeat. Using the inner and outer halves of the tips of the three middle fingers on both hands, the physician ''reads'' the condition of the humors in 12 of the patient's organs. For instance, according to the Medical Tantras the outside of the right index finger monitors the heart; the inside, the small intestines; the outside of the right middle finger records the spleen; the inside, the stomach. Early on, according to Dr. Donden, Tibetan physicians practiced a primitive form of heart surgery. But in the ninth century - in the wake of a failed heart operation on a king's mother - surgery was banned. Treatments still permitted included acupuncture, moxibustion (the burning of herbs on the skin) and bloodletting. The essence of Tibetan medicine, however, lies not so much in practice as in orientation. ''Compassion is the special prerequisite of being a doctor,'' explained Dr. Donden. ''In my own life, the more I have seen of suffering, the more I have come to feel compassion. I am an ordinary person affected by desire, hatred and ignorance. I can't make any claims. But whatever I do, I do my best to make love and compassion the center of my motivation.'' Yeshi Donden was born in 1929 to a prosperous family of farmers in the Lo-Ga district of central Tibet. By the age of 6, he had left home, sent by his parents to the 400 monks of Shedrup Ling Gompa, or Place of Meditation and Study. Because of his ability to memorize - the principal means of study for young monks in Tibet - the young Donden was chosen to pursue a career in medicine at Mendze Khang, the larger and more modern of the medical schools. Situated in the middle of Lhasa, Mendze Khang's student body consisted of more than 400 monks and laymen from all across Tibet and Mongolia (twice the size of its sister school, Chakpori). On an astrologically auspicious day, Yeshi Donden, then 11, formally entered the college and set to work memorizing the 1,140 pages of the four Medical Tantras. Two years later, he recited the texts for his teacher and then took a full exam, which he passed with high grades, and was admitted into the first class of formal medical training. For the next five years, Dr. Donden pursued a strenuous curriculum, including anatomy, embryology, pathology, diagnostic techniques and the identification and preparation of medicines. Of all the studies, he found pulse diagnosis the most difficult. The physician's fingers, he explained, had to be ''smooth, sensitive, without scars and pliable.'' The medical texts themselves give a vivid indication of just how sensitive the doctor must be to subtle variations of what laymen would consider a simple pulse beat. There are scores of different pulse types mentioned in almost lyrical terms. One is the so-called ''irregular'' death pulse, likened to ''a vulture attacking a small bird who suddenly stops, plunges, flutters its wings, stops again and then resumes its fall.'' If a mortal illness is caused by an imbalance among all three of the humors described in the texts (wind, bile and phlegm), the patient's pulse will be like ''the saliva of a drooling cow slowly blowing in the wind.'' As in the West, the radial artery at the wrist is considered the best amplifier of the activity of the heart and other organs. Neither too far, nor too close to the central organs, its sound is equated in Tibetan medical literature to ''a voice shouting across an open field in summer.'' For those who completed the painstaking tasks of memorization, the next step was a pilgrimage deep into the mountains. A caravan of 300 or more students would spend two months each summer collecting medicinal herbs for the following year's work. For the year-end exam, a large tent was erected at the center of the encampment and 200 herbs were arranged on cloth-covered piles of wood. The students were called in to identify each herb by sight, smell and taste. When he was 20, Yeshi Donden scored third in his class behind his two roommates. But because the three scores were so close, the young men were retested. Eyes closed, they were asked to identify the plants on the basis of taste and smell alone. ''I was graduating that year,'' recalls Dr. Donden in his understated way. ''My friends made little mistakes so I would come in first.'' In 1951, after two years of internship, he received his medical degree at the age of 22 and left Lhasa to practice in his own district. Arriving home, Dr. Donden's first sight was the advance guard of more than 20,000 Chinese troops speeding toward the Holy City. They were the advance units of an invasion of Tibet by the Chinese that had been under way since the previous year. Yeshi Donden had little time to dwell on his nation's fate. An influenza epidemic had broken out along the Bhutanese border. ''I was able to identify and treat this illness where others had failed. And as a result,'' he explained, ''I became quite famous.'' His reputation earned, Dr. Donden spent the next years traveling from one district to another, his skills in constant demand. By his 30th birthday, however, a popular uprising against the Chinese occupation (originating in 1956 in eastern Tibet, or Kham) engulfed the entire country. Fighting erupted in Lhasa itself. The 24-year-old Dalai Lama escaped by night from his summer palace to India, followed by tens of thousands of his people. ''I saw His Holiness when his party came through my village,'' recalled Dr. Donden. ''Those who weren't following him had joined the guerrillas to put up a last fight for our freedom. As a monk, I could not fight, so I borrowed a horse, said farewell to my parents, who were too old to make the journey, and set off alone.'' Within a few months, after a harrowing trek through the snowcovered mountains of eastern Tibet, Dr. Donden arrived in India, where he was sent to Dalhousie by the Tibetan Government-in-exile (re-established in the Indian city of Dharmsala). Many of the 30,000 refugees camped there in squalid conditions had contracted tuberculosis and other diseases. Preparing what medicine he could from herbs purchased in Indian stores, he set up a clinic and went to work. ''One day, a man who worked as a sweeper in my clinic was bitten by a poisonous snake,'' Dr. Donden remembered. ''Just as I was applying a Tibetan tourniquet, an Indian doctor arrived and said that the man would die in half an hour unless his leg was amputated. I told him that this was unnecessary. The Indian doctor asked the patient whose treatment he wished to follow. The sweeper replied that he preferred mine. There were many aspects to my treatment, but after 10 days the sweeper could move about. In a month he was completely well.'' Shortly thereafter, Yeshi Donden was summoned to Dharmsala, soon to become the Dalai Lama's personal physician. ''I arrived just before sunset'' continued Dr. Donden. ''The hills were covered with tents and shacks. Thousands of people were living one on top of another. They had refused to leave the Dalai Lama and were going wherever he went.'' THIRD JUMP As one of only three physicians who had managed to escape from his homeland, Dr. Donden undertook the task of preserving the art of Tibetan medicine for future generations. Working out of the Tibetan Children's Village (founded in 1961 to care for orphaned children), he began to teach 10 students the rudiments of the ancient skill. Progress, however, was hampered by an almost total lack of funds. Yeshi Donden could do little, until one day his many confrontations with Indian doctors yielded an ironically positive result. Responding to repeated claims by local physicians that the Tibetan was ''stealing'' their patients, the Indian Minister of Health himself arrived in Dharmsala to investigate. For six days he watched Dr. Donden diagnose patients by their pulse, after which the minister asked each individual his or her ailment. The day before he returned to New Delhi, the minister came to Dr. Donden's office. ''You are doing very good work here,'' he said. ''There's only one problem. You don't have enough students. I'm going to give you 40,000 rupees (about $5,000) a year and a 20-bed hospital.'' As a result, the Tibetan Medical Center was born. With the center's opening, Dr. Donden assumed the role of director, instructor, pharmacologist, as well as chief examining physician. With no other Tibetan physicians to assist him, he shortened the traditional training period to seven years. He taught men and women alike, some 40 of whom are now spread throughout the large agricultural settlements on which 80 percent of the refugees live. As in Tibet, students travel into the mountains behind Dharmsala to collect herbs each summer. Machines have replaced much of the labor in the manufacture of pills, of which some 300 types are routinely made. In 1969, Dr. Donden resigned from the center and opened a private practice. He has since seen an unending stream of Indian patients, the majority of whom are afflicted with cancer and diabetes, and Tibetans who seem mostly to suffer from tuberculosis. He continues to see the Dalai Lama every other day, taking his pulse just after sunrise. In 1978, a second physician was appointed by the Dalai Lama to work with him so that Dr. Donden could be free to travel in the West. ''Western medicine acts quickly and is helpful in cutting acute symptoms,'' Yeshi Donden observed at the end of his three-month visit to the United States. ''On the other hand, Tibetan medicine acts gradually, over a long period of time.'' He has made claims involving a wide variety of chronic illnesses that defy Western medical treatment - everything, it seems, from problems of childbirth to longevity. Although some of Dr. Donden's assertions may sound outlandish, Western physicians are willing to keep an open mind. ''If these claims are only in part true, they would be worthy of investigation,'' said Dr. Benson. ''Therefore, can we really afford to ignore them?'' ''Research today is a cost-benefit situation,'' said Dr. Donald G. Baker, associate professor of radiology at the University of Virginia. ''How is a drug company going to collect all of these medicines in northern India and still make a profit at it?'' But there are even more serious problems. ''The kind of information required by the F.D.A. before Tibetan medicines could be approved for use in this country would take an army of lab technicians years to develop,'' Dr. Goldstein said. ''Each ingredient must be individually identified, purified from its crude state and then thoroughly tested. Who is going to pay for it?'' Nevertheless, he feels that in the end the benefit would justify the cost. ''Personally, I think that the drug companies are missing a bet,'' he added. ''Some of these medicines are definitely going to be active.'' In the East itself, the bet has not been missed. Whereas Peking has actively disassembled almost every indigenous institution of the old Tibet, it has pursued a more restrained policy in regard to Tibetan medicine. Though Chakpori was razed following the 1959 uprising, Mendze Khang has not only been preserved, it has been augmented. The greater part of its facilities have been transferred to the newly completed Hospital of Tibetan Medicine in Lhasa, which with 127 doctors treats 600 to 700 outpatients a day. Under the Communists, the physicians have been forced to curtail their research in the area of the mind's relationship to the body, yet they have made many improvements. Drawings of herbs have been replaced by books of color photographs cataloguing the different medicines. In addition, the hospital operates high-altitude farms on which many of the herbs are now cultivated. Given the recent thaw in Chinese-American relations, as well as that between Peking and Dharmsala, it may soon be possible to study Tibetan medicine in Tibet itself. Yet this does not solve the Tibetan Medical Center's financial difficulties. At present, the hope is that Dr. Benson and his co-workers will find preliminary evidence to establish the value of further exploration into Tibetan medicine. Planning to remain in Dharmsala for several weeks, the Harvard team will be composed of physicians and physiologists who hope to gain direct insight into the medical and cultural aspects of Tibetan medicine. ''Because our system has so many facets,'' said Dr. Donden, ''the best possible course would be for a group of young doctors to come to India and stay for two to seven years.'' ''Western society should be able to extract from the Tibetan system more effective medicine,'' said Dr. Goldstein. And for the Tibetans, too, a fresh perspective could only be of benefit. He added, ''There has been "}
