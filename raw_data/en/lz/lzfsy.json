After a bench trial, the trial court agreed that three of Living Essentials' advertising campaigns violated the CPA. The trial court assessed a civil penalty against Living Essentials and awarded the State its attorney fees and costs. Living Essentials argues on appeal that the trial court (1) erred by adopting the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) prior-substantiation doctrine, (2) that the prior- substantiation doctrine violates article I, section 5 of the Washington State Constitution, (3) that Living Essentials' claims were mere puffery which did not require substantiation, (4) the trial court applied the wrong standard for necessary substantiation, and (5) the No. 76463-2-1/2 trial court erred in concluding that Living Essentials' Ask Your Doctor claim was deceptive. Living Essentials also challenges the trial court's penalty and award of attorney fees. We affirm.1 II. Living Essentials produces and markets the energy drink 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. During its advertising campaign, Living Essentials made numerous claims about the efficacy of 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. Three of those claims are relevant to this appeal. First, Living Essentials claimed that 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae was \"Superior to Coffee\" (Superior to Coffee claim). Specifically, Living Essentials claimed that \"the key vitamins and nutrients [in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae] work synergistically with caffeine to make the biochemical or physiological effects last longer than caffeine alone.\" Second, Living Essentials claimed that the decaf variety of 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae provided energy, alertness, and focus \"for hours.\" (Decaf claim). Living Essentials provided the basic message, if you do not like caffeine then \"Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae ... can provide the alertness you want without the 'caffeine feeling' you don't.\" Third, Living Essentials implied that 73 percent of doctors would recommend 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae (Ask Your Doctor claim). In an ad that ran on national television, a spokesperson said We asked over 3,000 doctors to review 5-hour Energy\u00ae, and what they said is amazing. Over 73% who reviewed 5-hour Energy\u00ae said they would recommend a low calorie energy supplement to their healthy patients who use energy supplements. 73%. 5-hour Energy has 4 calories and is used over nine million times a week. Is 5-hour Energy right for you? Ask your doctor. We already asked 3,000. 1 The State filed a motion to strike or disregard portions of appellants' opening and reply briefs. Because the State prevailed in this appeal, it is unnecessary for us to consider the merits of this motion. The State's motion is denied. -2-No. 76463-2-1/3 After an 11-day bench trial involving testimony and transcripts of testimony from 20 lay and expert witnesses and the admission of approximately 500 exhibits, the trial court issued a 57-page decision including detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Following FTC guidance, the trial court concluded that Living Essentials Superior to Coffee, Decaf, and Ask Your Doctor claims were deceptive and violated the CPA. With respect to the Superior to Coffee claim the trial court found that the real takeaway was \"that the combination of caffeine, B vitamins and amino acids would provide energy that would last longer than consumers would experience from a cup of premium coffee (and in some of the ads, longer than 3 or 4 cups of coffee).\" The court further found that \"[t]he studies [Living Essentials presented] do not clearly establish that 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae's vitamins and nutrients work synergistically with caffeine to make these benefits last longer than they would last with caffeine alone.\" Living Essentials' claim that \"5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae works better than caffeine alone ... is certainly plausible, given the science presented to the Court, but it remains a hypothesis, not an established scientific fact.\" The court concluded that \"Living Essentials violated the [CPA] when it aired or published ads that represented that the energy, alertness and from 5-hour ENERGY\u00ae lasts longer than a cup of coffee because of the synergistic effects of caffeine, B vitamins and nutrients in the product.\" The trial court also found that \"Living Essentials lacks competent and reliable scientific evidence to claim that decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae will generate energy and alertness that 'lasts for hours.\"' The trial court concluded that \"Living Essentials violated the [CPA] when it claimed in a press release and on its web site that Decaf 5-hour ENERGY\u00ae will provide energy, alertness and focus that lasts for hours.\" -3-No. 76463-2-1/4 Finally, the trial court determined that the \"Ask-Your-Doctors\" claim was deceptive. The court found that the \"net impression\" from the ad was that \"a substantial majority of doctors believe 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae is a safe and effective nutritional supplement that doctors would recommend to their patients.\" The court noted that \"while the statistics displayed ... were literally true, the impression left by the ads was not.\" Based on the number of times the ads aired or the number of bottles of product sold, the trial court imposed a $2,183,747 civil penalty and awarded the State its attorney fees and costs. Living Essentials appeals. II. Living Essentials first raises multiple challenges to the trial court's findings and conclusions that Living Essentials' Superior to Coffee, Decaf, and Ask Your Doctor claims were deceptive and violated the CPA. \"[W]hether a particular action gives rise to a Consumer Protection Act violation is reviewable as a question of law.\" Leingang v. Pierce County. Med. Bureau, 131 Wn.2d 133, 150, 930 P .2d 288 (1997). Whether a party committed the particular violation, however, is reviewed under the substantial evidence test. Leingang, 131 Wn.2d at 150. \"Substantial evidence is evidence in sufficient quantum to persuade a fair-minded person of the truth of the declared premise.\" Holland v. Boeing Co., 90 Wn.2d 384, 390, 583 P.2d 621 (1978). \"The substantial evidence standard is deferential and requires the court to view the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed\" below. Mansour v. King County, 131 Wn. App. 255, 263, 128 P.3d 1241 (2006). -4-No. 76463-2-1/5 Unchallenged findings of fact are verities on appeal. State v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, Inc., 81 Wn.2d 259, 263-64, 501 P.2d 290 (1972).2 Further, mere assertions of error are not enough. When a challenged finding is unsupported by argument on appeal, this court need not consider the assignment of error. Bryant v. Palmer Coking Coal Co., 86 Wn. App. 204, 216, 936 P.2d 1163 (1997).3 Even where the evidence conflicts, the appellate court need only determine \"whether the evidence most favorable to the prevailing party supports the challenged findings.\" Prostov v. State, Dept. of Licensing, 186 Wn. App. 795, 820, 349 P.3d 874 (2015). Finally, the reviewing court \"defer[s] to the trier of fact regarding witness credibility or conflicting testimony.\" Weyerhaeuser v. Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dep't, 123 Wn. App. 59, 65, 96 P .3d 460 (2004). Reviewing courts will not reweigh the evidence or the credibility of witnesses on appeal. Washington Belt & Drive Sys., Inc. v. Active Erectors, 54 Wn. App. 612, 616, 774 P.2d 1250 (1989).4 A. Living Essentials' primary contention is that the trial court erred by relying on the FTC's \"prior substantiation doctrine\" because it has not been adopted in Washington, cannot be judicially adopted, and is inconsistent with Washington CPA law. We disagree. A brief review of the CPA and FTC's prior substantiation doctrine is helpful. 2 Living Essentials does not assign error to numerous findings of fact. See, !2.:..9.:., Unchallenged findings 1-9, 1, 13-14{d){6), 15-16{a)-(c)(1), 16(d{10-{4), and portions of 10, 16{c)(2), 16{d)(5)-(6), 17, 19, 20, 22. 3 Living Essentials assigns error to several findings but fails to provide argument in support of the assignment. See, !2.:..9.:., Findings 14(d)(7), 16(c)(2), 19{i), 20{d), 22{a), 22(a)(2)-{3). 4 Living Essentials assigns error to several of the trial court's credibility determinations and weighing of evidence. See, !2.:..9.:., Findings 16, 16(c)(2), 16{d)(5)-{6), 17{c), 19, 20, 22. -5-No. 76463-2-1/6 1. The CPA prohibits \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\" RCW 19.86.020. The purpose of the CPA is \"to protect the public and foster fair and honest competition.\" RCW 19.86.920. The CPA is meant to be liberally construed to serve this purpose. Short v. Demopolis, 103 Wn.2d 52, 60-61, 691 P.2d 163 (1984). The Washington Attorney General may bring an enforcement action under the CPA. The State must prove three elements: \"(1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice, (2) occurring in trade or commerce, and (3) a public interest impact.\" State v. Kaiser, 161 Wn. App. 705, 719, 254 P.3d 850 (2011 ). The State is not required to prove that the unfair or deceptive advertisements actually injured consumers or that consumers relied on deceptive ads when deciding whether to purchase or consume the advertised products. Kaiser, 161 Wn. App. at 719. A CPA claim \"does not require a finding of an intent to deceive or defraud and therefore good faith on the part of the seller is immaterial.\" Wine v. Theodoratus, 19 Wn. App. 700, 706, 577 P.2d 612 (1978). The CPA does not define \"unfair or deceptive acts or practice.\" Instead, our Supreme Court has allowed the definition to evolve through the \"gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion.\" Klem v. Washington Mut. Bank, 176 Wn.2d 771, 785, 295 P.3d 1179 (2013). \"Given that there is 'no limit to human inventiveness,' courts, as well as legislatures, must be able to determine whether an act or practice is unfair or deceptive to fulfill the protective purpose of the CPA.\" Klem, 176 Wn.2d at 786 (quoting Panag v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Wash., 166 Wn.2d 27, 48, 204 P.3d 885 (2009)). -6-No. 76463-2-1/7 A claim under the CPA may be predicated upon (1) a per se violation of statute, (2) an act or practice that has the capacity to deceive substantial portions of the public, or (3) an unfair or deceptive act or practice not regulated by statute but in violation of public interest. Klem, 176 Wn.2d at 787. \"An act is deceptive if it is likely to mislead a reasonable consumer.\" State v. Mandatory Poster, 199 Wn. App. 506, 512, 398 P.3d 1271 (2017}. \"A plaintiff need not show that the act in question was intended to deceive, but that the alleged act had the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public.\" Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. v. Safeco Title Insurance Company, 105 Wn.2d 778, 785, 719 P.2d 531 (1986). Further, a truthful statement \"may be deceptive by virtue of the 'net impression' it conveys.\" Panag, 166 Wn.2d at 50. Washington's CPA was initially adopted in 1961 and modeled generally after section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(1 ); Hangman Ridge, 105 Wn.2d at 783. As with the CPA, the FTCA broadly prohibits \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\" The CPA was intended to \"complement the body of federal law governing restraints of trade, unfair competition and unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent acts or practices.\" RCW 19.86.920. As such, \"in construing this act, the courts [should] be guided by the final decisions of the federal courts and final orders of the federal trade commission.\" RCW 19.86.920; State v. Black, 100 Wn.2d 793, 799, 676 P.2d 963 (1984) (\"When the Legislature enacted the Consumer Protection Act, it anticipated that courts would be guided by the interpretation given by federal courts to their corresponding federal statutes.\"). Washington courts have repeatedly adopted federal court interpretations of section 5 of the FTCA when reviewing CPA cases. See Boeing Co. v. Sierracin Corp., -7-No. 76463-2-1/8 108 Wn.2d (1987) (citing RCW 19.86.920) (\"In the absence of Washington cases discussing when assertion of trade secrets constitutes a violation of antitrust laws, [courts] are guided by interpretations of the federal courts.\"); Fisher v. World-Wide Trophy Outfitters, 15 Wn. App. 742, 748,551 P.2d 1398 (1976) (citing Exposition Press, Inc. v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 295 F.2d 869, 873 (2nd Cir. 1961) (using the Second Circuit's interpretation of an unfair or deceptive act). See also Panag, 166 Wn.2d at 50 (quoting Sw. Sunsites, Inc. v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 785 F.2d 1431, 1435 (9th Cir. 1986)) (Deception exists \"if there is a representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead.\"); Blewett v. Abbott Labs, 86 Wn. App. 782, 787, 938 P.2d 842 (1997) (\"The directive to be 'guided by' federal law does not mean we are bound to follow it. But neither are we free to ignore it, and indeed in practice Washington courts have uniformly followed federal precedent in matters described under the [CPA].\"). Under section 5 of the FTCA, in order to prove that an advertisement is deceptive, the FTC must establish that the advertisement (1) conveys a representation through either express or implied claims; (2) that the representation is likely to mislead consumers; and (3) that the misleading representation is material. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Direct Mktg. Concepts, Inc., 569 F. Supp. 2d 285, 297 (D. Mass 2008), aff'd, 624 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 201 0). \"Neither proof of consumer reliance nor consumer injury is necessary to establish a section 5 violation.\" Federal Trade Comm'n v. Freecom Commc'ns, Inc., 401 F.3d 1192, 1203 (10th Cir. 2005). The FTC can prove that a representation is likely to mislead consumers by establishing either (1) actual falsity of express or implied claims (\"falsity\" theory); or (2) that the advertiser lacked a reasonable basis for asserting the representation was true (\"reasonable basis\" theory). Federal -8-No. 76463-2-1/9 Corp., 33 F.3d 1088, 1096 (9th Cir. 1994) (citing In the Matter of Thompson Med. Co., 104 F.T.C. 648 (1984)); Federal Trade Comm'n v. John F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1067 (C.D. Cal. 2012).5 Under the reasonable basis theory, if an advertisement states or impliedly suggests that a product successfully performs an advertised function or yields an advertised benefit, the advertiser must have a \"reasonable basis\" for the claim. Federal Trade Comm'n v. COORGA Nutraceuticals Corp., 201 F. Supp. 3d 1300, 1308-09 (D. Wyo. 2016) (citing Pfizer, Inc., 81 F.T.C. 23 (1972)). Further, the advertiser must have some recognizable substantiation for the representation prior to advertising it. John Beck Amazing Profits, 865 F. Supp. 2d at 1067. Where an advertiser lacks adequate substantiation, it necessarily lacks any reasonable basis for its claims and the advertisement is deceptive as a matter of law. Direct Mkg. Concepts, Inc., 624 F.3d at 8. This is known as the FTC's prior substantiation doctrine. 2. Living Essentials contends that the trial court erred by adopting the prior substantiation doctrine-effectively creating a new per se unfair trade practice. We agree that our Supreme Court has determined that it is for the Legislature, not the courts, to declare whether a statutory violation is a per se unfair trade practice. Hangman Ridge, 105 Wn.2d at 787. We disagree, however, that the trial court adopted the prior substantiation doctrine as a new per se unfair trade practice. Living Essentials relies primarily on this court's decision in State v. Pacific Health Center. Inc., 135 Wn. App. 149, 143 P.3d 618 (2006). In Pacific Health, the State 5 Here, because the State was proceeding only under the reasonable basis theory, the trial court did not analyze Living Essentials' claims under the falsity theory. -9-No. 76463-2-1/1 0 alleged that various alternative medicine practitioners violated the CPA because they were practicing medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture, without a license. Pacific Health, 135 Wn. App. at 153. The State had argued that by engaging in health care practices, the defendants represented that they possessed the expertise and training that only licensed health care providers possessed-a misrepresentation and violation of the CPA. The defendants argued that the State was attempting to create a new per se violation of the CPA: practicing medicine without a license. The Pacific Health court agreed with the defendants because, despite being unlicensed, they were actually skilled at performing the tests and diagnoses that they performed. The court concluded that the advertisements that claimed the defendants were skilled at performing medical tests, but not asserting that they were licensed doctors, were not deceptive. The court further concluded that if it were to find the ads deceptive simply because the defendants were unlicensed, it would amount to a new per se unfair trade practice. Pacific Health, 135 Wn. App. at 149. In reaching its conclusion, the Pacific Health court analogized to Bowers v. Transamerica Title Ins. Co., 100 Wn.2d 581, 675 P .2d 193 (1983). In Bowers, a title insurance company prepared closing documents in preparation for a sale despite not being licensed to practice law. The Pacific Health court explained that \"[t]he crucial point for our CPA analysis is not simply that [the appellants in Bowers] were unqualified to practice law, but rather that the record demonstrated they were, in fact, not skilled in preparing the very closing documents they held themselves out as qualified to prepare.\" Pacific Health, 135 Wn. App. at 172. -10-No. 76463-2-1/11 The Pacific Health court's analysis of Bowers clarifies that a decision does not risk creating a new per se unfair trade practice when, on the facts of the case, the alleged violators' conduct actually constituted deception. In Pacific Health, the unlicensed defendants were actually skilled at performing the tests and diagnosis for which they had advertised. Therefore, to hold that they violated the CPA would have created a new per se unfair trade practice because the doctor's advertisements were not, in fact, deceptive. Whereas in Bowers, because the advertisements were actually deceptive the case did not risk creating a new per se unfair trade practice. Living Essentials' argument might be persuasive if the trial court had declared that simply because Living Essentials lacked prior substantiation, its advertisements were per se deceptive, without any analysis of whether the claims were actually deceptive. But this is not what the trial court did. While the trial court explained the FTC's prior substantiation doctrine as part of its conclusions of law, the court specifically declined to rely only on prior substantiation: The State argues that any scientific evidence developed or relied upon after Living Essentials aired or published its ads is legally irrelevant because the FTC guidelines required pre-claim substantiation. While this Court acknowledges that both the FTC guidelines and federal case law indicate that pre-claim substantiation is required, the Court also concludes that subsequent scientific studies may shed light on pre-claim studies and are thus relevant and material to the Court's CPA analysis. More importantly, a review of the trial court's extensive findings of fact demonstrates that the court carefully considered Living Essentials' preclaim substantiation as well as an extensive list of postclaim studies and expert trial testimony in making its findings. The trial court found-with respect to Living Essentials' Superior to Coffee claim-that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support Living -11-No. 76463-2-1/12 Essentials' express claims that people who drink 5-hour ENERGY\u00ae will experience hours of energy, alertness, and focus because the vitamins and nutrients extend the effects of caffeine. As a result of the lack of scientific evidence, the trial court found the ads materially misleading and in violation of the CPA. Similarly, after reviewing both pre and postclaim studies and expert trial testimony, the trial court found: While there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to support a claim that the Decaf 5-hour ENERGY\u00ae shot may provide a short-term benefit in terms of energy, the science is insufficient to substantiate the claim that this benefit will endure over a five hour period. For this reason, the Court finds the Decaf Claims to be materially misleading and a violation of the CPA. Thus, while the trial court was appropriately guided by the FTC's prior substantiation doctrine, it did not adopt the doctrine as a per se violation of the CPA. Instead after weighing all of the evidence before it, the court found that Living Essentials' Superior to Coffee and Decaf claims were materially misleading. B. Living Essentials next contends that application of the prior substantiation doctrine is contrary to article I, section 5 of the Washington Constitution and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. We disagree. 1. Living Essentials first argues that the trial court's standard for adequate substantiation required \"competent and reliable scientific evidence\"-an unconstitutionally vague standard for penalizing and suppressing speech.6 Living 6 Living Essentials also argues that the trial court violated the First Amendment by shifting the burden of proof and not requiring the government to prove Living Essentials' ads were misleading. Living Essentials bases this claim on one isolated statement in the trial court's extensive findings and -12-No. 76463-2-1/13 Essentials argues that \"competent and reliable\" is just as vague as requiring \"credible and reliable\" identification of a criminal suspect, which the U.S. Supreme Court has found unconstitutional. See Kolendar v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1983). The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that notice be given of what is prohibited. Reader's Digest, 81 Wn.2d at 273. Whether \"notice is, or is not 'fair' depends on the subject matter to which it relates\" and \"'common intelligence' is the test of what is 'fair warning.\"' Reader's Digest, 81 Wn.2d at 273 (quoting Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926)). \"In the field of regulatory statutes governing business activities, greater leeway is allowed in applying the test.\" Reader's Digest, 81 Wn.2d at 273-74. Thus, statutes using words or phrases well enough known to enable those expected to use them to correctly apply them, or statutes that use words with a well settled common law meaning will be sustained against a vagueness challenge. Reader's Digest, 81 Wn.2d at 273-74. The phrase \"competent and reliable scientific evidence\" has been a benchmark for determining whether ad claims have a reasonable basis since at least 1984. See Sterling Drug, Inc. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 741 F.2d 1146, 1156-57 (9th Cir. 1984) (performance claims must be supported by \"competent and reliable evidence.\"). Our Supreme Court has held that where federal courts have \"amassed an abundance of law giving shape and definition\" to the law, there is sufficiently well established meaning in federal trade law to meet a constitutional challenge of vagueness. Reader's Digest, 81 conclusions and then contends that the court did not require the government to prove anything. Living Essentials, fails, however to cite to anywhere in the trial court's findings or conclusions that actually shifted the government's burden of proof. Its claim is without merit. -13-No. 76463-2-1/14 Wn.2d at 274. Given the weight of federal court decisions, FTC decisions, orders, and guidance surrounding both the requirement of \"competent and reliable scientific evidence\" and what advertisers may do to market dietary supplements in a fair and non\u00ad deceptive manner, the trial court did not err in following FTC guidance. 2. Living Essentials argues next that article I, section 5 of the Washington State Constitution affords greater protection of commercial speech than the First Amendment and requires application of strict scrutiny. Living Essentials contends that it is an open question whether article I, section 5 of the Washington Constitution provides broader protection than the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Living Essentials argues that the open nature of this question means that this court must undergo a Gunwall analysis to determine whether commercial speech is afforded greater protection under article I, section 5, than the First Amendment. State v. Gunwall, 106 Wn.2d 54, 58, 720 P.2d 808 (1986). While Living Essentials is correct that we use the Gunwall factors to analyze whether the Washington Constitution provides a broader right than the Federal Constitution, contrary to Living Essentials' claims, our Supreme Court has already answered that question regarding commercial speech. In Nat'l Fed. of Retired Persons v. Ins. Com'r., the Court determined that because 'Washington case law provides no clear rule for constitutional restrictions on commercial speech ... [w]e therefore follow the interpretative guidelines under the federal constitution.\" 120 Wn.2d 101, 118, 838 P.2d 680 (1992) (Describing the test that the United States Supreme Court established in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of New York, 557, -14-No. S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980)). See also, I no I no Inc. v. City of Bellevue, 132 Wn.2d 103, 116, 937 P .2d 154 (1997) (\"The federal analysis also applies when confronting [article I, section 5] challenges to regulations of commercial speech.\"). Living Essentials cites to other Washington cases as support for its assertion that it is still an open question whether commercial speech is afforded more protection in Washington than federally. See Soundgarden v. Eikenberry, 123 Wn.2d 750, 764, 871 P .2d 1050 (1994) (declining to address the scope of protection under article 1, section 5, because the parties \"have not addressed the ... [Gunwall] factors.\") and Kitsap County v. Mattress Outlet, 153 Wn.2d 506, 511 n.1, 104 P.3d 1280 (2005) (emphasis added) (\"Although our state constitution may be more protective of free speech than the federal constitution, it is unnecessary to consider a state constitutional analysis because [the ordinance] ... fails the minimum protection provided under the federal constitution.\"). None of the cases Living Essentials cites overrules or meaningfully distinguishes Nat'l Fed. of Retired Persons or I no I no. If anything, the cases that Living Essentials cites further supports the Supreme Court's statement in Nat'l Fed. of Retired Persons that \"Washington case law provides no clear rule for constitutional restrictions on commercial speech.\" 120 Wn.2d at 118. Accordingly, the Supreme Court's decisive language that we are to apply the four-part test from Central Hudson remains binding authority on this court. See Nat'l Fed. of Retired Persons, 120 Wn.2d at 118; lno lno, 132 Wn.2d at 116. In Central Hudson, the United States Supreme Court determined that commercial speech is entitled to First Amendment protection. 447 U.S. at 566. However, because commercial speech is not entitled to as much protection as noncommercial speech, the -15-No. 76463-2-1/16 Court established a four-part test to determine if a regulatory burden on commercial speech is constitutional. Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566. In analyzing this question, a court must consider: (1) whether the speech concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading, (2) whether the government's interest is substantial, (3) whether the restriction directly and materially serves the asserted interest, and (4) whether the restriction is no more extensive than necessary. Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566. Applying Central Hudson to this case, Living Essentials' argument that the prior substantiation doctrine is unconstitutional fails at the first prong. The United States Supreme Court has continually emphasized that in order to be constitutionally protected, commercial speech must not be misleading or concern unlawful activity. See In re R.M.J., 455 U.S. 191, 203, 102 S. Ct. 929, 71 L. Ed 2d 64 (1982) (\"Misleading advertising may be prohibited entirely\"). The Supreme Court has also held that the government may even regulate potentially deceptive speech without violating the First Amendment. See Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S. 1, 16, 99 S. Ct. 887, 888, 59 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1979) (In upholding a Texas statute that banned the use of trade names the court concluded that \"the use of a trade name ... enhances the opportunity for misleading practices .... Rather than stifling commercial speech, [the challenged statute] ensures that information ... will be communicated more fully and accurately to consumers than it had been in the past.\"). Living Essentials concedes that several federal Circuit Courts of Appeal have upheld the prior substantiation doctrine against similar constitutional challenges. See Jay Norris, Inc. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 598 F.2d 1244 (2d Cir. 1979); United States v. Readers' Digest Ass'n, 662 F.2d 955 (3d Cir. 1981 ); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Federal -16-No. 76463-2-1/17 Trade Comm'n, 676 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1982)). Living Essentials argues that these cases should be disregarded because they were \"issued at the dawn of First Amendment protection of commercial speech,\" but fails to explain why this matters. Living Essentials has not pointed to any case law purporting to overrule or meaningfully distinguish these cases and the Central Hudson analysis suggests that the prior substantiation doctrine remains just as constitutional today as it was when these cases were first decided. c. Living Essentials next contends that no substantiation was necessary because the Superior to Coffee and Decaf claims are \"mere puffery\" and therefore not actionable under the CPA. The FTC \"generally will not bring advertising cases based on subjective claims ... [or] cases involving obviously exaggerated or puffing representations, i.e., those that the ordinary consumers do not take seriously.\"7 Puffery is defined as \"either vague or highly subjective [claims] and, therefore, incapable of being substantiated.\" Federal Trade Nat'l Urological F. App'x 358 (11th Cir. 2009).8 Living Essentials' attempt to characterize its claims as subjective by highlighting the use of the word \"feeling\" in its advertisements is unpersuasive. Living Essentials claimed that the unique blend of vitamins and amino acids in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae worked 7 FTC POLICY STATEMENT ON DECEPTION 4 (OCT. 14, 1983), HTIPS://WWW.FTC.GOV/SYSTEM/FILES/DOCUMENTS/PUBLIC STATEMENTS/41 0531/831 014DECEPTIONSTMT.PDF [HTIPS://PERMA.CC/XEU9-NY6R]. 8 Citing Bureau of Consumer Prot., FTC, Dietary Supplements: An Advertising Guide for Industry with caffeine to enhance the duration of the energy, alertness, and focus derived from caffeine alone. These are factual representations that are capable of being tested. \"Living Essentials intentionally promoted the product's ingredients as changing the way the body functioned [and] [i]t promoted the product as a healthy way to achieve these physiological results.\" We agree with the trial court that Living Essentials' claims were factual representations and not mere puffery. Living Essentials also contends that the FTC does not require substantiation where the product involved is \"frequently purchased, easily evaluated by consumers, and inexpensive.\" But this point disregards the underlying policy purposes of the FTC's position: \"[t]here is little incentive for sellers to misrepresent ... in these circumstances since they normally would seek to encourage repeat purchases. Where ... market incentives place strong constraints on the likelihood of deception, the [FTC] will examine a practice closely before proceeding.\" FTC, STATEMENT ON DECEPTION at 5. However, in this case the incentive to mislead consumers is still present. There is no way for the consumer to know which ingredients are acting to make the consumer feel more energized. While the evidence suggests that it is the caffeine that is providing the specific effects that the consumer is feeling, Living Essentials expressly advertised that it is 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae's non-caffeine ingredients that are acting. Therefore, the policy concerns underlying the FTC's guidance do not apply here. D. Under the FTC's prior substantiation doctrine, the court must determine the appropriate level of substantiation required for a claim to have a reasonable basis. Living Essentials contends the trial court erred by applying the FTC substantiation -18-No. 76463-2-1/19 standard for claims that \"relate to consumer health.\" While we agree that the trial court misstated the applicable standard, contrary to Living Essentials' argument, the error does not mandate a reversal. The trial court found that \"Living Essentials' ads relate to consumer health\" and therefore \"require a relatively high level of substantiation.\"9 Under this relatively high level of substantiation standard, the court noted that Living Essentials' \"Superior to Coffee\" claim was \"certainly plausible ... [but was] not an established scientific fact.\" Further, the trial court concluded that \"[w]hile there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to support a claim that the Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae shot may provide a short- term benefit in terms of energy, the science is insufficient to substantiate the claim that this benefit will endure over a five hour period.\" These statements misstated the applicable standard. The FTC defines a health claim as a \"representation about the relationship between a nutrient and a disease or health-related condition.\" FTC, DIETARY SUPPLEMENT at n.2. When an advertisement alleges that a product has a relationship to a disease or health related condition, the FTC requires a relatively high level of substantiation. See POM Wonderful v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 777 F.3d 478, 500 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (the FTC \"bars representations about a product's general health benefits unless the representation is non-misleading and backed by 'competent and reliable scientific evidence that is sufficient in quality and quantity to substantiate that the representation is true.\"). 9 (Citing FTC, Dietary Supplements: An Advertising Guide for Industry (2001) available at https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/plain-language/bus09-dietary-supplements-advertising-guide\u00ad industry.pdf). -19-No. 76463-2-1/20 It is undisputed that Living Essentials markets and advertises 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae as a dietary supplement. However, to conclude that 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae's claims are also health claims was erroneous. Living Essentials has not made any claims that 5- Hour ENERGY\u00ae has any direct impact on a disease or health related condition. And to require that Living Essentials establish scientific facts substantiating its claims exceeds even the FTC's standard. As the amici correctly explained \"the competent-and-reliable standard does not envision scientific unanimity and certainly does not require, as the trial court held, that a claim be 'established scientific fact.\"' Similarly, the trial court erred by stating that Living Essentials had to substantiate that Decaf 5-hour ENERGY\u00ae lasted for five hours. The FTC requires that \"the substantiation must be relevant to the claimed benefits[,]\" and Living Essentials never advertised that Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae lasted for five hours, but rather than it lasted for hours. However, because this court reviews CPA violations de novo, the trial court's reliance on an erroneous standard does not mandate a reversal; substantial evidence exists to support the trial court's conclusion that Living Essentials' ads violated the CPA. We \"defer to the trier of fact regarding witness credibility or conflicting testimony\" Weyerhaeuser, 123 Wn. App. at 65, will not reweigh the evidence or the credibility of witnesses on appeal, Washington Belt & Drive Sys., Inc., 54 Wn. App. at 616, and need only determine \"whether the evidence most favorable to the prevailing party supports the challenged findings.\" Prostov, 186 Wn. App. at 820. Therefore, based on our independent review of the record and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that reversal is not warranted. Mansour, 131 Wn. App. at 263 -20-No. 76463-2-1/21 In order to satisfy the CPA, an advertiser must have a reasonable basis for its claim. \"Under the reasonable basis theory, the advertiser must have had some recognizable substantiation for the representation prior to making it an advertisement.\" John Beck Amazing Profits, LLC, 865 F. Supp. 2d at 1067. As the trial court found, Living Essentials failed to present any evidence that \"anyone with any science training ever assessed the ad claims and the science backing up those claims against the FTC substantiation guidelines.\" And we agree with the trial court that \"asking an advertising director who lacks any scientific or medical training to conduct internet research is [not] adequate substantiation.\" As for Living Essentials' Superior to Coffee claim, first, its expert Dr. David Kennedy conceded that there is no experimental evidence showing that the addition of a multivitamin to a caffeinated energy drink will cause greater improvement in physical and cognitive performance than can be attributed to the effects of caffeine alone. Further, Living Essentials points to no evidence that directly supports its Superior to Coffee claim. \"Dr. Kennedy's summary of the scientific literature does show some different physiological results from caffeine plus vitamins or caffeine plus amino acids, but the results are not the benefits touted by Living Essentials.\" Specifically, the Giles Study shows that taurine counteracts caffeine, rather than enhancing its effects. Further, neither the Glade nor NERAC studies examined whether combining the specific ingredients in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae with caffeine will cause the energy, alertness, and focus effects of caffeine to last longer than caffeine alone. Living Essentials pointed to the 2013 Nagrecha study, the 2015 Molnar study, and the 2015 Paulus study as support for its Superior to Coffee claim. But, as the trial -21-No. 76463-2-1/22 court found, none of those studies are sufficiently relevant to substantiate Living Essentials' claim. \"The Nagrecha study has limited relevance because its test subjects underwent only one round of testing 40 minutes after ingesting\" 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. The Paulus study had \"methodological problems significant enough to render [its] results unreliable.\" The Molnar study was insufficient to substantiate Living Essentials' claims because there was significant disagreement between the testifying experts as to the relevance of the Molnar Study and, as the trial court found, the Bloomer Study \"undercut the reasonability of relying on Molnar as substantiation for Living Essentials' claims.\" Finally, the Medicus study does not support 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae's Superior to Coffee claim. The trial court found Dr. Tom Mclellan's testimony to be credible that there is no basis for concluding that the Medicus study's results \"were attributable to any ingredient other than caffeine.\" As the testifying experts pointed out, the Medicus study was designed in a flawed manner that overemphasized its results with respect to 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. The study was not designed \"to determine whether the non\u00ad caffeine ingredients in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae led to improved performance[,]\" and the results \"do not show that consuming 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae improved any of the test subjects' cognitive functioning ... above baseline.\" We conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination that Living Essentials' Superior to Coffee claim is unsubstantiated. There is also no substantiation in the record to show that Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae lasts \"for hours.\" In support of the Decaf claim, Dr. Sanford Bigelow testified that Living Essentials acted reasonably in relying on the 2010 Glad Report and the 2007 -22-No. 76463-2-1/23 NERAC Report as substantiation. But the trial court found that Dr. Bigelow's testimony was not credible. The Glade report relied on studies that tested doses of 3000mg or more of taurine but Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae contains only 483mg of taurine; a differentiation that fatally undermines Dr. Michael Glade's conclusions because the FTC specifically cautions advertisers from relying on studies the conclusions of which are based on very different dosages. FTC, DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS at 14, 16. Dr. Kennedy also testified that the 2015 Shah study supported Living Essentials' Decaf claims. But \"the chart on which Dr. Kennedy relie[d] actually show[ed] that the ... test results at the 3 hour mark were not statistically significant.\" Further, the 2013 Kurtz study also contradicts Living Essentials' claim because it found that \"consumers drinking Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae experienced no energy benefits from the ingredients in the drink.\" While the trial court may have been incorrect in saying that Living Essentials had to show that Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae lasted for 5-hours, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination that Living Essentials' Decaf Claim was deceptive. E. Living Essentials finally argues that the trial court erred in determining that its Ask Your Doctor claim was deceptive. The trial court found that despite the words in the Ask Your Doctor ad being literally true, the net impression-that 73 percent of doctors had specifically recommended 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae as a healthy and safe dietary supplement-was deceptive. The court first reasoned that Living Essentials' specific goal in creating this -23-No. 76463-2-1/24 ad, as its advertising manager admitted at trial, was to indicate that doctors would recommend 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. Second, the surveys that Living Essentials used were specifically designed to elicit a yes response because saying no \"suggested that the responding doctor would instead recommend a high fat, high calorie, or high sodium energy supplement.\" And that \"Living Essentials presented the statistics in a way that would lead a reasonable viewer to believe that 73 [percent] of 3,000 doctors surveyed would recommend this product to their patients\" when it was actually 73 percent of 503 doctors. Living Essentials contends that its expert testimony alone is sufficient to establish what message the reasonable consumer would take away from the ad and that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination. We disagree. Because \"[a]n advertisement's meaning is a question of fact,\" FTC v. Nat'l Urological Grp., Inc., 645 F.Supp.2d at 1189, and a truthful statement \"may be deceptive by virtue of the 'net impression' it conveys[,]\" Panag, 166 Wn.2d at 50, the trial court did not err by concluding that the net impression from the \"Ask-Your-Doctors\" ad was deceptive. \"If an advertiser asserts that it has a certain level of support for an advertised claim, it must be able to demonstrate that the assertion is accurate.\" FTC, DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS at 9. \"Advertising should not ... suggest greater scientific certainty than actually exists.\" FTC, DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS at 16. \"In determining the meaning of an advertisement ... the important criterion is the net impression that it is likely to make on the general populace.\" Grolier, Inc., 91 F.T.C. 315, 430 (1978), order -24-No. 76463-2-1/25 set aside and remanded on other grounds, 615 F.2d 1215 (9th Cir. 1980), modified, 98 F.T.C. 882 (1981 ), reissued, 99 F.T.C. 379 (1982). In reviewing ads, the court \"will often be able to determine the meaning through an examination of the representation itself, including an evaluation of such factors as the entire document, the juxtaposition of various phrases in the document, the nature of the claim, and the nature of the transaction.\" FTC, POLICY STATEMENT ON DECEPTION at 2. \"When a seller's representation conveys more than one meaning to reasonable consumers, one of which is false, the seller is liable for the misleading interpretation.\" Nat'l Comm'n on Egg Nutrition, 88 F.T.C. 89, 185 (1976), modified, 92 F.T.C. 848 (1978) Here, the State's witness, Dr. Anthony Pratkanis, an expert in the science of consumer behavior and persuasion tactics, testified \"that the clear takeaway from these ads was that doctors would recommend 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae.\" Further, Dr. Pratkanis testified that Living Essentials' \"survey questions were biased, leading, and designed to elicit a limited response.\" The trial court did not err by allowing Dr. Pratkanis's expertise to help guide its ultimate conclusions. The key question that the trial court had to answer was what the reasonable consumer would have taken away from Living Essentials' ad. FTC, POLICY STATEMENT ON DECEPTION at 1-2 (\"We examine [advertisements] from the perspective of a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances .... To be deceptive the representation, omission or practice must be likely to mislead reasonable consumers under the circumstances.\"). Here, there is sufficient evidence in the record-including Dr. Pratkanis's testimony and the text of the -25-No. 76463-2-1/26 \"Ask-Your-Doctors\" ad itself-to support the trial court's conclusion that the reasonable consumer would have been misled by Living Essentials' claim. Ill. Living Essentials next contends that the trial court erred by imposing more than $2 million in penalties. We disagree. We review the trial court's imposition of a civil penalty for an abuse of discretion. State v. Ralph Williams' N.W. Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 87 Wn.2d 298, 553 P.2d 423 (1976) (Ralph Williams II). An abuse of discretion exists when no reasonable person would take the position adopted by the court. Griggs v. Averbeck Realty, 92 Wn.2d 576, 584, 599 P.2d 1289 (1979). After finding that Living Essentials had violated the CPA, the trial court assessed a $2,183,747 civil penalty against Living Essentials. First, the court concluded that \"the most appropriate method of determining the total number of violations for the deceptive advertisements is to determine the number of times the deceptive advertisements were aired in Washington\" within the statute of limitations period. The Superior to Coffee claim was included in two different ads that ran in Washington 975 and 1,040 times, respectively. The Ask-Your-Doctor ad ran 19,716 times in Washington. As for the Decaf claim, the court concluded that Living Essentials had made deceptive claims in its press release, press kit, and on the bottle packaging, but had not expressly advertised those claims in Washington. The court determined that the press release, dated 2008, was outside of the limitation period. Similarly, the court found there was no credible evidence introduced to show that the press kit was ever -26-No. 76463-2-1/27 distributed in Washington. However, the court did conclude that deceptively packaged bottles of decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae were sold in Washington 2,482 times.10 Then, the court determined that a civil penalty of $100 per violation for the deceptive advertisements and $4.29 per decaf bottle sold was an appropriate penalty. In determining the proper amount of penalty to assess per violation, the trial court found the following factors significant: (1) Living Essentials generated a substantial amount of revenue in Washington; (2) 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae posed a high risk to the public because it is consumed, so there is no way to reverse the impact such a product may have on an individual; and (3) Living Essentials spent more time trying to substantiate its claims after marketing its products in Washington than before. Accordingly, the court assessed a $1,971,600 penalty for the Ask-Your-Doctor claim, a $201,500 penalty for the Superior to Coffee claim, and a $10,647 penalty for the decaf packaging, equating to a total civil penalty of $2,183,747. RCW 19.86.140 that \"[e]very person [(including corporations)] who violated [the CPA] shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of not more than two thousand dollars for each violation.\" Washington courts recognize two basic tenets of trade law in effectuating the purpose of chapter 19.86 RCW. \"First, no one should be permitted to profit from unfair and deceptive conduct. ... Second, fair dealing must be encouraged at all stages of commerce.\" (Citing State v. Ralph Williams' N.W. Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 82 Wn.2d 265, 510 P.2d 233 (1973) (Ralph Williams 1). 10 Living Essentials sold $10,648 worth of decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae in Washington. The court estimated that a reasonable per bottle price was $4.29, and therefore concluded that Living Essentials sold approximately 2,482 bottles of decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae in Washington (1 4.29 = 2482). -27-No. 76463-2-1/28 While RCW 19.86.140 provides that a statutory penalty for violating the CPA is mandatory, it leaves the amount of the penalty and the factors to consider within the trial court's discretion. Ralph Williams II, 87 Wn.2d at 314. Here, the trial court reasoned that \"penalties should be large enough to deter future violations and to ensure that defendants do not profit from the deceptive advertising.\" Living Essentials asserts that the penalty violates the excessive fines clause of the U.S. Constitution. See Timbs v. Indiana, No. 17-1091, slip op. at 2 (U.S. Feb. 20, 2019) (holding that \"[t]he Excessive Fines Clause [of the Eight Amendment] is ... incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"). Under the excessive fines clause, civil penalties may not be \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant's offense.\" United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 334, 119 S. Ct. 2028 141 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1998). Living Essentials fails to show how assessing a $100 per violation penalty, despite being statutorily authorized to assess up to $2000 per violation, is grossly disproportional. Courts have \"consistently found that civil penalty awards in which the amount of the award is less than the statutory maximum do not run afoul of the Excessive Fines Clause.\" U.S. v. Mackby, 221 F. Supp. 2d 1106, 1110 (N.D. Cal. 2002). Living Essentials also contends that, under the due process clause, the trial court should have considered (1) the degree of reprehensibility, (2) the award compared to the harm, and (3) the amount of the award compared to other cases. BMW of N.A., Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S. Ct. 1589 134 L. Ed. 2d 809 (1996). Using this analysis, Living Essentials argues that the fine here violated the due process clause because it was grossly disproportionate to other CPA violations. See State v. WWJ Corp., 138 -28-No. 76463-2-1/29 Wn.2d 595, 980 P.2d 1257 (1999) and Ralph Williams II, 87 Wn.2d at 306-09. Living Essentials' argument fails for two reasons. First, this court has already expressly rejected Living Essentials' argument. See Mandatory Poster, 199 Wn. App. at 527 (citing Perez-Farias v. Global Horizons. Inc., 175 Wn.2d 518, 533-34, 286 P.3d 46 (2012)) (rejecting the argument that BMW compelled reversing the trial court's assessment of a civil penalty because \"our Supreme Court expressly declined to apply the [BMW] factors to cases involving statutory damages.\"). Second, the cases that Living Essentials cites actually stand for the opposite proposition. In Ralph Williams II, the court awarded civil penalties between $250 and $2000 per violation. 87 Wn.2d at 316, n.11. In WWJ, the court awarded a penalty of $2000 per violation. 138 Wn.2d at 598. Here, the court assessed a penalty, on average, of just $90 per violation. The only reason that the total penalty here is significantly higher than in the cited cases is because Living Essentials violated the CPA more than 24,000 times. In essence, Living Essentials is suggesting that the penalty is unconstitutionally excessive because they violated the statute too many times. We decline to adopt this interpretation of the due process clause. We conclude that the trial court's assessment of $2,183,747 in civil penalties for Living Essentials' 24,213 individual violations of the CPA was not an abuse of discretion. IV. Living Essentials finally argues that the trial court abused its discretion in its award of attorney fees. We disagree. -29-No. 76463-2-1/30 There are two relevant inquires in determining an award of attorney fees: first, whether the prevailing party is entitled to legal fees, and second, whether the award of attorney fees is reasonable. Public Util. Dist. 1 v. International Ins. Co., 124 Wn.2d 789, 814, 881 P.2d 1020 (1994). Whether a party is legally entitled to recover attorney fees is a question of law that we review de novo. King County v. Vinci Constr. Grands (2017). Whether the amount of fees awarded was reasonable is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Living Essentials does not dispute that the prevailing party in a CPA action is entitled to an award of attorney fees. RCW 19.86.080(1) provides that \"the prevailing party [in a CPA action] may, in the discretion of the court, recover the costs of said action including a reasonable attorney's fee.\" In interpreting the term \"prevailing party,\" the Washington Supreme Court has taken guidance from federal courts. \"[A] plaintiff becomes 'a prevailing party ... [i]f the plaintiff has succeeded on any significant issue in litigation which achieve[ d) some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\"' Parmelee v. O'Neel, 168 Wn.2d 515, 522, 229 P.3d 723 (201 0) (citing Texas St. Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 109 S. Ct. 1486, 103 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1989)). \"[T]he touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry [is] the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which Congress sought to promote in the fee statute.\" Parmelee, 168 Wn.2d at 522 (citing Texas St. Teachers Ass'n, 489 U.S. at 792-93). \"Central to the calculation of an attorney fees award ... is the underlying purpose of the statute authorizing the attorney fees.\" Brand v. Dep't of Labor & Indus, -30-No. 76463-2-1/31 139 Wn.2d 659, 667, 989 P.2d 111 (1999). Awarding the State its fees and costs after a CPA action will\"encourage an active role in the enforcement of the [CPA,] places the substantial costs of these proceedings on the violators of the act, and [will] not drain [the State's] public funds.\" Ralph Williams II, 87 Wn.2d at 314-15. Below, the trial court determined that the State of Washington was the prevailing party and therefore entitled to recover its attorney fees and costs. The State brought suit because it believed that Living Essentials had violated the CPA, which the trial court ultimately agreed it had. That the State originally alleged more violations of the CPA than were ultimately found at trial does not change the fact that the State was successful in proving that Living Essentials had violated the CPA. As such, the State succeeded on a significant issue in this case: whether Living Essentials had violated the CPA. Therefore, the State was the prevailing party below. Further, awarding the State its attorney fees and costs is consistent with the underlying purpose of the CPA. This award will help to encourage the Attorney General's active role in CPA enforcement actions, which in turn will help to protect the public from untrue and deceptive advertisements. Lastly, the trial court did not err in calculating the amount of fees awardable in this case. The trial court awarded the State $1,886,866.71 in attorney fees and $209,125.92 in costs. The trial court found that the State had reasonably incurred such a substantial amount of attorney fees and costs based on the \"lengthy and complex nature of the litigation.\" Further, the court reduced the original amount of fees and costs that the State had requested in order to \"reflect time spent on unsuccessful motions or -31-No. 76463-2-1/32 other duplicative time.\" Accordingly, the court found that there was \"no basis to reduce the request\" any further. While Living Essentials argues that the court should have further reduced the award because the State only prevailed on some of its claims, the trial court expressly stated that it had already taken that into account. In fact, the court reduced the fee award by more than $40,000 \"to reflect time spent on unsuccessful motions or other duplicative time.\" The trial court's finding that there is no basis to reduce the award any further was not an abuse of its discretion . Fees on Appeal Both parties have requested their fees on appeal, and RCW 19.86.080(1) allows this court to award fees to the prevailing party. Because the State is the prevailing party on appeal it is entitled to its reasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal subject to compliance with RAP 18.1.

Procedural History This case arose out of a 2012 multi -state consumer protection investigation of Living Essentials' advertising and marketing practice s. On July 1 7, 2014, the State filed this CPA enforcement action pursuant to its enforcement authority under RCW 19.86.020 ; RCW 19.86.110; and RCW 19.86.080. (Dkt. #1).1 On July 23, 2015, the State filed a Second Amended Complaint 1 The State's original complaint included a sixth claim for relief, which the Court dismissed pretrial. (Dkt. #23). MEMORANDUM DECISION - 5 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 for Injunctive and Other Relief rem oving the dismissed claim but pursuing the five claims outlined above . (Ex. 662 ). Living Essentials answered the Second Amended Complaint on July 31, 2015 , denying any CPA violations . (Ex. 663 ). 2. Living Essentials' Dietary Supplement Products Living Essentials is a privately -held limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Michigan, with its principal place of business in Farmington H ills, Michigan. Living Essentials manufacture s, market s, and sell s a liquid dietary supp lement, 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae nationwide, including in Washington. It introd uced Original 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae in 2004, and added an Extra Strength and Decaf variety in 2007. The 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae products , sold in 2 ounce bottles, contain the following ingredients : Ingredient 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae Original 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae Extra Strength 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae Decaf B-3 (Niacin) 30 mg 40 mg -- B-6 40 mg 40 mg 40 mg Folic Acid 400 mcg 400 mcg 400 mcg B-12 500 mcg 500 mcg 500 mcg Sodium 18 mg 18 mg 18 mg Taurine 467 mg 529 mg 483 mg Glucuronolactone 411 mg 379 mg 346 mg Malic acid 273 mg 320 mg 292 mg N-Acetyl-L-tyrosine 271 mg 260 mg 237 mg L-Phenylalanine 229 mg 260 mg 237 mg Caffeine 200 mg 230 mg 6 mg Citicoline 19 mg 22 mg -- Choline Bitartrate -- -- 408 mg 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae is marketed as a \"dietary supplement.\" Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (\"DSHEA \"), a dietary supplement is a product intended to be ingested to supplement the diet and contains one of several statutorily defined ingredients: a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or botanical, or an amino acid. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(ff). 3. The Nutritional Science MEMORANDUM DECISION - 6 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 The Court heard extensive scientific evidence regarding the ingredients in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae and their effects on or function within the human body . The following is a summary of the evidence . a. B Vitamins in General Living Essential print ads state: Vitamins B6, B12, and B3 (Niacin): Play a key role in the production of amino acids, the bui lding blocks of protein and aid[] in the processing of carbohydrates for energy. (Ex. 653). The State does not dispute this description of the role B vitamins play in human bodies. The State's nutritional expert, Dr. Edward Blonz, and Living Essential's expert , Dr. David Kennedy, agree that B vitamins are essential to metabolism (cellular generation of physiological energy) within the human body. B vitamins prevent the creation of destructive compounds (known as \"free radicals\") in the body and contribute to the synthesis of important molecules in the body that drive cerebral blood f low to the brain . Humans need B vitamins to turn amino acids such as L-tyrosine into neurotransmitters used in cognitive functioning. Fatigue is a classic symptom of a B vitamin deficiency. Drs. Blonz and Kennedy agree that there is consensus within the scientific community that the intake of B vitamins from one's diet can reduce tiredness and fatigue. (i) Niacin (B 3) Niacin, or vitamin B 3, is an essential nutrient that plays a role in producing co -enzymes involved in energy release. It is quickly absorbed in the stomach and duodenum. Dr. Blonz testified credibly that healthy, well -nourished adults , in general, typically obtain the daily recommended re quirement of vitamin B 3 from the foods they consume each day. Dr. Kennedy testified credibly that a niacin deficiency can cause weakness, mood disorders, cognitive problems, personality irritability, and, in extreme cases, psychosis. 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae Origin al's 30 milligrams of niacin is 150 percent of the minimum amount humans need to consume on a daily basis for healthy physiological functioning . The 40 MEMORANDUM DECISION - 7 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 mg in the Extra Strength formula is 20 times the daily required amount. There is no niacin in the 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae Decaf. (ii) Vitamin B 6 Vitamin B 6, like niacin, is involved in energy release and protein synthesis. The vitamin contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. Deficiency levels of vitamin B 6 are in the range of 10.5 percent of the U.S. adult population. According to Dr. Kennedy, a deficiency of B 6 can cause mood disorders, cognitive problems, personality irritability, and in extreme cases, seizures and convulsions. (iii) Folic Acid ( Vitamin B9) Folic acid, also known as folate, is a B vitamin essential for the body to metabolize amino acids and to create tissue within the body . Folate , which is found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, dried beans, and peas (Ex. 653), is important for healthy cardiovascular function (blood flow) and can contribute to the reduction of fatigue and tiredness . If ingested with food, it is absorbed by the body in three to four hours. If ingested on an empty stomach, it can be absorb ed by the body within an hour. There is some scientific support that a single dose of this vitamin can improve blood flow. 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae 's 400 mg of folic acid constitutes 100 percent of the recommended daily value of B 9 needed to maintain one's health. (iv) Vitamin B12 Vitamin B 12 is another es sential nutrient that works with folic acid in a number of biosynthetic processes . This vitamin , which is found in meat or animal products, such as eggs , contributes to normal energy metabolism and to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae has 83 times the daily amount of B 12 needed in healthy adults. At trial, Dr. Kennedy agreed with Dr. McLellan that there is no experimental evidence showing that the addition of B vitamins to a caffeinated energy drink will cause greater improvement in ph ysical and cognitive performance than can be attributed to the effects of caffeine alone. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 8 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 b. Amino Acids (i) Taurine Taurine is a micronutrient involved in several cellular and physiological functions. Although humans require several hundred milligrams per day o f the micronutrient, i t is created by the body and people get the rest of the taurine they need from their diet. Taurine can effect endothelial function (blood flow) and can have an effect on one's cognitive function and mood. The experts at trial agreed that there is inconsistent or limited quality experimental evidence indicating that the addition of taurine to a caffeinated energy drink will cause greater improvement in physical and cognitive performance than can be attributed to the effects of caffein e alone. (ii) Glucuronolactone Glucuronolactone is a naturally occurring byproduct of metabolism of glucose in the liver. The experts at trial agreed that there is no experimental evidence showing that the addition of glucuronolactone to an energy drink will c ause gr eater improvement in physical and cognitive performance than can be attributed to the effects of caffeine alone. (iii) Malic acid Ex. 653 , one of Living Essentials' print described malic acid as follows: \"the body synthesizes Malic Acid during the pr ocess of converting carbohydrates to energy. The main food source of Malic Acid is fruits.\" There w as no other evidence presented by either party at trial regarding this ingredient. (iv) N-Acetyl -L-tyrosine and L -Phenylalanine L-Phenylalanine is an essential nutrient derived from a person's diet. It generates the non - essential nutrient L -tyrosine that in turn is converted into neurotransmitters in the brain. L - tryrosine supplementation can contribute to the creation of neurotransmitters depleted by stress. There have been some studies that indicate that low doses of L -tryosine can improve cognitive functioning. According to Living Essentials' print ads, \"tyrosine\" is an amino acid that transmits nerve impulses to the brain and is found in meat, dairy, fish , and grains. Ex. 653. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 9 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 c. Caffeine Caffeine is a chemical compound, found in coffee and tea plants. It acts as a stimulant to the central nervous system. When it is absorbed by the body, it binds to adenosine receptors. These receptors are situated througho ut the body in both the tissue and central nervous system in the brain. As a person requires energy, that person's body will produce adenosine. In the brain, adenosine inhibit s the release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, adrenaline, serotonin and glutamate. Caffeine antagonize s the effect of adenosine, meaning it causes an increase in the release of neurotransmitters. Caffeine has been demonstrated to impact cognition and physical performance in humans. The testifying experts agreed, however, that there is little evidence that caffeine improves episodic or long -term memory. Caffeine has a half -life of 3 to 10 hours, m eaning the effects of caffeine last for several hours . d. Citic holine and Choline Bitartrate Choline is a n essential nutrient that works with vitamin B 12 and folate to contribute to the synthesis of the neurotransmitter , acetylcholine . Citicholine , the and Extra Strength 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae, is a chemical compound of choline and cytidine. According to Living Essential ads, citicholine is \"a water -soluble compound essential for the synthesis of phosphatidyl choline, a constituent of brain tiss ue. Citicholine plays a role in neurotransmission and can help support brain tissue.\" (Ex. 653). Citicholine has been shown to improve memory in elderly participants with cognitive decline. Choline bitartrate is a chemical compound of tartaric aci d and choline. Large doses of choline bitartrate (2 grams) have been shown to improve performance on visuomotor tasks but slow reaction times. Because a fraction of choline bitartrate is choline, Dr. Blonz estimated that Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae contains 167 mg of choline. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine recommends that male adults consume 550 mg and female adults consume 425 mg of choline per day. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 10 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 4. Living Essentials' Ad Claims In 2004, Livin g Essentials first be gan to manufacture and sell the 2 ounce non-carbonated 5-Hour ENERGY \u00ae \"shot.\" The competition at the time inc luded Red Bull, Monster, AMP, Full Throttle , and Rock Star, and they were all sweet, carbonated energy drinks that were marketed towards teens . Living Essentials de cided to market its product to working adults, rather than teens , and to focus on the health aspects of the product . Living Essentials began running advertisements in 2005 and television ads in 2006. It has continued to air ads on television and cable c hannels across the country, including in the State of Washington to the present. Initially, the company sought to educate consumers about the benefits of its product over the competition: the small 2 ounce bottle made 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae much more convenient t han large soda -can sized drinks, and the product contained no sugar and only 4 calories. The company's initial ads focused on these educational themes. a. The Vitamins Claims Living Essentials has aired and published several ads that make claims regarding the role the non-caffeine ingredients play in 5-Hour ENERGY \u00ae. Living Essentials has never denied that its product contains caffeine but it has expressly stated that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae's non -caffeine ingredients are the product's \"key\" ingredients in the creatio n of energy, alertness , and focus . The company has chosen to promote 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae 's B vitamins and nutrients as the reason the product is so effective . Carl Sperber, the company's director of advertising, developed the tag lines \"B Vitamins for Energy; Amino Acids Focus & Better Mood ,\" that appeared in early Living Essentials' television ads (Ex. 2005) for this purpose: MEMORANDUM DECISION - 11 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 See also Ex. 2129 (Living Essentials' print ad claimed that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae \"contains a powerful blend of B -vitamins formulated for energy and alertness.\") In the print ad (Ex. 653 ), entitled \"The Ten Reasons to Trust 5Hour Energy, \" Living Essentials provided a detailed description of its \"key ingredients\" and described why they were beneficial: MEMORANDUM DECISION - 12 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 In Ex. 382, the Lots of Reasons ad, the narrator describes 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae's \"key ingredients\" or the \"beneficial ingredients\" as those that \"are found in every day food l ike avocados, broccoli and bananas, or already in you.\" The animation depicts an avocado, a floret of broccoli and a banana emerging from the 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae bottle. (Similar statements about the product's key ingredients are made in Ex. 648, the Diner ad , and in the print ad, Ten Reasons to Trust 5 Hour Energy, Ex. 653). Ex. 630 and 633, the Coffee and Vitamins ads from March 2013, use the same animation and script as Ex. 382, but when the avocado emerges from the bottle, the words \"B 9\" and \"B 6\" appear: When the broccoli emerges, the word \"niacin\" appears; when the banana emerges, the word \"tyrosine\" appears: MEMORANDUM DECISION - 13 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 The end tag line is \"It's like coffee with vitamins and nutrients. Put them together and it's a great combination. \" Living Essentials' ads expressly represent that the vitamins and nutrients in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae play a role in providing energy, alertness and focus. b. The Superior to Coffee Claims Living Essentials ' ads also expressly claim t hat the key vitamins and nutrients work synergistically with caffeine to make the biochemical or physiological effect s last longer than caffeine alone . The claims are well summarized in a 2012 press release from Living Essentials (Ex. 113): Ex. 635, the \"Is It Safe?\" ad from April 2013, shows a cup of coffee and a bottle of vitamins. The narrator says \"It's simple. Caffeine with vitamins and nutrients. It's the combination that makes it so great.\" The print ad, Ex. 640, carries on with th is theme: \"It delivers a powerful blend of B - MEMORANDUM DECISION - 14 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 vitamins (B6, B12, Niacin and Folic Acid), amino acids and caffeine comparable to a cup of the leading premium coffee. These and other ingredients work in concert to provide a feeling of alertness and energy that lasts for hours.* \"2 In the Construction Cowboy ad from May 2012 (Ex. 384 ), Living Essentials claimed that 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae is \"packed with B vitamins and nutrients\" to make it last longer than 3 or 4 cups of coffee. The \"How Much Coffee\" radio ad, Ex. 723, and the \"Cup a fter Cup radio\" ad, Ex. 724, mad e the same claims. The State argues that Living Essentials downplayed or minimized the effects of caffeine in 5- Hour ENERGY\u00ae . This Court does not so find. Living Essentials never misled consumers into believing that the product contained no caffeine. In fact, its web site (Ex. 2116) promoted the benefits of caffeine: But Living Essentials' ads did make objective claims that the duration of the recognized physiological benefits of caffeine would be extended because of the non -caffeine ing redients in 5- 2 This print ad contains a disclaimer at the bottom in small print: \"Does not provide caloric energy. Not proven to improve physical perf ormance, dexterity, or endurance. *Individual results may vary.\" MEMORANDUM DECISION - 15 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 Hour ENERGY\u00ae . Living Essentials conveyed that its formula of B-Vitamins and amino acids, in combination with caffeine , was superior to coffee because the increase in alertness, fatigu e reduction , and improved mental functioning lasts longer than caffeine alone. c. The Decaf Claims Living Essentials began to sell a decaffeinated version of 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae in 200 8 to appeal to tired, but caffeine -sensitive people. The decaf formula has no niacin and 6 mg of caffeine. The only other difference is the addition of choline bitartr ate in lieu of citic oline, although it is not clear why this particular change was made. Living Essentials has never advertised Decaf 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae on television or on the radio. The extent of the marketing materials presented at trial were a press release when the product launched (Ex. 722), a press kit developed by an ad agency for Living Essentials (Ex. 105) , screen shot s of Living Essentials' website (Ex. 661, 1283, 2118) , and the packaging on the Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae bottle (Ex. 101) . In the press release, Sperber stated that the decaf product provide s \"a sustained energy boost\" for peo ple sensitive to caffeine. Living Essentials claimed on its web site that the Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae \"gently\" works to provide alertness , which it attributes to the presence of choline in the product : MEMORANDUM DECISION - 16 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 The claims in the press release and on the web site are not just claims of subjective \"feelings.\" By linking the physiological benefits of choline with the Decaf product, Living Essentials is implying an objective benefit from drinking Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae : alertness and sustained energy. Decaf 5 -hour ENER GY\u00ae has not been a big seller for Living Essentials, accounting for less than 1% of company sales. d. The Crash Claims Sperber testified that he first heard the word \"crash\" linked to the consumption of sugared, caffeinated energy drinks in a movie starring J ohn Carrey, who in one scene drank multiple cans of an energy drink and in the next scene was seen crashed out on the floor, asleep. Sperber understood that consumers complained that when the sugar and caffeine in energy drinks wore off, they would experi ence a sudden drop in energy and feel even more tired than before they drank the product. To differentiate 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae from competing energy drinks, he developed an ad campaign revolving around the crash theme: In the earliest ads, Living Essentials attributed the \"crash\" effect to the combination of sugar and caffeine: MEMORANDUM DECISION - 17 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 Because 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae contains no sugar, Living Essentials believed consumers would not experience a \"crash\" relating to a drop in glucose levels after consuming the 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae products. Living Essentials began to print the \"No Crash Later\" tag line on the bottle itself. In 2007, the National Advertising Division (\"NAD\") of the Better Business Bureau reviewed Living Essentials' promotional claims regarding 5 -hour EN ERGY\u00ae, including the \"no crash later\" claim. In response to the NAD investigation, Living Essentials indicated that by \"crash,\" it meant \"no sugar crash\" because 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae has no sugar. The NAD recommended that Living Essentials modify the \"no crash \" representation to make it clear that the ads meant that 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae would not produce a \"sugar crash.\" Living Essentials modified its advertisements to qualify the \"no crash\" language by including an asterisk directing consumers to a small print disc laimer saying \"No crash means no sugar crash.\" (Ex. 382, 383, 384, 638, 648, 651, 2129) . Several of Living Essentials' ads continue to claim that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae will not cause a \"crash.\" See Ex. 629 (Parachute Guy says \"hours of energy now, no crash later ), Ex. 638 (Parachute Guy 2, same tag line), Ex. 651 (Parachute Guy, same tag line), and Ex. 2005 (Why Crash ad) . MEMORANDUM DECISION - 18 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 e. The Ask Your Doctor Claims Living Essentials created its \"Ask Your Doctor\" ( \"AYD \") ad campaign in July 2012. The AYD advertisement s (Ex. 649 ,650) aired for approximately 10 weeks from July 17, 2012 through October 1, 2012. Mr. Sperber's inspiration for the AYD advertisement came from the Trident sugar -free gum campaign, which said that \"[f]our out of five dentists surveyed would choose a sugar -free gum for their patients who [chew] gum\" and then told consumers to \"[a]sk your dentist about Trident.\" Sperber wanted to replicate this ad and sought to find a way to do so. To substantiate a claim that doctors would recommend 5 -Hour ENERGY for their patients, the company undertook two surveys \u2014an online survey and a paper survey \u2014of primary care physicians. Living Essentials, through counsel, retained Thomas Maronick, Ph.D., a professor of marketing at Towson University in Maryland and the former Dire ctor of Impact Evaluation in the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the FTC to create the online survey. Dr. Maronick retained a marketing research and analytical consulting firm (Decision Analyst) to administer the survey to a panel of primary care physici ans on its Physician Advisory Council. Dr. Maronick decided on a target of 500 completed questionnaires, which would be sufficiently large to achieve the desired margin of error. A total of 503 physicians completed the survey. The survey did not ask doct ors for their general opinions about energy drinks or whether they would recommend any energy supplement product for their patients. Instead, the questions asked if the doctor would recommend a low calorie, or a low sodium energy drink for their patients who already consumed such products. Not surprisingly, the majority of doctors said \"Yes.\" The results of the online survey indicated that 73.6% of the physicians said they would recommend a low-calorie energy product to their healthy patients who use energy drinks. The doctors were also shown a 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae label and a brief description of the product. They were then asked if they would recommend 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae to th eir healthy patients who use energy drinks. The survey results indicated that 47.7% of the physicians would specifically recommend 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae to their healthy patients who use energy supplements. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 19 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 About 25% of the survey participants responded that th ey would not recommend 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae. Living Essentials subsequently hired Joe Hennessy, Sales Director for MicroDose, to assist with a paper survey3 based on questions used in the online survey that Dr. Maronick had designed. Under Hennessy's direction, sales staff would make in -person visits to doctors' offices across the United States to promote 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae. His sales team left samples of the product and brochures describing 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae's ingredients in these doctors' offices. Living Essential, again through their attorneys at Oakland Law Group, asked Hennessy to have his sales representatives deliver paper copies of the Maronick survey (Ex. 627) to doctors they normally would visit and to ask the doctors to complete the survey. According to He nnessey, he distributed 100,000 copies of the survey to his territorial managers who in turn transmitted copies to the sales representatives. Hennessy was instructed to target 2,500 responses. Dr. Maronick was not involved in the paper survey process and had concerns about whether such a method would suffer from biased responses. Hennessy received 2,659 paper surveys before the cutoff date. Approximately 90% of the physicians responding to the paper survey indicated they would recommend a low -calorie ene rgy supplement to patients who use energy supplements, and 74% would specifically recommend 5 - hour ENERGY\u00ae. After receiving the results of the online survey and the paper survey, Living Essentials created three versions of the AYD television commercial, tw o 30-second spots and one 10 -second version. (Exs. 649, 640, and 2098). Sperber was personally involved in the development of the script for these ads. He testified that the intent was to convey to consumers that doctors viewed 5 - Hour ENERGY\u00ae as a safe and effective nutritional supplement as a way of allaying possible 3 Living Essentials used the phrase \"in -person survey\" to describe the second survey. The Court does not find this to be an accurate description of how Living Essentials conducted the surv ey. No doctors were questioned in a face -to-face meeting. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 20 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 health and safety concerns. He sought to convince consumers that, by and large, doctors recommended a product like 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae. The script for the 30 -second ad (Ex. 2122) said \"We asked over 3,000 doctors to review 5 - Hour ENERGY\u00ae. And what they said was amazing. Over 73 percent who reviewed 5 -hour ENERGY said they would recommend a low calorie energy supplement to their healthy patients who use energy supplements. Seventy -three percen t. 5-hour ENERGY\u00ae has four calories and it's used over nine million times a week. Is 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae right for you? Ask your doctor. We already asked 3,000.\" Placed next to the ad spokeswoman was a large stack of papers, which she flipped through or ge stured to while speaking: The fine print fro m this screen shot said \"Of all primary care physicians surveyed, 47% would specifically recommend 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae for their healthy patients who use energy supplements.\" The broadcasting networks ABC and NBC r efused to run the AYD ads without some changes to the script. Consumers also complained to Living Essentials about the Ask Your Doctor ads and these complaints were a contributing factor for the company pulling the ads before the end of the campaign. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 21 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 5. Living Essentials ' Claim Substantiation Before this litigation began, Living Essentials had commissioned three literature reviews and two scientific studies concerning the efficacy of 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae. (i) Glade Reports In 2007, Living Essentials, through Jonathan Emord, an attorney with Emord & Associates, commissioned Dr. Michael Glade, a Fellow in the American College of Nutrition, to conduct a review of the scientific literature to assess certain Living Essentials promotional claims, including \"B-Vitami ns for Energy,\" \"Amino Acids for Focus and Better Mood,\" and \"No Crash L ater.\" (Ex. 2071) . Dr. Glade testified that he found competent and reliable scientific support for these claims and prepared a written report which he provided to Emord in July 2007 . Dr. Glade testified that when he reviewed the scientific literature, he examined the studies to verify that they were conducted in a scientifically sound manner before including them in his literature review. As to the claim that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae provides energy that lasts for hours , he concluded that the literature supported this claim because the concurrent consumption of taurine, caffeine, and glucuronolactone increases the conversion of stored triglycerides into energy. As to the claim that B -vitamins in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae provide energy, he concluded that the literature supported this claim because the daily consumption of niacin, vitamin B 6, vitamin B 12, and folate supports the use of fatty acids for metabolic energy production. As to the claim that the amino acids in 5 - Hour ENERGY\u00ae provide focus, Dr. Glade concluded that the literature supported this claim because the consumption of N -acetyl -L-tyrosine and L -phenylalanine enhances cognitive functioning. Regarding the \"no crash\" claim, Dr. Glade repeate d his summary of the literature on the effects of caffeine but really does not hing more. . Dr. Glade's report does not discuss what is meant by \"crash,\" or the impact of glucose or caffeine withdrawal on any sudden decrease in energy levels. It is unclea r how the studies he cites relate in any way to the \"no crash\" claim. At some point, Living Essentials received a copy of the 2007 report because it produced the report to the Attorney General as substantiation in this lawsuit . MEMORANDUM DECISION - 22 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 In 2010, Living Essentials c ommissioned Dr. Glade to conduct a similar literature review to assess whether there was competent and reliable scientific evidence to support claims that Living Essentials' Decaf 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae provides energy and alertness that lasts for hours without an y crash effect . (Ex. 2079) . He was also asked to substantiate the claim that the drink contained a \"proven blend of B -vitamins, amino acids and essential nutrients to keep you going strong.\" Id. Dr. Glade reviewed some 217 scientific studies and conc luded that there was science to back each of these claims. With regard to the contention that the energy provided by the drink would \"last for hours,\" Dr. Glade cited studies relating to taurine, which he concluded demonstrated that daily dietary suppleme ntation of taurine in 3000 mg or more increased metabolizable energy that could last for at least four hours (Decaf 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae contains only 483 mg of taurine). He also cited studies for the proposition that the daily intake of certain B vitamins supp orted the production of energy within 2 hours of consumption and for 12 to 24 hours after consumption. As to the \"no crash later\" claim, Dr. Glade concluded that dietary supplements that do not contain sugar or caffeine cannot produce a \"sugar crash\" or c affeine withdrawal effect . Again, there is no evidence that any employee of Living Essentials reviewed Glade's 2010 literature review, but Living Essentials provided it to the Attorney General as substantiation for its decaf claims. The Court has serious q uestions about the scientific reliability of Dr. Glade's two reports. First, his analysis was based on a non-quantitative list of ingredients in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. He was not given the actual formula, so Dr. Glade was unable to look at the actual amounts of vitamins and amino acids contained in the product to compare to the levels tested in the studies he reviewed . Second, Dr. Glade's 2007 literature review did not evaluate how 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae , or any of its ingredients in the amounts found in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae would affect healthy, well -nourished individuals. Dr. Glade admitted in his deposition that it was possible that the caffeine, by itself in MEMORANDUM DECISION - 23 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae, could be causing the energy, alertness, and focus that consumers felt after drinking the energy supplement. Third, Dr. Glade relied on studies that evaluated the consumption of certain vitamins and nutrients in sick populations. The scientists who testified at trial disagreed as to whether these factors undercut Dr. Glade's conclusions . There was no analysis in either report as to why reliance on the studies he cited was appropriate. Finally, Dr. Glade did not communicate his conclusions to anyone directly working for Living Essentials. Carl Sperber, the director of advertising, had n ever seen either of Dr. Glade's reports. Sperber testified that starting in 2007, the company began relying on the Oakland Law Group to review all of the ads he created to ensure that they were backed by adequate substantiation. No one from the Oakland L aw Group testified regarding what role, if any, the 2007 Glade Report played in substantiating specific ad representations. (ii) Blum Study Living Essentials commissioned James Blum, Ph.D. , an epidemiologist, to conduct a clinical trial to assess the effects of the 2004 formulation of 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae as compared to two other energy drinks then on the market , but not to a placebo . Dr. Blum tested subjects' peak energy, the duration of energy, and any \"crash.\" He concluded that consumers' self -reported peak energ y after drinking 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae occurred at 4.92 hours. The peak energy duration for the two competing products occurred at 4.39 and 4.34 hours, which Dr. Blum felt were similar results. Dr. Blum also asked test subjects whether they experienced a \"crash \" after drinking the three energy drinks. Dr. Blum testified that he considered a \"crash\" to be the experience of hitting a \"floor or wall\" where the test subjects self -reported feeling physiologically stressed. Based on this definition of \"crash,\" he co ncluded that 24 percent of the people consuming 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae reported experiencing a \"moderately severe\" crash. Eighty percent of the Red Bull and 75 percent of the Monster group reported experiencing a similar crash. Dr. Blum did not test MEMORANDUM DECISION - 24 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 the non -caffeine ingredients of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae and reached no conclusions as to the efficacy of these ingredients in the absence of caffeine. Dr. Blum provided his final report directly to Living Essentials in May 2007. (Ex. 2153) Living Essentials retained a copy o f Dr. Blum's report in its files, and that report constituted part of Living Essentials' substantiation for its promotional claims about the 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae products. (iii) NERAC Report Also in 2007, Living Essentials, through Jonathan Emord of Emord & Associates , commissioned NERAC , Inc., a global research and advisory firm, to conduct a review of the scientific literature to assess certain promotional claims including \"No Crash Later,\" \"B -Vitamins for Energy,\" in Fatigue.\" (Ex. 2070 ) NERAC's team of biochemists, food scientists, and nutritionists sought to find at least one ingredient in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae that supported each of the company's claims. They looked at the research into B vitamins, the amino acid s, and caffeine. NERAC's conclusions differed from those of Dr. Glade. For example, NERAC concluded that there was no support in the literature for claiming that glucuronolactone improved memory, supplied energy , or affected fatigue. Although NERAC identified one study that indicated that a high dose of glucuronolactone delayed the onset of fatigue, the dose was 34 times the amount of glucuronolactone in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae. Because NERAC found no study varying the dosage level of this ingredient, it co ncluded that one could not say that the glucuronolactone in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae had a measurable effect on energy or fatigue. With regard to the \"B Vitamins for Energy\" claim, NERAC concluded that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae included B vitamins at doses high enough to \"pro mote mental health and support good physical condition and provide energy.\" With regard to the \"Amino Acids for Focus\" claim, NERAC concluded that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae included certain amino acids, namely phenylalanine and tyrosine, had been shown to improve mood and attention, and thus supported the claim. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 25 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 NERAC 's discussion of the \"no crash later\" claim was quite abbreviated. It stated that the \"crash\" phenomenon was related to sudden shifts in blood sugar levels and because 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae contains no sugar , it could not contribute to a sudden change in blood sugar levels. NERAC found no published human studies showing a relationship between any of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae's ingredients and a \"crash\" as NERAC defined it. Living Essentials provided a copy of the NERAC report as part of its substantiation for its promotional claims about the 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae products. (iv) Medicus Clinical Study In early 2008, Emord & Associates contacted Dr. Jay Udani, the CEO and Medical Director of Medicus Research LLC, to conduct a clinica l trial of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae. The purpose of the study was to establish the scientific validity of claims the company was either making at the time or intended to make about its product in the future. Medicus retained Dr. Keith Wesnes and his firm, Cognitiv e Drug Research ( \"CDR \"), to assist with the study. CDR had developed a computerized cognitive assessment tool to assist researchers in evaluating the effect of certain commercial products on human test subjects. (Ex. 1452) . CDR's core battery of automat ed tests included immediate word recall, reaction time to questions, working memory, delayed word recall, word recognition, picture recognition, and self -reported alertness, calmness, and contentment. Ultimately, Drs. Udani and Wesnes proposed to undertake a 4-arm crossover, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to assess the efficacy of a single dose of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae compared to a placebo, and the efficacy of one active comparator (Monster Energy Drink) to a placebo, measured by alertness and cognitive function over a 6 -hour period. (Ex. 1455, 1448) . The trial involved five separate visits to the test site. The primary objective was to measure the power of attention, continuity of attention (focus), quality of short -term working memory, qualify of episodic (long -term) memory, speed of memory, and self -related alertness. The secondary objective was to assess the effects of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae on blood glucose levels. The tertiary objective was to assess changes in self -related contentment, calmn ess, mood, and fatigue. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 26 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 Ninety test subjects underwent a screening visit where they were trained on the CDR tests hourly for 4 hours. They were provided standardized frozen foods with low glycemic content to consume the day before each visit. They were instructed not to drink any alcohol or energy drinks the day before each visit and to sleep only 3 to 6 hours the night before. Participants were instructed not to consume more than 4 cups of coffee the day before each visit and not to consume any caffeine or food on the morning of each visit. The subjects were provided the same standardized meal of eggs, bacon and sausage on each study day, two hours after consuming the energy drink or placebo. They were not provided any carbohydrates. Dr. Udani concluded that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae had a statistically significant effect on cognitive function and mental energy over a 6 -hour test period as compared to the placebo . There was no evidence of a statistically significa nt drop in blood sugar compared to placebo (and thus no \"crash\"), and there were no statistically significant diminishment in mood, contentment, calmness, depression, or anxiety that would represent a negative effect of using the product. The study tested the effects of the 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae formula as a whole. It did not study or test the effects of any of the non-caffeine ingredients. Nor did Dr. Udani examine whether 5 - Hour ENERGY\u00ae was \"superior\" to drinking the same amount of caffeine in some other form, such as in coffee. Because the clinical trial did not evaluate separate ingredients in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae, Dr. Udani testified it was not possible to draw any conclusions about the benefits of such individual ingredients from the Medicus Report's data. The experts disagreed about the reliability of the study's data or the validity of any conclusions one could draw from the data, given its design. Dr. McLellan, an expert on caffeine, credibly testified that because Dr. Udano allowed test subjects arrive in a caffeine withdrawn state, and the placebo group's overall performance was so far below baseline, any statistically significance in test scores between the 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae group and placebo group was likely attributable to the former group's ingestion of ca ffeine. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 27 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 6. Post-Claim Scientific Evidence Living Essentials presented additional scientific evidence, developed after its ads aired, to substantiate the claims now being challenged by the State.4 a. Moat Article (2003) In 2003, Stuart Moat published an articl e entitled \"Folate, homocysteine, endothelial function and cardiovascular disease,\" in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. (Ex. 2002) . Moat's article is a literature review on the effect of folate or folic acid deficiencies on the cardiovascular sys tem. Moat concluded that that folate can reverse endothelial dysfunction.5 According to Dr. Kennedy, Moat also found that the cardiovascular benefit of taking a single dose of folate can be detected physiologically within two hours of ingestion , at four hours post - ingestion , and even after six weeks. b. Scholey & Kennedy Study (2004) In 2004, Andrew Scholey and David Kennedy co -authored a paper entitled \"Cognitive and physiological effects of an \"energy drink\": an evaluation of the whole drink and of gluco se, caffeine and an herbal flavoring fractions.\" (Ex. 2068) . They conducted a double -blind, placebo - controlled crossover study to evaluate the effects of a non -caloric placebo drink with (a) an energy drink containing glucose, caffeine, and guarana; (b) a drink containing only the glucose fraction of the energy drink; (c) a drink containing only the caffeine fraction of the energy drink; and (d) a drink containing only the flavoring fraction of the energy drink. Scholey and Kennedy used CDR's cognitive t esting system on their test subjects. They concluded that there were improvements to cognitive functioning after the consumption of the energy drink but that neither glucose nor caffeine in isolation provided any 4 The State argues that any scientific evidence developed after Living Essentials aired or published its ads is legally irrelevant because the FTC guidelines required pre -claim substantiation. Wh ile this Court acknowledges that both the FTC guidelines and federal case law indicate that pre -claim substantiation is required, the Court also concludes that subsequent scientific studies may shed light on pre -claim studies and are thus relevant and mate rial to the Court's CPA analysis. 5 Endothelial function is the measure of how well the body is delivering blood on demand to the periphery, including the brain. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 28 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 significant improvements in cognitive fun ctioning. They concluded that their test results strongly suggest that the cognitive enhancing properties of energy drinks contain ing glucose, caffeine and guarana6 were attributed to the combination of active ingredients, rather than solely to caffeine. The study does not directly support the contention that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae's ingredients work together to achieve results not attributable to caffeine alone because 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae does not contain any glucose or guarana. But Living Essentials contends and Dr. Kennedy testified that the study is strongly supportive of the proposition that it is not the caffeine alone in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae that makes it effective. c. Haskell & Kennedy Study (2005) Dr. Kennedy testified that in 2005, he and a colleague, Crystal Haskell, co-authored a paper that looked at the effects of both caffeine (given in two different dose levels, 75 mg and 150 mg) in habitual users and non -users by examining cerebral blood flow. (Ex. 2004) . They concluded that caffeine improved cognitive performa nce and mood in healthy, young adults regardless whether the adults were habitual users or non -users of caffeinated products. All of the scientific experts agreed that caffeine is well -documented to improve cognitive performance. d. Giles Study (2012) In 201 2, Grace Giles et al. published an article entitled \"Differential cognitive effects of energy drink ingredients: Caffeine, taurine, and glucose,\" in the journal Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior. (Ex. 665, 2034) . Giles studied the effects of caffei ne, taurine, and glucose (both alone and in combination) on cognitive performance and mood in 24 -hour caffeine abstaining habitual caffeine consumers. Subjects took cognitive tests 30 minutes and 60 minutes post-ingestion. Giles found that caffeine enhan ced executive control and working memory, and reduced simple and choice reaction time , that t aurine increased choice reaction times but reduced reaction time in working memory tasks , and that g lucose slowed choice reaction time. Glucose , combined with caf feine , enhanced working memory. Taurine , combined with glucose and 6 Guarana is a plant containing caffeine. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 29 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 caffeine , enhanced orienting attention. Caffeine reduced feelings of fatigue and increased tension and vigor. Taurine reversed the effects of caffeine on vigor and caffeine -withdrawal sy mptoms. Giles' final conclusion , however, was that caffeine, not taurine or glucose, is likely responsible for reported changes in cognitive performance following the consumption of energy drinks, particularly in caffeine -withdrawn habitual caffeine consumers. e. Wesnes's Appetite Article (2013) In 2013, Dr. Wesnes, along with Dr. Udani and Dr. Barrett, published an article outlining the results of the Medicus Study in the journal, Appetite . (Ex. 664, 2107 ). In the article entitled \"An evaluation of the cognitive and mood effects of an energy shot over a 6 h period in volunteers. A randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled, cross -over study,\" Dr. Wesnes described the Medicus clinical trial and the result s from that trial. The article described the study's results this way: \"an energy shot can significantly improve important aspects of cognitive function for up to 6 h[ours] compared to placebo in partially sleep -deprived healthy volunteers.\" Dr. Wesnes testified that he thought the results of the tests in the Medicus study were \"most uncaffeine -like\" because the differences in the cognitive performance of the 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae group and the placebo group were significant over the entire 6 -hour period. Dr. Ke nnedy testified that the results of the Medicus clinical trial demonstrated that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae provided improvements in attention, working memory, long -term memory, alertness, depression , and anxiety and that these improvements endured for six hours. He also opined t hat, based on other studies relating to the benefits of caffeine, these effects could not be attributable to caffeine alone. Dr. McLellan disagreed with this interpretation of the data when he testified that 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae did not improve any test scores; it simply showed less of a diminishment of cognitive functioning in sleep -deprived and potentially caffeine withdrawn test subjects, than placebo. He found the test results consistent with prior studies showing the impacts on caffeine over t ime. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 30 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 f. Kurtz Article (2013) In 2013, Abigail Kurtz et al. published an article entitled \"Effects of Caffeinated Versus Decaffeinated Energy Shots on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate in Healthy Young Volunteers,\" in the journal Pharmocotherapy . (Ex. 2044) . Kurt z's article described a study evaluating the effects of a single dose of caffeinated 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae shot compared with a decaffeinated 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae shot, assessed by changes in blood pressure and heart rates in healthy volunteers. Kurtz sought to determine if the non -caffeine ingredients in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae were affecting blood pressure. Kurtz found that the caffeinated shot significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure over a three -hour period compared with the decaf version of the drink. She concluded that it was unlikely that the non -caffeine ingredients were contributin g to blood pressure increases. Kurtz also reported that self -reported energy level s did not vary significantly between the caffeinated and decaffe inated versions of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae over time. She concluded that \"[i]t appears that the decaffeinated shot provides the same amount of increase in perceived energy without the rise in peripheral blood pressure noted with the caffeinated shot.\" g. Nagrecha Stu dy (2013) Natasha Nagrech a et al. published an article entitled, \"The Effect of Caffeine and Choline Combinations on Short -term and Auditory Memory,\" in 2013 in the journal, Clinical Pharmacol Biopharmaceutical (Ex. 2238), in which she reported on a study to determine whether choline in combination with several doses of caffeine could facilitate short -term visual and verbal memory and attention in adult and middle aged human subjects with normal cognitive function. Subjects underwent computerized testing o nce 40 minutes after ingestion. The test results showed that subjects ingesting 100 mg caffeine and 2 grams of choline bitartrate and those ingesting choline alone showed no change in performance on short -term memory or attention tests compared to placebo . The group ingesting 50 mg of caffeine and 2 grams of choline bitartrate scored significantly lower on tests for short -term verbal memory and attention than a placebo group. The MEMORANDUM DECISION - 31 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 subjects ingesting 25 mg of caffeine and 2 grams of choline bitartrate scored significantly higher on tests for short -term visual memory than a placebo group. h. Marczinski Study (2014) Cecile Marczinski authored an article entitled \"Subjective State, Blood Pressure, and Behavioral Control Changes Produced by an 'Energy Shot'\" in th e Journal of Caffeine Research in 2014. (Ex. 2056) The purpose of the Marczinski Study was to investigate the acute effects of 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae on subjective and objective measures assessed hourly for 6 hours following consumption. Marczinski concluded th at while 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae improved subjective feelings of vigor and reduced fatigue, the subjects' objective performance on a computerized cognitive test did not improve , and in fact worsened over time. i. Shah Study (2015) Dr. Blonz and Dr. Kennedy both referenced a study published by Sachin Shah entitled \"Energy Implications of Consuming Caffeinated Versus Decaffeinated Energy Drinks.\" According to Dr. Kennedy, Shah's article was published in the Journal of Pharmacy Practice, although the article itself is not in evidence (Ex. 2254, p. 65). Dr. Kennedy summarized Shah's study: Shah conducted two studies to measure subjective energy levels in participants who consumed a caffeinated version of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae and a decaffeinated version of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae. Dr. Kennedy testified that Shah's test results indicated that both caffeinated and decaffeinated 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae \"significantly boosted energy level s 1 hour after consumption, but caffeinated EDs have a significantly greater boo st and it is sustained at least 3 hours after consumption.\" j. Buckenmeyer Study (2015) In 2015, Phillip Buckenmeyer published an article entitled \"Cognitive Influence of a 5 -h ENERGY\u00ae shot: Are effects perceived or real?\" (Ex. 1398) . Buckenmeyer studied th e effects of consumption of a 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae shot on various cognitive functions across five hours on 24 college -aged students using a double -blind, cross -over, placebo -based design. Buckenmeyer MEMORANDUM DECISION - 32 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 concluded that while 90% of the participants subjectively th ought that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae effective one -hour post -ingestion, he found no evidence that it enhanced recognition, reaction time, short -term and working memory, or attention capacity. Buckenmeyer did not use CDR's test battery but instead used a web -deliver ed cognitive assessment from Lumosity.com. k. Molnar Study (2015) Janos Molnar authored an article entitled \"Evaluation of the Effects of Different Energy Drinks and Coffee on Endothelial Function.\" Molnar looked at four different treatments: 5 -Hour ENE RGY\u00ae (230 mg of caffeine) , Red Bull (80 mg caffeine) , a drink called NOS (120 mg caffeine) , and coffee (240 mg caffeine) , and compared test subjects' endothelial function over a 4 hour period . (Ex. 2137) . The endothelium is the lining of the blood vessel s. The endothelium responds to signals from the brain to dilate or contract blood vessels. The body needs to ensure that blood is delivered to working muscles . A properly functioning vasculature, reflected in endothelial function, provides this service to the body. Molnar found a significant improvement in endothelial function (or blood flow ) 1 \u00bd and 4 hours after the subjects consumed 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae and Red Bull . Neither NOS nor t he coffee, containing the same amount of caffeine as 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae , changed endothelial function significantly . The Molnar Study did not test energy, alertness or focus. It looked at endothelial function as a proxy for coronary function, or how the heart works. Dr. Blonz did not find the Molnar Study to be relevant for this reason . Dr. Kennedy opined that the Molnar Study supported the proposition that the physiological effects of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae cannot be attributed to caffeine alone. Because endothelial functioning relates to how well the body delivers blood on demand to the brain, Dr. Kennedy testified that it is reasonable to conclude from Molnar's results that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae would have a greater impact on cognitive functioning than would caffeine alone. l. Jacobson Study (2015) In 2015, B.H. Jacobson published a study i n the journal Perceptual & Motor Skills , entitled \"Effect of Energy Drinks on Selected Fin e Motor Tasks.\" (Ex. 2060) . Jacobson assessed the effect MEMORANDUM DECISION - 33 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 of energy shots on certain fine motor skills of college -aged males. Jacobson noted that the stimulant e nergy blends present in most of the commercially available energy shots and energy drinks include caffeine, taurine, guarana, ginseng, glucose, and B vitamins. He notes that \"very little research on the combined or synergistic effects of these ingredients \" has been done. After summarizing the conflicting results of studies examining the effect of caffeine combined with taurine or glucose, he stated that the purpose of his study was to \"compare hand steadiness, choice reaction time, pursuit rotor tracing, and simple reaction time following ingestion of a commercially available energy shot or a placebo.\" The energy shot involved in the test was 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae Extra Strength. Jacobson's study showed that the ingredients in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae did affect the subjects' physical performance. The energy shot did not improve hand steadiness over the placebo but did improve reaction times , which the author surmised may be the result of the caffeine in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae. m. Bloomer Study (2015) Richard Bloomer publishe d the article, \"Comparison of 5 -Hour ENERGY and Caffeine on Cognitive Performance and Subjective Feelings in Young Men and Women,\" in the Journal of Caffeine Research in 2015. (Ex. 1397) . Bloomer sought to compare the effects of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae to caffein e only and to a placebo on subjective feelings of energy and mood, objective measures of cognitive performance, heart rate, and blood pressure in men and women. Bloomer's study concluded that neither caffeine nor 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae resulted in an improvement in subjective feelings of energy or mood or in objective cognitive performance. The results clearly diverge from those of the Medicus Study. Dr. Blonz attribute d the difference to the design of the study: the Bloomer participants were allowed to eat breakfast on the day of testing, suggesting that the lack of food impacted the Medicus test results. Dr. Kennedy felt that the Bloomer study must have been flawed be cause the lack of improved functioning after ingesting the caffeine -only drink MEMORANDUM DECISION - 34 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 was inconsistent with most of the recogniz ed science relating to caffeine but he was unable to identify what any such flaws were. n. Pomportes Study (2015) Laura Pomportes et al. w rote the article, \"Heart Rate Variability and Cognitive Function Following a Multi -Vitamin and Mineral Supplementation with Added Guarana ( Paullinia cupana in the journal, Nutrients (Ex. 2062 ). The Pomportes Study assessed cognitive performance and hear t rate variability following the ingestion of either a multivitamin and mineral combination supplemented with 300 mg of guarana, compared to a caffeine supplement or a placebo. Test participants were asked to perform cognitive tasks 15 minutes after inges tion and then every 15 minutes over a 3 -hour period. The results indicated that those ingesting the multivitamin/mineral/guarana product performed better on cognitive tests than the caffeine only or placebo. Dr. Kennedy testified that the study is signif icant in that it demonstrated that a mixture of multivitamins, minerals and guarana worked better in improving cognitive functioning than caffeine. o. Paulus Study (2015) In May 2015, an undergraduate student in Ohio named Ryan Paulus published an article documenting a study he and colleagues performed to test cognitive functioning and self -related mood of college students after consuming 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae, or a Starbucks DoubleShot\u00ae, or a drink containing caffeine powder. Paulus concluded that the 5 -Hour ENERGY \u00ae appeared to perform better than the other two products. Experts for both parties agree that this study has some fairly basic methodological problems. The study was not blind, for example, and there were limited controls on the test subjects' food consu mption and activities during the tested time periods. p. Cheskin Study (2016) In July 2016 , Lawrence J. Cheskin, a researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, issued a report to the Oregon Department of Justice entitled \"Randomized, Placebo - MEMORANDUM DECISION - 35 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 Controlled Crossover Trial of an Energy Drink.\" (Ex. 2247) . Cheskin stated that the most common active ingredient in energy drinks is caffeine \"but whether energy drinks boost energy due to caffeine, other non -herbal (vitamins, minerals, amino -acids) an d herbal ingredients that may be present, or a combination remains unclear.\" He stated that all previous studies of the efficacy of energy drinks \"lacked sufficient power and were generally not placebo -controlled.\" Because he did not find sufficient evid ence to determine the effect of any ingredients other tha n caffeine, in boosting energy, Cheskin sought to test the efficacy of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae Decaf, compared to a placebo drink. Cheskin's study involved 147 participants who were given Decaf 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae or a placebo drink and then underwent computerized cognitive tests at 30 minutes, 1 \u00bd hours and 5 hours post -ingestion. The Cheskin data indicate that there was no significant improvement in cognitive, behavioral, or energy -level performance after consum ing 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae Decaf compared to the placebo drink. After comparing the relative reliability of his study results as compared to those of Paulus, Kurtz and Giles, he concluded \"We found strong evidence that 5 - Hour ENERGY Decaf is not efficacious in enhancing energy levels or any related cognitive behavioral parameters measured.\" Dr. Blonz believed that the Cheskin Study was competent and reliable; Dr. Ke nnedy did not. Dr. Kennedy criticized the design of Cheskin's study because 38 percent of the participants were morbidly obese, and thus might suffer from obesity -related illness; the age range of the participants was overly large, from age 18 to 70 , whic h could confo und the cognitive test results; and the cognitive tests were run over the weekend when it would have been difficult to control for sleep, food intake, ca ffeine intake, or alcohol use. 7. The Blonz/ McLellan/Kennedy Scientific Dispute s The scientis ts presented by the State and Living Essentials disagreed on several key issues. The Court summarizes its understanding of these disputes below. a. Whether caffeine is the sole active ingredient in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae . MEMORANDUM DECISION - 36 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 The complaint alleges that caffeine is the sole active ingredient in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae. By \"active ingredient,\" the Court adopts Dr. Blonz's definition: an ingredient that has a physiological effect on the human body. Dr. Kennedy presented convincing testimony, and the studies each side cited also s upport the conclusion, that the B -vitamins, and the amino acids can have a physiological effect on the body. The Court finds from this evidence that caffeine is not the sole active ingredient in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. As previously described above, B vitamins, taurine, tyrosine and choline are bioactive. B vitamins, in general, promote metabolism which plays a role in the generation of physiological energy and can affect cognitive function and mood. Taurine can improve endothelial function and reduce subjectiv e feelings of fatigue. Tyrosine can promote the formation of neurotransmitters. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the se bioactive ingredients in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae , in the amounts found in that product, are efficacious in providing consumers with the advertised benefits of \"energy, alertness, and focus. \" Dr. Kennedy agreed with Dr. McLellan that there is no experimental evidence showing that the addition of multivitamins to a caffeinated energy drink will cause greater improvement in physical and cognitive performance than can be attributed to the effects of caffeine alone. b. Whether healthy, well -nourished adults can benefit physiologically from vitamins and amino acids in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae . Dr. Blonz testified that healthy, well -nourished adults will receive no benefit from the B - vitamins and amino acids found in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae and that these ingredients provide no physiological benefit and would simply be excreted. Dr. Kennedy strongly disagrees wit h this opinion and testified that the recommended daily allowance of a particular vitamin is a minimum that humans should receive each day to prevent disease. He provided the results of a study he conducted and published in the article \"Multivitamins and minerals modulate whole -body energy metabolism and cerebral blood -flow during cognitive task performance: a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled trial,\" in the journal Nutrition & Metabolism in 2016. This study MEMORANDUM DECISION - 37 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 investigated whether supplementing t he diet of healthy females with a multivitamin could affect metabolic and cerebral blood flow consequences, assessed through cognitive tasks. He found that just a single dose of Vitamin s C and B led to an increase in fat oxidation and total energy expende d. The Court finds this evidence to be compelling proof that healthy, well -nourished adults can benefit from some of the vitamins in 5 -Hour ENERGY \u00ae. The State has not shown that the vitamins and nutrients in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae provide no benefit whatsoever. c. Whether the Medicus Study supports Living Essentials' claims that non - caffeine ingredients contribute to the overall effectiveness of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae . The Medicus Study concluded that subjects who drank 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae performed better on tests of power of attention, continuity of attention, quality of working memory, and quality of episodic memory at several measurement points throughout the 6 hours. Dr. McLellan, an expert on caffeine, testified that there is no basis for concluding that these results we re attributable to any ingredient other than caffeine. Dr. Kennedy disagrees. He testified that because caffeine has not been demonstrated to improve episodic memory and the 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae improved episodic memory, there must be some interaction between the caffeine and the other bioactive ingredients causing this result. After reviewing the scientific evidence and the testimony of Drs. McLellan and Kennedy, the Court finds Dr. McLellan's opinion to be the more credible. First, Medicus did not design its study to determine whether the non-caffeine ingredients in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae led to improved performance on these cognitive tests. One of the study's co -authors, Marilyn Barrett, testified on that \"the study was not designed to show what kind of effect there was with caffeine and the other ingredients. It could have been additive. It could have been synergistic. It could be no effect. The study was not designed to show that.\" (Barrett Dep. 70:19 -23). Second, the Court agrees with Dr. McLellan that the test results from the Medicus clinical trial do not show that consuming 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae improved any of the test subj ects' cognitive functioning , including episodic memory, above baseline. The results merely indicate that the MEMORANDUM DECISION - 38 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 cognitive performance of the 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae group did not diminish as muc h as that of the placebo group. Third, t he Court also finds compelling Dr . McLellan's testimony that t he Medicus study had design flaws that , whether intentional or not, inflate d the positive res ults of the study in favor of 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae . Test subjects were asked to perform the computerized tests in a state of sleep deprivat ion, which Dr. Udani acknowledged would have a negative impact on cognition and affective processing. (Ex. 1458 ). Limiting test subjects' sleep ensured a greater impact from the caffeine in 5- Hour ENERGY\u00ae , resulting in higher test scores by participants who received 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae as opposed to those receiving the placebo . The test subjects were additionally not permitted to consume caffeine on the day of testing, which meant that for those who regularly drink caffeine, they were arriving in a caffeine withdrawn state. Because scientific literature demonstrates that caffein e withdrawal has a negative effect on performance, those test subjects who were habituated to caffeine and received the placebo would have inevitably perform ed more poorly than the test subjects who received the caffeinated 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae . Finally, episodi c memory has little to do with the claimed benefit of \"energy, alertness and focus.\" The evidence presented at trial makes it clear that caffeine provides these benefits. While it is certainly plausible that the non -caffeine ingredients have a synergisti c effect with the caffeine to enhance or extend the effect of the caffeine, that question has not been studied. The Court finds that the Medicus Study does not support a claim that the non-caffeine ingredients in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae contribute to the effective ness of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae. d. Whether the Monster Arm data undermine s Living Essentials' contention that the cognitive benefits from 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae seen in the Medicus Study are attributable to its non -caffeine ingredients. The Appetite article made two controve rsial statements about the Medicus Study results . First, Drs. Wesnes, Udani , and Barrett wrote that the caffeine in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae was unlikely to account for the effects seen in study participants because caffeine's effects dissipate after 90 minutes. Second, they wrote that \"no other study with an energy shot has yet demonstrated such MEMORANDUM DECISION - 39 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 a widespread improvement to various aspects of cognitive function which have sustained to 6 h.\" (Ex. 2107) . On the eve of trial, the Court ordered Living Essentials to produce documents relating to data Medicus collected from a part of its study known as the \"Monster Arm .\" These documents revealed that i n addition to testing subjects after consuming 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae, the Medicus team had also tested the same subjects after they consum ed a competitor energy drink, Monster, and a placebo. Thus, there were in fact four \"arms\" to the Medicus Study: 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae, a comparison placebo, Monster, and a comparison placebo. The Court rejects Living Essentials' argument that the M onster Arm was a \"completely different study.\" The IRB protocol and IRB approval was the same; the test subjects were the same. Test participants took the same battery of computerized tests and answered the same questionnaire about calmness, alertness, a nd contentment after consuming all four drinks . The Court also rejects Living Essentials' contention that the Monster Arm data was never analyzed. In fact, t he Medicus Study team prepared a fairly extensive analysis of the two arms of the study. The te am labeled the 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae drink as \"Drink A,\" and its comparison placebo as \"Drink B.\" The Monster drink was labeled as \"Drink E,\" and its comparison placebo labeled \"Drink D.\" In a summary of the data comparing Drinks A and B and Drinks D and E , the Medicus team reported that the all of the composite scores between 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae and the placebo were different, with the 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae group out performing the placebo group on all performance measures except self-rated calmness . With regard to the Mon ster group, the team concluded that four of the five major composite scores and self -ratings were significantly different between the Monster and placebo. Monster outperformed the placebo on four performance measures (power of attention, continuity of att ention, quality of working memory, and quality of episodic memory) , as well as on self -rated alertness and contentment. While the Medicus team concluded that the cognitive benefits of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae over the placebo were generally greater and \"more stati stically reliable \" than those of Monster over the MEMORANDUM DECISION - 40 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 placebo, the data nevertheless showed statistically significant cognitive benefits from Monster lasting the entire 6 hours . According to Ex. 666, Dr. McLellan's article relating to energy drinks, Monster contains 80 mg of caffeine (compared to 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae's 200 mg), 1,000 mg of taurine (compared to 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae's 467 mg), 5 mg of glucuronolactone (compared to 411 mg in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae), 27 grams of sugar, an unknown amount of vitamins B 2, B3, B5, and B12, 5 mg of guarana and 200 mg of ginseng. Guarana is a plant that contains caffeine. Monster appears to contain no Vitamin B 6 or B 9, no choline or citicoline , L-Phenylalanine . The Court agrees with Dr. McLellan 's opinion that the Monster Arm data directly contradict statements made in Appetite . Th e data demonstrate s that subjects consuming 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae or Monster performed bett er on the cognitive tests than did the subjects consuming the comparable placebo drink. Some of the early cognitive performance results from Monster could be attributable to the glucose. But, according to Dr. McLellan, t he glucose would have raised the b lood glucose levels over the first 30 minutes but those levels would have returned to baseline within 60 minutes. This conclusion appears credible given Dr. McLellan's analysis in Ex. 666 of the limited scientific evidence suggesting that the addition of glucose to a caffeinated energy drink will cause greater improvements in cognitive performance than can be attributed to the effects of caffeine alone. The Medicus Study showed differences in cognitive performance from Monster over placebo over the entire 6 -hour period \u2014long after the blood g lucose levels would have returned to baseline . The Court agrees with Dr. McLellan that the cognitive benefits Medicus found from Monster are unlikely to be attributable to glucose alone. According to Dr. McLellan, t he caffeine in both energy drinks , however, would have remained elevated throughout the duration of the 6 hour s. Any contention by Dr s. Wesnes, Udani and Barrett that the effects of the caffeine would have disappeared after 90 minutes is also not supported by the science on caffeine. The Court agrees with Dr. McLellan that the Monster Arm data make s it impossible to conclude that the cognitive benefits achieved from 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae MEMORANDUM DECISION - 41 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 are attributable to its non -caffeine ingredient s. The Court also finds that Living Essentials' failure to disclose, discuss , and account for the Monster arm data undercut s the credibility of Living Essentials' claim that the non -caffeine ingredients of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae are working synergistically with caffeine to en hance or extend the duration of any energy, alertness , and focus than the caffeine would otherwise provide. e. Whether the Cheskin Study undermines Living Essentials' claims about the Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae product . Dr. Cheskin 's study concluded that 5-Hour ENERGY Decaf does not enhance energy levels or cognitive functioning. The experts who testified at trial disagree on the reliability of Dr. Cheskin 's study results. Dr. Blonz testified that the Cheskin study was competent and reliable scientific e vidence. Dr. Kennedy, on the other hand, deemed the study \"an appalling piece of work.\" Dr. Kennedy criticized the methodology: (1) the principal investigator was an obesity doctor with inadequate experience in the area of brain science; (2) he believed the study was designed to reach the results the Oregon Department of Justice wanted; (3) Dr. Cheskin included participants between 18 and 70 years of age, which undercuts the reliability of the test results because cognitive function varies with age; (4) D r. Cheskin included a significant number of morbidly obese individuals which would confound the test results; (5) the tests were done over the weekend when participants probably had been out \"clubbing\" and came in with either too little or too much sleep; (6) Dr. Cheskin did not train the participants on the computerized tasks to make sure they could do the tasks in the first place; (7) there were no usable baseline results because of the lack of this training; (8) Dr. Cheskin did not use one of the valid t ests (POMS scale) more than once after 30 minutes which would pick up any effect from the small amount of caffeine in the product but would not pick up any effect of the other bioactive ingredients. The Court did not hear from Dr. Cheskin himself and Dr. B lonz did not or could not rebut these criticisms. Based on Dr. Kennedy's credible review, the Court finds that the Cheskin Study MEMORANDUM DECISION - 42 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 is not sufficiently reliable to consider when assessing Living Essentials' claims regarding its decaffeinated product. 8. Living Essentials' expert testimony on substantiation standard of care and advertising subjectivity analysis. Living Essentials presented evidence through Dr. Sanford Bigelow that it complied with industry standards in substantiating its ad claims, first, by havi ng Carl Sperber conduct internet research on the formula 's ingredients, then by instituting a process for legal and regulatory review by an outside law firm, followed by retaining Dr. Glade and NERAC to perform literature reviews, and finally, by asking Dr . Blum and then Medicus to undertake clinical studies. Dr. Bigelow concluded that Living Essentials \"exceeded industry standards\" in substantiating its product claims. The Court finds some of Dr. Bigelow's opinions credible and some not. First, the Court cannot find that asking an advertising director who lacks any scientific or medical training to conduct Internet research is adequate substantiation. Mr. Sperber had no ability or training to assess the scientific reliabili ty of anything he read online. Second, the Court also cannot find that Living Essentials' regulatory or legal review was reasonable to substantiate the ad claims . There was no testimony from anyone who performed this review as to what they looked at or how they analyzed its accura cy and reliability. Dr. Bigelow had no idea how this regulatory review was conducted, or what criteria were applied when evaluating substantiation. T here is simply no evidence in the record that anyone with any science training ever assessed the a d claims and the science backing up those claims against the FTC substantiation guidelines , as Dr. Bigelow testified he performed for his various employers and clients . Third, there is no evidence that anyone within the company ever saw Dr. Glade's reports or the NERAC report. Although Living Essentials produced them to the Attorney General in this litigation as claim substantiation, the Court cannot find that Living Essentials knew about the MEMORANDUM DECISION - 43 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 reports wh en they were prepared . Mr. Sperber did not know about them and no one else from the company testified. Dr. Bigelow admitted that he has no idea whether Living Essentials even knew of or relied on the FTC substantiation guidelines when it took action to s ubstantiate its ad claims. Thus, Dr. Bigelow's opinion that Living Essentials met the standard of care in substantiating its ad claims by procuring these reports is not supported by evidence in the record. The Court does find that some of Dr. Bigelow's op inions are credible. For example, as set out below, the Court finds credible his testimony that the European Food Safety Authority (\"EFSA\") reports substantiate the general contention that certain B vitamins can help reduce fatigue and contribute to energ y metabolism. The Court also agrees with Dr. Bigelow that Living Essentials acted reasonably in undertaking clinical studies. The question, however, is not whether choosing to pay for clinical studies was reasonable or met the standard of care. The ques tion is whether the studies are adequate to support the ads' claims. Living Essentials also presented the expert testimony of J. Howard Beales, III, a professor of strategic management and public policy at George Washington University. Dr. Beales, the former Director of the Consumer Protection Division of the Federal Trade Commis sion, testified that none of the claims in Living Essentials' ads are all subjective, rather than objective, and thus are not deceptive. He opined that subjective claims cannot be supported by scientific evidence. The Court finds that Living Essentials' claims are not subjective. The company intentionally promoted the product's ingredients as changing the way the body functioned. It promoted the product as a healthy way to achi eve these physiological results. The company spent a significant amount of money on clinical studies to establish that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae was having a biochemical or physiological effect on the bodies of its consumers. As Dr. Beale admitted, if an advertiser claims that a product will change or affect the physiological functioning of the body, that is an objective claim for which scientific substantiation exist. This Court so finds. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 44 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 E. APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF LAW The Consumer Protection act prohibits companies like Living Essentials from engaging in \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\" RCW 19.86.020. The purpose of this act is to protect the public and foster fair and honest competition. RCW 19.86.920. The act is meant to be liberally construed to serve this purpose. Short v. Demopolis , Wn .2d 595, 602, 200 P.3d 695, 699 (2009). The Washington Attorney General may bring an enforcement action u nder the CPA. RCW 19.86.080. In this CPA enforcement action, the State must prove three elements: (1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice (2) committed by Living Essentials in trade or commerce (3) that has a public interest impact. State v. Kaiser , 161 Wn. App. 705, 719, 254 P.3d 850 (2011). The State is not required to prove that Living Essentials' unfair or deceptive advertisements injured consumers or that consumers relied on particular 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae ads when deciding whether to purchase or consume the dietary supplement. Id. A CPA claim also \"does not require a finding of an intent to deceive or defraud . Good faith on the part of the seller is immaterial to liability . Wine v. Theodoratus , 19 Wn. App. 700, 706, 577 P.2d 612 (1978). 1. Unfair or Deceptive Act or Practice Whether a party committed a particular act is an issue of fact. See Leingang v. Pierce County Med. Bur., Inc. 131 Wn.2d 133, 150, 930 P.2d 288 (1997). Whether a particular act is unfair or deceptive for purposes of the CPA - in other words, the determination of whether the CPA applies to a factual situation - is a question of law for the Court. See Panag v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Wash. , 166 Wn.2d 27, 47, 204 P.3d 885 (2009) (citing Leingang , 131 Wn.2d at 150). The CPA does not define \"unfair or deceptive act or practice.\" The Court has allowed the definition of unfair or deceptive to evolve through the \"gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion .\" Klem v. Washington Mut. Bank , 176 Wn.2d 771, 785, 295 P.3d 1179 (2013) (citing Saunders v. Lloyd's of London , 113 Wn.2d 330, 344, 779 P.2d 249, 256 (1989)). There is no limit to human MEMORANDUM DECISION - 45 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 inventiveness, so the courts and the legislature are left to define an unfair or deceptive act in order to fulfill the protective purposes of the CPA . Id. at 786. Washington state courts have concluded that there are several routes a court can take when determining if a company's conduct is unfair or deceptive. See Kl em, 176 Wn.2d at 787. Blatant, false misrepresentations that result in actual deception are obviously deceptive, although actual deception is not required, only the capacity to deceive. Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. v. Safeco Title Ins. Co. , 105 Wn.2d 778, 785, 719 P.2d 531 (1986). In addition, a truthful statement \"may be deceptive by virtue of the 'net impression' it conveys[.]\" Panag , 166 Wn.2d at 50 (citing FTC cases). 2. FTC Advertising Substantiation Requirement The CPA also provide s that courts can be guided in their determination of whether conduct is unfair or deceptive by federal court decisions and \"final orders of the federal trade commission interpreting the various federal statutes dealing with the same or similar matters\" as the CPA. RCW 19.86.920; CertainTeed Corp. v. Seattle Roof Brokers , -563 RAJ, 2010 WL 2640083, at *6 (W.D. Wash. June 28, 2010); Black , 100 Wn.2d 793, 799, 676 P.2d 963, 967 (1984) (\"When the Legislature enacted the Consumer Protection Act, it ant icipated that our courts would be guided by the interpretation given by federal courts to thei r corresponding federal statute s\"). The CPA was modeled after Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(1), which, like the CPA, includes a broad prohibition o n \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\" Hangman Ridge , 105 Wn.2d at 783. Washington courts have relied on cases interpreting Section 5 of the FTC Act when determining if certain conduct is unfair or deceptive. See, e.g., Panag , 166 Wn.2d at 49 -50. Under Section 5 of the FTC Act , to prove that an ad is deceptive, the FTC must establish (1) that an advertisement convey s a representation through either express or implied claims; (2) that the representation is likely to mislead consumers; and (3) that the m isleading representation is material. F.T.C. v. Direct Mktg Concepts, Inc. , 569 297 (D. Mass. 2008), aff'd, 624 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2010). Neither proof of consumer reliance nor consumer injury is necessary MEMORANDUM DECISION - 46 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 to establish a Section 5 violations. F.T.C. Freecom Inc., 401 F. Supp.2d at 297 -98. The Court will apply this te st to the Living Essential ads in this case. An advertisement's meaning is a question of fact. FTC v. Nat'l Urological Grp., Inc. , 645 aff'd, 356 Fed. Appx. 358 (11th Cir. 2009). The Court must look at the advertisem ent's overall, net impression, rather than the literal truth or falsity of the words of the ad. Id. Where implied claims are conspicuous and reasonably clear from the face of the advertisement, extrinsic evidence is not required to prove the existence of implied claims. U.S. v. Bayer Corp. , 2015 WL 5822595 , at *11 (D. N.J. Sept. 24, 2015). The Court can ascertain an advertisement 's meaning by examining the ad itself . F.T.C. v. U.S. Sales Corp. , 785 F. Supp. 737, 745 (N.D. Ill. 1992). Even an accurate communication can be deceptive if the \"net impression\" it conveys is deceptive. Panag , 166 Wn.2d at 50. Courts \"will often be able to determine meaning through an examination of the representation itself, including an evaluation of such factors as the en tire document, the juxtaposition of various phrases in the document, the nature of the claim, and the nature of the transaction.\" FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION , Policy Statement on Deception (1983), at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/policystmt/ad -decept.htm (last accessed October 7, 2016) . With respect to extrinsic evidence of the \"takeaway\" from an ad, consumer survey evidence or consumer testimony is not required. F.T.C. v. Medlab, Inc. , 615 F. Supp. 2d 1068, -78 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (citing cases and rejecting defendant's argument that consumer survey evidence or consumer testimony must be presented to support a finding as to the meaning of an ad). Extrinsic evidence can include expert testimony. FTC Policy Statement on Deception , n.8. In analyzing a representation, the FTC can prove that a representation is likely to mislead consumers by establishing either (1) actual falsity of express or implied claims (\"falsity\" theory); or (2) tha t the advertiser lacked a reasonable basis for asserting that the message was true (\"reasonable basis\" theory). F.T.C. v. 1088, 1096 (9th Cir.1994) (citing MEMORANDUM DECISION - 47 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 In the Matter of Thompson Med. Co., Inc. , 104 F.T.C. 648 (1984) ); F.T.C. v. LLC, 865 F.Supp.2d 1052, 1067 (C.D.Cal.2012). The FTC may prove the claims are literally false if all reasonable scientists would agree that the claims do not provide the benefits as asserted. Mullins v. Premier Nutrition Corp. , 2016 WL 1534784, at *16 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 15, 2016) (citing In re GNC Corp. , 789 F.3d 505, 515 (4th Cir.2015)). The FTC may do this by showing the advertiser's expert opinions are unreasonable or that no expert b elieves in the assertion. Id. at *17. The State has indicated that it is not proceeding on the actual falsity theory but is instead proceeding solely on the reasonable basis theory . Thus, the Court will not apply the \"all reasonable scientists\" standard to Living Essentials' substantiation evidence in this case. If an ad expressly states or impliedly suggests that a product successfully performs an advertised function or yields an advertised benefit, the advertiser must have a \"reasonable basis\" for the claim. F.T.C. , 2016 WL 4472994 , at *4 (D. Wyo. 2016) (citing In re Pfizer , Inc., 81 F.T.C. 23 (1972) ). Under the reasonable basis theory, the advertiser must have had some recognizable substantiation for the representation prior to making it an advertisement. John Beck Amazing Profits , LLC , 865 F.Supp.2d at 1067 . The advertiser has the burden of establishing what substantiation it relied on for a claim, and the State has burden of establishing that that substantiation is inadequate. F.T.C. v. Johnson , 96 F. Supp. 3d 1110, 1120 (D. Nev. 2015) . Where an advertiser lacks adequate substantiation evidence, they necessarily lack any reasonable basis for their claims and the ad is deceptive as a matter of law. Direct Mktg. Concepts, Inc. , 624 F.3d at 8. In determ ining whether an advertiser has satisfied the reasonable basis requirement, the Commission or court must first determine what level of substantiation the advertiser is required to have for his advertising claims. Then, the adjudicator must determine wheth er the advertiser possessed that level of substantiation.\" Pantron I Corp., 33 F.3d at 1096 ; John Beck Amazing Profits, LLC , 865 F. Supp.2d at 1067 . Under FTC guidance to advertisers of dietary supplements, claims about the efficacy of dietary supplements must be supported by \"competent a nd reliable scientific evidence,\" which the MEMORANDUM DECISION - 48 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 FTC defines as \"tests, analyses, research, studies or other evidence, based on the expertise of professionals in the relevant area, that have been conducted and evaluated in an ob jective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results. See FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION , Dietary Supplements: An Advertising Guide for Industry (last accessed October 7, 2016), at 9. The FTC lists a number of factors (known as the Pfizer factors) to considering the appropriate amount and type of substantiation: x The Type of Product . Generally, products related to consumer health or safety require a relatively high level of substantiation. x The Type of Claim . Claims that are difficult for consumers to assess on their own are held to a more exacting standard. Examples include health claims that may be subject to a placebo effect or technical claims that consumers cannot readily verify for themselves. x The Benefits of Truthful Claims and The Cost/Feasibility of Developing Substantiation for the Claim. These factors are often weighed together to ensure the valuable product information is not withheld from consumers because the cost of developing substantiation is prohibitive. This does not mean, however, that an advertiser can make any claim it wishes without substantiation, simply because the cost of research is too high. x The Consequences of a False Claim. This includes physical injury, for example, if a consumer relies on an unsubstantiated clai m about the therapeutic benefit of a product and forego es a proven treatment. Economic injury is also considered. x The Amount of Substantiation that Experts in the Field Believe is Reasonable. In making this determination, the FTC gives great weight to accepted norms in the relevant fields of research .... Whe re there is an existing standard for substantiation developed by a government agency or other authoritative body, the FTC accords great deference to that standard. Id. at 8-9. A guiding principle for determining the amount and type of evidence needed is what experts in the relevant area of study would consider to be adequate. Id. at 10. The FTC will look at the amount and type of substantiation. For example, the most reliable evidence comes from well-controlled human clinical trials. Id. It will look at the quality of the evidence by examining the validity of the methodology used in any clinical trials. Id. at 12. The FTC cautions advertisers not to rely on the fact that a study was published as proof of scientific reliability without assessing MEMORANDUM DECISION - 49 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 the quality of the research. Id. The FTC also requires that advertisers of dietary supplements consider the totality of the scientific evidence and not cherry pick the studies that support their claims and ignore conflicting study results. Finally, the studies on which an advertiser is relying must be relevant to the claims being made in ads : Therefore, advertisers should ask questions such as: How does the dosage and formulation o f the advertised product compare to what was used in the study? Does the advertised product contain additional ingredients that might alter the effect of the ingredients in the study? Is the advertised product administered in the same manner as the ingred ient used in the study? Does the study population reflect the characteristics and lifestyle of the population targeted by the ad? If there are significant discrepancies between the research conditions and the real life use being promoted, advertisers need to evaluate whether it is appropriate to extrapolate from the research to the claimed effect.\" Id. at 16. \"Claims that do not match the science, no matter how sound that science is, are likely to be unsubstantiated.\" Id. 3.

F.T.C. v. Figgie Int'l, Inc. , 994 F.2d 595, 605 (9th Cir. 1993). MEMORANDUM DECISION - 50 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 F. ANALYSIS 1. Living Essentials' Vitamin C laims are not deceptive. Living Essentials' claims that that B vitamins promote energy and amino acids promote alertness and focus are not deceptive. Nutritional science supports the general proposition that the vitamins and nutrients in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae are physiologica lly beneficial , even to healthy, well - nourished adults . They support metabolism which affects energy. They can help reduce fatigue. They can help increase blood flow to the brain and support the generation of neurotransmitters, which can affect alertnes s and focus . Dr. Kennedy's testimony regarding the general health benefits of B vitamins, choline, taurine, and L-tyrosine, was compelling and credible. Dr. Sanford Bigelow testified credibly that the dosages found in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae are sufficient in qua ntity to provide the claimed benefits . There is adequate scientific substantiation predating July 2012 to support Living Essentials' claim that the vitamins and nutrients in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae help promote energy, alertness and focus . For this reason, the Co urt finds that the State has not established that Living Essentials ' Vitamins Claims violated the CPA. 2. Living Essentials ' Superior to Coffee Claim s are deceptive. Living Essentials , however, claim s that the B vitamins and amino acids do not just promote energy, alertness and focus . Living Essentials also claim s that these vitamins and amino acids work synergistically with caffeine (or interacts with caffeine) to enhance the duration of the energy, alertness and focus derived from caffeine.7 This is the takeaway of the Superior to Coffee Claim s. Living Essentials advertised that the combination of caffeine, B vitamins and amino acids would provide energy that would last longer than consumers would experience from a cup of premium coffee (and in some of t he ads, longer than 3 or 4 cups of coffee). 7 Although some of the studies suggest that caffeine does not improve episodic memory, and that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae provides some improvement in this area, none of Living Essentials' ads claim such a benefit from the product. Carl Sperber testified that he was not even aware of what \"episodic memory\" was. He c ertainly did not use these words in any Living Essential ads. These studies are thus irrelevant to the Court's analysis. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 51 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 While the Court finds competent and reliable scientific evidence that caffeine in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae is probably interacting with its B vitamins, taurine, glucuronolactone, and other non - caffeine ingredients, the Cou rt cannot find that this evidence supports the specific benefit Living Essentials is claiming. Dr. Kennedy's summary of the scientific literature does show some different physiological results from caffeine plus vitamins or caffeine plus amino acids, but the results are not the benefits touted by Living Essentials. The Giles study, for example, actually supports the proposition that taurine counteracts the caffeine, rather than enhancing its effects. The studies do not clearly establish that 5-Hour ENERG Y\u00ae's vitamins and nutrients work synergistically with caffeine to make these benefits last longer than they would last with caffeine alone. As set out in the FTC dietary supplement guidelines, the substantiation must be relevant to the claimed benefits. None of the studies Living Essentials submitted to the Court support the claim that combining specific B vitamins , taurine, choline, glucuronolactone and tyrosine with caffeine will cause the energy, alertness and focus effects of caffeine to last longer t han if the caffeine were consumed alone . Neither Glade nor NERAC examined this issue. The only corporate representative to testify regarding the substanti ation Living Essentials relied o n when airing its ads was Carl Sperber. Sperber cited the Medicus S tudy as the only substantiation he was aware of, other than his own Internet research . But the Medicus study had no separate caffeine arm against which to compare 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae . At trial, Living Essentials presented several studies on which it now relies to substantiate its Superior to Coffee C laims. Living Essentials points to t he 2013 Nagrecha Study , the 2015 Molnar Study and the 2015 Paulus Study. The Court has reviewed each study presented and the testimony of the experts regarding these studies and finds none that are sufficiently relevant to substantiate the Superior to Coffee Claim s. The Nagrecha study has limited relevance because its test subjects underwent only one round of testing 40 minutes after ingesting the caffeine/choline MEMORANDUM DECISION - 52 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 drink. There is no data in the Nagrecha study to indicate that adding choline to a caffeinated drink extend s the benefits of caffeine past that 40 minute mark. The 2015 Paulus study compared 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae to a Starbucks DoubleShot and to caffeine by itself. In his te sts, Paulus found that the 5 -Hour ENERGY group outperformed the other two groups. But the Court finds the methodological problems, specifically the lack of blinding of the participants and lack of other controls , to be significant enough to render the Pau lus Study results unreliable. The 2015 Molnar Study come s the closest. Molnar found a significant improvement in endothelial function (blood flow) 1 \u00bd and 4 hours after the subjects consumed 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae and Red Bull, and no similar improvement in endot helial function was seen for those ingesting NOS or coffee. Dr. Blonz testified that the Molnar study was not relevant to the claims Living Essentials was making in the ads because Molnar did not test cognitive functioning to evaluate energy, alertness and focus . Molnar was merely looking at endothelial function as a proxy for coronary function. Dr. Kennedy disagreed and testifie d that endothelial function is a measure of how well the body is delivering blood on demand to the brain. In Dr. Kennedy's o pinion, t he more blood delivered to the brain, the better the cognitive functio ning. But the Bloomer study concluded that neither caffeine nor 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae resulted in an improvement in subjective feelings of energy or mood or in objective cognitive per formance, seeming to undercut the reasonability of relying on Molnar as substantiation for Living Essentials' claims. Ultimately, the question the Court confronts is whether the Molnar study, by itself, suffices to substantiate the efficacy claims Living E ssentials made in ads years befo re the study was published and whether it now suffices to justify these claims . Dr. Beales opined that very little substantiation should be required because \"there is not very much at stake for consumers\" under the factors set out in Pfizer, Inc. , 81 F.T.C. 23, 62 (1972). The Court rejects this opinion. Because the Court finds that Living Essentials' ads relate to consumer health, the Court concludes that the MEMORANDUM DECISION - 53 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 better approach is that set out in the FTC dietary supplement gu idelines: \"Generally, products related to consumer health or safety require a relatively high level of substantiation.\" After careful consideration, the Court finds that Living Essentials lacked adequate competent and reliable scientific evidence to make t he Superior to Coffee Claim . First, Dr. Kennedy admitted that there is no study that has looked at the effects of the combination of ingredients in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae on energy, alertness and focus as compared to caffeine. He also conceded that there is no e vidence that the addition of multivitamins, taurine, or glucuronolactone to a caffeinated energy drink will cause greater improvement in physical and cognitive performance that can be attributed to the effects of caffeine alone. As he testified, \"At this stage, we don't know which of the other micronutrients [or] the other bioactives [] interact with caffeine.\" He opined that a number of different non -caffeine ingredients in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae could be interacting to extend one's energy, alertness and focus , but t here are studies that support this hypothesis and there are studies that undermine it. Second, caffeine may not improve endothelial function for as long as 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae does. It does not necessarily follow, however, that caffeine's impact on cognit ive performance ends when its impact on endothelial function ends . Dr. McLellan testified that caffeine can cross the blood/brain barrier and, because of its half -life, remains in and affects cognitive performance for a significant period of time. L iving Essentials is claiming that 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae works better than caffeine alone in sustaining energy, alertness and focus over several hours . This claim is certainly plausible, given the science presented to the Court, but it remains a hypothesis , not a n established scientific fact. The Court finds that the Superior to Coffee claims were express claims and are thus material under the CPA. The ads expressly state that people who drink 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae will experience hours of energy, alertness and focus because the vitamins and nutrients extend the effects of caffeine. There is insufficient scientific evidence to support this express health -related claim. The Superior to Coffee Claims are thus materially misleading. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 54 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 For these reasons, Living Essentials violate d the CPA when it aired or disseminated ads that expressly or impliedly stated that the energy, alertness and focus derived from 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae will be greater than or last longer than any similar physiological benefits derived from coffee. 3. The Decaf ads are deceptive . The Court finds that Living Essentials lacks competent and reliable scientific evidence to claim that Decaf 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae will generate energy and alertness that \"lasts for hours. \"8 Dr. Bigelow testified that Living Essentials acted reasona bly in relying on the 2010 Glade Report and the 2007 NERAC Report to substantiate this decaf claim . The Court does not find this testimony credible. Dr. Glade relied on taurine studies that demonstrated that daily dietary supplementation of taurine in 30 00 mg or more increased metabolizable energy that could last for at least four hours. Decaf 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae contains only 483 mg of taurine. The FTC guidelines on dietary supplements specifically cautions advertisers from relying on studies the conclusion s of which are based on very different dosages. Such is the case here with the taurine studies on which Dr. Glade relied. Dr. Glade also cited studies for the proposition that the daily intake of between 6 mcg and 5000 mcg of B 12 support s the production of energy within 2 hours of consumption and for 12 to 24 hours after consumption. Dr. Kennedy testified that the 2015 Shah Study demonstrated that both caffeinated and decaffeinated energy drinks \"significantly\" boosted energy level one h our after consumption. But the chart on which Dr. Kennedy relies (Ex. 2254, slide 65) actually shows that the decaf energy level test results at the 3 hour mark were not statistically significant. And the 2013 Kurtz study also found that consumers drinkin g Decaf 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae experienced no energy benefits from the ingredients in the drink. 8 The Court dismissed the State's challenge to representations in Exhibit 641 as non -actionable on Living Essentials' CR 41(b)(3) moti on. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 55 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 While there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to support a claim that the Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae shot may provide a short -term benefit in terms of energy, th e science is insufficient to substantiate the claim that this benefit will endure over a five hour period. For this reason, the Court finds the Decaf Claims to be materially misleading and a violation of the CPA. 4. The \"No Crash\" ads are not deceptive . The S tate contends that Living Essentials claims that consumers will experience no sugar or caffeine crash after drinking 5 -Hour ENERGY. The main problem with the State's allegation is that there appears to be no accepted meaning of the word \"crash\" when appli ed to energy drinks. Dr. Pratkanis testified that the phrase \"crash feeling\" is left open to the consumer to interpret any way they feel in their experience. Dr. Blonz interpret ed the term \"crash\" as a non -scientific term dealing with caffeine withdrawal effects. By 2007, Living Essentials began to use t he phrase \"no crash\" to mean \"no sugar crash,\" or the absence of the sudden feeling a consumer may experience following ingestion of sugar (which 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae does not contain). Because there is no sugar in 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae, a person will not experience a \"crash\" relating to a drop in glucose levels after consuming the 5 - hour ENERGY\u00ae products. Each of Living Essentials' ads referencing \"crash\" after July 17, 2012 contained an asterisk directing consumers to a statement that \"no crash means no sugar crash,\" or contained only the language \"no sugar crash.\" The Court rejects Dr. Blonz's theory that the term \"crash\" in the 5 -hour ENERGY\u00ae advertisements r efers to feelings of fatigue or tiredness that a person who is habituated to caffeine may experience after not having had caffeine for a certain period. There is no empirical evidence for the existence of a caffeine -related crash. Habituation does not de velop after a single ingestion of caffeine, and a caffeine -related \"crash\" is physiologically implausible because of caffeine's half-life. Dr. Blonz cited no studies showing evidence of a \"caffeine crash.\" MEMORANDUM DECISION - 56 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 The State has failed to establish that Living E ssentials' \"no crash\" claims are misleading or deceptive under the CPA. 5. The Ask Your Doctor Ads were deceptive under the CPA. The Court finds that the net impression from the AYD ads was that a substantial majority of doctors believe 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae is a sa fe and effective nutritional supplement that they would recommend to their patients. While the statistics displayed in the ads and the words used in the ad were literally true, the impression left by the ads was not. Dr. Anthony Pratkanis, an expert in t he science of consumer behavior and persuasion tactics, testified credibly that the clear takeaway from these ads was that \"doctors would recommend\" 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae . The Court agrees. First, Sperber testified that when he developed the script, he wanted to allay consumers' concerns about the safety or nutritional value of 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae by indicating that doctors would recommend the product. Neither of the surveys (Ex. 436; Ex. 627) asked physicians if they thought 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae was healthy or safe. Inst ead, the doctors were informed that 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae low fat, low calorie, low sodium, sugar -free drink. The survey then asked if the physicians would recommend 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae for healthy patients who already use energy supplements: Dr. Pratkanis testified that the survey questions were biased , leading , and designed to elicit a limited response. Due to the phrasing of the questions that preceded this question, a \"no\" response to this question suggested that the responding doctor would instead rec ommend a high fat, high calorie, or high sodium energy supplement, rather than allowing doctors the option of saying they do not recommend energy supplements at all. It is thus not surprising that 47 percent MEMORANDUM DECISION - 57 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 of the doctors responding to the online survey responded in the affirmative, and 74 percent of the doctors responding to the paper survey responded in the affirmative. Second, the statistics Living Essentials presented in the ads (\"over 73%\") were the results of the online survey of 503 doctors, but th e reference to \"3,000 doctors\" was a combination of both surveys. Although the statistics in the AYD ads were technically an accurate depiction of the online survey, the statistics presented in the ad were only accurate for responses from 503 doctors, not for responses from 3,000 doctors, as the ads state. The Court finds credible Dr. Pratkanis's testimony that the survey methods used for the online survey and the paper survey differed so dramatically that the surveys could not reasonably be combined and represented as the same survey. The 2,600 doctors who participated in the paper survey were not randomly selected. They were specifically chosen by sales representatives making sales calls on doctors' offices. Yet, the company presented the statistics i n a way that would lead a reasonable viewer to believe that 73% of 3,000 doctors surveyed would recommend this product to their patients. Living Essentials argues that even if the ads were not accurate, they were not materially misleading. They presented Dr. Christopher Stomberg, an expert on econometrics (the application of statistics to economic questions) who testified that the online survey statistic results contained in the AYD ads were accurate and representative of the opinions of primary care docto rs across the United States. Living Essentials argues that because the survey results were representative of what 3,000 randomly selected primary care doctors would have said had they been surveyed in a scientifically valid manner, the ads cannot be found to be misleading in any material way. G. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW Based on the analysis set out above, the Court concludes the following: 1. The State failed to prove that Living Essentials violate d the Consumer Protection Act when it aired or published ads that indicated that the non -caffeine ingredients in 5 -Hour ENERGY\u00ae promote energy, alertness and focus. MEMORANDUM DECISION - 58 KING COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 516 Third Avenue, C-203 Seattle, WA 98104 (206) 477-1537 2. Living Essentials violate d the Consumer Protection Act when it aired or published ads that represented that the energy, alertness and focus from 5 -Hour ENERG Y\u00ae lasts longer than a cup of coffee because of the synergistic or interactive effects of caffeine, B vitamins and nutrients in the product. 3. Living Essentials violate d the Consumer Protection Act when claimed in a press release and on its web site that Dec af 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae will provide energy, alertness and focus that lasts for hours. 4. The State failed to prove that Living Essentials violated the Consumer Protection Act when it aired or published its \"no crash\" ads. 5. Living Essentials violated the Consumer Pr otection Act when it aired the Ask Your Doctor ads.
