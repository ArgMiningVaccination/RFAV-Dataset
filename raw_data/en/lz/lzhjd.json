HISTORY OF NUTMEG ESSENTIAL OIL The word 'Nutmeg' originates from the Latin nux and muscada (translating to 'musky nut'). Although a commonplace spice now found in the kitchens of practically every home, it boasts a long, deadly, and fascinating history. The Nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans) originates from the secluded Banda Islands of Indonesia. The Arabs are thought to be the first to chance upon the obscure spice, and, in an attempt to hide its location, began to narrate stories and legends about its roots. Nutmeg later entered European trading, and only the well-off could afford to spend lavishly to experience its earthy, spicy-sweet taste and scent. Then, when medieval doctors claimed that it could be the only antidote to the Black Death pandemic, prices for the already-expensive spice soared exorbitantly. The battle over Nutmeg only intensified in the 1600s, when the Dutch began the infamous 'Nutmeg Wars' on the soils of the Banda Islands, only ending after the English invaded the region and successfully re-distributed the seeds towards East Asia. Back then, Nutmeg, along with its essential oil, was regarded as something of a mystical spice; it was believed to possess aphrodisiac and hypnotic powers as well as bring good fortune to those who used it. In China, India, and the Middle East, it was used to induce sexual arousal, revive marriages, and help with fertility. Due to its primary constituent, Myristicin, many claimed that ingesting Nutmeg could also induce hallucinations, euphoria, and paranoia. Nutmeg essential oil has also been heavily featured in traditional medicine and practices across various cultures for generations. In Ancient China, for example, it was thought to be an important remedy against liver and abdominal problems, and Indian Ayurvedic practitioners frequently used it to address symptoms of fever as well as alleviate pain, coughing, flatulence, and menstrual problems. In addition, Ancient Egyptians saw Nutmeg essential oil as a precious preservative component forming part of the embalming and mummification process. CULTIVATING AND EXTRACTING QUALITY NUTMEG ESSENTIAL OIL Nutmeg essential oil is sourced from the dried seeds of the Nutmeg tree (Myristica fragrans), which garners roughly 10-15% of volatile oil. The height of Myristica fragrans can range from about 5-20 meters (16-66 feet). One intriguing feature of this evergreen tree is that it is also dioecious, meaning a single plant will bear its fragrant flowers limited to only one sex. Only about 7% of the world's plant species operate sexually in this way. Myristica fragrans is native to the exotic Spice Islands or Maluku of Indonesia, though it now also grown in India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, China, and the Caribbean region, amongst other countries. The ideal growing conditions include warmer temperatures (20 - 30\u00b0C), a lively humid climate, and plenty of rainfall (200 - 350 cm). An elevation up to about 900 meters (3000 feet), along with soils of clay or sandy loam are also particularly well-suited for its cultivation. An initial harvest of Nutmeg can only occur after about seven years of planting, after which the tree begins to bear fruit all year round. Its full harvesting capacity is maximized only after 10-20 years. The round, yellow Nutmeg fruits are roughly the size of peaches, and when ripe, they burst open to reveal the hefty, shiny Nutmeg seed and its characteristic red aril - a viney, soft, mesh-like covering that loops its way around the seed. This aril is popularly known as 'Mace', and is also used to spice foods all over the world. Following the harvest period, the outer aril is removed and the seeds are typically left to dry out in the sun for one or two months, before the kernels are isolated and steam distilled. This produces a volatile oil that is thin and colorless (or light-yellowish) that exudes a soft-spicy scent with a unique Nutmeg undertone that is slightly heavy and musky. NUTMEG ESSENTIAL OIL BENEFITS & COMPOSITION Nutmeg essential oil has a long reputation as being helpful for a variety of physical and psychological conditions, and is thought to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, carminative, energizing, cleansing, and pain-relieving properties.
