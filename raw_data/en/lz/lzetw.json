Professor Ian Frazer, from the [University of Queensland](http://www.uq.edu.au) in Brisbane, received the award at a ceremony held tonight at Parliament House, Canberra. \"I'm elated at the fact that I've been selected,\" says Frazer. \"It's great recognition for my team and the work they have done.\" For the past two decades, Frazer and colleagues have been examining the role of the human papilloma virus (HPV) in the development of cervical cancer. His work led to the development of two vaccines to prevent the onset of cervical cancer and another two vaccines, currently undergoing clinical trials, designed to treat women who have already been infected. Frazer says his interest in HPV stems from work in the early 1980s examining hepatitis B infections among homosexual men, while based at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne. \"I observed that they had trouble getting rid of genital warts,\" he says. \"That led to me to think about the virus that caused them, because we knew nothing about it and neither did the literature.\" Frazer was alerted to some research by Harald zur Hausen - one of this year's Nobel Prize winners for medicine - who believed that HPV might cause cervical cancer. Frazer's own research confirmed the link. \"The really exciting thing from my point of view was that we could see a paper in it, we could see that it might lead to our future employment,\" he says. \"But we could see that potentially there might be some useful benefit.\" In 2006, the HPV vaccine was approved for use and several months later the Australian government announced the funding of a national HPV vaccination program, which has now been received by 80% of Australian secondary schoolgirls. Frazer says the next challenge is to bring the vaccine to the people who need it most-women in developing countries. Frazer and his colleagues are working to establish vaccination programs in Vanuatu and Nepal. \"The job's not done until we can protect the millions of women at risk from cervical cancer,\" he says. \"I want to see universal vaccination of kids worldwide with this vaccine.\" Frazer says he will use his A$300,000 prize money to further research at the university and to encourage wealthy Australians to support scientific research. \"A lot of mums and dads give money for biomedical research in Australia ... I want to see those who are in position to give substantial amounts,\" says Frazer. Other winners Dr Carola Vinuesa of the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the [Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au/) is the winner of the Science Minister's Prize for Life Scientist of the Year, for her research into the genetic cause of autoimmune diseases. Vinuesa and colleagues identified a gene called roquin that is a critical represser of diseases such as juvenile diabetes and lupis. \"When roquin is mutated - that is a single one letter within the three billion letters of the genome is changed - the immune system turns on itself, developing antibodies that attack our own organs and tissue,\" she says. According to Vinuesa, the discovery is now opening up new targets for drug discovery to fight autoimmune disease. \"We're identifying single targets that are responsible for the disease,\" says Vinuesa. \"This increased specificity will probably result in more effective treatments.\" The Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year was awarded to Professor Tanya Monro of the [University of Adelaide](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/) for her work on new applications for optical fibres. \"We're trying to push the science of optical fibres so we can let them move beyond their traditional role in telecommunications,\" says Monro. Some of the applications Monro says her team is working on include biomedical analysis, water-quality monitoring and sensors for measuring structural fatigue. \"For example, a little optical fibre could take a small sample of blood or mucus, and travel up into holes in the fibre that contain antibodies. Light enters the fibre from the other end, interacts with the fluid and that light signal can tell you whether or not a particular molecule is there,\" says Monro. The Excellence in Science Teaching categories were awarded to Bronwyn Mart of Magill Primary School in Adelaide and Clay Reid of Clare High School, South Australia. "}
