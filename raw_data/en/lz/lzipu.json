Roin May 1, 2008 The role of the patent system in promoti ng pharmaceutical innovation is widely seen as a tremendous success story. This view overlooks a serious shortcoming in the drug patent system: the standards by which drugs are deemed unpatentable under the novelty and non-obviousness requirement bear little relationship to the social va lue of those drugs or the need for a patent to motivate their development. If the idea for a drug is not novel or is obvious, perhaps because it was disclosed in an earlier publication or made to look obvious by recent scientific advances, then it cannot be patented. Yet the mere idea for a dr ug alone is generally of little value to the public. Without clinical trials proving the drug's safety and efficacy, a prerequisite for FDA approval and acceptance by the medical community, it is unlikely to benefit the public. Given the immense investment needed to fund clinical trials on dr ugs, and the ability of generic manufacturers to rely on those tests to secure regulatory approval fo r their own products, pharmaceutical companies are rarely willing to develop a drug without pate nt protection. The novelty and non-obviousness requirements make no concession for the developm ent costs of inventions, and thus withhold patents from drugs that are unlikely to reach the public without that protection. This gap in the patent system for drugs has created a pervasive problem in the pharmaceutical industry, causing firms to regularly screen through their drugs in R&D and discard ones with weak patent protection. The potential harm to the public from the loss of these drugs is likely significant. Congress can easily avoid this problem by ensuring that the successful completion of the FDA's rigorous clinical trial process is rewarded with a lengthy exclusivity period enforced by the FDA.

For this reason, pharmaceutical innovation is thought to be the pa tent system's greatest success story. Amidst this general optimism about the effectiveness of patents in promoting pharmaceutical innovation, scholars have overl ooked a critical flaw in the system: socially valuable drugs often cannot be pa tented even though they are unlikely to be developed for public use without th at protection. If the idea fo r a drug is not novel or is 1 See JAMES BESSEN & MICHAEL J. MEURER , PATENT FAILURE : HOW JUDGES , BUREAUCRATS , AND LAWYERS PUT INNOVATION AT RISK 88-89 (2008); A DAM B.

Yet the mere idea for a drug alone is generally of little value to the public. Without clinical trials proving the drug's safety and efficacy, a prerequisite for Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approval and acceptance by the medical community, it is unlikely to benefit the public. Given the immense investment needed to fund c linical trials on drugs, and the ability of generic manufacturers to rely on those tests to secure regula tory approval for their own products, pharmaceutical companies are rarely willing to develop a drug without patent protection. The novelty and non-obviousness re quirements make no concession for the development costs of inventions, and thus w ithhold patents from drugs that are unlikely to reach the public without such protection. Th is gap in the patent system for drugs has created a pervasive problem in the pharmaceu tical industry, causing firms to regularly screen through their drugs in R&D and discard ones with weak patent protection. The potential harm to the public from the lo ss of these drugs may be enormous. Part I of the article describes how th e public currently de pends on patents to promote pharmaceutical innovation, and benefits from the system through the introduction of new drugs. At a time when many scholars believe that patents often do more harm than good,2 the pharmaceutical industry is widely thought to showcase the benefits of patents.3 Pharmaceutical companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on clinical trials to satisfy the FDA's safety and efficacy standards, while generic drugs are exempted from those requirements and enter th e market at minimal cost. Without some 2 See, e.g. , BESSEN & MEURER , supra note 1, at 14-16; F ED. TRADE COMM 'N, TO PROMOTE INNOVATION : THE PROPER BALANCE OF COMPETITION AND PATENT LAW AND POLICY ch. 3, at 30, 34-41, 44, 50-55 (2003); N AT'L RESEARCH COUNCIL OF THE NAT'L ACADS ., A PATENT SYSTEM FOR THE 21ST CENTURY 35- 38 (Stephen A. Merrill et al. eds., 2004). 3 See FED. TRADE COMM 'N, supra note 2, ch. 3, at 14. 3way to postpone competition from generics, pharmaceutical companies could not recoup their R&D costs. Under the protection of a pa tent, firms are able to delay generic entry for 10 to 14 years on average, providing time to profit from their R&D efforts. The promise of that reward spurs private indu stry to invest billions of dollars in pharmaceutical R&D each year, and those investments have yielded immense social returns in the form of valuable new medical treatments. The public pays a price for this progress, since patented drugs typically cost substantiall y more than generics, and consumers suffer from those high prices for the duration of the patent term. Without patents, however, the large majority of dr ugs likely would not be developed, and the health gains they produce mi ght never be realized. Part II identifies a previous ly unrecognized and serious defect in the patent system for pharmaceuticals: put simply, not all drugs ar e patentable, and there is little reason to believe that the drugs denied protection are any less valuable than patentable drugs. The theoretical point underlying this observation is straightforward. Whenever the costs of developing and commercializing an invention are both substan tial and vulnerable to free- riding, as is the case with most drugs, patent s can be essential for promoting those post- invention efforts. Under the novelty and non-obviousness requir ements, however, patents are denied to inventions when the idea for them is not new or is obvious, regardless of whether a patent is needed for their development. Those doctrines can therefore prevent valuable inventions from reaching the public. To this author's knowledge, this article is the first to recogn ize that the novelty requirement can deter innovation when development and commercializa tion costs are high. With respect to the non-obviousness requirement, other scholars have noted the potential for such a problem, 4but it has received little attention in the literature, and its implications for the pharmaceutical industry have been largely overlooked. Section A of Part II analyzes the novelty requirement for pharmaceuticals, demonstrating how it frequently interferes with the patenting of potentially valuable drugs. In the pharmaceutical industry, merely disclosing the idea for a drug can prevent it from later being patented. Although resear chers generally try to patent the new drugs they discover, current law allows seemingly insignificant disclosures to undermine the novelty of drugs, which makes it easy for re searchers to unwittingly disclose their discoveries. In university laboratories, the pr essure to publish often leads researchers to disclose new drugs prematurely. Private industry may be an even worse culprit, with companies regularly filing overly-broad patent applications to establish priority over large numbers of potential new drugs. As their research advances, the companies typically disclaim most of those compounds from their applications, leaving only the prior disclosure of the drugs. Practices such as these have created a significant body of potentially valuable drugs that cannot be patented. Section B of Part II examines the non-obviousness requirement's effect as an impediment to drug patenting. Much like the novelty requirem ent, it denies patents to drugs before they have been developed and made available to the public. Its consequences are likely more perverse than those of the novelty st andard, however, since \"obvious\" drugs are defined as ones that would have been reas onably expected to succeed at the time of their invention. U nder the non-obviousness test, therefore, the drugs that initially look most likely to be effective are often the least likely to be patentable. The non-obviousness standard also ha s the ironic effect of turning progress in 5the pharmaceutical sciences against itself, sinc e it withholds patent protection from drugs based on the scientific advances that allowed researchers to identify them as ones that are likely to be effective. These counterintui tive policies embodied in the non-obviousness standard can have a significan t effect on the ability of fi rms to patent promising new drugs. Part III argues that the novelty and non-obviousness requirements are not just a potential threat to pharmaceutical innovation; they are actually costing the public access to valuable drugs. Since pharmaceutical compan ies rely on the patent system to recoup their R&D investments, they regularly screen their drug candidates during development to discard ones that appear unpatentable. In fact, the comp anies use redundant reviews to catch these drugs, screen ing through their products at le ast three separate times before clinical trials, and frequently abandon promising drug candidates on account of perceived weaknesses in their patent protection. It is impossible to know how many of these abandoned drugs would have proven socially valuable, given the early stage at which they are dropped from development. Neve rtheless, the frequency with which this phenomenon occurs suggests that the inju ry to the public is substantial. Part IV explores various policies that Congress could adopt to encourage the development of unpatentable drugs, and ul timately recommends that newly-developed drugs be guaranteed protection from generi c competitors through the FDA, receiving an automatic period of market exclusivity after successfully completing clinical trials. Other possible strategies discussed are reforming the patent laws to ensure that drugs remain patentable until they are developed, and usi ng the government to fund the development of unpatentable drugs. Those approaches both ha ve significant drawbacks, however, since 6the patent reforms might open the door to a busive patenting strate gies, and a government- funded development program would be incredib ly difficult to implement successfully at present. FDA-administered periods of exclus ivity provide a much more sensible solution to the problem of unpatentable drugs. Unlike patent reforms, they link the reward of exclusivity to the need for that protection, si nce the exclusivity is given in exchange for successfully completing the FDA's clinical-tri al requirements, and those requirements are themselves what make the reward of exclusivity necessary. Moreover, unlike a government-run drug-development program, Congress could easily implement the proposed FDA-administered exclusivity period s, since current law already provides for certain short delays in the approval process for generics. While those existing regulatory delay periods are rarely long enough to motiv ate the development of an unpatentable drug, Congress could simply lengthen them to correct this problem. I. BACKGROUND : PATENTS AND PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION Pharmaceutical innovation is of ten seen as the golden ch ild of the patent system, with patents taking credit for the discovery and development of valuable new drugs that provide tremendous health benefits to the public. 4 The purpose of the patent system is to encourage socially valuable investments in R&D that firms would not otherwise make due to the profit-eroding effects of comp etition. In the pharmaceutical industry, firms must invest hundreds of millions of dollars in cl inical trials on their drugs before they can be sold to the public, while their generic riva ls are exempted from those requirements and can enter the market at low cost. Without some way to delay generic competition, 4 See, e.g. , Rebecca S. Eisenberg, The Problem of New Uses , 5 Y ALE J. HEALTH POL'Y, L. & ETHICS 717, 720-21 (2005). 7therefore, pharmaceutical companies would usually find it impossible to recoup their R&D investments, and would likely invest th eir money elsewhere. With strong patent protection, however, firms can expect to enjoy a lengthy monopoly over their drug, providing them an opportunity to profit from their investment in R&D. Although the public suffers from high prices for drugs whil e they are covered by a patent, most of those drugs probably would not have been deve loped without that protection. As a result, it is widely thought that the benefits of drug patents far outweigh their costs. The economic function of the patent system is to promote the creation, development and commercialization of inventions.5 Successful innovation can be of great value to society,6 but it often requires signi ficant investments in R&D.7 The public relies on private industry to pr ovide most of that investment,8 and unless firms expect to profit from their R&D efforts, they are likel y to spend their money on something else. Appropriating the returns from an R&D investment can be difficult in a competitive market, since other firms may be able to im itate successful inventions without incurring the same costs and risks.9 The resulting price competition can undermine the original inventors' profits as competitors \"free-ride\" off of their efforts. The patent system is an attempt to preserve the incentive to invest in R&D that would otherwise be vulnerable to free-riding by awarding inventor s temporary exclusive rights to make, use and sell their inventions, thereby protecting them from the profit-eroding effects of competition.10 5 See Kenneth W. Dam, The Economic Underpinnings of Patent Law , 23 J. LEGAL STUD. 247, 247-48 (1994). 6 See Charles I. Jones & John C. Williams, Measuring the Social Return to R&D , 113 Q UARTERLY J.

Mitchell Polinsky & Steven Shavell eds. 2007); S TEVEN SHAVELL , FOUNDATIONS OF 8 Although patent-law scholars typically focus on the role of patents in promoting inventive activity,11 patents can be equally important in encouraging investment in the subsequent development and comm ercialization of inventions.12 The idea for an invention is usually of little value to the public until it has be en turned into a marketable product,13 and the process of doing so can be both risky and expensive. Indeed, the cost and risk of bringing an invention to market is often much greater than that faced during the initial research that ga ve rise to the invention.14 If competitors can produce and sell copies of the invention while avoiding its de velopment and commercialization costs, then there may be little or no incentive for firms to ever bring that invention to market. Under these circumstances, a patent can be essential for the investme nt that enables the practical use of an invention - a fact known to economists for at least 100 years.15 Even when ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW 138 (2004). It is worth noting that the patent system is just one of many ways to correct for the otherwise inadequate incen tives for R&D that sometimes exist in a competitive market.

Kitch, The Nature and Function of the Patent System , 20 J.L. & ECON. 265, 276-77 (1977). 15 See id. The traditional economic justification for patents likely always encompassed the promotion of development and commercialization efforts in addition to inventive activity. See F.M. SCHERER , INDUSTRIAL MARKET STRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 440-41 (2d ed., F.M. Scherer ed. 1980). The idea that patents encourage po st-invention efforts is now often associated with Edmund Kitch's \"prospect\" theory of patents. See, e.g. , Lemley, supra note 11; John F. Duffy, Rethinking the Prospect Theory of Patents , 71 U. CHI. L. REV. 439, 439-40 (2004). In his seminal 1977 article, The Nature and Function of the Patent System , Kitch argued that the patent system benefits society not just by promoting R&D investments, but also by enabling patent holders to coordinate post-invention investments efficiently, and thus avoiding wasteful or duplicative R&D. See Kitch, supra note 14. Much of Kitch's observation about patents assumes efficient licensing, see Menell & Scotchmer, supra note 10, at 1501-03, and his 9patents are unnecessary for motiv ating the creation of an inve ntion, therefore, they can still be critical for encour aging the subsequent investme nt in its development. Of course, not all inventions need a patent to incent their development and commercialization.16 In many cases the costs and risk s of getting an invention to market are relatively small, and the i nherent lead-time advantage th at the inventors will enjoy over competitors is sufficient for them to recoup their R&D investments.17 In other cases patents are unnecessary for motivating po st-invention spending because those investments are not vulnerable to free-riding. For example, a firm might be willing to build an expensive new manufacturing plant to produce an unpatented invention because competitors would have to make the same i nvestment in building their own plant before they could launch an imitation product.18 Additionally, on some occasions the underlying invention does not need a pate nt because the efforts to develop and commercialize it give rise to th eir own patentable invention,19 which can make it difficult for competitors to capitalize on the i nnovative firm's post-invention expenses.20 In any argument has proven controversial. See e.g., id.; Duffy, supra; Mark F. Grady & Jay I. Alexander, Patent Law and Rent Dissipation , 78 V A. L. REV. 305 (1992); Lemley, supra note 11; Dongal G. McFetridge & Douglas A.

Arti Kaur Rai, Regulating Scientific Research: Intellectual Property Rights and the Norms of Science , 94 N W. U.L. REV. 77, 120-135 (1999). This debate is largely unrelated to the traditional economic justification for patents, which is that without a patent system the threat of competition deters investment in R&D. 16 See W ESLEY M. COHEN ET AL ., P ROTECTING THEIR INTELLECTUAL ASSETS : APPROPRIABILITY CONDITIONS AND WHY U.S. MANUFACTURING FIRMS PATENT (OR NOT) (Nat'l Bureau of Econ.

Maurer, Innovation Today: A Public-Private Partnership , in INNOVATION AND INCENTIVES , supra note 10, at 243-44. 20 But cf. Note, The Disclosure Function of the Patent System (or Lack Thereof) , 118 H ARV. L.

For some inventions, however, patents do play an essential role in promoting their development and commercialization, and drugs are a clear example.21 Pharmaceutical companies spend somewhere between $800 million and $1.2 billion on R&D for each new drug that reaches the market.22 Roughly half of that money is spent satisfying the FDA's clinical-trial requirements to esta blish the safety and efficacy of new drugs,23 producing data that cannot be protected with patents.24 Meanwhile, generics are exempted from the FDA's clinical-trial requirements, entering the market based on the clinical-trial data submitted by the pharmaceutical company. 25 As a result, generic-drug manufacturers spend on average only about two million dollars on the approval process.26 Once they are on the market, those drugs dram atically reduce sales of (and profits from) the name-brand drugs they imitate.27 Pharmaceutical companies therefore rely on a lengthy period of market exclusivity to r ecoup their investments in developing new drugs. With strong patent protection, they are usually able to keep generics off the 21 See Dan L. Burk & Mark A. Lemley, Policy Levers in Patent Law , 89 V A. L. REV. 1575, 1676-77 (2003). 22 See Joseph A.

Economists refer to this harm as deadweight loss, and it is a problem inherent in the patent system.34 With pharmaceuticals, the deadweight loss caused by patent protection is especially troubling 28 See Henry G. Grabowski & Margaret Kyle, Generic Competition and Market Exclusivity Periods in Pharmaceuticals , 28 M ANAGERIAL & DECISION ECON. 491 (2007); Henry G. Grabowski & John M. Vernon, Effective Patent Life in Pharmaceuticals , 19 I NT'L J. TECH. MGMT. 98, 109-117 (2000).

Hughes et al., \"Napsterizing\" Pharmaceuticals: Access, Innovation , and Consumer Welfare, NBER Working Paper 9229, at 6 (2002). 33 See Hughes et al., supra note 32, at 6 (noting that \"the ratio of price to marginal cost for branded drugs with patent protection is about 6:1\"). 34 There are alternative mechanisms for promoting innovation that avoid this deadweight loss problem, such as a rewards system or direct government investment in R&D. See, e.g., S COTCHMER , supra note 10, at 31-58; Steven Shavell & Tanguy Van Ypersele, Rewards Verses Intellectual Property Rights , 44 J.L. & ECON. 525 (2001). In the context of pharmaceuticals, another way to minimize the deadweight loss problem caused by patents is through government subsidies for (or provision of) prescription-drug insurance - a policy that operates much like a reward system. 12because some people must forgo the use of drugs that would improve their health, and sometimes even save their lives.35 Although the temporary high prices that result from patent protection are a significant problem, the benefits of the pate nt system can outweigh these costs. The public may suffer for a time from the higher pr ices charged for a patented invention, but that harm is necessarily smaller than the injury that would result if no one ever created or developed that invention in th e first place, or if it would have taken much longer for the invention to reach the public. As a rule of thumb, therefore, patents are socially desirable when, in their absence, the public would not ot herwise benefit from the invention or there would be a substantial delay in the public's receipt of that benefit. 36 The pharmaceutical industry is probably the best example of where patents are socially desirable under this ru le of thumb, since patents appear to be a prerequisite for most pharmaceutical innovation.37 Given their high R&D cost s compared to those of their generic rivals, pharmaceutical compan ies rely on lengthy periods of market exclusivity - normally 10 or more years for the drugs currently de veloped - to support 35 See Arti K. Rai, The Information Revolution Reaches Pharmaceuticals: Balancing Innovation Incentives, Cost, and Access in the Post-Genomic Era , 2001 U. ILL. L. REV. 173, 187-88 (2001). 36 This rule of thumb is more of a heuristic than an absolute economic principle. An exact account of the social welfare consequences of a patent grant would have to consider the numerous positive and negative externalities of issuing a patent, including its effect on wasteful and duplicative R&D spending; the administrative and enforcement costs of patents; reduced spending on trade secrecy (and perhaps increased labor mobility from less reliance on employee non-competition covenants); the potential stifling of related innovation or improvements due to overly-broad patent claims, unclear patent boundaries, high licensing costs, anti-commons, and patent thickets; R&D spillovers from patents; and reducing licensing costs in comparison to trade secrets. Alth ough these secondary economic effects can be important, they are often hard to calculate and, at least with respect to pharmaceuticals, they do not appear to overw helm the social value of the inventions brought forth from patent protection. See infra text accompanying notes 44-47; B ESSEN & MEURER , supra note 1, at 88-89. 37 See, e.g. , NAT'L RESEARCH COUNCIL , supra note 2, at 41; Edwin Mansfield, Patents and Innovation: An Empirical Study , 32 M ANAGEMENT SCI. 173, 174-75 (1986). 13their investments in br inging drugs to market.38 Not surprisingly, therefore, firms in the industry consistently report that patent protection is essential for their efforts to discover and develop new drugs.39 Moreover, it is well known that pharmaceutical companies generally refuse to develop a new drug unle ss they have strong pa tent protection over it.40 Indeed, drug researchers who work in govern ment and academia report that when they are looking for a partner in private industry to fund the development of a new drug, it is almost impossible to attract interest unless the drug is patented. 41 Some scholars even worry that that the patent system may be too effective at promoting pharmaceutical innovation,42 although the available ev idence indicates that society's investment in pharmaceutical R&D continues to generate substantial positive returns. In theory, the patent system coul d be harming the public by causing wasteful and duplicative R&D in \"patent races.\" 43 In the case of pharmaceuticals, however, numerous economic studies have found that the social benefits produced by new medical 38 See infra notes 337.

The discussion above demonstrates why th e case for the patent system is at its strongest in the pharmaceutical industry, sinc e innovation in the field is incredibly valuable to society and most of it woul d not occur without the patent system.52 Indeed, it is considered \"well established\" that the availability of patent protection for drugs improves social welfare.53 This is not to say that the patent system is perfect; no one questions that the public suffers greatly from high drug prices. At the moment, however, the public depends on the patent system to promote pharmaceutical innovation, and usually benefits when the system is successful in that task. II. THE PATENT STANDARDS AND THE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF DRUGS When scholars recount the story of pha rmaceutical innovation as the patent system's great success story, they focus on how patents are a necessary incentive for the discovery and development of mo st drugs. It is often assume d that patent protection is always available to promote the de velopment of drugs that need it.54 That assumption is wrong. When the idea for a drug is insufficiently new or inventive, it cannot be patented, even when that drug has not yet been proven safe and effective in clinical trials, and thus 50 See Jerry Avorn, Dangerous Deception - Hiding the Ev idence of Adverse Drug Effects , 355 N EW ENG. J. MED. 2169, 2169-70 (2006). 51 See Margaret Gilhooley, Vioxx's History and the Need for Better Procedures and Better Testing , 37 SETON HALL L. REV. 941 (2007). 52 See SCHERER , supra note 39. 53 See NAT'L RESEARCH COUNCIL , supra note 2, at 41. 54 See, e.g. , RICHARD A. EPSTEIN , O VERDOES : HOW EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION STIFLES PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION 58 (2006) (noting that \"the overall [patent] system tends to be reliable, especially for pharmaceutical patents\"). 16cannot be approved by the FDA for sale to the public.55 This section explores the gap in protection left by this rule, explai ning how the novelty and non-obviousness requirements, two of the three ba sic standards of patentability,56 operate to prevent valuable drugs from being patented before th ey have been developed for public use. At a more general level, this section notes that whenever the post-invention costs of developing and commercializing an invent ion are substantial and vulnerable to free- riding by competitors, the novelty and non-obviousness requirements can deny patents to inventions that are unlikely to reach the publ ic without that protection. This problem arises in the pharmaceutical industry because of the need for safety and efficacy testing, which forces pharmaceutical companies to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in clinical trials while generics can enter the market almost freely. Although the analysis in this section is limited to pharmaceuticals, it is possible that similar problems occur in 55 This observation is relevant to the burgeoning literatu re on \"reverse payment\" settlements of drug patent litigation, discussing settlements where pharmaceu tical companies pay the generic manufacturer challenging their patent to delay releasing its product until near the end of the patent term. See Bureau of Competition, Federal Trade Commission, Agreements Filed with the Federal Trade Commission under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003: Summary of Agreements Filed in FY 2006, at 4-5 (Jan. 2007). These agreements have been criticized for enabling pharmaceutical companies to \"pay for delays\" in generic competition, which forces consumers to pay higher prices for drugs. C. Scott Hemphill, Paying For Delay: Pharmaceutical Patent Settlement as a Regulatory Design Problem , 81 N.Y.U. L. REV. 1553 (2006); see also Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Competition in the Pharmaceutical Marketplace: Antitrust Implications of Patent Settlements , Prepared Statement before the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, at 10- 19 (May 24, 2001). Such criticisms presume that if the patent on a drug is invalid, then the public is best served by allowing generics to enter. In reality, the patent standards for pharmaceuticals correspond poorly to whether patent protection is necessary for a drug's development. See infra text accompanying notes 77-79, 165-168. To anal yze the social-welfare consequences of these settlement agreements, therefore, attention should be paid to the grounds upon which the patent is being challenged, and whether that patent was likely necessary for the drug's development. 56 Inventions must be new, not obvious and useful to be patented. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-103. Unlike the novelty and non-obviousness standards, the utility requirement cannot alone deny patent protection to a valuable drug, since any drug lacking \"utility\" is not valuable. In fact, the utility requirement is often considered perfunctory, a lthough it has some bite w ith pharmaceutical patents, see STEPHEN A. BECKER , PATENT APPLICATIONS HANDBOOK \u00a7 6:31 (2006), forcing inventors to delay filing a patent on a drug until they possess sufficient evidence to demonstrate its claimed utility. See infra notes 91-94. 17other industries.57 Of course, any such extension of the analysis below must be done with care. One might assume that the same problems that arise for the traditional pharmaceuticals discussed below also arise for newer biologic drugs ( i.e., large-molecule drugs such as human growth hormone), sin ce both are subject to the same safety and efficacy standards.58 There is no regulatory path for generics in the biologic industry,59 however, and thus no need for patents to pr event generics from using another firm's clinical-trial data to enter the market.60 Given the sensitivity in the analysis to industry variations, this section focuses only on patent protection for traditional pharmaceuticals, even though the thesis can be stated more generally as applying whenever post-invention costs are significant and subject to free-riding. A. The Novelty Requirement More than any of the ot her doctrines in patent la w, the novelty requirement epitomizes the patent system's failure to adequately promote pharmaceutical innovation by ignoring the development and commercializati on costs of inventions. This failure is particularly notable because the novelty requirement is pr obably the least controversial rule in patent law, stating only that an inve ntion must be new to be patented. In the pharmaceutical industry, this rule means that a drug cannot be patented if the idea for it was previously disclosed to the public; no exception is made for when the disclosed drug has not yet been tested in clinical trials, and thus has not been approved by the FDA. 57 Two other industries where the novelty and non-obviousness requirements might have similar effects are agricultural chemicals and medical equi pment, since both of those industries are governed by a regulatory regime similar to the one for drugs. See 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360. 58 See PETER BARTON HUTT ET AL ., FOOD AND DRUG LAW: CASES AND MATERIALS 624-734 (3rd 2007). 59 See Richard G. Frank, Regulation of Follow-on Biologics , 357 N EW ENG. J. MED. 841, 841-43 (2007). 60 If firms in the biologic industry are expecting Congress to change these regulations soon to permit generic entry, the problems with the novelty and n ovelty requirements discussed below might be occurring for biologics even though they do not yet face generic competition. 18This problem arises with surp rising frequency in the industr y, as it is not uncommon for scientific publications to disclose a drug in a manner that later prevents it from being patented. Courts exacerbate the situation by invaliding drug patents on the basis of seemingly trivial disclosures, often made before anyone recognized the value of the drug or knew enough about it to file a patent. As a result, the novelty requirement makes it easy for valuable drugs to become unpatentable before they have been developed for public use. Part one of this section explains how the novelty requirement operates with respect to pharmaceutical inventions, denying patent protection to drugs on the ground that the idea for them was previously disclose d in some manner. Part two examines how the courts exacerbate this prob lem with an expansive interp retation of novelty that makes it easy for researchers to undermine the patentab ility of the drugs they discover. Part three discusses how drug researchers at univers ities and in private industry sometimes fall into this trap, disclosing drugs prematurely such that they cannot later be patented. 1. The Novelty Standard for Drugs Only new drugs can be patented, and th e patent system judges novelty based on whether the idea for an invention is new, not whether the public has access to the invention. It is well accepted th at the disclosure of an idea for a drug can prevent it from later being patented, ev en if that drug is not yet available to the public. Under these circumstances the patent system offers no in centive for the devel opment of drugs into FDA-approved products. 19The novelty requirement provides that an invention is only pate ntable if it is a new idea.61 Inventions that have been freely disc losed to the public are considered part of the \"public domain,\" and are \"no longer patentable by anyone.\"62 The novelty doctrine therefore precludes the patenting of an y invention that \"was known or used by others in this country, or pate nted or described in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent.\"63 The rule also states that once an invention is disclosed to the public, either by being \"patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country,\" the inventors have just one year to submit a patent application on it.64 After that one-year grace period, their inven tion belongs to the public.65 Pursuant to the novelty doctrine, therefore, a patented inven tion that was disclosed to th e public before the patentees invented it, or disclosed more than a year before they filed their patent a pplication, is \"anticipated\" by the prio r disclosure, and the patent is invalid. The economic rationale for the novelty re quirement is so widely accepted among patent-law scholars that it is almost canonical;66 if an invention is not new, then it is 61 See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. 62 In re Hall, 781 F.2d 897, 898 (Fed. Cir. 1986). 102(a). 64 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). 65 Id. For the sake of simplicity, this paper refers to \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and (b) together as the novelty requirement, although they are usually treated separately. See, e.g. , DONALD S. CHISUM , 1 C HISUM ON PATENTS \u00a7 3.01 (2006). Section 102(a) prohibits someone from patenting an invention if, before she conceived of it, it had been invented and disclosed to the public by someone else. Section 102(b) prohibits anyone from patenting an invention that was disclosed by anyone more than one year before the patent application was filed, including by a subsequent inventor or even the patent applicant herself. As a result, \u00a7 102(b) is often referred to as a \"statutory bar\" or \"loss of right\" prov ision, and it encourages inventors to file their patent applications early. See ROBERT PATRICK MERGES & JOHN FITZGERALD DUFFY , PATENT LAW AND POLICY : CASES AND MATERIALS 541-42 (3d ed. 2002). At the same time, \u00a7 102(b) also acts as a more administrable version of the novelty requirement. For purposes of this paper, the distinction between \u00a7 102(a) and \u00a7 102(b) is usually irrelevant. supra note 15, at 502; Merges, supra note 12, at 12. Scholars sometimes question certain details of the novelty doctrine, but rarely the basic rule. See, e.g. , Rebecca S. Eisenberg, Analyze This: A Law and Economics Agenda for the Patent System , 53 V AND. L. REV. 2081, 2088-91 (2000). 20presumed that the public already has access to it, and thus there is no reason to issue a patent for it. The patent system is designed to reward only those inventions that the public would not have received absent th e inducement of a patent. Underlying the novelty requirement, therefore, is the assu mption that disclosing an invention to the public provides free access to its benef its, making patent protection unnecessary.67 This assumption is so deeply entrenched in the literature on patents that scholars have defined the very purpose of the patent system as \"the promotion of new and improved works,\" 68 and the novelty requirement is said \"to lie at the heart of the patent system.\"69 T h e Supreme Court has even stated that the novelty bar is an \"inherent requisite[] in a patent system which by constitutional command must 'promote the Progre ss of . . . useful Arts,'\"70 and intellectual-property scholars routinely cite this proposition with approval.71 There appears to be near uniform agreement that the novelty rule is always a sensible limit on the government's authority to grant patents, regardless of the invention at issue. This consensus view on the novelty require ment ignores the cr ucial role that patents sometimes play in encouraging the development and commercialization of inventions, since the doctrine ba rs the patenting of old ideas for inventions regardless of 67 See Eisenberg, supra note 66, at 2088 (\"Granting patents on technologies that are not new would impose the social costs of monopolies without the counterveiling benefits of promoting development and introduction of welfare-enhancing inventions.\"); Merges, supra note 12, at novelty requirement] is fairly straightforward,\" since if \"information is already in the public domain when the 'inventor' seeks to patent it[,] society has no need to grant a patent to get this information\"). 68 Menell & Scotchmer, supra note 10, at __; see also Barton & Emanuel, supra note 30, at 2076 (stating that the novelty requirement \"ensure[s] innovation by precluding patents for something already invented\"). 69 CHISUM , SUBCOMM .

LEGIS. 45, 57- 58 (2000). 21whether a patent is needed for those inventions to reach the public. As discussed in Part I, it is well known that patents are sometimes necessary for motivating the efforts to develop an invention into a marketable product. 72 A patent is only awarded in exchange for the creation and disc losure of inventions,73 however, not for their subsequent development or commercialization.74 Scholars seem to have assumed that if an invention needs patent protection to be made availabl e to the public, then it will in fact be patentable.75 Under the novelty doctrine, however, the investment necessary to develop and commercialize an invention is irrelevant to its patentability. Once the idea for an invention ceases to be novel, the incentive provided by the patent sy stem for bringing it to market disappears, no ma tter how critical that incentive might be. Although this point may seem obvious, to this author's knowledge it has not been made before now.76 This aspect of the novelty requirem ent takes on great importance in the pharmaceutical industry, where new drugs can ce ase to be \"novel\" inventions long before they have undergone the clinical trials needed to establish their medicinal value, and thus can become unpatentable before the public ev er gains access to them. Unless a new drug is proven safe and effective in clinical trials, neither the FDA nor the medical community will accept its use in the practice of medicine. 77 A publication that merely discloses the 72 See supra text accompanying notes 12-15. 73 See Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc., 525 U.S. 55, 63 (1998). 74 See Kitch, supra note 14, at 276-77. 75 See, e.g. , F. Scott Kieff, Property Rights and Property Rules for Commercializing Inventions , 85 M INN. L. REV. 697, 714 (2001); Kitch, supra note 14, at 284. 76 A related point about the novelty requirement, made by William Kingston, is that the patent system fails to adequately promote innovation when final commercialized products bear little relationship to individually patented inventions, since the link between the patent grant and the incentive to commercialize a product is then weak. See William Kingston, The Unexploited Potential of Patents, in DIRECT PROTECTION OF INNOVATION 9, 12-14, 20-21, 30-32 (William Kingston ed. 1987). This view leads Kingston to conclude that patents fail to adequately promote innovation in most fields other than chemicals and pharmaceuticals, where the \"inventio n-innovation link is . . ET AL ., supra note 58, at 624-734 (detailing the FDA approval process for new drugs); Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group, Evidence-Based Medicine: A New Approach to Teaching the 22idea for a new drug is rarely en ough for the public to benefit from that drug's discovery. Nonetheless, such a disclosure can prevent an yone else from later patenting that same drug, since it is no longer a novel invention.78 Once a year has passed from the date of publication, not even the scientists who firs t invented the drug can patent it, and their invention falls permanently into the public domain.79 The novelty requirement therefore creates a substantial gap in th e scope of patent protection for pharmaceuticals, wherein a new drug can become unpatentable before it has been tested in clinical trials. A recent Federal Circuit decision aptly demonstrates this problem, showing how the novelty requirement can render a drug unpatent able prior to clinic al trials, and thus before the public can benefit from its use.80 The case involved the analgesic drug Ultracet\u00ae, a combination of two older drugs th at interact synergistically to provide added pain relief with a lower incidence of side-effects.81 The idea of combining the two drugs first appeared in a 1972 publication, but was mentioned just briefly82 and went unnoticed by the medical community.83 Physicians did not begin prescribing the combination until Practice of Medicine , 268 J. AM. MED. ASS'N 2420, 2420 (1992) (noting that \"[i]t is now accepted [by physicians] that virtually no drug can enter clinical practice without a demonstration of its efficacy in clinical trials\"). 78 See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a). Fo r examples of such cases, see infra notes 99-104. 79 See 35 U.S.C. Ltd., 476 F.3d 1321, 1324-25 (2007) (recounting how a prior publication forced Ortho- McNeil to narrow its patent on Ultracet\u00ae to such an extent that it could no longer prevent generic companies from entering the market). 81 Ultracet\u00ae is a fixed-dose combinati on of acetaminophen and tramadol. 82 The publication that first disclose d the idea of combining tramadol and acetaminophen was the original 1972 patent on tramadol, which mentioned it in a long list of many other drug combinations involving tramadol. See U.S. Pat. 3,652,589 (issued Mar. 28, 1972). The patent did not claim the tramadol- acetaminophen combination as part of the invention. Id. 83 As reported in PubMed, the firs t peer-reviewed article to discuss using tramadol and acetaminophen combined as an analgesic (in animal experiments) was published in 1996. See Ronald J. Tallarida and Robert B. Raffa, Testing for Synergism Over a Range of Fixed Ratio Drug Combinations: Replacing the Isobologram , 58 L IFE SCI. PL-23 (1996). One of the authors of the article, Robert Raffa, is a named inventor in the patent at issue in the Ultracet\u00ae case. See U.S. Pat. 5,336,691 (issued Aug. 9, 1994). 232001,84 after a pharmaceutical company established its safety and efficacy and received FDA approval to market it under the tradename Ultracet\u00ae.85 That company, which was unaware of the prior disclo sure in the 1972 publication,86 received its own patent on the combination in 1994,87 and thereafter funded clinical trials necessary for regulatory approval. Once the 1972 publication came to light, however, it was unable to prevent generic-drug companies from entering the market.88 Although the bene fits of Ultracet\u00ae were unknown to the public before the pharmaceutical company patented it and established its safety and efficacy, the idea for the combination was not new, and, for better or worse, the novelty re quirement \"assure[s] that ideas in the public domain remain there for the free use of the public.\" 89 2. Turning the Novelty Requirement into a Trap for the Unwary Although there is a strong fina ncial incentive for drug researchers to secure patent rights over their inventions, the novelty requirement contains se veral pitfalls that make it 84 Based on a search in PubMed, the first medical-jou rnal article to recommend combining tramadol and acetaminophen was published in 20 01, just after FDA approval. See R. B. Raffa, Pharmacology of Oral Combination Analgesics: Rational Therapy for Pain , 26 J.

See Ortho-McNeil Pharm. Inc. v. Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd., No. 04-CV-73698, 2005 WL 2679788, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 19, 2005). Although one might have expected Ortho-McNeil to find this reference sooner, the 1972 patent uses an obsc ure synonym of acetaminophe n, \"p-acetamino phenal,\" in its reference to the combination, see U.S. Pat. 3,652,589, and was likely overlooked for that reason. 87 U.S. Pat. 5,336,691. 88 Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc. v.

Quick Point Pencil Co., 440 U.S. 257, 262 (1979). 24easy for researchers to unwittingly undermine th e patentability of new drugs. Cursory disclosures containing little information about a drug are often enough to later prevent it from being patented. In fact, it is well-settled law that a disclosure can be \"entirely adequate to anticipate a claim to [an inven tion] . . . and, at the same time, entirely inadequate to support the allowance of such a claim.\"90 As a result, new drugs can become unpatentable before anyone ever has a chance to patent them. There are at least three different scenarios in which this situation arises: when researchers publish preliminary research about a drug but do not have enough evidence to demonstrate its therapeutic value; when researchers mistak enly believe a new drug is ineffective and disclose it as such; and when researchers disclose a new drug w ithout recognizing their own discovery. In the first scenario, which is probably the most common of the three, a drug becomes unpatentable because the researcher s who first disclosed it did not have the evidence needed to demonstrate its medicina l value to patent it. Patents only cover inventions that are \"useful,\"91 and drug patents must contain \"more than respectable guesses as to the likelihood of [the drug's] success.\"92 Although the Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") does not require clinical-trial data,93 it usually demands evidence from laboratory or animal experiments to substantiate the asserted therapeutic 90 In re Hafner, 410 F.2d 1403, 1405 (C.C.P.A. 1992). 91 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 92 Rasmusson v.

The statutory foundation for this requirement lies in the utility and enablement standards of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101, 112. See Rasumsson, 413 F.3d In 1560, 1567-68 (Fed. Cir. 1995). 25utility of the drug,94 and often rejects drug patents fo r failing to meet this standard.95 While the disclosure of a new drug without adequate preclinical evidence is not enough to support a patent,96 such a disclosure can still anticip ate a subsequently -filed patent on the drug97 - even if that disclosure was an earlie r patent application rejected by the PTO for lack of utility.98 In the Ultracet\u00ae case, the initial disclosure merely speculated about the drug's effects, and offered no evid ence that it would actually work.99 There are at least four other analogous cases, involving an anti-inflammatory drug,100 a treatment for 94 See In re Fisher, 421 F.3d 1365, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2005); U.S. PATENT & TRADEMARK OFFICE , MANUAL OF PATENT EXAMINING PROCEDURE \u00a7 2107.03 (8th ed. 2001); J OHN R. THOMAS , PHARMACEUTICAL PATENT LAW 57-83 (2005). 95 See BECKER , supra note 56, at \u00a7 6.31. 96 In re Fisher, 421 F.3d at 1377-78. 97 See, 410 F.2d 1403, 1405 (C.C.P.A. 1969) (invalidating a patent on artificial resins). 98 The combination of the novelty and utility requirements can create a significant barrier to patenting drugs for diseases that are currently difficult to treat. Pa tent applications are typically published 18 months after being filed. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 122(b). Once published, they are considered a printed publication and can anticipate other patents, regardless of whether the PTO rejected the application for lack of utility. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e). If a different set of researchers later try to patent the drug, their claim will likely be anticipated by the prior application. Id. The researchers who submitted the original patent application can submit another one that includes sufficient evidence of utility, but only if they are able to do so within 12 months of when their original patent application was published. See id. at \u00a7 102(b). The PTO usually requires evidence of efficacy from la boratory or animal models for the targeted condition that are known to correlate with efficacy in humans, an d if scientists have not yet had any success in treating the disease, these models are difficult to verify. See I v e r P . C o o p e r , Training Materials for Examining Patent Applications with Respect to 35 U.S.C. Section 112, First Paragraph - Enablement Chemical/Biotechnical Applications , 3 B IOTECHNOLOGY & LAW at *3-7 (Bd. Pat. App. & Interf. Mar. 21, 1991). Consequently, even this 30-month timeframe can be a problem for drugs that target conditions which are poorly understood or are resistant to treatment. See, e.g. , Rasmusson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 413 F.3d at *3-9 (Bd. App. & 2003). 99 Ortho-McNeil Pharm. Inc. v. Caraco Pharm. Labs. LTD., No. 04-CV-73698, 2005 WL 2679788, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 19, 2005) (discussing the patent disclosure that invalidated most of the claims in the Ultracet\u00ae patent). The 1972 disclosu re did not contain evidence of the synergistic benefit of combining tramadol and acetaminophen, see U.S. Patent 3,652,589, at 12, which was critical for its patentability. Cf. Merck & Co., Inc. v. Biocraft Labs., Inc., 874 F.2d 804, 808-09 (Fed. Cir. 1989). 100 In SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Copley Pharmaceutical, Inc. , the Federal Circuit held that a patent on nabumetone (Relafen\u00ae), an anti-infl ammatory drug, was invalidated by an earlier publication that merely disclosed the chemical structure of the compound, without any mention of its possible medicinal uses. 45 Fed. Appx. 915, 916-17 (Fed. Cir. 2002); see also In re '639 Patent Litig., 154 F. Supp. 2d at 162. Although SmithKline Beecham held a separate patent on Relafen\u00ae's medical use that was not anticipated by the prior disclosure, that patent expired less than three years after the FDA firs t approved the drug, much earlier than the patent on Relafen\u00ae itself. See In re '639 Patent Litig., 154 F. Supp. 2d at 159, 166 n.8. 26prostate cancer,101 a drug for hypertension and angina,102 and an osteoporosis treatment.103 In each of these cases, the courts invalidated a drug patent based on a publication that failed to provide an adequate disclosure of the drug with its claimed utility.104 Whenever researchers disclose a dr ug without establis hing its therapeutic value, therefore, they ca n potentially undermine the novelty of the drug, rendering it unpatentable. The second scenario in which valuable new drugs sometimes enter the public domain prematurely is when they initially appear to be ineffective in early experiments. On at least two separate occasions the cour ts invalidated patents claiming what later became a FDA-approved use for a drug - a chemotherapy treatment105 and a treatment 101 In Rasmusson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp. , the Federal Circuit invalidated several patents on the use of finasteride (Proscar\u00ae) to treat prostate cancer, finding them to be anticipated by a previous, unsuccessful attempt to patent the same treatment, even though that earlier attempt \"fail[ed] to provide any data to demonstrate the effects of finasteride in treating prostate cancer.\" 413 F.3d 1318, 1322, 23-27 (Fed. Cir. 2005). At the time of this decision, finasteride was already on the market as a treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and male-pattern baldness. The drug's role as a treatment for prostate cancer is remains experimental. See R o b e r t L . L e i b o w i t z & S t e v e n J .

Cir. Federal invalidated the patent on metoprolol succinate (Toprol-XL\u00ae), a controlled-release drug for hypertension and angina, based on an earlier patent filed by the patentee that claimed a specific formulation of the drug, id. at _, even though the older patent was too narrow to effectively block generic competition. 103 In Merck & Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. , 395 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the Federal Circuit invalidated a patent on the once-weekly dosage of Fosamax\u00ae, an osteoporosis drug, based on an article in an industry newsletter that suggested a similar dosing schedule. Id. at 1373-77 (invalidating the patent on grounds of obviousness, rather than anticipation, because the article recomme nded a slightly different dosage). Although the article that invalidated the pa tent was not peer-reviewed, presented no evidence on the safety or efficacy of using Fosamax\u00ae once we ekly, and its author had no formal training in pharmacology or medicine, see Merck & Co., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 288 F. Supp. 2d 601, 618 & n.1, 629 (D. Del. 2003), the Federal Circuit found th at \"Merck's idea added nothing to what came before,\" and that there is no reason \"why Merck and not [the author of the article] should get credit for the idea.\" 395 F.3d at 1375. The court did not mention that the author never patented the idea. 104 See supra notes 100-102. 105 The decision in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue Labs., Inc. , 246 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001), involved two patents on a method of reducing blood toxicity during chemotherapy by administering paclitaxel (Taxol\u00ae) over a three-hour period. Id. at 1371-72, 77-81. physicians initially administered Taxol\u00ae over a 24-hour pe riod, that practice changed after the release of the clinical-trial data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of a 3-hour administration period. See C. Williams et al., Shorter 27for peptic ulcers106 - based on publications that discussed the (subsequent ly) patented use for the drug, but describe d it as being ineffective.107 These decisions reflect the courts' highly formalistic approach to the novelty requirement, wherei n \"[a] reference is no less anticipatory if, after disclosing the invention, the reference then disparages it.\"108 As a result of this rule, the novelty requirement pr events the patenting of medical treatments that were initially thought to be ineffective, even when it later appears that those treatments work and would be valuable if prove n safe and effective in clinical trials. The third situation in which this problem arises is when researchers disclose a new drug to the public without realizing what they discovered, thereby failing to patent the new drug while simultaneously making it im possible for anyone else to patent it. While this scenario may sound farfetched, in 2005 and 2006 alone the Federal Circuit invalidated three pharmaceutical patent s - covering an inhalation anesthetic,109 an Verses Longer Duration of Infusion of Paclitaxel for any Advanced Adenocarcinoma (Review) , THE COCHRANE LIBRARY 2007, Issue 2, at 2-4, 7-8. A generic version of Taxol\u00ae was already on the market when the Federal Circuit invalidated Bristol-Myers Sq uibb's patent, and thus it is unclear whether the decision had any financial repercussions for the patentee. See Jennifer E. Smith, Generic Taxol Gets Production Boost , DRUG STORE NEWS, Jul. 23, 2001, at 16. 106 The decision in Astra Akteibolag v. Andrx Pharms., Inc. , 222 F. Supp. 2d 423 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) related to several patents on the use of omeprazole (Prilosec\u00ae), including a patent on the use of that drug in the treatment of ulcers. Id. at 591-98. The use of Prilosec\u00ae along w ith antibiotics now plays an important role in the treatment of peptic ulcers, see NIH Consensus Development Panel on Helicobacter J AM. MED. ASS'N 65, 67-68 (1994), although it took a long time for the medical community to embrace this treatment. See Barry J. Marshall, The Discovery that Helicobacter Pylori, a Spiral Bacterium, Caused Peptic Ulcer Disease , in HELICOBACTER PIONEERS : FIRSTHAND ACCOUNTS FROM THE SCIENTISTS WHO DISCOVERED HELICOBACTERS : 1892-1982, at 199-201 (Barry Marshall ed., 2002). For a discussion of the debate among physicians over the use of acid-blocking drugs and antibiotics in the treatment of peptic ulcers, and the intellectual property issues that affected that debate, see infra note 321. 107 See Bristol-Myers Squibb, 246 F.3d F.3d ( quoting v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 150 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 1998)). 109 In Abbott Laboratories v. Baxter Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., the Federal Circuit invalidated a patent on the mixture of water and sevoflurane (a \"fast- acting, highly effective inhalation anesthetic\"), a combination that prevents the sevoflurane from degrading and becoming toxic during transport and storage. 471 F.3d 1363, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The Court held that the patent was inherently anticipated by an older patent covering a process of purifying sevoflur ane, which involved adding water and then distilling away all the water and other impurities. Id. at 1369. Although \"knowledge of the beneficial nature of a water-sevoflurane mix was wholly lacking\" before the patentee discovered that water prevented 28antidepressant,110 and a drug used to assess calcium metabolism and bone health111 - under these exact circumstances. In each of the three cases, not only was the public not using the product before the patentee redisc overed and developed it for medical use, but prior to the patentee's efforts, no one even knew the product existed.112 Under the doctrine of inherent anticip ation, however, the disclosure of a drug in some unrecognizable form is still suffi cient to invalidate a later-file d patent on that drug, since the prior \"lack of knowledge [about the drug] is wholly irrelevant to the question of whether the . . . patent claims someth ing 'new' over the [earlier] disclosure.\"113 sevoflurane from becoming toxic while in storage, th e court explained \"that a reference may anticipate even when the relevant properties of the thing disclosed were not appreciated at the time.\" Id. at 1367. The original patent on sevoflurane expired before the drug was approved by the FDA. See Abbott Labs. v. Baxter Pharm. Prods., Inc. , No. 01 C 1867, 2005 WL 2347221, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 22, 2005). 110 In SmithKline Beecham Corp . v. Apotex Corp. , the Federal Circuit invalidated a patent on the antidepressant drug paroxetine hydrochloride (Paxil\u00ae) on the ground that it had previously been produced in trace, undetected amounts during the process of manufacturing an ol der experimental version of the drug. 403 F.3d 1331, 1343-45 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The Court acknowledged that the newer version of Paxil\u00ae \"was not even discovered until years after\" the older version was first manufactured, but explained that \"inherent anticipation does not require [that anyone have ] . . . recognize[d] the inherent disclosure in the prior art at the time the prior art is created.\" Id. at 1343. The patent on the older version expired before the FDA ever approved the drug, and the patent on th e newer version was not set to expire until 2006. See SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., 247 F. Supp. 2d 1011, ___, 1017 (N.D. 2003), aff'd on other grounds , 403 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The first generic version of Paxil\u00ae entered the U.S. market in September 2003. See Press Release, Apotex Corp., Apotex Launches First Generic Version of Paxil\u00ae , Sept. 8, 2003, at http://www.apotexcorp.com/press/GenericPaxil09082003.htm. 111 In Nichols Institute Diagnostics, Inc. v. Scantibodies Clinical Laboratory, Inc. , the Federal Circuit held that a patent on certain antibodies - used to measure the blood levels of Human Parathyroid Hormone (\"Human PTH\") - was anticipated by one of the inve ntors' own abstracts, in which they had unwittingly disclosed the patented antibodies. 195 Fed. Appx. 947, 948-49, 51-52 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The abstract disclosed ten separate blood serums, each containing a mixture of antibodies that, according to the abstract, \"provided the possibility to specifically detect . . . human PTH.\" Id. at 948. Although \"the significance of the claimed antibody was not known until after the abstract was submitte d,\" the Court still held that the patent was inherently anticipated by the abstract. Id. at 952. 112 Abbott Labs., 471 F.3d at 1367; SmithKline Beecham, 403 F.3d at 1343; Nichols Inst. Diagnostics, 195 Fed. Appx. at 948-49. 113 Abbott Labs., 471 F.3d at 1368. Dan Burk and Mark Lemley, who defend the inherent-anticipation doctrine, describe it as a \"categorical judgment that an invention already being used by the public shouldn't be patentable because someone discovers informati on about how it works.\" Dan L. Burk & Mark A. Lemley, Inherency , 47 W M. & (2005); cf. MERGES & DUFFY 388-89. There are two prob lems with this argument. First, recent opinions from the Federal Circuit - including the ones discussed above - establish that an in vention is inherently anticipated if it merely existed in prior literature or practice, regardless of whether anyone has previously benefited from it. See supra text accompanying note 112. Second, Burk a nd Lemley incorrectly assume that \"in cases in which the public is already benefiting from the invention, the additional value of learning exactly how or why they benefit does 29Consequently, whenever a drug is unknowingly di sclosed to the public, it can cease to be novel before anyone knows about it, and the patent system will no longer reward any efforts to discover it or establish its therapeutic value. As strange as these three rules mi ght sound, they have been relatively uncontroversial among most patent-law scholars.114 Indeed, it is sometimes thought that an expansive novelty requirement is needed to prevent pharmaceutical companies from abusing the patent system by continually fili ng new patents on old drugs to delay entry by generic competitors, a practice known as \"evergreening.\"115 The courts could use other doctrines to more precisely ta rget and block these abusive strategies, however, such as an equitable defense to infringeme nt for generic manufacturers.116 The novelty doctrine may prevent some evergreening,117 but it can also prevent researchers from patenting therapeutically valuable drugs that have not yet been developed, as seen with many of the drugs mentioned above.118 The rule is designed to prohibit researchers from patenting any drug that was previously used or describe d in a publication, regard less of whether the earlier disclosure allowed the public to benefi t from the drug's use, or even whether it would have allowed the inventor to patent the drug. Under the novelty requirement, not seem worth withdrawing from the public the use of an invention that they already enjoy.\" Burk & Lemley, supra , at 383. While this may be true for some inventions, it is not for others; the value of pharmaceutical innovation, for example, depends heavily on the productio n of information about whether a drug is safe and effective. See JERRY AVORN , POWERFUL MEDICINES : THE BENEFITS , RISKS, AND COSTS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 39-68 (2005). 114 See, e.g. , MERGES & DUFFY , supra note 65, at 388-89. 115 See Natalie M. Derzko, The Impact of Recent Reforms of the Hatch-Waxman Scheme on Orange Book Strategic Behavior and Pharmaceutical Innovation , 45 IDEA 165, 186-87, 220-21 (2005); cf. Rebecca S. Eisenberg, The Role of the FDA in Innovation Policy , 13 M ICH. TELECOMM . & TECH. L. REV. 345, 354 & n.37 (2007). The phenomenon of evergreening dates back to at least the 1930s. See MACHLUP , PATENT SUBCOMM . REPORT , supra note 12, at 10 & n.50. 116 See SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., 247 F. Supp. 2d 1011, 1043 -52 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (Posner, J.), aff'd on other grounds , 403 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2005). 117 Some of the drugs mentioned above were possibly the subject of abusive patent litigation by pharmaceutical companies, includin g the cases involving Prilosec\u00ae, Taxol\u00ae and Paxil\u00ae, discussed at supra notes 105, 106 & 110. 118 See supra notes 99-102, 109, 111. 30therefore, negligible disclosures can - and ha ve - prevented socially valuable drugs from being patented. 3. Falling into the Novelty Trap Given the current structure of the novelty requirement, it is not uncommon for new drugs to be disclosed prem aturely such that la ter they cannot be pa tented. The hair- trigger approach to the novelty requirement di scussed above is part icularly problematic for the drugs discovered at universities, where researchers are rewarded more for publishing their research results than for pate nting them, and are thus prone to disclosing a new drug before securing patent rights over it . This same problem occurs in private industry, although under different circumstan ces. Pharmaceutical companies often disclose drugs prematurely by filing broad patent applications that cover many more drugs than they plan to develop, and subseque ntly discard most of those drugs into the public domain. The regularity with which potential drugs are disclosed under these circumstances suggests that Ultracet\u00ae is not an isolated occurrence, and that there are likely many other drugs that lose their novelty before the public gains access to them. The large number of PTO decisi ons rejecting drug-patent app lications for lack of novelty is consistent with this conclusion. Novelty is often a barrier to the pate nting of drugs discovered in university laboratories. Academic researchers are frequently the first to identify new drugs,119 and 119 Of the new drugs approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2003, at least 15% were originally identified through publicly-funded research. See Robert Kneller, The Origins of New Drugs , 23 N ATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY 529, 529-30 (2005). 31publishing is an important part of their work.120 Although many academics try to keep their inventions secret before filing a patent application,121 it is not always clear what information must be withheld to pr eserve the novelty of an invention,122 and the pressure to publish makes it difficult for them to keep their research secret for any extended period of time.123 As a result, it is not uncommon for unive rsity inventions to be disclosed to the public more than one year before anyone tries to patent them.124 According to a recent survey of universities with large medical-research programs, 82% were unable to patent at least one of their life-science inventions during the previous year \"because research outcomes were already published,\" and 71% we re unable to find a commercial partner to develop one or more of their life-sc ience inventions fo r the same reason.125 These survey 120 See Richard Monastersky, The Number That's Devouring Science: the Impact Factor, Once a Simple Way to Rank Scientific Journals, has Become an Unyielding Yardstick for Hiring, Tenure, and Grants , CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION , Oct. 14, 2005, at A12. 121 See Eric C.

Denis, University Licensing Trends and Intellectual Capital, in BIOTECHNOLOGY LAW 2002: BIOTECHNOLOGY PATENTS & BUSINESS STRATEGIES , at 565 (PLI Pats., Copyrights, Trademarks, and Literary Prop. Course, Handbook Series No. G0-0129, 2002), WL 718 PLI/Pat 551 (noting that it is often very difficult for universities to file timely patent applications on their employees' inventions). 125 See Campbell & Bendavid, supra note 121, at 250-53. Some of th ese life-science inventions are likely to be new drugs, cf. Mark G. Edwards et al., Value Creation and Sharing Among Universities, Biotechnology and Pharma, 21 N ATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY 618 (2003), while others are probably research tools used to discover new drugs. See Annetine C. Gelijns & Samuel O. Thier, Medical Innovation and Institutional Interdependence: Rethinking University-Industry Connections , 287 J. AM. MED. ASS'N. 72, 73-74 (2002). Some, but not all, of the life-science research tools developed at universities need a patent to be developed. See Arti K. Rai & Rebecca S. Eisenberg, Bayh-Dole Reform and the Progress of Biomedicine , University Inventions Get Into Practice , 48 M GMT. SCI. 61, 65 (2002). 32results are consistent with anecdotal eviden ce that universities sometimes fail or are unable to patent their facu lty members' inventions,126 including new drugs.127 This problem extends beyond the drugs discovered at universities, however, as pharmaceutical companies themselves regularly disclose drugs in a manner that later prevents them from being patented. A lthough researchers in the private sector occasionally publish without realizing that they are undermining the novelty of their invention, 128 these types of mistakes ar e more common at universities.129 When pharmaceutical companies disclose drugs prematurely, it is often while they are prosecuting their patents before the PTO. Pharmaceutical companies file their drug patents during early R&D, when they are s till trying to select a lead compound from 126 See, e.g. , Paul Citron, Research Interactions Between Industry and Academia: A Corporate Perspective , 39 T HE PHYSIOLOGIST 81, 91-92 (1996); Lorelei Ritchie de Larena, The Price of Progress: Are Universities Adding to the Cost? , 43 H OUS.

SCI. 90, 93 (2002). One reason why universities are unable to patent all of their important drug-related discoveries is that faculty members sometimes fail to inform the universities of their inventions in a timely manner. See, e.g. , Owen-Smith & Powell, supra note 41, at 109-10; Thursby & Thursby, supra , at 93. Another reason is that universities have limited resources available to fund their patenting offices, see Owen-Smith & Powell, supra note 41, at 99, 102-03; Jerry G. Thursby et al., Objectives, Characteristics and Outc omes of University Licensing: A Survey of Major U.S. Universities , 26 J. TECH. TRANSFER 59, 66 (2001), and therefore file patent applications on only a portion - usually about 50-60% - of the inventions disclosed to them by university employees. See Association of University Technology Managers, AUTM U.S. LICENSING SURVEY : FY2005 29-31, at http://www.autm.net/pdfs/AUTM_LS_05_US.pdf. Although universities try to patent the inventions most likely to prove commercially viable, their sorting process is necessarily imperfect, and important drug- related discoveries can be left unpatented because they seemed too speculative or the commercial possibilities too remote. See Margo A. Bagley, Academic Discourse and Proprietary Rights: Putting Patents in Their Proper Place , 47 B.C.L. REV. 217, 263-64 (2006); NIH: Moving Research from the Bench to the Bedside, Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Health of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 108th Cong. 53 (2003) (prepared statement of Andrew Neighbour, Associate Vice Chancellor for Research, University of California Los Angeles) (comparing the process of selecting the inventions to patent to the process of \"the princess kissing frogs in search of a prince\"). 127 See, e.g. , In re Application of Weichselbaum, 2006 WL 4494416, at *2 (Com'r Pat., May In Behr, 2006 WL 2711012, at 1646439, at *2-4 (Bd.

An analogous problem arises with the drugs that pharmaceutical companies patent but later abandon before completing their development. Pharmaceutical companies usually investigate thousands of compounds before finding one that they are willing to take into clinical trials. 134 Although firms try hard to identify and develop the drugs that will prove safe and effective (and profitabl e), their selection process is far from perfect.135 Subsequent scientific developments might make a drug look promising that was previously abandoned by private industry due to perceived lack of therapeutic value. 130 See Bruno Galli & Bernard Faller, Discover a Drug Substance, Formulate and Develop it to a Product , supra note 128, at 688; Stephen T.

CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS 2837 (2006). 34Moreover, given the unpredictability of drug development, company scientists can easily misjudge the therapeutic poten tial of a drug, selecting a co mpound for development that dead-ends while ignoring ot hers that would have pr oven effective if tested.136 Corporate executives can make similar errors, dropping a drug from their company's pipeline due to a mistaken judgment about its ther apeutic value or market potential.137 By the time these drugs are discarded, many have already been pa tented, and the clock on their patent life is running down. Even if another company belie ved that the drug might be valuable, the diminishing window of potential market ex clusivity over the dr ug usually deters licensing.138 When pharmaceutical companies drop a drug from their pipeline, therefore, most stop paying the upkeep fees on the pate nt, hastening the drug's entrance into the public domain.139 Although it is impossible to know exactly how many drugs fall into the public domain under these circumstances, the number appears to be large. One sign of the problem is that the PTO has rejected num erous pharmaceutical patents for lack of 136 See Ralph Hirschmann, Introduction , in 11 P HARMACEUTICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY : INTEGRATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT : CASE HISTORIES 2-3 (Ronald T.

There are a number of reasons why a therapeu tically valuable drug might be mistaken for one not worth developing and dropped from a company's pipeline, including errors in estimating the costs of clinical trials or likelihood of success, miscalculation of potential market size, poor patient compliance or incorrect dosing during clinical trials, inadequate patient recruitment in clinical trials, and inadequate trial size. See BARTFAI & LEES, supra note 135, at 43, 57-58, 59-60, 133-34, 158-59. Therapeutically valuable drugs can also be dropped from a company's pipeline for reasons related to internal company politics.

Occasionally an executive or R&D manager at a pharmaceutical company will negotiate with her employer to leave the firm and licen se one of its \"failed\" drugs from the employer to develop it. See BARTFAI & LEES, supra note 135, at 59. Licensing is more practical under these circumstances because the departing executive is aware of the company's earlier rese arch on the drug and, unlike an outside company, would not have to start the entire research project over again. 139 See AstraZeneca, Gowers Review of Intellectual Property - Call for Evidence , Apr. 26, 2006, at 5; Kimberly A.

These drugs are apt to fall through the system unprotected as a result of the novelty requirement. B. The Non-Obviousness Requirement Much like the novelty doctrine, th e non-obviousness re quirement excludes valuable drugs from the patent sy stem by ignoring the development and commercialization costs of inventions. Th e test for non-obviousness focuses on the level of risk in the research that produced the invention, and does not consider the costs and risks of developing that invention into a mark etable product.

Without clinical tr ials to demonstrate the drug's safety and efficacy, however, it wi ll not receive FDA regulatory approval and be made available for sale in the Unite d States. As a result, the non-obviousness requirement withholds patent protection from the drugs that seem most promising before they have been developed. Advances in the pharmaceutical sciences often exacerbate this problem by making the drug-discovery process more predictable, which makes it harder for researchers to establish the non-obviousness of new drugs. This perverse tendency in the non-obviousness do ctrine leaves a significant ga p in the scope of patent protection afforded to new drugs, renderi ng unpatentable many promising new drugs while penalizing scientific progress in drug discovery. Part one of this section examines the basi c test for non-obviousness as it is applied to new drugs, noting how the doctrine ignores the development and commercialization costs in the industry, and how previ ous scholars have either overlooked or underestimated this flaw in the drug patent re gime. Part two of the section explores the results of this mismatch between the non- obviousness requirement and the economics of drug development. 1. The Non-Obviousness Standard for Drugs Obvious inventions cannot be patented. In the pharmaceutical industry, this rule means that a drug is unpatentable if its releva nt properties were reasonably expected at the time of its invention, regardless of whethe r it has yet to be pr oven safe and effective in clinical trials. If the id ea for a drug is obvious, therefore, the patent system offers no incentive for private indust ry to invest in securing its regulatory approval. 37The purpose of the non-obviousness requirement is to prevent trivial inventions from being patented.148 Originally crafted by the j udiciary, and late r codified by Congress,149 the non-obviousness doctrine provides that inventions cannot be patented if they would have been obvious to other skilled artisans in th e pertinent field at the time they were made.150 When this test is applied correctly,151 it excludes \"the results of ordinary innovation\" from patent protection,152 while rewarding the inventors who undertake highly uncertain rese arch projects that initially seem unlikely to succeed.153 This test is often described as \"the most important of th e basic patent requirements,\"154 and the Supreme Court has repeatedly suggest ed that non-obviousness is a constitutional limitation on the scope of Congress's patent power.155 In the context of pharmaceutical patents, the non-obviousness requirement has been designed to stop researchers from paten ting drugs that they \"[r]eached by means of routine procedures . . . producing only predictable results.\"156 Pharmaceutical patents are considered obvious if there was a \"reasonable expectation\" that the drug \"would work for its intended purpose\" at the time it was invent ed, and there is inadequate \"[e]vidence of 148 See MERGES & DUFFY , supra note 65, at 644. 149 See Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 11-17 (1966). 150 Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a), \"[a] patent may not be obtained . . . if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art ar e such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\" 151 The ultimate question of obviousness is not a bright-line rule, see KSR U.S. __, [11, 15, 17] (2007), and it can be difficult for the courts to apply the test in a predictable manner. See Harries v. Air King Products Co., Inc., 183 F.2d 158, 162 (1950) (L. Hand, J.) (observing that the non-obviousness standard is \"as fugitive, impalpable, wayward, and vague a phantom as exists in the whole paraphernalia of legal concepts\"). 152 KSR Int'l, __ U.S. at [last page]. at 2.

John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1966). 156 Merck & Co. v. Biocraft Labs., Inc., 874 F.2d 804, 809 (Fed. Cir. 1989); see also Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 1348, 1365-69 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 38unexpected results\" in the drug's performance.157 Courts apply this test through the eyes of a hypothetical \"skilled artisan\" in the field,158 whom they generally define as an experienced drug researcher or medicinal chemist.159 Unless such a person would have been surprised by the drug's properties and succ essful test results, it cannot be patented under the non-obviousness standard. Much like the novelty doctrine, the doctr inal test for non-obviousness ignores the development and commercialization costs of inventions, assuming that once the idea for an invention becomes accessible to the public through its obviousness, the invention itself will also be available.160 The goal of the non-obviousness re quirement is to ensure that the patent system rewards only those inventions that would not have been created absent the inducement of a patent.161 Since obvious ideas are likely to occur to people even without a patent as a reward, patent protection is thought to be unnecessary.162 In reality, the public often cannot benefit from a new idea until someone has invested to develop and commercialize it.163 Nonetheless, these post-invention costs are irrelevant to judicial determinations of obviousness.164 The non-obviousness standard is therefore based on 157 Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1368, 70; see also Eli Lilly and Co. v. Zenith Goldline Pharms., Inc., 471 F.3d 1369, 1377-78 (2006). To be more precise, a reasonable expectation of success makes the claimed compound prima facie obvious, and the applicant may rebut th at presumption of obviousness with evidence of unexpected results.

This policy of ignoring post-invention co sts is particularly troubling in the pharmaceutical industry, where the non-obviousness requirement results in the denial of patent protection to potentially valuable drugs before they have been developed for public use. Although a new drug is considered obviou s if an experienced drug researcher would have reasonably expected it to possess its beneficial properties, 165 that expectation will not satisfy the FDA's regulatory requirements. Without clinical trials to demonstrate the drug's safety and efficacy, it will not be a pproved by the FDA, and thus will not be made available to the public.166 The cost of those clinical tria ls alone - without considering the risk of failure - still run in the hundreds of millions of dollars on average;167 and even drugs with a reasonable expect ation of success at the time they are invented usually face significant uncertainty in clinical trials.168 Yet the patent system offers no reward for investing in those clinic al trials if the drug to be test ed is considered obvious under the patent laws. This policy of ignoring the development and commercialization costs of drugs may seem like a glaring failure in the non-obviou sness standard, but it has received little 165 See supra text accompanying notes 157-159. 166 See supra note and text accompanying note 77. 167 If success were guaranteed, the mean out-of-pocket cost for clinical trials on a new drug, including the time-value of money, would be over $250 million. See DiMasi et al., supra note 22, at 172. A relatively small percentage of new drugs, perhaps 30%, generate sufficient revenues during their initial years on the market to recoup these costs. Cf. Henry Grabowski et al., Returns on Research and Development for 1990s New Drug Introductions , 20 P HARMACOECONOMICS Supp. 11, 22-23 (2002). 168 Only about one-fifth of the new drug candidates that begin clinical trials ever complete the process and are approved by the FDA, see Joseph A. DiMasi, Risks in New Drug Development: Approval Success Rates for Investigational Drugs , 69 C LINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS 297, 298 (2001), and very few drugs are ever guaranteed su ccess in clinical trials. See George Lasezkay, An Overview: Attracting Partners in the Pharmaceutical Industry , 25 R ETINA S104 (2005). 40attention from patent-law scholars. Severa l scholars have critic ized the test for non- obviousness on the ground that it overlooks the costs of the inventive process,169 but fewer have commented on the doctrine's failure to consider the post-invention costs and uncertainty of developing a nd commercializing inventions.170 At least one scholar, Robert Merges, actually argued agai nst consideration of development and commercialization costs of inventio ns in the test for non-obviousness,171 although his brief treatment of the issue glossed over the possi bility that an obvious invention might not reach the public without a patent to motivate its development.172 Dan Burk and Mark Lemley recognized the theoretical point th at the non-obviousness requirement should 169 See, e.g. , John H. Barton, Non-Obviousness , 43 IDEA 475 (2003); & Scotchmer, supra note 10, at __; Merges, supra note 12, at 4. This argument was first outlined by Robert Merges, who noted that the non-obviousness requirement can deter research \"where initial experimentation is very costly\" because it fails to consider risk aversion among inventors. Id. at 4. Merges observed th at when the expected returns from various research projects are e qual, risk-adverse firms will prefer the lower-cost a nd lower-variance projects because they offer a safer investment. Id. at 43-69. He therefore recommended \"a modest lowering of the standard . . . for research wh ich is very expensive in the early stages.\" Id. at 69. 170 See Stuart Minor Benjamin & Arti K. Rai, Who's Afraid of the APA? What the Patent System Can Learn from Administrative Law , 95 G EO. L.J. 269, 278 (2007); Burk at S HAVELL , supra note 10, at 152 n.31. Karen Boyd suggested lowering the non-obviousness standard for biotechnology inventions, arguing that given \"the cost and like lihood of commercial success\" in biotechnology, a lower standard was appropriate to \"give the needed incentive to overcome the risk aversion that is otherwise problematic in the industry.\" Karen I Boyd, Nonobviousness and the Biotechnology Industry: A Proposal for a Doctrine of Economic Nonobviousness , 12 B ERKELEY TECH. L.J. 311, 339 (1997). Much like Merges, see supra note 12, Boyd does not advocate lowering the non- obviousness standard to account for situations where the development and commercialization costs of an obvious invention are greater than the expected profits from marketing it without patent protection. Instead, she argues that the non-obvi ousness standard should be adjusted to correct for risk aversion. See Boyd, supra, at 316-18, 337-41. 171 Merges defended the non-obviousness doctrine's exclusive focus on \"the level of uncertainty facing the inventor just prior to the crucial experiment leading up to the patent,\" contending that \"the intrinsic social value of producing information\" about \"highly uncertain technical challenges\" justifies patent protection, whereas the information produced in the post-i nvention stages of product development and commercialization \"would seem to produce relatively few positive externalities.\" Merges, supra note 12, at 33-34. In other words, he believes that awarding patents on the basis of development and commercialization expenses is unwise because thos e efforts do not \"contri bute valuable technical information to the relevant technical community.\" Id. at 34, 65-69. 172 Although Merges focuses on the potentially smaller spill-over benefits from developing inventions, see supra note 171, spill-over benefits are of secondary impor tance when deciding whether to grant a patent on an \"obvious\" invention that will not reach the public with out such protection because of its development and commercialization costs. See supra note and text accompanying note 36. Moreover, the spill-over benefits from commercializing inventions can sometimes be substantial. Cf. U.S. CONGRESS OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT , INNOVATION AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES 35 (1995). 41account for the costs and uncertainties of post-i nvention efforts, and even noted that such an adjustment could be important for pharmaceuticals.173 Like Merges, however, they discounted the risk of valuable i nventions being considered obvious,174 and thus saw little problem with the existing non-obviousness standard for drugs.175 A few other scholars, including John Barton, Stuart Benjamin and Arti Rai, have re cognized that valuable drugs might in fact be obvious, and thus be in danger of never being developed.176 T h e y described this problem only as it relates to certain new drug technologies, however, and did not extend the observation in to a general critique of the non-obviousness requirement as it applies to pharmaceutical s. The patent-law literat ure generally shows little awareness of how the economic logic underlyi ng the non-obviousness te st unravels in the 173 See Burk & Lemley, supra note 21, at 1678 (\"If patents are to drive innovation in biotechnology, rather than merely invention, . . . courts must take account of the cost and uncertainty of post-invention testing and development.\"). 174 Reflecting the widely-held assumption that a valuable drug would be patentable, Burk and Lemley make only passing reference to the threat of losing important new drugs due to the non-obviousness requirement. See Burk & Lemley, supra note 21, at 1681-82 (\"Lowering the obviousness threshold makes it more likely that marginal inventions will be patented, but . . . [i]f getting from invention to market is the costly and uncertain part of the endeavor, it is the[] more significant inventions that we need to worry about rewarding.\"). 175 To prevent drug companies from designing around the patents on their comp etitors' successful drugs, Burk and Lemley recommend \"a fairly high [non]obviousness threshold\" for biologic drugs, and perhaps the same for traditional pharmaceuticals as well. Burk & Lemley, supra note 21, at 1682, 1684-86. This suggestion follows from their view that the pharm aceutical and biotechnology industries \"fit well into [Edmund Kitch's] prospect theory,\" and thus they advise issuing \"[f]ewer and broader patents\" in those industries. Id. at 1682, 1684-87. Using the non-obviousness standard for this task is problematic, however, because it necessarily creates a zone of unpatentable drugs around each ne w drug patent or publication, and those unpatentable drugs might have great social value. See infra text accompanying notes 184-195. Moreover, it is unclear whether a smaller number of broad patents in pharmaceu ticals would be better for promoting innovation. See infra note 192. 176 See Barton, supra note 169, at 506 (\"[T]here is a strong argument that it would be obvious to try particular human proteins as pharmaceuticals, and there would be no investment without the patent system.\"); Benjamin & Rai, supra note 170, at 307-08 (noting th at \"given the rapid advances of biotechnology, it might be technically obvious to identify a gene that could be used therapeutically,\" but \"without a patent no one would have the incentive to develop the potential therapeutic product\"); Philippe Ducor, New Drug Discovery Technologies and Patents , 22 R UTGERS COMPUTER & TECH. L.J. 369, 372, 461 (1996) (\"[T]he screening of combinatorial molecu lar libraries by high-throughput receptor assays is potentially powerful enough to render its products (ligands) unpatentable due to obviousness,\" which \"threatens the incentives of the pharmaceutical industry to invest in the ligand's development\"). 42pharmaceutical industry, where any drug (includi ng an obvious one) that is subject to the FDA's rigorous clinical-trial re quirements likely needs a patent to incent its development. 2. The Perversity of the Non-Obvious ness Requirement as Applied to Drugs In an industry like pharmaceuticals, where patents are necessary for promoting the development and commercialization of inventions, the non-obviousness requirement performs a pernicious economic function. It denies patent protectio n to the drugs that appear most likely to succeed at the time they are invented and that have expected beneficial properties; i.e., the drugs that appear most promising in early research. The courts and PTO apply this te st without hesitation, finding drugs to be unpatentable whenever their therapeutic properties are considered uns urprising. Although some of these drugs are obvious because their chemical structure is nearly id entical to that of existing drugs, which means they may have th e same therapeutic eff ects and be of little value, the patent system is largely incapable of distinguishing these low-value \"me too\" drugs from important new medicinal agents . In fact, the PTO rejects drug-patent applications for obviousness long before the ther apeutic properties of those drugs can be reliably predicted. Moreover, because the non-obviousness test focuses on whether the therapeutic properties of a dr ug are expected, not whether th e drug is socially valuable, the PTO and courts have rejected patent ap plications on drugs because the drug is expectedly superior to known treatments, and th us is expected to have great social value if developed. This test for non-obviousness is particularly problematic for the efforts of medicinal chemists to create new drugs by e nhancing the therapeutic properties of known compounds, since they often e nhance those compounds in ways that they reasonably 43expect to produce beneficial effects. Ir onically, scientific a dvances in medicinal chemistry actually worsen this problem by making the drug-discovery process more predictable, which generally makes the drugs discovered through those advances more obvious. Given the perversity of these rules, there are likely a great number of drugs that cannot be patented under the non-obviousness requirement; something evidenced by, among other things, the numerous PTO decisi ons rejecting drug-patent applications on the ground that the claimed invention is obvious. The most troubling aspect of the non-obvi ousness requirement is that it denies patent protection to inventions because they seemed likely to work while ignoring the question of whether a patent is needed to motivate that invention's development. The non-obviousness doctrine was crafted under th e assumption that patents are only necessary for encouraging research that i nvolves significant uncertainty and seems unlikely to produce a working invention.177 While it is true that the inventions arising out of high-risk research are more likely to require patent protection, since investors might be unwilling to finance that research if competitors could duplicate their successes without taking the same risks, this situation is not the only one where patents are necessary. If the investment required to develop and commercialize an invention is significant and, like the initial research, vulnera ble to free-riding imitators, then patent protection becomes increasingly important for the results of both high- and low-risk research projects. Since the standards of non-obviousness ignore these post-invention costs, the rule can discourage investment in the research projects that initially appear to have a high probability of success. 177 See Merges, supra note 10, at 2-3, 20-31. 44Applying the doctrinal test for non-obvi ousness to drug patents thus has a perverse effect on the incentives for pharm aceutical innovation, since it withholds patent protection whenever a firm pursues research th at appears likely from the start to yield an effective drug. New drugs are considered ob vious if an experien ced drug researcher would have expected them to possess their beneficial properties at the time they were invented.178 As a general rule, therefore, the more likely it appears that a new drug will be successful, the less likely it is to be patentable under the non-obviousness requirement. 179 Consequently, the incen tive normally provided by patents to invest in the development of new drugs does not exist for th e ones that seem most promising in early research. On some occasions this effect may be rather benign, such as when it denies patent protection to drugs that are so closely related to an older drug that they are unlikely to provide any additional therapeu tic benefits. These \"me too\" drugs, as they are known, are sometimes characterized as worthless inventions that se rve only to increase pharmaceutical companies' profits;180 indeed, some have advocated more vigorous enforcement of the non-obviousness require ment to discourage their development.181 Under current law, if the similarities betw een an existing and me-too drug create a reasonable expectation that the me-too drug w ill succeed in early experiments, then the me-too drug is considered obvious unless it pos sesses unexpected and superior properties 178 See supra text accompanying notes 157-159. 179 See, e.g. , In re Childers, 2003 WL 25277879, at *4 (Bd. Pat. App. & Interf. Dec. 22, 2003) (rejecting the claims on compounds said to be usef ul in treating stroke victims because \"one of ordinary skill in the art would have reasonably expected the compounds . . . would . . . exhibit the property binding to the [target] receptor\"). 180 See, e.g. , MARCIA ANGELL , THE TRUTH ABOUT DRUG COMPANIES : HOW THEY DECEIVE US AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT, 74-93 (2005); Peter Lansbury, An Innovative Drug Industry?

It is unclear whether the public would benefit by not having access to such drugs.183 Regardless, to the extent that the non-obvi ousness standards deny patent protection to me-too drugs that provide little or no th erapeutic advantage over existing drugs, the doctrine does not pose a catastrophic threat to public welfare. Unfortunately, the patent system is largely incapable of distinguishing unimportant me-too drugs from drugs of signifi cant medicinal value, and there is little reason to trust that the drugs deemed \" obvious\" under current law would not provide great benefit to society. By introducing small changes into the chemical structure of an existing drug, scientists sometimes create a superfluous me-too product, but other times produce a new drug with substantially improved therapeutic properties.184 A new drug that looks similar to an older one can ther efore represent a major advance in medical technology.185 Although these improved versions of known compounds should still be 182 Compare Ortho-McNeil Pharm., Inc. v.

The test for non-obviousness does not target the drugs with pharmacological properties that are equivalent to existing drugs on the market; instead, it denies patent protection to the drugs that have expected pharmacological properties. That expectati on often comes from prior disclosures of compounds that were never developed into an FDA approved drug, and thus are not 192 Even if the patent system where capable of identifyi ng \"me too\" drugs that will have virtually identical therapeutic properties to previously patented drugs, it would still be dangerous to use the patent system to deter their development. The me-t oo phenomenon in pharmaceuticals is largely the result of development races, where competing firms begi n developing sim ilar compounds - i.e., drugs in the same therapeutic class - at roughly the same time, and end up launching closely related drugs within a few years of one another. See Joseph A. DiMasi & Cherie Paquette, The Economics of Follow-On Drug Research and Development , 22 P HARMACOECONOMICS 1, 9-10 & fig.4 (Supp. 2, 2004). The PTO could try to stop these races by denying patent protection to all of the drugs in a class other than the first one (or few) to be patented. To the extent to which these development races lead to wasteful R&D expenditures, preventing them would be beneficial. See Rai, supra note 35, at 205-06; Scherer, supra note 18, at 39-45. Moreover, since me-too drugs reduce prices an d steal market share from the break through drug that preceded them, blocking their development would increase the expected return from developing breakthrough products. See Frank R. Lichtenberg & Tomas J. Philipson, The Dual Effects of Intellectual Property Regulations: Within- and Between-Patent Competition in the U.S. Pharmaceuticals Industry , 45 J.L. & ECON. 643, 646- 47 (2002). This strategy is risky, however, since the PTO would usually have to decide which drugs in the class can be patented before any of them have proven successful, and they might pick the wrong ones. See infra text accompanying notes 188-190. Drug development is very unpred ictable and involves a high rate of failure. See supra note 167. The first drug in a class to be patented might fail in development, while a patent application claiming what appears to be a me-too drug could turn out to be the only drug in its class to be successfully developed. Rejecting patent applications on me-too drugs could therefore prevent the public from receiving any drug from that class. The PTO could try to avoid this problem by granting a single patent that covers the entire class of drugs, trusting the patent holder to select the best drugs of the class and make the socially optimal investment in their development. Cf. Kitch, supra note 14. Granting a broad monopoly at such an early stage in pharmaceutical R&D might stifle innovation, however. Cf. Merges & Nelson, supra note 15. Given the great uncertainty involved in selecting an appropriate lead compound for development, and the difficulty in modifying that compound's structure to maximize its chances of success in clinical trials, see Paul W. Erhardt, Medicinal Chemistry in the New Millennium: A Glance into the Future , in 1 D RUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT 17-102 (Mukund S. Chorghade ed., 2006), allowing multiple firms to tackle these proble ms may sometimes be required for the production of a single successful drug within a class. Cf.

Leeson & Brian Springthorpe, The Influence of Drug-Like C oncepts on Decision-Making in Medicinal Chemistry , 6 NATURE REVIEWS DRUG DISCOVERY 881, 886, 889 (2007). 48available for use in medical practice.193 Moreover, even when the PTO compares drugs to existing treatments, it will deny them patent protection if they possess expectedly superior properties.194 If there is a reasonable expectation that a new drug will be superior to known treatments, or perhaps even an expectation that it will be the only successful treatment for a conditi on, then that drug is not considered to be the product of true inventiveness, and is therefore obvious. For example, in a case where the court was deciding whether to grant a patent on a pain re liever that, in its own words, appeared to possess \"substantially greater analgesic effec tiveness than one of the most, if not the most, active analgesic compound of the art,\" th e court rejected the application because it thought the drug's superior properties were unsurprising in light of its chemical structure. 195 Although some obvious drugs may be si mple clones of existing treatments, others may represent significant advan ces in medical technology, and the non- obviousness doctrine pays little at tention to the difference. The rule that drugs must have unexpectedly superior properties to be patented can make it especially difficult to patent the drugs created by enhancing compounds with known therapeutic effects.196 Pharmaceutical companies employ medicinal chemists to turn a known compound - perhaps an existing drug, a failed drug candidate, or any other public-domain compound with known biologic ef fects - into a safe and effective drug by altering its structure to improve desirable pharmacological properties while minimizing negative ones. 197 Many of these drugs have proven immensely valuable to society,198 but 193 See infra text accompanying note 220. 194 See supra note 191. 195 In re Carabateas, 345 F.2d 1013, (C.C.P.A 22 N ATURE (2004); Wermuth, supra note 184, at 70-72, 77-82. 197 See David J.

The problem of obvious - and thus unpatent able - drugs promises to grow worse over time because the non-obviousness requirement, almost by definition, turns progress in the pharmaceutical sciences against itself; th at is, it denies pate nt protection to new drugs based on the very advances in science that led to their discovery. In the past, the \"unpredictable nature of chemical reactions \" shielded most pharmaceutical patents from obviousness challenges.202 Over the past twenty years, however, researchers have worked to reduce this uncertainty by de veloping more mechanistic and predictive approaches to drug discovery: ones that are less dependent on the trial-and-error process.203 Among their successes, medicinal chem ists are beginning to get better at predicting the pharmacological properties of compounds based on their structure.204 While much progress remains to be made,205 even now medicinal chemists often try to synthesize and test only the most promising compounds when searching for a new drug candidate, helping improve the efficiency and output of the drug discovery process.206 Unfortunately, this more predictive approach to drug discovery comes at the expense of 202 Eli Lilly and Co. v.

Teleflex Inc. exacerbated this tension between the pharmaceu tical sciences and the unexpected-results test of non-obviousness. The Court chastised the Federal Circuit for not applying the non-obviousness standard strictly enough, and made it clear that when researchers pursue \"a finite number of identified, predictable so lutions,\" one of which ultimately \"leads to the anticipated success,\" the resulting invention is unlikely to be patentable.210 Although drug discovery continues to involve a great deal of uncertainty,211 this heightened 207 Of course, if the science of medi cinal chemistry were to ever reach the point where ex tensive clinical trials are no longer necessary , the now-inevitable clash betwee n pharmaceutical science and the unexpected-results test of non-obviousness would disappear. 208 KSR Int'l Co. Teleflex Inc., __ U.S. __ (2007). 209 Philippe Ducor made a similar argument about technological progress in drug discovery and the non- obviousness test, although his observation focused on specific types of drug-discovery tools, and may have been mistaken about the legal effects of those technologies. See Ducor, supra note 176, at 435-63. Ducor, along with many others at the time, optimistically believed that high-throughput screening (an automated process of trial-and-error testing that works simultaneously on large numbers of distinct compounds) would ultimately \"yield products having predetermined properties with the highest possible degree of predictability.\" Id. at 446. As a result, he concluded that the technique would \"render its products . . . unpatentable due to obviousness,\" thereby \"threaten[i ng] the incentive of the ph armaceutical industry to invest in the[ir] . . . development.\" Id. at 461. In truth, because high-throughput screening is just an efficient form of blind trial-and-error experimentation, it probably shields drugs from obviousness challenges. Cf. Pfizer, Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 1348, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Since the individual compounds tested in the experiment do no t have a reasonable likelihood of success ex ante , and high- throughput screening does not always identify any promising leads, see Wermuth, supra note 128, at 73-76, the drugs discovered through it will likely remain non-obvious. Cf. Takeda Chem. Indus. v. Alphapharm Pty., Ltd., _ F.3d _, _ (Fed. Cir. 2007) (explaining that the choice of lead compounds must have been obvious based on the prior art to support a finding of obviousness). 210 KSR Int'l, __ U.S. at __.

The PTO has rejected numerous drug patents for being obvious in light of prior publications,213 including patents on drugs for cancer,214 HIV,215 hypertension,216 stroke,217 diabetes,218 and tuberculosis.219 One medicinal chemistry textbook describes the non-obviousne ss requirement as a \"significant problem in obtaining valid and effec tive patent protection\" for drugs, and notes that that \"[i]nventors' previous patents and publications often . . .

See Crary, supra , at 1; Ludwig & Kelley, supra, at 2. Of course, the true impact of KSR on pharmaceutical patents might be quite modest.

Given these strange tendencies within the doctrine, it is not surprising that drug researchers frequently encounter the non-obviousness requirement as a barrier to patenting their discoveries. III. LOST DRUGS More than firms in any other industr y, pharmaceutical companies rely on the patent system to secure a return on thei r R&D investments, particularly the large investments they make in clinical trials.221 Under the novelty and non-obviousness requirements, socially valuable drugs can be deemed unpatentable before they have been tested in those trials, and thus before they can be sold to the public. Without the patent system to incent these post-invention efforts, private industry is apt to simply ignore such drugs, likely resulting in their loss to the public. These lost drugs are nearly impossible to observe, however, since pharmaceutical compan ies rarely publicize the drugs that they drop from development. To determin e whether the novelty and non-obviousness requirements are stifling pharmaceutical innovati on, therefore, this Section examines how patents influence the R&D decision-making process inside pharmaceutical companies, finding that the patent standards routinel y deter private industry from developing promising drug candidates. According to acad emic researchers, industry insiders, and medicinal chemistry textbooks, pharmaceutical companies systematically screen their 220 Souleau, supra note 128, at 721. 221 See supra text accompanying notes 21-30. 54drug candidates to exclude th e ones lacking strong patent protection, checking their patentability at least three different times during drug development. The existence of these screening procedures and frequency with which they influence companies' R&D investments indicates that the novelty and non-obviousness requirements are likely denying the public access to new drugs. Pharmaceutical companies examine the patentability of their potential drug candidates at the beginning of each research project, and they regularly drop ones that appear to be in the public domain.222 Some version of this patent screen has existed since at least the early 1960s.223 In modern practice, company sc ientists often start preclinical research with a list of compounds being consider ed for development into a particular type of drug,224 and their selection of compounds is of ten critical to th e project's success.225 According to medicinal chemistry textbooks an d academic researchers, one of the first tasks performed in narrowing that list is the crossing off of any compound that the scientists think cannot be patented,226 applying a per se rule that unpatentable drugs will not be developed. 222 See Telephone Interview with Theodore Torphy, supra note 138 (explaining that companies evaluate the patentability of their drug candidates before advancing them into preclinical development, and that unless they are confident that a candidate can be effectivel y patented, they will not move forward with it). 223 In 1962, when a change in government policy made it difficult for pharmaceutical companies to effectively patent compounds that were originally synthesized through National Institute of Health-funded research, pharmaceutical companies simply stopped sc reening those compounds for therapeutic activity. See Rebecca S. Eisenberg, Public Research and Private Development : Patents and Technology Transfer in Government-Sponsored Research , 82 Va. L. Rev. 1663, 1682-84 (1996). The standoff only ended when an investigation by the Comptroller General forced a change in the policy. Id. at 1683. 224 See Malcolm MacCoss & Thomas A.

Showell & Mills, supra note 137, at 55In addition to this initial patent sc reen, pharmaceutical companies check the patentability of their drug candidates at least twice more before clinical trials, screening out any compounds with weak patent protecti on that escaped the prior review. Once the researchers working on a particul ar project have narrowed their search down to just a few drug candidates, those compounds are given to a patent attorney to evaluate their patentability and file a patent over them.227 Later, when one of those drug candidates (hopefully) gets close to clinical trials, the firm will inspect its patent protection again, using in-house or outside counsel to perform a thorough review of the strength of its patents.228 According to industry insi ders, this last audit is considered a \"gate-keeping event\" before clinical trials,229 and it is not unusual for a pharmaceutical company to sour on an otherwise promising drug candidate after their attorneys turn up a prior disclosure that threatens its patent protection.230 These stories from industr y insiders are consistent with reports from drug researchers in govern ment and academia that private industry 551-52 (\"During the lead optimization phase of proj ects additional factors contributing to subsequent failure may include poor portfolio decision-making and a sub-optimal IP.\"). 227 See Janice Klunder & Sian Griffiths, A Beautiful Friendship: The Information Professional and the Patent Attorney/Agent, at 21-22 (Presentation at SLA Pharmaceu tical & Health Technology Division, Spring Meeting, Boston, Mar. 19, 2007) at http://units.sla.org/division/dpht/meetings/spring2007/ klunder_griffiths_2007s.ppt#270,1,Slide 1; Edlyn S.

In the global drug market, roughly ha lf of industry profits come from sales in the United States.235 (The other major markets, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, and the United Kingdom, generate a much smaller share of sales.236) As a result, private industry will screen drugs out of development based solely on their lack of patentability in the United States, paying little a ttention to the opport unities for protection elsewhere.237 231 See supra note 41. 232 See, e.g. , Suzanne Berry, Biotech Meets the Investors , 20 T RENDS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY 370, 371 (2002); Hans Kupper Discusses Science and Venture Capital, Interview by Joanna Pinto , 9 D RUG DISCOVERY TECH. 909, 911 (2004). 233 See BARTFAI & LEES, supra note 135, at 135; Fredric J.

See Press Release, IMS Health Inc., IMS Health Reports Global Pharmaceutical Mark et Grew 7.0 Percent in 2006, to $643 Billion (Mar. 20, 2007) (on file with author). 237 See BARTFAI & LEES, supra note 135, at 138. 57For most of these discarded drugs, the reason why their pa tent protection is inadequate relates e ither directly or indirectly to the novelty and non-obviousness requirements.238 As discussed in Part II, prior public ations that describe a drug or cause it to appear obvious can preven t anyone from later patenting it.239 Those prior disclosures sometimes leave room for a narrow patent on the drug,240 but many times those patents are ineffective241 because their limited scope would allow competitors to launch generics without infringing the patent.242 Although pharmaceutical companies can occasionally block those generics by arguing that they are functionally equivalent to what was claimed in their patent,243 courts are reluctant to apply this doctrine of 238 The novelty and non-obviousness requirements define the scope of the public domain, and are therefore the only doctrines that can prevent a valuable drug from being patented. Courts and the PTO sometimes reject or invalidate drug patents based on other doctrines, including the utility and enablement requirements. See Cooper, supra note 98; T HOMAS , supra note 94, at 60-83, 204-08. Without the novelty and non-obviousness requirements, however, these failings could be corrected in a subsequent patent filing (unless the drug has no utility or cannot be manufactured or used, in which case it is of no consequence). 239 See supra text accompanying notes 119-147, 213-220. 240 See Simmons, supra note 227, at 54. 241 See, e.g. , Astrazeneca AB v. Mutual Pharm. Co., 384 F.3d 1333, F.3d 1324, 1331 (2003); Novartis 1297, 1301-03 (2001). 242 Certain types of drug patents are particularly vulnerable to these design-around efforts, while others are not. If a drug only has one active ingredient and that ingr edient is patented, then the patent will be difficult for generics to design around even if it is narrow, since any change the generic firms make to the active ingredient would likely trigger the FD A's clinical trial requirements. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.93. Similarly, if a pharmaceutical company has a patent on the only FDA-approved use for a drug, then generic manufacturers cannot receive FDA appr oval to sell that drug for its approved use without infringing the patent. See M ARTIN A. VOET, T HE GENERIC CHALLENGE : UNDERSTANDING PATENTS , FDA & PHARMACEUTICAL LIFE-CYCLE MANAGEMENT 36-38 (2005). If the novelty or non-obviousness requirement make it impossible to patent a drug's active ingredient or the medical use(s) for which it will be approved, see, e.g. , supra notes and text accompanying notes 80 -89, 100-103, 140- 147, 191-198, and 210-217, then firms can some times receive a narrower patent, such as one on a particular crystalline or salt form of the drug, a route of administering it (including the addition of other ingredients to the drug that affect its absorption, distribution or metabolism in the body), and particular dosage forms or strengths of the drug. See V OET, supra, at 35-39. Unlike patents on a drug's active ingredient or its FDA-approved uses, however, these narrower patents are often vulnerable to being designed around by generic manufacturers, since the FDA will allow generics onto the market that are \"not identical to [the] listed drug in route of administration, dosage form, and strength\" so long as it believes the differences will not effect the safety and effectiveness of the drug. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 314.93(b), (e)(1)(i). 243 See 287 F.3d 1097, 1105-07 (2002). 58equivalents,244 and it can only be used when the novelty and non-obviousness requirements would not have prevented th e patent claims from encompassing the generic.245 Moreover, pharmaceutical companies are often estopped from invoking that doctrine by their own prior statements to the PT O, where they had to interpret their patent claims narrowly to overcome a PTO reje ction for obviousness or lack of novelty.246 Similar problems can arise if the pharmaceutical company failed to inform the PTO of a prior reference that was material to their drug's novelty or non-obviousness.247 Deliberately withholding such a reference from the PTO is considered inequitable conduct and can render the pa tent unenforceable, even wh en the patent is valid.248 Concerns over the patent protection on a drug re lated to any of these doctrines are likely to result in it being considered unpatentab le, and thus liable to be screened out of development. Although unpatentable drugs occasionally slip through the pharmaceutical companies' screening procedures and are deve loped despite such inadequacies in their patent protection, given the careful efforts by pharmaceutical companies to prevent this from happening, it is likely that the vast major ity of those drugs never reach the public. As seen in the cases discussed in Part II, pharmaceutical companies sometimes develop and market new drugs with patents that the co urts later invalidate fo r lack of novelty or 244 See Charles W.

Pharmaceutical companies are now more vigilant in policing their own patents, and with the advent of the intern et and browsing technology, it has become much easier for the firms to locate prior disclosures.251 In this environmen t, private industry is unlikely to make many mistakes, and drugs with weak patent protection will rarely enter clinical trials. When a drug is screened out of deve lopment under these circumstances, the resulting loss to the public is unlikely to be mitigated by the gain of some other drug developed in its place. Good drugs are hard to find,252 and firms cannot easily identify patentable drugs of comparable quality to replace the unpatentable ones they discard.253 249 See supra notes 100-104, 109-111, 200. 250 See GENERIC DRUG ENTRY PRIOR TO PATENT EXPIRATION : AN FTC STUDY 10, 57 (Federal Trade Commission, 2002). Up until the late 1990s, FDA regulations made it difficult for generic drug companies to receive the 180-day period of gene ric exclusivity intended to reward them for successfully challenging a drug patent. See ERNST R. BERNDT ET AL ., D O AUTHORIZED GENERIC DRUGS DETER PARAGRAPH IV CERTIFICATIONS ? RECENT EVIDENCE 5 (Apr. 17, 2007) at http://www.analysisgroup.com/analysisgroup/uploade dFiles/Publishing/Article s/PhRMA_Authorized_Gen eric_Entry.pdf. In fact, between 1984 and 1997, there were only thr ee occasions when the FDA granted a 180-day exclusivity period to a generic-drug company. See GENERIC DRUG ENTRY PRIOR TO PATENT EXPIRATION , supra, at 57. Not surprisingly, generic companies initiated relatively few challenges on pharmaceutical company patents during those years. See id., at 10; B ERNDT ET AL ., supra , at 19 exh.3. Starting in 1997, however, when a fede ral district court struck down the FDA's interpretation of the statute regarding the grant of 180-day exclusivity periods, see Mova v. Shalala, 955 (D.D.C. 1997), 140 1998), the number of generic chal lenges to pharmaceutical patents increased dramatically. See GENERIC DRUG ENTRY PRIOR TO PATENT EXPIRATION , supra, at 10; B ERNDT ET AL ., supra , at 19 exh.3. Those challenges are now so commonplace that the patents on successful new drugs are almost guaranteed to end up in litigation. See Alicia Ault, Generic Drugs: A Big Business Getting Bigger , THE SCIENTIST , at 36 (June 20, 2005); Bruce N. Kuhlik, The Assault on Pharmaceutical Intellectual Property , 71 U. CHI. L. REV. 93, 102 (2004). 251 See Telephone Interview with Declan Doogan, M.D., President of Research and Development at Amarin, London, U.K. (Jan. 25, 2007) (on file with author) (explaining that browsing technology makes it much easier for pharmaceutical companies to find pate nt-busting literature on th eir own products). 252 See NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH , RESPONSE TO THE CONFERENCE REPORT REQUEST FOR A PLAN TO ENSURE TAXPAYERS ' INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED _ (2001). 253 During early preclinical research, when company sc ientists are trying to select a drug candidate for further testing among a list of numerous compounds, each of which performed similarly in an initial 60Moreover, unless two drugs are so closely related as to be therapeutic substitutes, it is unclear why firms would shift resources over fr om an unpatentable drug to a patentable one. The R&D side of the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive,254 and firms should be expected to pursue all drug candidates with anticip ated net positive returns, not just the drugs with the highest anticipated ne t returns. Unless firms in the pharmaceutical industry are for some reason unable to borrow money or are experiencing long-term labor shortages,255 their decisions to drop a particular drug from development due to weak patent protection should have little effect on their decision s to develop other types of drugs. When pharmaceutical companies screen unpantentable drugs out of their pipeline, therefore, the public should not expect to receive other drugs in their place. The loss of an unpatentable drug is simply that, a loss. The social costs of losing such drugs lik ely far outweigh any benefits to the public from faster access to inexpensive generics of the unpatentable drugs that actually reach the market. As noted above, pharmaceutical companies rigorously screen the drugs in their pipeline to exclude ones with weak patent protection, which suggests that the vast laboratory experiment, the scientists are likely to move forward with a compound from the list even if the most promising ones were ruled out as unpatentable. See supra text accompanying notes 222-226. On many occasions, however, there is no second-best alternative. See David J. Payne et al., Drugs for Bad Bugs: Confronting the Challenges of Antibacterial Discovery , 6 N ATURE REVIEWS : DRUG DISCOVERY 29, 31-33 (2007). Moreover, even if a second or third-choice compound is available, by forcing the firm to work on a more flawed compound, the patent system is significantly reducing the probability of ultimate success in producing a safe and effective drug. \"Indee d, finding a suitable starting molecule is often the most challenging feature of the search \" for new drugs. Mitscher & Dutta, supra note 40, at 104. 254 See Scherer, supra note 18, at 29-33. 255 It is unlikely that drug development is being st ymied by a shortage of capital in the pharmaceutical industry. Although capita l restraints might cause a pharmaceutical company to treat drug candidates as competing investment opportunities within a single budget year, see BARTFAI & LEES, supra note 135, at 58, those firms have access to the capital market s, and generally have good credit ratings. See Standard & Poor's, A Better Prognosis for Big Pharma , BUSINESS WEEK ONLINE , May 4, 2006, at 12. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies should be expected to adjust their annual budgets, if need be by borrowing money, to ensure that they can develop all of the pr ofitable drugs identified by their researchers. If pharmaceutical companies are leaving pr ofitable drugs on the table, it is likely because they lack the human capital necessary for pursuing all of the profitable drugs in their pipeline. In the long run, however, the demand for workers should lead more people to enter the industry. 61majority of those drugs are neve r made available to the public.256 Of course, some unpatentable drugs are developed despite thei r lack of protection, sometimes because the manufacturer mistakenly believed that th e drug was adequately covered by a patent,257 and sometimes because of unusual circumstances under which it is profitable to develop the drug without patent protection.258 If these drugs had been patented, it would have taken years longer for generics to enter the market, and cons umers would have suffered. So long as private industry screens the bulk of unpatentable drugs out of development, however, the harm caused by their loss likely dw arfs any benefits from faster access to generics.259 The magnitude of this injury is generally hidden from the public as a result of the early stage at which most unpatentable dr ugs are screened out of development. 256 See supra text accompanying notes 222-234, 249-251. 257 See supra notes and text accompanying notes 80-89 (dis cussing the development of Ultracet\u00ae). Mistakes such as these are likely rare, however, since pharmaceutical companies use redundant checks - at least three independent reviews - to screen out unpatentable drugs. See supra text accompanying notes 222-234. When companies mistake a patentable drug for an unpatentable one, however, there are no built- in redundancies to prevent those drugs from being discarded. As a result, there should be far fewer instances of firms unwittingly developing an unpatentable drug compared with mistakes made in excluding patentable drugs. On balance, therefore, these mistakes likely harm the public. 258 Pharmaceutical companies are sometimes willing to develop so-called \"orphan drugs\" without patent protection, since they cost less to develop and ma rket and are guaranteed seven years of marketing exclusivity. New drugs receive \"orphan\" status if they are approved for the treatment of \"rare diseases or conditions,\" which Congress defined as ones \"affect[ing] less than 200,000 persons in the United States,\" or ones \"for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing . . . a drug for such a disease or condition will be recovered from sales.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bb(a)(2). Once a drug receives orphan status, the FDA will \"not approve another application . . . for such drug for such disease or condition . . . until the expiration of seven years from the date of approval of the approved application.\" Id. at \u00a7 360cc(a). Compared with other drug s, orphan drugs are typically less expensive to develop because they require fewer clinical trials to secure FDA approval, complete their clinical trials over a year earlier on average, and are approved faster by the FDA. See Christopher-Paul Milne, Orphan Products\u2014Pain Relief for Clinical Devel opment Headaches , 20 N ATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY 780, 782 (2002). Moreover, because orphan drugs are generally prescribed by a small group of specialty physicians and have little competition from existing therapies, they cost much le ss to commercialize than ordinary drugs. See id. at 783. As a result, industry executives report that private industry is sometimes willing to de velop an orphan drug with only the seven-year period of market exclusivity. See Telephone Interview with Anonymous, Senior Intellectual Property Counsel, supra note 230 (noting that for drugs that treat rare diseases, the seven years of marketing exclusivity provided under the Orphan Drug Act is sometimes enough for the company to move forward); Telephone Interview with Declan Doogan, supra note 251 (same). 259 See supra text accompanying note 36. 62Pharmaceutical companies do not announce the drug candidates that they choose not to develop, including the ones dr opped on account of a prior disclosure which undermined their patent protection. While industry insiders acknowledge that many such drugs exist,260 the decisions to discard them are made behind closed doors. On occasion the public might catch a glimpse of one of these drugs, such as when the PTO rejects a drug-patent application for lack of novelty or obviousness. These PTO decisions, of which there have been many, 261 can end private industry's e fforts to develop the claimed drug.262 Even under these circumst ances, however, the injury to the public is usually obscured by the absence of clinical-trial data on the drug's safety and efficacy,263 preventing the public from knowing which of the drugs ultimately would have been approved by the FDA and how valuable those drugs would have been. The public-health 260 See Telephone Interview with Anonymous, Director of Intellectual Property, supra note 228; Telephone Interview with Anonymous, Senior Intellectual Property Counsel, supra note 230; cf.

Sept. 22, 1994). 262 When the PTO rejects a patent application on a drug for lack of novelty, it does not necessarily mean that the applicant will drop its research into the claimed drug, since the applicant may have other ways of securing patent protection over the drug. For example, in In re Hofmann , the PTO rejected the claims on a compound for treating HIV, but allowed the claims on a method of using that compound for the treatment of HIV. 1999 WL 33548892 , at *4-5 (Bd. Pat. App. & Interf. Sept . 14, 1999). Although these method-of- use patents are considered weaker than a patent on the compound itself, see Anton Hopen, Intellectual Property in Drug Development: A Report from a Breakout Session , 25 R ETINA S95 (2005), and pharmaceutical companies are more likely to develop a drug when they have a patent on its active ingredient, see SCHACTER , supra note 40, at 50, method-of-use patents can provide sufficient protection to allow companies to develop the drug. See VOET, supra note 242, at 35-39. In many of the PTO decisions cited above and throughout the article, however, the rejections encompassed the method of using the claimed drug, which often leaves little room for pharmace utical companies to draft an effective patent. 263 See, e.g. , AVORN , supra note 113, at 39-68; Barry L. Beyerstein, Alternative Medicine and Common Errors of Reasoning , 76 A CAD. MED. 230 (2001). 63consequences of the novelty and non-obvi ousness requirements thus remain largely unobservable. There can be exceptions, of course, such as when the government funds its own clinical trials on an unpatentable drug, providi ng evidence of health benefits the public would have been receiving if private indus try had developed the drug earlier. One notable example involves the drug finasteride and its use in the prevention of prostate cancer. The PTO held that this use for the drug was not novel because finasteride had already been developed as a treatm ent for benign enlarged prostates,264 and anyone who used it for that purpose would inherently ( i.e., unknowingly) be nefit from its chemopreventative effects.265 With little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in this newly-di scovered yet non-novel therapy,266 the National Cancer Institute stepped in and funded its own clinical trial,267 demonstrating that finasteride reduces the 264 The FDA approved finasteride as a treatment for beni gn prostatic hyperplasia, although it is not widely prescribed for that purpose. See Christopher S. Saigal et al., Economic Evaluation of Treatment Strategies for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia - Is Medi cal Therapy More Costly in the Long Run? , 177 J. UROLOGY 1463, 1464 (2007) (finding that less than 10% of patients treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia are given finasteride). 265 In re Gormley, 1049136, at *3-4 (Bd. Pat. App. & Interf. 2001) (explaining that the mere discovery of \"a new benefit of an old process cannot make the process again patentable\"). The PTO has rejected other drug patents on the same grounds of inherent anticipation, including an HIV drug and a drug for raising HDL (\"good\") cholesterol levels. See In re Williams, 2005 WL 4773220, at *4 (Bd. Pat. App. & Interf. Jun. 2005); In re Levin, 2004 WL 1697793, *2-4 (Bd. Pat. App. & Interf. 2004). 266 Without patent protection, private industry was unlik ely to ever fund clinical trials on finasteride's chemopreventative benefits. Even with a patent, howeve r, industry would probably be reluctant to fund those trials without significant financ ial support from the public sector. Cf. Ronald B. Herberman et al., Cancer Chemoprevention and Cancer Preventive Vacc ines\u2014A Call to Action: Leaders of Diverse Stakeholder Groups Present Strategies for Over coming Multiple Barriers to Meet an Urgent Need , 66 CANCER RES. 11540 (2006) (discussing the various barriers to private investment in chemoprevention). Clinical trials on chemopreventative drugs are not only ex pensive; they also take about five years longer on average than most other clinical trials, which shor tens their effective patent life, and thus deters pharmaceutical companies from developing them. See id. at 11546-48. With a patent, however, private industry might have invested in further clinical trials to resolve unanswered questions about the drug and market it to physicians. 267 See Press Release, National Cancer Institute, First Pr ostate Cancer Prevention Drug Found, But Not All Men Benefit: NCI Announces Results of Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (Jun. 24, 2003), at http://www.cancer.gov/newscente r/pressreleases/PCPTresults. 64incidence of prostate cancer in men ag e 55 years and older by almost 25 percent.268 Although there were concerns at first that finasteride might increase the risk for high- grade prostate cancer,269 recent studies suggest the opposite,270 and experts have grown increasingly confident that wider use of finasteride would significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by prostate cancer.271 Publicly-funded re search of this sort is often slow to influence physician practices,272 however, and the concerns over high-grade cancer still deter most physicia ns from prescribing finasteride as a prophylactic.273 While a pharmaceutical company w ould likely have greater success in promoting finasteride,274 none of them have an incenti ve to fund studies that would resolve lingering questions about the drug's safety, seek FDA approval for its use in 268 See Ian M.

See, e.g., AVORN , supra note 113, at 292-312. 65preventing prostate cancer, or market th e therapy to physicians. Without these commercialization efforts, it may be year s before the medical community reaches a consensus on the appropriate role for this unpatentable therapy.275 Whenever the patent rules prevent the introduction of a new drug or therapy, or even just delay it, as may be happening with finasteride, the injury to the public can be severe. Over two hundred thousand men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States this year, and over twenty-s even thousand will die from the disease.276 If finasteride works as many experts anticipate, then the current delay in its use could be causing thousands of unnecessary deaths.277 This is not the only example of a potentially valuable but unpatentable therapy the public is not using. Untold numbers of other drugs have been screened out of development by pharmaceutical companies for reasons related to their patentability, perhap s including drugs for HIV, ca ncer, heart dis ease, stroke, diabetes, malaria, tuberculosis and diarrhea278 - conditions that afflict and kill millions of people each year.279 Losing an effective treatment fo r any one of those conditions would be a tragedy, even if it offers only minor improvements in health outcomes. The public relies on the patent system to promote pharmaceutical innovation; encouraging not just the invention of ne w drugs, but also their development and commercialization. When the system fails, and private industry is give n little incentive to 275 See Telephone Interview with Ian M.

The widespread pr actice among pharmaceutical companies of screening their drug candidates to remove ones with insufficient patent protection indicates that these loses are likely real. Current patent policy, which withholds patent protection from drugs because they lack novelty or are obvious, therefore poses a substantial threat to the public's wellbeing. IV. SOLUTIONS Patent reform is now a popular subject among scholars and policymakers, but the calls for reform rarely seek addi tional protections for pharmaceuticals.280 Indeed, the pharmaceutical industry is thought to be one of the few places where the patent system is effective at promoting innovation.281 Since the patent system seems to be failing for many other industries,282 several scholars have suggested adopting technology-specific patent rules to deal with the distinct attributes of different technologies.283 Others favor a system of unitary patent laws and often a dvocate stricter enforcement of the existing patent standards.284 With rare exception,285 however, neither side of this debate has 280 See Robert A. Armitage, The Conundrum Confronting Congress: The Patent System Must Be Left Untouched While Being Radically Reformed , 5 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL . PROP. L. 268, 268-73 (2006); Clarisa Long, Our Uniform Patent System , 55 F ED. LAW. 44, 45-47 (2008). 281 See Armitage, supra note 280; B ESSEN & MEURER , supra 1, at 14-16; J AFFE & note 1, at 39-41; S CHERER , supra note 39. The most common call for drug-patent reform is to crackdown on patent evergreening, where firms try to extend the patent lives on their drugs. See, e.g., Burk & Lemley, supra note 21, at 1687; S CHERER , supra note 39, at 50. 282 See BESSEN & MEURER , supra note 1, at 14-16; S CHERER , supra note 39. 283 See, e.g. , Peter S. Menell, A Method for Reforming the Patent System , Berkeley Center for Law and Technology: Law and Technology Scholarship, Paper 34 (May 3, 2007) at http://repositories.cdlib.org/bclt/lts/34; William Fisher, The Disaggregation of Intellectual Property: How the Laws of Intellectual Property have Grown - and Grown Apart , HARVARD LAW BULLETIN (Summer 2004); cf. Burk & Lemley, supra note 21, at 1634-38. 284 See JAFFE & LERNER , supra note 1, at 203-05; Long, supra note 280. 285 See infra note 292. 67focused on ways of improving th e patent system for drugs,286 believing that its role in identifying and rewarding valuab le drugs is largely a succes s story and (except for some concerns over \"ever greening\" patents)287 should be left untouched.288 Scholars have overlooked how the patent standards s uppress pharmaceutical innovation by limiting patents to innovative new ideas fo r drugs, such that the system offers no incentive for the development of socially valuable drugs that were disclosed or made to look promising in earlier publications. Congress has several tools at its disposal for encouraging the development of these drugs, including patent-law reforms, direct government funding of clinical trials, and, most promisingly, market-exclusivity awar ds enforced through the FDA. Part A of this section outlines changes to the novelty and non-obviousness requirements that would prevent drugs from falling into the public domain prematurely, noting several drawbacks to this approach. Part B discusses Congress' possible role in financing the development of unpatentable drugs, and how presently th e government is generally incapable of successfully prosecuting this task. Part C argues that the best way to motivate the development of unpatentable drugs is through FDA regulations. Although pharmaceutical companies now rely on the patent system to recoup their R&D investments, typically requiring ten or more years of market exclusivity on the products they develop,289 the FDA could provide this same period of exclusivity by simply postponing its regulatory ap proval of generics. Sinc e the FDA's clinical-trial 286 See supra note 280. 287 See supra note 115. 288 See Armitage, supra note 280. Cf. B ESSEN & MEURER , note 1; S CHERER , supra note 39. 289 See Telephone Interview with Anonymous Director of Intellectual Property, supra note 228 (explaining that firms typically invest in a new drug only if they expect at least ten years of marketing exclusivity); cf. Grabowski, supra note 38, at 20. 68requirements are the reason why firms rarely develop drugs wit hout protection from generic competitors, FDA-administered exclus ivity periods link the reward of exclusivity with the need for that protection, offering a convenient fix for the patent system's inadequacies in promoting drug development. A. Patent Reform Perhaps the most obvious solution to the problem of unpatentable drugs is to make those drugs patentable again. Congress could carve out an exemption in the novelty and non-obviousness standards for drugs th at must be proven safe and effective in clinical trials before they can be sold to the public. 290 This legislative response would likely have costs, however. Such a drama tic change in the nove lty and non-obviousness requirements might open the door to abusive patenting strategies, and could even be considered unconstitutional under current S upreme Court precedent. More modest reforms in the patent standards might avoid th ese problems, but would only help to incent the development of a much smaller group of drugs. Patent reforms are therefore a second-best solution. To address the problem caused by the novelty and non-obviousness standards, Congress could amend those rules to ensure that drugs can be patented if they must still complete the FDA's clinical trial requirements. With respect to the novelty requirement, it could carve out an exception that allows rese archers to patent drugs that have not yet been developed and are not otherwise cove red by a valid patent or pending patent 290 Congress adopted a version of this approach for certain biologic drugs in 1996, inserting a special provision in the non-obviousness statute to safeguard the patentability of particular biotechnological The non-obviousness requi rement could be similarly adjusted to provide that a drug is not obvious unless there is no longer any need for it to be tested in rigorous clinical trials to satisfy the FDA's safety and efficacy standards. Indeed, Congress could explicitly tie the non-obviousness standards for pharmaceutical patents to the FDA's regulatory requirements, such that a drug is n on-obvious if it must complete the full panoply of FDA-required clinical trials before the public can benefit from its use.292 In circumstances where the FDA will approve a ne w drug based almost entirely on clinical- trial data submitted for another drug, as it does with generics and certain formulation changes in existing drugs, then the trad itional non-obviousness test (or perhaps a much stricter one) would be appropriate. One problem with these proposals for amending the novelty and non-obviousness requirements is that they might be difficult to implement without inadvertently allowing firms to engage in abusive patenting strategies . Both requirements pl ay an important role 291 It is possible that this rule might violate the TR IPS Agreement, which states that \"patents shall be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to . . . the field of technology.\" Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), Apr. 15, 1994, art. 27(1), 33 I.L.M. 81, 93-94; see Burk & Lemley, supra note 21, at 1678. Nonetheless, the United States patent laws already contain certain industry-sp ecific provisions designed to benefit the pharmaceutical industry, such as an exemption in the non-obviousness requirement for certain types of biotechnology patents, see 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(b), and patent-term extensions for pharmaceuticals, see 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156. The reason why these provisions have not yet been challenged is likely because the TRIPS provisio n can only be enforced through the World Trade Organization's (WTO) disput e resolution procedures, wh ich require a challenge from another member country. See TRIPS Agreement, art. 64(1). Th e only remedy the WTO can provide is to authorize the challenger to impose trade sanctions against the violating member. See id. With respect to the law proposed above, which would exempt certain pharmaceutical patents from the novelty requirement, there is a chan ce that the law could be challenged by a country with a substantial stake in the generic-drug industry, such as India or Israel. See Shimon Amselem, The Biopharmaceutical Industry in Israel , B USINESS BRIEFING : PHARMATECH 2002, at http://www.touchbriefing.com/pdf/17/pt 031_r_2_amselem.pdf; William Greene, The Emergence of India's Pharmaceutical Industry and Implications for the U.S. Generic Drug Market, U.S. International Trade Commission, Office of Economics, Working Paper No. 2007-05-A (May 2007). However, since the existing industry-specific patent provisions in U.S. la w have not yet been attacked, the threat of such a challenge may be limited. 292 Stuart Benjamin and Arti Rai have argued that th e PTO already has authority to adopt regulations allowing it to grant patents on obvious inventions when patents are necessary to promote their development, citing gene therapies as an example of where this might be appropriate. See Benjamin & Rai, supra note 170, at 308. 70in limiting the scope of the patents that issu e, preventing firms from asserting monopoly power over too wide an expanse of technology.293 To prevent overly-aggressive patenting, therefore, Congress would have to carefully tailor the pr oposed exemptions so that firms could only claim non-novel or obvious drugs in narrow patents. The statute would have to walk a delicate line, however, allowing patent claims on drugs that are strong enough to prevent generic competitors from entering the market,294 but not so strong as to prevent other pharmaceutical companies from pursuing related lines of research.295 Other problems might also aris e from changing the novelty and non- obviousness requirements, such as pharmaceutic al companies using the new provisions to \"evergreen\" their drug patents by using new patent filings to block generic entry after their original patents expire.296 Pharmaceutical companies have been very creative in their litigation tactics,297 and any dramatic alterations to the patentability standards are likely to produce unexpected results. An additional concern with modifying the novelty and non-obviousness requirements to allow the patenting of undeveloped drugs is that it might be unconstitutional under current Supreme Court precedent. Congress can only use the patent system \"[t]o promote the Progress of . . . useful Arts,\"298 and according to the Supreme Court, this rule prevents Congress from \"authoriz[ing] the issuance of patents 293 See MERGES & DUFFY , supra note 65, at 383; Suzanne Scotchmer & Jerry Green, Novelty and Disclosure in Patent Law , 21 RAND J. ECON. 131 (1990). 294 See F. M. Scherer, The Pharmaceutical Industry - Prices and Progress , 351 N. ENG. J. MED. 927, 927 (2004) (\"Drug patents provide particularly strong protection against competition from other companies because even a slightly different molecular variant must undergo the full panoply of clinical tests required by the FDA.\"). 295 One possible approach to this craf ting such a statute would be to tie the exemptions for non-novel and obvious drugs to the FDA regulations governing the approval of generic products and the definition of a \"bioequivalent\" drug. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(8)(B). supra note 115, at 348-49. 298 U.S. CONST . art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8. 71whose effects are to remove existe nt knowledge from the public domain.\"299 Since the Court has said the purpose of the novelty and non-obviousness requirements is \"to exclude from consideration for patent protect ion knowledge that is already available to the public,\"300 those two doctrines may be constitutional limita tions on Congress's power to authorize the grant of patents. As a re sult, the courts might strike down a law that permits the patenting of any old or obvious in vention, even a law directed toward drugs that are unlikely to reach the public without patent protection. There are other doctrinal reforms that w ould partially resolve the problem posed by the novelty requirement wit hout running afoul of the Supr eme Court's interpretation of the Patent Clause, such as changing the law to make it harder for drugs to fall into the public domain. One of the most significant pr oblems with the curre nt novelty doctrine is the ease with which it allows seemingly trivial disclosures to anticipate later-filed patents on a drug. This hair-trigger approach to th e novelty doctrine is often to blame for the new drugs that fall into the public domain pr ematurely. If Congress wishes to preserve the patentability of those drugs, it could simp ly increase the amount of information that must be disclosed about a drug be fore it is considered not no vel. In particular, Congress could amend the novelty requirement to ensu re that pharmaceutical patents cannot be anticipated by a prior disclosure unless that disclosure would have been sufficient to support a patent on the drug. This reform would resolve only some of the problems caused by the novelty requirement, 301 however, and none of the problems caused by the 299 Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 6 (1966). 300 Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 148 (1989). 301 For example, many of the drugs disclosed by academic researchers in scientific publications might still be considered not novel under this proposed rule. Moreover, pharmaceutical companies and universities sometimes just make a mistake in their effort to patent a drug, creating a sufficient disclosure of the invention but failing to follow through on their patent application. See, e.g. , In re Application of Weichselbaum, 2006 WL 4494416, at *2 (Com'r Pat., May 3, 2006). 72non-obviousness standard. Additionally, sinc e the heightened novelty requirement imposed by courts has been useful in blocki ng certain evergreening strategies, the courts might need to craft other doctrines to block those potentially abusive litigation techniques.302 The loss of drugs caused by the current novelty and non-obviousness requirements is a serious problem, and Congress would be justified in reforming the patent laws to ensure that those doctrines no longer deter the deve lopment of socially valuable drugs. These reforms would come at a price, however, and the most effective ones might actually be unconstitutional. Modifying the novelty and non-obviousness requirements to avoid the problem of unpate ntable drugs is therefore a second-best solution. B. Direct Government Funding Rather than relying on patent reforms to promote the development of socially valuable drugs that currently cannot be pate nted, Congress could finance the development of those drugs itself. This approach would allow generi c manufacturers to enter the market immediately after a drug is approve d by the FDA, saving consumers from the high prices of patented drugs. Unfortuna tely, the government lacks the capacity to reliably develop these drugs, since it would be unable to identify most of them or complete their preclinical development, ha s a history of grossly underfunding clinical research, and usually fails to effectively disseminate knowledge of publicly developed therapies to medical practitioners. Without a dramatic overhaul of the current system for 302 See supra text accompanying notes 114-116. 73financing pharmaceutical R&D, therefore, government-funded drug development is not a feasible solution to the probl em of unpatentable drugs. The most intuitively appealing strategy for promoting the development of drugs that cannot be patented under the novelty and non-obviousness requirements is for the government to directly fund the clinical trials needed for their approval by the FDA. Information about the safety and efficacy of drugs is a classic example of a public good.303 If the government were to produce that informati on on its own, allowing drug companies to manufacture and sell old or obv ious drugs without ha ving to invest in clinical trials, the lack of patent protection would cease to be a problem. Moreover, since these drugs would still be in the public domain, people would have access to them at generic prices right away, shie lding them from the hardship caused by the higher prices of patented drugs. In theor y, therefore, the public would be best served by a system where the government directly funds the necessa ry clinical trials on unpatentable drugs, as opposed to relying on the award of monopoly rights to en courage private industry to develop them. As a practical matter, however, ther e are a number of reasons why the government is probably incapable of reliab ly developing and commercializing these drugs. First, in most cases the government wo uld find it difficult to identify the old or obvious drugs to develop.304 Those drugs may have been disclosed to the public in some sense, but their potential value is often know n only to the pharmaceutical companies that chose not to develop them. It is unlikely that those companies would hand over such drugs to the government, especially when it has taken on the role of a competing drug 303 Cf. S HAVELL , supra note 10, at 111-13. 304 There might be a few exceptions, such as an obvious controlled-release version of an existing drug. 74developer. Without that assistance, the gove rnment would probably find no more than a handful of the old or obvious drugs discarded by industry.305 Second, even if the government knew about the unpatentable drugs that private industry discards, those drugs are typically screened out of development during early preclinical research, and the government is poo rly equipped to complete that preclinical work. At least two of the th ree patent screens that phar maceutical companies run their drugs through occur before they have fi nished (or even begun) the preclinical development work needed to evaluate a nd improve their pharmacological properties.306 This stage of research is not only an e ssential step in the drug development process,307 it is also one of the most complicated and difficult of the entire process,308 and government laboratories are not set up for this work.309 The human and technological capital necessary for developing a lead compound into a drug ready for clinical trials and wide- scale production is located almost exclusively by the private sector,310 and neither government nor academia could easily replicate that infrastructure.311 The government therefore lacks the technological capacity to develop most of the unpatentable drugs that pharmaceutical companies drop from their pipeline. 305 Perhaps the government could offer rewards to private industry for disclosing the unpatentable drugs that they would have developed but for the absence of patent protection. Establishing such a reward system would be complicated, however, because the government would need a reliable way of linking its reward to the actual value of the drug. If such a reward system we re ever devised, it is unclear why its use would be limited to unpatentable drugs. 306 See supra text accompanying notes 222-227. 307 See MacCoss & Baillie, supra note 224. 308 Galli 188, at 689; supra and government . . are ra rely organized . . . to embrace the drug discovery process in the multidisciplinary fashion . . . that is the modern paradigm by which new hits or leads are . . . transformed into new viable medicines.\" note 188, at __. 310 Martina Casenghi et al., New Approaches to Filling the Gap in Tuberculosis Drug Discovery , PL OS MED., vol. 4, Nov. 2007, at 1; John S. Lazo, Roadmap or Roadkill: A Pharmacologist's Analysis of the NIH Molecular Libraries Initiative , 6 M OLECULAR INTERVENTIONS 240, 241 (2006). 311 See Casenghi et al., supra note 309, at 3. 75Third, it is doubtful Congress would allocate sufficient funds for the development of unpatentable drugs. Although the potential benefits from government financing of clinical research are substantial,312 funding for government-sponsored clinical trials is chronically in short supply,313 and recent spending cuts reflect Congress's unwillingness to commit necessary resources to important clinical research.314 Private industry likely under-invests in clinical trials as well, since the social costs of clin ical trials are much lower than their private costs - which includ e the entire costs of medical care for study participants even though most of them would otherwise be receiving alternative medical treatments paid for by their insurer315 - and monopoly profits from the sale of patented drugs are lower than their social value.316 Nevertheless, the public still relies on private industry to finance the bulk of clinical research.317 If Congress were to be tasked with paying for the development of non-novel or obvious drugs, there is little reason to believe the funding would be adequate. Fourth, assuming that the government funds clinical trials on unpatentable drugs and establishes their safety and efficacy, th at research can fall on deaf ears without 312 See S. Claiborne Johnston et al., Effect of a US National Institutes of Health Programme of Clinical Trials on Public Health and Costs , 367 L ANCET 1319 (2006). 313 See Jennifer Couzin, Tight Budget Takes a Toll on U.S.-Funded Clinical Trials , 315 S CIENCE 1202, 1202-03 (2007); Mike Mitka, Scientists Research , 297 JAMA 1867, 1867 (2007); Charlie Schmidt, Public Cooper ative Groups Say NCI Trials Funding Inadequate; Some Turn to Industry , 99 J.

Unlike pharmaceutical companies, who aggressively market their products, the government is often content with publishing research outcomes in medical journals,318 which can have a limited impact on physician practices.319 The government-funded clinical trial on the use of finasteride fo r cancer prevention, described in Part III above, appears to be an example of where the government's failure to market a potentially life-saving drug is delaying (o r perhaps preventing) its widespread use.320 There are likely other examples as well, in cluding the slow pace at which the medical profession adopted antibiotic s as a treatment for ulcers.321 Although pharmaceutical 318 See AVORN , supra note 113, at 292-94. 319 See supra note 272. 320 See supra text accompanying notes 264-27 5. The government-funded clini cal trials on tamoxifen for preventing breast cancer might be another example. Cf. Liz Savage, Researchers Wonder Why High-Risk Women Are Not Taking Chemoprevention Drugs , 99 J. NAT'L CANCER INST. 913, 913-14 (2007). 321 Researchers first discovered that most peptic ulcer s could be cured with antibiotics in 1982, but because those antibiotics were off-patent, the researchers found it difficult to find a sponsor for testing the treatment in clinical trials. See Marshall, supra note 106, at 199. After a few year s the researchers were able to run a number of studies and confirm the effectiveness of the antibiotic treatment. Id. at 187-201. Nonetheless, the pharmaceutical companie s holding patents on acid-reducing drugs \"effectively drowned out much of the[ir] research by funding hundre ds of acid reduction trials.\" Id. at 199. Even after the NIH issued a consensus statement in 1994, a decade later, stating that ulcers should be treated with a combination of antibiotics and acid-reducing drugs, see NIH Consensus Development Panel, supra note 106, at 67-68, most primary-care physicians in the United States were slow to adopt the new treatment, largely due to a lack of awareness of its effectiveness. See Thomas Breuer et al., How Do Clinicians Practicing in the U.S. Manage Helicobacter pylori-Related Gastroinestinal Diseases? A Comparison of Primary Care and Specialist Physicians , 93 A M. J. GASTROENTEROLOGY 553 (1998). In the practice of medicine, \"[p]harmaceutical marketing is the most important source of knowledge about new drugs for most physicians,\" A VORN , supra note 113, at 292, and up until 1996, when the manufacturer of Prilosec\u00ae secured FDA approval for the Prilosec\u00ae-antibiotic combin ation as a treatment for ulcers, there was no one to market the NIH-recommended treatment to physicians. See H. Pylori Treatment Recognized by FDA , 53 AM. J. HEALTH -SYS. PHARMACY 1229, PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE PATIENTS 16-17 (1999), at http://www.mtppi.org/pdfs/pud_paper.pdf. It was not until the late 1990s that most physicians were treating ulcer patients in a manner consistent with NIH recommendations. See Roger J. Zoorob et al., Practice Patterns for Peptic Ulcer Disease: Ar e Family Physicians Testing for Howden, A National Survey of Primary Care Physicians' Perceptions and Practices Related to Helicobacter Pylori Infection , 4 J. CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY 326 (2004). It is likely that this change is at least partially attributable to the marketing efforts behind Prilosec\u00ae. See H. J. O'Connor, Helicobacter Pylori and Dyspepsia: Physicians' Attitudes, Clinical Practice, , 16 A ILMENT PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS 487, 493 (2001). 77marketing can be noxious,322 the failure to promote a valu able new drug can be just as bad when it prevents that drug from being used.323 For these reasons, and perhaps others, the government is ill-suited to the task of developing and commercializing unpatentable drugs. This is not to say that the government could never play a more direct role in the financing of drug development. It is possible that Congress could implement elaborate reforms to overcome the problems with government funding identified above, such as instituting some sort of payment or reward system to encourage private industry to develop drugs that cannot be patented. If such a system were to be created, however, it is unclear why it should be limited to only unpatentable drugs, rather than attempting to eliminate the deadweight loss caused by drug patents more generally. These types of policy propos als are beyond the scope of this paper. C. FDA-Administered Exclusivity Periods In the end, the best way for Congress to promote the development of unpatentable drugs is through the FDA, requiring the agen cy to withhold regulatory approval from generics for long enough to replicate the pr otection normally provided by patents. These FDA-administered exclusivity periods can fill the gaps left by the novelty and non-obviousness requirements by guaranteeing an ade quate period of market exclusivity to any drug that successfully completes the FDA' s clinical trial requirements. Congress could implement this proposal with only mode st changes to existing law, since the FDA 322 See generally ANGELL , supra note 180, at 115-72; J OHN ABRAMSON , OVERDOSED AMERICA : THE BROKEN PROMISE OF AMERICAN MEDICINE (2004). 323 This problem might be most severe when a non-novel or obvious drug developed by the government must compete against patented drugs being marketed by pharmaceu tical companies. 78is already required to impose short delays on generic manufacturers. Solving the problem of unpatentable drugs simply requires length ening those existing regulatory delays. Moreover, since the FDA's regulatory requireme nts are themselves what drive much of the need for protection in the pharmaceutical industry, linking the reward of exclusivity to successfully completing clinical trials is a sensible approach to promoting innovation. While pharmaceutical companies currently rely on the market exclusivity afforded by patents to rec oup their R&D investments, Co ngress could use the FDA to provide roughly the same level of protection. Generic drugs cannot be sold to the public without FDA approval, and Congress can build automatic delays into that process - lasting ten or more years - to mimic the effects of strong patent protection.324 A lengthy exclusivity period administered by the FDA should provide nearly the same inducement for pharmaceutical innovation as do patents, and therefore solve the problems created by the novelty and non-obviousness requirements. 325 Fortunately, the basic framework for these FDA-administered exclusivity periods is presently in place;326 Congress just needs to lengthen certain regulatory delays that already exist under current law. When Congress first author ized abbreviated regulatory review for generic drugs in 1984,327 exempting generics from the FDA's clinical trial 324 Since these FDA-administered peri ods of exclusivity are essentially trade secrecy provisions protecting the clinical trial data submitted by pharmaceutical companies, and do not guarantee market exclusivity, see infra note 329, they probably would not be subject to any possible constitutional limitations on Congress' patent power. 325 See Valerie Junod, Drug Marketing Exclusivity Under United States and European Union Law , 59 FOOD & DRUG L.J. 479, 484-85 (2004) (noting that marketing-exclusivity periods can encourage the development of unpatentable drugs). 326 See Eisenberg, supra note 115, at 359-61. 327 See Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration (Hatch-Waxman) Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98- 417, 98 Stat. 1585 (codified as amended in scattered sections of the U.S.C.). 79requirements,328 it required the FDA to wait between five and seven a nd one-half years after approving most new drugs before allowing generics onto the market.329 It is unclear whether these regulatory delays were design ed to encourage the R&D of unpatentable drugs,330 or, more likely, to simply coordinate th e timing of patent challenges by generic drug manufacturers.331 In either case, there is co mpelling evidence that the current 328 The FDA will approve a generic dr ug without clinical-tri al evidence of its safe ty and efficacy if the generic is \"bioequivalent\" to a drug that the FDA already approved. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(8)(B). 329 The duration of FDA-enforced exclusivity depends on the drug at issue. If a new drug contains an active ingredient that was previously approved by the FDA, then it receives only three years of data exclusivity. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)( iii). During that three-year period, the FDA will not approve generic versions of the drug in its new form or labeled for its new use unless the generic applicant relies upon its own clinical-trial data in support of the application. See id. If a new drug does not contain any previously- approved active ingredients, then it is known as a new molecular entity (\"NME\"), and it receives five years of data exclusivity. Id. at \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(ii). For NMEs, the e ffective duration of that five-year period varies depending upon whether it is patented. When an NME is patented, and the patent holder files an infringement lawsuit against the generic competitors trying to enter the market, the FDA typically withholds its approval of the generic product for seven and one-half years following the NME's initial approval. See id. When the NME is not patented, the FDA begins to accept applications for generics as soon as the five-year period expires, see id., and since it takes them an averag e of 16 months to approve an application for a generic drug, see Steven K. Galson, 2006 CDER Update 11, (Jan. 18, 2007), at http://www.fda.gov/cder/present/galson/ default.htm, the five years of exclusivity usually amounts to six and one-third years. In each of these cases, generi c companies can bypass the FDA-enforced exclusivity periods by submitting their own clinical-trial data. Th e only exception is for \"orphan\" drugs, which receive a different form of protection. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360cc(a); see supra note 258. 330 These regulatory delays may have been designed to encourage the development of unpatentable drugs, see H.R. REP. NO. 98-857, at 29 (1984), although scholars and policymakers have (until now) been unable to identify categories of unpatentable drugs that would justify the delays, see, e.g. , Junod, supra note 325, at 484-85, and it was widely assumed that any drug that fails to satisfy the patentability requirements deserves little or no protection. See John Thomas, Proprietary Rights in Pharmaceutical Innovation: Issues at the Intersection of Patents and Marketing Exclusivities , CRS REPORT FOR CONGRESS , at CRS-13- 14 (2006). 331 The existing FDA-administ ered exclusivity periods may serve primarily the interests of generic manufacturers. The Hatch-Waxman Act rewards the firs t generic company to successfully challenge a drug patent with 180 days of being the only (unauthorized) generic on the market. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv). This bounty system creates a race among generic companies to be the first to file a patent challenge. Absent the 5-year exclusivity period provided in the Hatch-Waxman Act, competition among generic companies would force them to file their challenges as early as possible. The successful companies would likely be launching their generic products just a few years after the origin al drug first entered the market. Sales of most blockbuster drugs do not take off until after their fourth or fifth years, however, usually after substantial marketing efforts. See Henry Grabowski et al., supra note 167, at 17-18. Consequently, the market-exclusivity provisions in the Hatch-Waxman Act force generic companies to delay their patent challenges in a way that likely increases their industry's profits. Cf. Alfred B. Engelberg, Special Patent Provisions for Pharmaceuticals: Have they Outlived Their Usefulness? A Political, Legislative and Legal History of U.S. Law and Observations for the Future , 39 IDEA 389, 406 (1999) (explaining that the five-year exclusivity period s in Hatch-Waxman \"did not deprive [generic manufacturers] of any important economic right since there is no real incentive to develop a generic drug until a market has been established . . .\"). 80periods of FDA-administered exclusivity are inadequate,332 since pharmaceutical companies continue to screen drugs with w eak patent protection out of their pipeline.333 If the existing market-exclusi vity periods were long enough to make unpatentable drugs a profitable investment, then private industry should already be developing them, even if the expected profit is less than what fi rms would receive from a patented drug.334 Consequently, although it is difficult to calcula te the precise optimal length of exclusivity for drugs,335 there is a very high probability that the optimal length is longer than the current five to seven and one-half years. By lengthening that period to somewhere between ten and fourteen years, Congress would at least provide a rough substitute for patent protection, 336 and thus eliminate the distortions arising from the novelty and non- obviousness requirements.337 Compared to patents, these FDA-administered exclusivity periods are a more sensible tool for promoting the development of unpatentable drugs, since the reward of exclusivity is given in exchange for satis fying the FDA's regulatory requirements, and 332 See Grabowski, supra note 331, at 21 (\"Only drugs with sales revenues in the top decile of new introductions would generally earn enough to recoup the mean R&D investment within 7 years.\"). According to several industry executives interviewed for this article, the FDA-enforced periods of market exclusivity are generally insufficient to justify the expense of developing and commercializing a new drug. See Telephone Interview with Anonymous, Director of Intellectual Property, supra note 228 (explaining that the FDA-enforced exclusivity periods alone are rarely sufficient for a pharmaceutical company to move forward on a drug project); Telephone Interview with Anonymous, Senior Intellectual Property Counsel, supra note 230 (stating that seven years of exclusivity is sometimes sufficient, although most often it is not); cf. Telephone Interview with Declan Doogan, supra note 251 (explaining that the 7 years of market exclusivity for orphan drug s is only occasionally sufficient for firms to develop them). 333 See supra text accompanying notes 222-251. 334 See supra text accompanying notes 254-255. Under some circumstances firms might discard unpatentable drugs even if the current 5 to 7\u00bd years of exclusivity is adequate for them to recoup their R&D investment; e.g., if the industry is facing severe, long-term resource constraints (perhaps a skilled- labor shortage) that forces firms to invest in only the most profitable drugs available. See supra note 255. 335 See Louis Kaplow, The Patent-Antitrust Intersection: A Reappraisal , 97 H ARV. L. REV. 1813, 1823-39 (1984). 336 See supra note 289. 337 Generics typically do not enter the market until 10 to 14 years after the initial launch of the name-brand drug. See Grabowski & Kyle, supra note 28; Grabowski & Vernon, supra note 28, at 109-117; Scherer, supra note 294, at 927. 81those requirements are the primary reason why exclusivity is necessary. The FDA requires new drugs to be proven safe and effective in clinical trials before they can be marketed, which involves tremendous cost and risk. At the same time, the FDA permits generic competitors to enter the market wit hout satisfying those re gulatory requirements, allowing them to free-ride upon the pharmaceuti cal companies' investments in clinical trials. Whenever the FDA requires that a drug be proven safe and effective in clinical trials before entering the market, therefore, so me guarantee of market exclusivity is likely necessary to encourage its development.338 Conversely, if a non-novel or obvious drug can enter the market without ex tensive clinical-trial testing, then th is lengthy award of exclusivity may be unnecessary. FDA-administ ered exclusivity periods link the promise of market exclusivity with the need for th at protection, and are therefore a logical approach to promoting investme nt in clinical trials. Other adjustments to these FDA-administer ed periods of market exclusivity might further improve the incentives for pharmaceu tical innovation. The duration of exclusivity awarded under a regulatory regime - as opposed to the less flexible patent system - could be tailored in accordance with the varying R& D costs and risks of different drugs. In fact, since the exclusivity peri ods would be awarded in exchange for satisfying the FDA's regulatory requirements, and those regulatory requirements are the primary reason why drug development is so costly, the FDA is in a unique position to link the duration of market exclusivity to the burden of meeti ng its own requirements. Longer and more expensive clinical trials likely require more protection, whereas shorter and cheaper trials 338 See supra text accompanying notes 21-30. 82could be motivated with a br iefer period of exclusivity.339 Additionally, the FDA could discourage the development of \"me too\" dr ugs by withholding the market-exclusivity rewards - or even regulatory approval - from new drugs unt il there is clinical-trial evidence documenting their therapeu tic advantages over older drugs.340 I t i s u n c l e a r whether such a policy would benefit the public,341 but it certainly makes more sense to use the FDA for this task than the PTO, which has neither the institutional expertise nor the experimental data necessary for making these judgments soundly.342 The only significant problem with the FDA-enforced exclusivity periods is that they might permit wasteful development races in clinical research, but this problem can be avoided. If no single fi rm is given the exclusive right s to develop a drug, multiple competing firms could decide to run clinical tr ials on it at the same time in the hopes of being the first to receive FDA approval. The FDA could easily prevent such races, however, since firms cannot begin testing a dr ug in clinical trials without the FDA's approval,343 and it could give its approval to only one firm.344 So long as the FDA guards against these development races, its abil ity to block entry by generic competitors is the most promising strategy for avoidi ng the harm now caused by the novelty and non- obviousness requirements. 339 Interestingly, the patent system currently does the exact opposite. The 20-year patent term runs from the date when the patent is filed, which occurs during early preclinical research for most drugs. As a result, the longer a drug is in development, the shorter its eff ective patent life becomes, even though the need for protection is likely greater. 340 See ANGELL , supra note 180, at 240-42; but see AVORN , supra note 113, at 365. 341 See supra note 192. 342 See supra text accompanying notes 184-192. 343 See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 505(i). 344 In the event that the initial firm fails to develop the drug, the FDA could allow another one to begin testing it. 83CONCLUSION The record of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry is one of the patent system's crowning achievements, and it can probably take credit for much of the $55.2 billion spent by private industry on pharmaceutical R&D last year alone.345 Nonetheless, there remains considerable room for im provement in the system. While many commentators extol the virtues of pharmaceutical patents in promoting innovation,346 and other scholars criticize those patents fo r providing too much protection over drugs,347 they have all overlooked how the patent system often fails to provide any protection to valuable drugs. These unpatentable drugs are generally ignored by private industry, and as a result, they rarely reach the public. This stunning failure in innovation policy is caused by the patent system's novelty and non-obviousness requirements, which have been crafted under the flawed assumption that patents are only needed to promote the creation of inventions, not their development or commercialization. Under current law, onc e the idea for a drug has been disclosed to the public or becomes obvious, that drug is no longer patentable. Without private industry to develop that idea in to an FDA-approved drug, howeve r, the public is unlikely to ever benefit from its use. Since pharm aceutical companies rarely invest in drugs without patent protection, the novelty a nd non-obviousness requirements take on a pernicious role in the industry: seemingly tr ivial disclosures of drugs often prevent those drugs from later being patented and developed; the drugs that appear most likely to be 345 See Press Release, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), R&D Spending by U.S. Biopharmaceutical Companies Reaches a Record $55.2 Billion in 2006 , at http://www.phrma.org/news_room/press_releases/r%26d_spending_by_u.s._biopharmaceutical_companies _reaches_a_record_%2455.2_billion_in_2006/. 346 See supra notes 1, , Engelberg, supra note 331; Mark A. Lemley & Kimberly Moore, Ending Abuse of Patent Continuations , 84 B.U. L. REV. 63, 82-84 (2004). 84effective in early res earch are singled out as being obvi ous, and are thus discarded by private industry; and the scientific advances that allow researchers to more easily identify promising drug candidates become the basis fo r withholding patent protection from those drugs. These ill-conceived doctrine s have a direct and negativ e impact on the investment decisions made by private industry, causi ng pharmaceutical companies to screen otherwise promising drugs out of developmen t due to perceived in adequacies in their patent protection. The public ra rely learns of these drugs, of course, because they are seldom developed for medical use. The de trimental consequences of the novelty and non-obviousness requirements thus remain mostly hidden from public view. In light of the tremendous benefits that pharmaceuticals of ten provide to society, however, there is great cause for concern. Congress shoul d prevent these harms by modifying FDA regulations to ensure that ne wly-approved drugs receive ade quate protection in the form of automatic regulatory delays im posed upon generic competitors. 85 "}
