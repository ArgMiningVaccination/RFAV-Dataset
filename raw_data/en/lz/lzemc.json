TAB A ONDCP Assertions 2 and training in how to identify and treat individu als with substance use disorders. Projects that support substance use disorder prevention, treatment, or re covery may be eligible for other Rural Development financial assistance programs. (a) Data - The funding set aside made available by the 2018 FB is managed in the accounting system by using funding codes that the program staff uses when obligating funding. The methodology described is based on these funding codes defining the nature of the funding set aside a nd the obligations incurred against it. Rural Development ob ligation data also recognizes that other programs may fund projects related to substance use disorder and includes that data through the use of TOA codes and NAICS codes associated with the obligations. (b) Financial Systems - The methodology described above desc ribes the relationship of decision units reported to ONDCP and the programs/activities as reported in the fina ncial system. The data represent the obligations re lated to the 2018 FB 20 perc ent set aside along with any other projects funded by other Rural Development programs as identified by TOA codes and NAICS codes associated with the obligations. (3) Application of Drug Methodology - The drug methodology disclosed in Section 7.a.(2) was the actual methodology used to generate the table require d by section 7.a.(1). Calculations are well documented to independently reprod uce these data. Also, calculations provide a means to ensure consistency of data between reporting years. (4) Material Weaknesses or Other Findings - There are no material weakne ss or other findings. Rural Development has not completed A-123 or internal compliance review on this specific program, but the budget and obligations would be included in the overall tes ting of the budget authority and obligations if the prog ram(s) were sampled. (5) Methodology Modifications - There was not modification of the methodology from prior year. (6) Reprogramming or Transfers - There were no reprogramming or transfers affecting the 2018 FB 20 percent set-aside funding. (7) Fund Control Notices: RD believes that the data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that complies w ith all Fund Control Notices issued by the Director under 21 U.S.C. \u00a71703(f) and Section 9 of the ONDCP Circular, Budget Execution. The funding estimates and expenditures are consistent with the approved drug met hodology and budget formulation. Jeffrey S. Machelski Associate CFO - Budget and Policy JEFFREY MACHELSKIDigitally signed by JEFFREY MACHELSKI Date: 2023.03.06 10:48:46 -05'00' National Drug Control Strategy : FY 202 2 Compliance and Accounting Summary is a rolling average of the five previous full performance years (FY 2017- FY 202 1) where complete data is available. Material Weakness of Findings There were no material weakness es or findings and funding and spending estimates are consistent with the drug/funding methodology established. Reprogramming or Transfers LEI is a budget line item within the N ational Forest System appropriation. Funds allocated for drug enforcement activities are apportioned on an as needed basis based on an evolving analysis of the workload. As such, no reprogramming or transfers were made. Other Disclosures LEI is a small directorate within a larger complex land management agency that comprises appro ximately .6 percent of the agency's overall budget. The Forest Service commits approximately $13 .52 million for drug control and enforcement activities. LEI currently has approximately 600 personnel actively engaged in drug control, eradication, investigation and interdiction in addition to normal mission activities and any further accounting would be overly burdensome on our limited resources. BUDGET Law Enforcement Agency Support Forest Service drug -related activities are directed to mitigate threats to the forest, visitors, and employees. LEI accomplishes this mission by detecting, investigating, eradicating and targeting enforcement measures that provide the greatest impact based on resource availability. Since Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCO) conduct the vast majority of marijuana cultivation on N ational Forest System lands , LEI partners with other Federal, State and local cooperators to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle these organizations. LEI continues to partner with the U.S. Department of J ustice through local U.S. Attorney's Offices to coordinate and support prosecutorial efforts. Additionally, LEI continues to partner with the Office of National Drug Control Policy and various High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) programs to effic iently combat illicit drug production on N ational Forest System lands and participates in Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigations through assigned personnel. The Forest Service also continues to work with our Federal partners to reduce cross -border smuggling activities on N ational Forest System lands to ensure the safety and security of the visiting public and employees on those lands contiguous with the international border. Since 2014 an alarming trend has developed in TCO mar ijuana cultivation operations. These organizations are smuggling into the United States banned and or restricted pesticides for use in their marijuana growing operations. This trend was observed initially as occurring in a few sparse marijuana grow sites where LEI personnel would infrequently discover small quantities of these banned or restricted substances. As of 2019, these hazardous materials are ubiquitous in marijuana grow sites within California and are beginning to be discovered on publ ic lands outside of California as well. As these hazardous materials became more prevalent in marijuana growing operations, LEI began a concentrated effort to rehabilitate and recover these sites. LEI will further concentrate on the reclamation of these s ites by engaging in targeted reclamation and rehabilitation based on resource availability. Management Assertions Obligations by Budget Decision Unit National Drug Control Strategy: FY 2022 Compliance and Accounting Summary LEI believes, based on a review of the data submitted in this report, that obligations reported by budget decision unit are the actual obligations and expenditures depicted in the table on page two. The obligations are consistent with the approved drug methodology on budget formulation and re present best estimates of planned and or actual expenditures. Drug Methodology The approved methodology utilized to create this report is reasonable and believed to be as accurate as is possible based on the following: Data derived from the legacy Law Enforcement Investig ation Management Attainment Reporting System (LEIMARS) and the new Law Enforcement Investigations Reporting System (LEIRS) is the best source of statistical data currently available to the Forest Service. Data derived from this system along with field reporting is utilized to assess and distribute law enfo rcement resources as efficiently as is practical. Law enforcement activity, including drug control and enforcement, is a cons tantly evolving situation requiring significant flexibility. Financial Systems LEI tracks as accurately as is possible expenditures and believes that the appropriations and expenditures reflected in the table are as accurate as is possible based on LEI's review and availability of resources. The expenditures represented in the tables are all consistent with the approved drug methodology. Methodology The methodology described in this report is the same methodology used to derive funding levels. Methodology Modifications LEI did not make any modifications to methodology for reporting drug control resources from the previous year's reporting. Material Weakness or Findings There were no material weaknesses or other findings. The agency annual audit assurance review did not uncover any material weaknesses or findings in agency financial or reporting systems. Reprogramming or Transfers No reprogramming or transfers were made. Fund Control LEI believes that the data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that complies with all Fund Control Notices issued by the Director under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(f) and Section 9 of the ONDCP Circular, Budget Execution. The funding estimates and expenditures are consistent with the approved drug methodology and budget formulation. ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Review. An agency or bureau included in the National Drug Control Budget with prior year drug-related obligations of less than $50 million may submit Alternative Budget Formulation Compliance, Detailed Accounting, and Performance Summary reports. Due to the Forest Service's total allocation of $13.52 million, a more in-depth analysis beyond this document creates an unreasonable burden and the Forest Service submits this alternate report and analysis.

Marshall European Center for Security Studies (GCMC) funded from the Regional Centers Account and the Security Cooperation Account. The GCMC receives internally reprogrammed funds while the Se curity Cooperation Account executes the Office of the Secretary of Defense's (OSD) identified counter narcotic (CN)/Countering Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC) requirements through the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Security Cooperation. The DSCA Comptroller Division utilizes reports from the official accounting system, to track CN and CTOC funding activity. This information is captured for the fiscal year and reported annually in October. The data is pulled from the financial system by the identified accounting details based on the programs identified as counternarcotic programs. DSCA CN activities are coded as Project Codes with specific Project and Tasks. The GCMC CTOC program is designated by OSD as a transnational program, and as part of its transnational mandate, it is able to focus its building partnership capacity (BPC) efforts on a global audience sourced from all Geographical Combatant Commands (GCC).

The TRICARE Encounter Data Operational Data Store (TEDODS) served as the data source for the purchased care information. The Medical Data Repository (MDR) served as the data source for the direct care information.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the budget formulation compliance reports for them to be in accordance with the Circular. The procedures performed in a review-level attestation vary in nature and timing from, and are substantially less in extent than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the budget formulation compliance reports are in accordance with the Circular, in all material respects, to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained if we had performed an examination. We believe that the review evidence we obtained was sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusions. We were required to be independent and to meet our ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical principles related to engagements conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The ONDCP National Drug Control Budget, \"FY 2023 Funding Highlights,\" March 2022, identified that the DoD has three agencies that have Federal drug control spending: the Defense Health Program (DHP), Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Counternarcotics and Stabilization Policy) (DASD[CNSP]) Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities, and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). DHP The Defense Health Agency, on behalf of the DHP, provided the DoD OIG the DHP budget formulation compliance report, dated October 7, 2022, that we reviewed to determine compliance with the Circular. The report contained budget data and addressed the required assertion that funding levels represented bureau level requests. The report did not address the assertion related to the timeliness of the summer budget submission, as the DHP did not submit a summer budget. The DHP annual counterdrug budget submission is aligned with the DoD's PPBE timeline. DASD (CNSP) Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities The DASD(CNSP) provided the DoD OIG the Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities budget formulation compliance report, dated September 29, 2022, that we reviewed to determine compliance with the Circular.

However, the Department in fact did not carry out an internal budget formulation pr ocess for fiscal year 2024 under which OESE developed or submitted a budget request to ONDCP in summer of 2022 . Consequently, the requirements of the ONDCP Circular are not applicable. ONDCP Circular Budget Formulation dated September 9, 20 21 (in section 9(a)(1)), indicate s that for agencies with no budget data applicable for the summer budget submission, the agency (1) notify ONDCP by July 15th that the agency budget formulation process does not include the submission of any agency budget proposal to OND CP for review or adjudication prior to development of the OMB -level fall budget submission; and (2) attest to this fact in this Compliance Report. The Department notified ONDCP by e -mail on Ju ne 7, 2022 that for the above reasons ONDCP would not be receiving a summer drug control budget request from the Department for the fiscal year 2024 formulation cycle. F or purposes of this Compliance Report we reaffirm that the Department's fiscal year 2024 budget formulation process did not include the submission by OESE of any budget proposal, budget formulation data, or other pre -decisional budget information to the agency for review or adjudication prior to development of the Department's OMB -level fall budget su bmission.

Over the past several years, the Department's activities classified fo r inclusion in the national drug control budget were funded under School Safety National Activities (SSNA) which is a broad discretionary authority under Title IV, Part F, Section 4631 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) . SSNA programs hel p States and school districts foster a safe, secure, and supportive school and community environment conducive to teaching and learning, which may, though not specified in in authorizing language, include drug prevention efforts; facilitate emergency management and preparedness, as well as recovery from traumatic events; and increase the availability of school- based mental health service providers for students. A subset of projects funded under SSNA comprise the only Department of Education activities included in the national drug control budget in fiscal year 2022 . The subset of projects supported under SSNA that have a drug control nexus, and for which funds are thereby included in this accounting of drug control funds, include (1) School Climate Transformation Grants and related technical assistance to help create positive school climates by developing and adopting, or expanding to more schools, the use of multi -tiered decision- making frameworks that guide the selection, integration, and implementation of evidence- based behavioral practices for improving school climate and behavioral outcomes for all students; and (2) dissemination, outreach, and other technical assistance activities that support and improve drug and violence prevention efforts. In addition to activities that include drug preventio n, School Safety National Activities carried out by the Department in 202 2 also included: (1) Project SERV (School Emergency Response to Violence) , which provides education -related services to LEAs and institutions of higher education (IHEs) in which the learning environment has been disrupted due to a violent or traumatic crisis ; (2) Project Prevent grants to LEAs to help schools in communities with pervasive violence break the cycle of violence; (3) School Emergency Management Activities, such as Grants to States for Emergency Management and the Department's Readiness and Emergenc y Management for Schools Technical Assistance Center, which helps schools, school districts, and IHEs in the development and implementation of high- quality emergency operations plans ; (4) Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grants and School -Based Mental Health Services grants, which help increase the number of counselors and other mental health 2 professionals to provide services to students in high- need school districts ; and (5) a small number of miscellaneous other school safety activities . Although the Department obligated funds for all five of these activities in fiscal year 2022, funds for these five components of School Safety National Activities are not included in the ONDCP drug budget and, therefore, they are not includ ed in this obligations report. DISCLOSURES Drug Methodology This accounting submission includes all fiscal year 2022 obligations of funds under School Safety National Activities, with the exception of activities that have no drug control nexus. Accordingly, the amounts in the enclosed table of prior -year drug control obligations include all funding for School Safety National Activities, with the exclusion of obligations of funds for (1) Project SERV; (2) Project Prevent; (3) School Emergency Management Activities ; (4) Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grants and School -Based Mental Health Services grants ; and (5) miscellaneous other school safety activities . Obligations by Drug Control Function All obligations of funds for the School Safety National Activities program shown in the table on page 2 of this report fall under the ONDCP drug control function category of prevention. Obligations by Budget Decision Unit All obligations of drug control funds in the table on page 2 of this report are displayed using the School Safety National Activities program as the budget decision unit . Methodology Modifications The Department does not have any drug control budget methodological modifications to disclose. Material Weaknesses or Other Findings The Department does not have any material weaknesses or other findings to disclose that affect the presentation of fiscal year 2022 drug-related obligations in this report. Limitations that affect the presentation of drug- related obligations in this report are explained in the disclosures below. Reprogrammings or Transfers There were no reprogrammings or transfers of drug- related budgetary resources in the Department of Education in fiscal year 2022. Other Disclosures The Department acknowledges the following limitation in the methodology described above for deriving the obligations of fiscal year 2022 drug control funds att ributable to the School Safety National Activities program: No t all obligations of funds included in the resource summary of this report support drug prevention activities \u2014 some of these funds support violence prevention and school safety activities that have no drug control- related nexus. 3 ASSERTIONS Obligations by Decision Unit The fiscal year 2022 obligations of drug control funds shown in this report for the School Safety National Activities drug budget decision unit are the actual 202 2 obligations of funds from the Department's accounting system of record for the School Safety National Activities program. Drug Methodology The methodology used to calculate the fiscal year 2022 obligations of drug prevention funds presented in this report is reasonable and accurate, because: (1) the methodology captures all of the obligations of funds under the School Safety National Activities program that reasonably have a drug control- related nexus, and (2) these obligations of funds largely corres pond to the display of resources for the School Safety National Activities program in the Department's budget justifications to Congress that accompany the President's budget. Data No workload or other statistical information was applied in the methodology used to generate the fiscal year 2022 obligations of drug control funds presented in the table on page 2 of this report. Where assumptions based on professional judgment were used as part of the drug methodology, the association between these assumptions and the drug control obligations being estimated is thoroughly explained and documented in the drug methodology disclosure and in the other disclosures in this accounting report. Financial Systems Financial systems supporting the drug methodology yield data that fairly present, in all material respects, aggregate obligations from which the drug- related obligation estimates are derived. Application of Drug Methodology The methodology disclosed in the narrative of this report was the actual methodology used to generate the fiscal year 2022 obligations of drug control funds presented in the table on page 2. Material Weaknesses or Other Findings There are no material weaknesses or other findings by independent sources, or other known weaknesses, that affect the presentation of fiscal year 2022 drug-related obligations in this report. The limitation of the methodology described above for deriving the obligations of fiscal year 2022 drug control funds in this report is disclosed on page 3. Methodology Modifications The Department did not make any modifications in the methodology it used to calculate its drug control obligations between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022. 4 Reprogrammings or Transfers There were no reprogrammings or transfers of Department of Education drug control funds in fiscal year 2022 . However, subsequent to the Department submitting its fiscal year 2022 financial plan to ONDCP, the Department reallocated various small amounts of funds across activities within School Safety National Activities . As a result of these reallocations the Department's drug control budgetary resources de creased by approximately $1.3 million , from $59.718 (as estimated in the financial plan) to the final amount of $58.459 . Fund Control Notices The Director of ONDCP has never issued to the Department of Education any Fund Control Notices under 21 U.S.C. 1703(f) or the applicable ONDCP Circular, Budget Execution. Therefore, the required assertion that the data presented in this report accurately reflect obligations of drug control funds that comply with all such Fund Control Notices is not applicable.

We also reviewed the Budget Formulation Compliance Report, which includes budget formulation information for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, 1 and the Chief Financial Officer's or accountable senior executive's asse rtions relating to the budget formulation information. CDC management is respons ible for, and submitted, the Detailed Accounting Repor t and Budget Formulation Complianc e Report, which were prepared in accordance with the ONDCP Circular National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews , dated September 9, 2021 (ONDCP Compliance Re views Circular). We performed this review as required by 21 U.S.C. section 1704( d)(1) and as authorized by 21 U.S.C. section 1703(d)(7) and in compliance with the ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular. It is our responsibility to e xpress a conclusion about the reliability of CDC's Detailed Accounting Report for fiscal year 2022, CDC' s Budget Formulation Compliance Report for fiscal year 2024, and management's assertions based on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified P ublic Accountants and the standards app licable to attesta tion engagements, 1Although CDC's Budget Formulation Compliance Report was provided to ONDCP as of fiscal year 2022, the budget figures reflect the fiscal year 2024 funding request. Amy Frontz and Christa Capozzola as described in the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) publication, Government Auditing Standards (April 2021). Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any ma terial modifications should be made to the Detailed Accounting Re port, Budget Formulation Complia nce Report, and management's assertions for them to be in accordance with the criteria. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from, and are substantia lly less in extent than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable a ssurance about whether ma nagement's reports and assertions are in accordance with the criteria in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Notwithstanding the limited nature of the engagement, we believe that the review evidence obtained is sufficient in accordance with attest ation standards and appr opriate to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion. We are required to be independent and to me et our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement.As part of our review, we performed review procedures on CDC's fi scal year 2022 Detailed Accounting Report and fiscal year 2024 Budget Formulation Co mpliance Report according to the ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular's crite ria. We limited our work to inquiries and analytical procedures appropriate for an attestation review. Specifically, we performed procedures for the purpose of expressing a co nclusion about the reliability of each of the assertions made in CDC's reports. Those procedures included reviewing CDC's drug methodologies and reprogramming or transfer of drug control funds, if applicable. We also performed procedures to determine whet her CDC submitted the summer budget timely and whether funding levels re presented CDC requests. Based on our review, we are not aware of any ma terial modifications th at should be made to CDC's Detailed Accounting Re port for fiscal year 2022 and CDC's Budget Formulation Compliance Report for fiscal year 2024 and mana gement's assertions for them to be in accordance with the ONDCP Compliance Reviews Circular.

The Medicaid total reflects the net outlays of Medical Assistance Payments benefit grants and the Vaccines for Children Progra m, administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Medicare total reflects gr oss benefit outlays. Attachment B FY 2022 Drug Control Methodology 1) Drug Methodology - The Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 Drug Control budgetary resources are provided are based on estimates of the projecte d costs associated with substance abuse treatment paid for by Medicare and Medicaid and are prepared by the CMS Office of the Actuary. See detail below how Medicaid and Medicare methodology is determined. a. FY 2022 Outlays/Enacted by Budget Decision Unit - CMS distributes drug control treatment into two functions: x Medicaid - Treatment x Medicare - Treatment Medicaid Treatment: Included in this Drug Control Accounting report for FY 2022 are estimated Medicaid outlays, rather than obligations, since CMS receives no direct funding from ONDCP. Based on the Medicaid Methodology stated below, OACT pr ojected $8,450.0 million in estimated outlays in Medicaid treatment costs based on the methodology below. Medicaid Methodology The projections provided in the above table were based on data from the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 through 2013, based on expenditures for claims with SUDs as a primary diagnosis. Managed care expenditures were estimate d based on the ratio of SUD expenditures to all expenditures for fee-for-se rvice by eligibility group. The estimates were trended forward to FY 2020 using the growth rate of expenditures by state and eligibility category from the form CMS-64 , Quarterly Medicaid Statement of Expenditures for the Medical Assistance Program, MAX data, and estimates are consistent with the FY 2023 President's Budget. The annual growth rates were adjusted by comparing the rate of SUD expenditure growth from FY 2007 through 2013 to all service expenditure growth and adjusting the growth rate proportionately. Medicare Treatment: Included in this Drug Control Accounting report for FY 2022 are estimated Medicare outlays, rather than obligations, since CMS receives no direct funding from ONDCP. Based on the Medicare Methodology stated below, OACT pr ojected $3,190.0 million in estimated outlays in Medicare treatment costs based on the methodology below. Medicare Methodology The projections of Medicare spending for the trea tment of substance abuse are based on the FY 2023 President's Budget baseline. These proj ections reflect estimated Part A and Part B spending into FY 2023 and are based on an analys is of historical fee for service claims through 2020, using the primary diagnosis code included on the claims. The historical trend is then used to make projections into the future. These projec tions are very similar to those for the FY 2022 President's Budget and vary only due to changes in the baseline. Within this methodology, an adjustment was made to reflect spending for beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, since their actual claims are not available. It was assumed that the proportion of costs related to substance abuse treatment was similar for beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans as for t hose enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare. These estimates do not include spending under Medicare Part D because there is not a straightforward way to get this information. There is no diagnosis code associated with prescription drug claims, and drugs used to treat SUD are often also used to treat other conditions. 2) Methodology Modifications - None 3) Material Weakness or Other Findings - None 4) Reprogramming or Transfers - None 5) Other Disclosures - None TO: FROM: January 1\u001b, 2023 Benjamin D.

Summer Budget Formulation Information FDA provided the FY 2024 summer budget submission to ONDCP on June 3, 2022. A copy of the submission is provided as an attachment to this memorandum. Timeliness of Summer Budget Submission I assert that FDA provided the FY 2024 summer budget submission to ONDCP at the same time as HHS.

HUMAN SERVICES Public Health Service Indian Health Service Rockville, MD 20852 TO: Director Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) FROM: Jillian Curtis Chief Financial Officer Indian Health Service SUBJECT: Fiscal Year 2022 Detailed Accounting Report In accordance with the requirements of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Circular Accounting of Drug Control Funding and Performance Summary , I make the following assertions regarding the attached annual accountin g of drug control funds for the Indian Health Service (IHS): Obligations by Budget Decision Unit I assert that obligations reported by budget de cision unit are the actual obligations from the Unified Financial Management Sy stem (UFMS), the agency's accounting system of record for these budget decision units, consistent with the drug budget methodology discussed below. Drug Methodology I assert that the drug methodology used to calcula te obligations of prior year budgetary resources by function for all Areas and Operating Offices was reasonable and accurate in accordance with the criteria listed in Section 6b(2) of the Circular. In accordance with these criteria, I have documented/identified data wh ich support the drug methodolog y, explained and documented other estimation methods (the assumptions for which are subjected to periodic review) and determined that the financial systems supporting the drug methodology yield data that present fairly, in all material respect, aggregate obligations from which drug-related obligation estimates are derived. The IHS methodology for estimating the drug control budget was established using the amounts appropriated for the Alcohol and Substance Abus e Prevention programs authorized under Public Law (P.L.) 102-573, the Indian Health Amendments of 1992. See attached table \"Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Treatment and Prevention Pr ogram authorized under P.L. 102-573\" for list of programs. This table reflects estimated amounts. When originally authorized and appropriated, the funds were allocated to Tribes in their Indi an Self-Determination contracts and compacts by specific programs. However, when the programs were reauthorized and captured under P.L. 102-573, some IHS Area offices allo cated the funds in lump sum while others maintained the specific program breakout. Theref ore, at the current time precise amounts of Page 2 - Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy funding for each program are not available. The table is maintained to estimate current funding level and is the basis of the drug budget c ontrol methodology. Excluded is the amount for the Adult Treatment programs, which represents the original authorization for IHS to provide alcohol treatment services. The focus on alcoholis m treatment is the reason for the exclusion. Drug Resources by Decision Unit: The IHS drug control funds are a ppropriated in two budget line items: 1) Alcohol and Substance Abuse (A SA), and 2) Urban Indian Health Programs (UIHP). The ASA funds are primarily allocated to Tribes under their Indian Self-Determination contracts and compacts, where they manage the programs and have authority to reallocate funds to address local priorities. Th e portion of the alcohol fund included in the drug control budget methodology is as described above, i.e., the entire budget excluding the amount for adult treatment. The UIHP funds are allocated th rough contracts and grants to 501(c)(3) organizations. The portion of UIHP funds included in the drug control budget methodology is for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism programs transferred to the IHS under the UIHP budget. Drug Resources by Function: Under the met hodology, two programs through FY 2007 were identified as Prevention programs, Community Education and Training and Wellness Beyond Abstinence. In FY 2008, one half of the ne w funds appropriated for Methamphetamine and Suicide prevention and treatment were also included in the Prevention function. The treatment function comprises the remaining program excludi ng adult treatment. In addition, the amount of UIHP funds is included u nder the treatment function. FY 2008, one half of the new funds appropriate d for Methamphetamine and Suicide prevention and treatment was also included in the Prevention function; these f unds are now referred to in the tables as substance abus e prevention and treatment. Application of Drug Methodology I assert that the drug methodology disclosed in this section was the actual methodology used to generate the table required by Section 6a of the Circular. Methodology Modifications None Material Weaknesses or Other Findings None Reprogramming or Transfers IHS did not reprogram or transfer any funds included in its drug control budget. Page 3 - Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy Other Disclosures None Funds Control Notices IHS was not issued any Fund Control Notices by the Director under 21 U.S.C. 1703 (f) and Section 9 of the ONDCP Circular Budget Execution , dated October 22, 2019.

Table - FY 2022 Drug Control Obligations The first table attached to this report is necessary for understanding the IHS drug control budget methodology. The table titled \"Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Treatment and Prevention Program Authorized Under P.L. 102-573\" shows the ASA budget line item broken out by the activities originally authorized in P.L. 100-690 and later included under P.L. 102-573. This table also includes the funding within the UIHP budget line item that supports alcohol and substance abuse treatment services. However, funds are not appropriated or accounted for by these specific categories, but rather as the lump sum funds of ASA, Ur ban Health, and the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. The second table shows the obligations of these funds as required by the ONDCP Circular Accounting of Drug Control Funding and Performance Summary.

CBP management prepared the Table of FY 2022 Drug Control Obligations and related assertions to comply with the requirements of the ONDCP Circular, National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews , dated September 9, 2021. CBP management was unable to provide supporting documentation for the methodology used in determining the drug control obligation percentages for each CBP program office. These percentages are applied to total actual obligations to estimate the obligations related to its drug control activities. The estimated drug control activity obligations are further broken down between interdiction and intelligence in the Table. Further, CBP management was unable to provide supporting documentation for the methodology used in estimating the percentages of drug control activity obligations allocated between interdiction and intelligence. As a result, Williams Adley was unable to assess the reasonableness and accuracy of the methodologies used and Drug Methodology assertion.

Drug Methodology U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is a multi-mission agency that calculates obligations by budget decision unit and drug control function, pursuant to an approved drug control funds calculation methodology. There are five program offices with in CBP that are tasked with drug-control responsibilities: the United States Border Patrol (USBP), the Offices of Field Operations (OFO), Information and Technology (OIT), Training and Development (OTD), and Air and Marine Operations (AMO). In conformity with the requirements of ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews, dated September 9, 2021 , each program office has developed a drug methodology to estimate the percentage of its obligations related to drug enforcement. USBP, OFO, OIT, OTD, and AMO each attribute their resources to both intelligence and interdiction functions. Page 2 The Drug Control Obligations table is based on actual obligations for each decision unit and program office named above for FY 2022. The obligation reports are generated by data reported in CBP's Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing (SAP) system, which is a DHS-approved accounting system. SAP is a fully integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that CBP uses to record and report obligations. Each program office multiplies its drug control obligation percentages by its actual total obligations per SAP to estimate obligations related to drug enforcement activities. The drug methodology developed and applied by each program office is described below: UNITED STATES BORDER PATROL (USBP) The USBP is responsible for controlling almost 6,000 miles of land borders between ports of entry with Canada and Mexico, and nearly 2,700 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and Puerto Rico. There were 19,234 Bo rder Patrol agents, as of November 5, 2022, assigned to the mission of detecting and apprehending illegal entrants between the ports-of-entry. These illegal entries include aliens, drug smugglers , potential terrorists, wanted criminals, and persons seeking to avoid inspection at the designated ports of entry due to their undocumented status. It has been determined that 15 percent of USBP's activities are related to drug activities. This percentage was determined based on a historical study of the hours worked by agents, canine officers, and core personnel at various border checkpoints with narcotic-intensive activities. USBP resources come from (1) the Border Security Operations program, project, and activity (PPA) within CBP's Operations and Support (O&S) appropriation, and Border Security Assets and Infrastructure PPA within CBP's Procurement, Construction, and Improvements (PC&I) appropriation. Of the 15 percent of obligations related to drug enforcement activities, USBP determined through the historical study referred to in the above paragraph that 3.5 percent of agents' efforts are related to intelligence and 96.5 percent are related to drug interdiction. Also, historically, the 15 percent of obligations are related to drug interdiction only. These activities include staffing permanent border traffic checkpoints nationwide, including 881 canine units trained in the detection of humans and certain illegal drugs that are concealed within cargo containers, truck trailers, passenger vehicles, and boats. In addition, agents perform line watch functions in targeted border areas that are frequent entry po ints for the smuggling of drugs and people into the United States. CBP is the lead agency within DHS for the development and deployment of border technology and tactical infrastructure to secure America's borders. Prior to FY 2017, CBP's Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology (BSFIT) appropriation provided multi-year funding for the CBP program office, USBP, to develop and install technology and tactical infrastructure solutions, enabling a more effective and efficien t method for controlling border security. While CBP still has multi-year funds available from previously enacted BSFIT appropriations, CBP transitioned to the DHS Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) beginning in FY 2017. Consequently, the BSFIT appropriation has been discontinued and counterdrug funding is now appropriated through CBPS O&S and PC&I appropriations. All anticipated and actual obligations for drug control activities are now being accounted for through USBP. Obligations for FY 2022 BSFIT carryover funds were captured using the standard calculation of 15 percent of BSFIT obligations. This data comes from a historical study performed by USBP, which provides reliable source data for the drug methodology described above. Page 3 OFFICE OF FIELD OPERATIONS (OFO) OFO estimates there were 3,316 CBP officer (CBPO) full-time equivalents related to drug enforcement on enforcement teams in FY 2022. Anti-Terrorism Contraband Enforcement Teams (A-TCET) work closely with the Passenger En forcement Rover Team (PERT) and Passenger Analytical Unit (PAU) teams to coordinate all enforcement activities. Although the primary mission of A-TCET teams is anti-terrorism, they also focus on all types of contraband, including narcotics. CBP estimates that 69 percent of the A-TCET is devoted to drug enforcement. The smuggling methodologies and their indicators are similar for both narcotics and anti-terrorism activities. Of the funding that is devoted to enforcement teams, OFO estimates that 85 percent is dedicated to interdiction with 15 percent dedicated to intelligence. OFO had 25,392 CBPOs in FY 2022, who, in addition to the interdiction of contraband and illegal drugs, enforce hundreds of laws and regulations on behalf of many other Federal Government agencies. The other Federal agencies include, for example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and Bureau of Export Administration, among many others. CBP subject matter experts estimate that approximately 30 percent of these officers' time is devoted to drug -related activities. Of the funding that is devoted to general officer duties, OFO estimates that 80 percent is dedicated to interdiction with 20 percent dedicated to intelligence. CBP uses a variety of Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) systems and Radiation Detection Equipment (RDE) systems as part of its layered inspection strategy to achieve its primary mission of securing the Nation's borders and protecting America from the entry of dangerous people and goods. These systems are also used to facilitate the flow of legitimate trade and travel across U.S. borders. It is estimated that 77 percent of the funding for NII is associated with general contraband detection, which would include narcotics. Of the total funding that is devoted to NII, OFO estimates that 70 percent is dedicated to interdiction with 30 percent dedicated to intelligence. Multiple types of NII and RDE systems are used to inspect sea containers thoroughly and quickly, rail cars, trucks, automobiles, pallets, and various packages and parcels for the presence of contraband without damaging the conveyance or its contents. These systems keep CBP officials from resorting to more intrusive and time-consuming manual inspections, such as unloading, drilling and dismantling. The Administration has announced a National Heal th Emergency to combat the Opioid crisis. Seizures of illicit fentanyl have risen substantially in the last three years. Despite increased enforcement actions, there has been a dramatic and disturbing increase in overdose deaths attributable to illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs. In response to this rise, OFO has begun to procure, deploy, and train employees to improve the agency's capability to detect and interdict fentanyl and other opioids. Those resources we re accounted for in this analysis. CBP has a limited number of narcotic detection devices deployed to its largest POE along the Southwest Border. CBP also uses three types of canine teams: narcotics/human, drug, and currency. CBP has 476 canine officers in the field. Of the funding devo ted to these canine teams, 100 percent of their time is devoted to drug interdiction. CBP has established and deployed a world-class detector dog Page 4 program to augment existing technology while establishing cutting edge detection capabilities. CBPOs use specially trained detector dogs in interdiction and to support specialized programs aimed at combating the terrorist threat at the Na tion's borders, international airports, and seaports. CBP's NTC addresses illicit narcotics smuggling on a global scale through an aggressive targeting and analysis program, identifying narcotics smuggling schemes in all modes of transportation. NTC has the lead role of identifying global trends and patterns in the narcotics trade and responding to these threats from a national platform. NTC creates system rules and coordinates with CBP POEs, other government agencies, and partnering nations to intercept suspect shipments, directly engaging new and active investigations. As CBP's focal point for counterterrorism strategy and policy, Counter Network Division (CND) supports frontline officers and agents and is the c onduit to senior leadership and the intelligence community for field-generated counterterrorism information. CTD ensures the frontline receives the tools and training to perform the counterterr orism mission and facilitates quick and accurate dissemination of relevant classified and uncla ssified intelligence between headquarters and operators in the field. 100 percent of the CND budget is estimated to be devoted to counter narcotics intelligence. This data comes from the Cost Management Info rmation System (CMIS) and an internal CBP Canine Tracking System (Canine TS), which provide reliable source data for the drug methodology described above. OFFICE OF INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY (OIT) OIT's budget supports the drug enforcement mission t hrough the acquisition, support, and maintenance of technology, and mission critic al targeting application systems. Of OIT's spending, it is estimated that 10 percent of Automated Targeting Systems software application costs; TECS; and data center operatio ns costs are in support of the drug mission. Of OIT's funding, it is estimated 40 percent is spent on drug interdiction and 60 percent is devoted to intelligence. The determinations surrounding the percentage of OIT spending that related to drug enforcement activities, specifically interdiction and intelligence, was determined through professional judgment, which provides reliable source data for the drug methodology described above. OFFICE OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT (OTD) OTD calculates the portion of their budget attributable to drug control funding by issuing an annual data call for all projected National Traini ng Plan (NTP) funded training courses to assess if courses contain any items related to drug enforcement material and activities. The curriculum of each course is reviewed, and subject matter experts determine course hours delivered related to drug enforcement for this task. If specific courses offered through the NTP contain drug enforcement related material, a specific percentage for that course is defined (hours related to drug enforcement training divided by the total number of course hours). Specific training programs identified include the canine training programs and basic, specialized, and advanced training for CBP officers and agents. O TD's day -to-day operational resources are attributed to drug enforcement activities at the same rate as the NTP course delivery which is 16.49 percent for interdiction and 0.68 percent for intelligence for FY 2022. These percentages vary during the year of execution depending upon actual course delivery obligation rates. Page 5 AIR AND MARINE OPERATIONS AMO is a critical component of CBP's border security mission and the DHS risk -based and multi-layered approach to homeland security. AMO applies advanced capabilities and employs unique skill sets to protect the Nation's borders and preserve America's security interests. AMO is the lead operational component within CBP responsible for air and maritime border security. AMO's mission areas include a ir, maritime, and land law enforcement; domain awareness; extended border and foreign oper ations; and contingency and national security operations. In this capacity, AMO targets the conveya nces that illegally transport narcotics, arms, and aliens across our borders and in the Source, Transit, and Arrival Zones. In FY 2022, AMO P-3 aircraft flew 6,146 hours in drug control effo rts, which represent 83 percent of all AMO P-3 hours. These hours were in support of Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) in the Source and Transit zones. AMO P-3's participated in the interdiction of 137,148 pounds of cocaine in the Source and Transit zones. This equates to 22.3 pounds of cocaine for every counternarcotic hour flown. AMO partners with USBP on land border security to provide close tactical ground support. Through operations such as wide-area surveillance, investigations, patrols, and tactical response in diverse environments, AMO is effectively able to perform counter-narcotics, prevention of imported and exported illegal merchandise or contraband, and other anti-smuggling/trafficking missions. AMO also operates the Air and Marine Operations Center (AMOC). The AMOC is a key element in CBP's counter -network strategy, responsible for assessing and countering terrorism, transnational organized crime, and other illegal activities. The AMOC advises, guides, and directs the operational employment of sensor technologies for DHS and CBP, managing the air and maritime domain awareness architecture. It integrates multiple sensor technologies, intelligence, law enforcement databases, open-source information, and an extensive communications network. It monitors the airspace of major security events, and houses and collaborates with the Office of Intelligence via its Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination cell that collects and analyzes multi-domain intelligence from a variety of sources, including CBP and USCG aircraft. Using flight hours spent performing drug-related activities, AMO has determined that 83 percent of the budget resources that support AMO are considered drug-related. Of the total flight hours flown by AMO, 21 percent were related to intellig ence and 79 percent were related to interdiction in FY 2022. The source data for the financial information/flight hour information is retrieved from Air and Marine's official system of record, the Tasking and Operations Management Information System (TOMIS). TOMIS has undergone a verification and validation by DHS and has been referenced in several GAO and OIG reviews, which provides reliable source data for the drug methodology described above. 2. Methodology Modifications The drug control methodology for obligations used in FY 2022 remained the same as the methodology used in FY 2021 for the reported program offices. Page 6 3. Material Weaknesses or Other Findings In FY 2022, CBP contributed to two of the Departmental material weaknesses: Information Technology Controls and Information Systems, as well as Financial Reporting. However, CBP's control deficiencies did not impair CBP's ability to report complete and accurate obligation data in the Table of FY 202 2 Drug Control Obligations. Also , during FY 2022, CBP joined other DHS components in making significant improvements in remediating areas of material weaknesses and worked to resolve financial reporting deficiencies through targeted remediation. The IT Controls and Information Systems area of material weaknesses continues to affect the Department's ability to fully comply with financ ial management system requirements. While control deficiencies surrounding CBP's accounting system, SAP, were attributed to access controls, CBP had sufficient compensating controls to ensure accounting records were accurate. CBP continues to undergo system improvement and modernization efforts, along with the Department. The outcome of these efforts will efficiently enable the Department to comply with government-wide requirements and thus reduce the need for manual compensating controls. 4. Reprogrammings or Transfers The data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that properly reflects all changes in drug-related budgetary resources th at occurred during the fiscal year, including reprogrammings or transfers. ONDCP approved all reprogrammings or transfers that individually or in aggregate exceed $5 million or 10 percent of a specific program or account included in the National Drug Control Budget in FY 2022. ONDCP has reviewed and approved the following DHS reprogrammings and transfers: x CBP Family Reunification and Intel Transfer/Reprogramming in the amount of $33.9 million. This transfer/reprogramming includes: o Family Reunification ($27M) - neither use nor source of funds contribute to drug interdiction or intelligence efforts. o Human Smuggling Disruption - Southwest Border Coordination Center ($6.9M) - this reduced USBP's drug rel ated budgetary resources by $6M. x Department of Homeland Security FY 2022 Reprogramming and Transfer Notifications in the amount of $318.1 million. This reprogramming increased AMO's drug related budgetary resources by $16.9M to cover pay shortfalls in the AMO Programs, Projects, and Activities (PPA). x ICE Southwest Border Emerging Requirements, Operational Shortfalls in the amount of $345.7 million. This transfer/reprogramming reduced drug related budgetary resources for AMO ($9.3M), OFO ($4.6M), and USBP ($15.4M). Overall, these transfers/reprogrammings reduced CBP's drug related budgetary resources by a net of $18.4M for FY 2022. 5. Other Disclosures There are no other disclosures that CBP has determined are necessary to clarify any issues regarding the data reported under ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews, dated September 9, 2021. Page 7 B. Assertions 1. Obligations by Budget Decision Unit The obligations reported are consistent with the application of the approved methodology, as required by ONDCP Circular: Budget Formulation, Section 7, for calculating drug control funding against the bureau's accounting system of record for these Budget D ecision Units. 2. Drug Methodology CBP asserts that the methodology used to estimate drug enforcement related obligations is reasonable and accurate. The criteria associated with this assertion are as follows: a. Data The estimate of drug enforcement related obligat ions is based on the methodology described in section A.1 above. This drug methodology, and the systems used to support this methodology, such as TOMIS, CMIS, and the AMOC Integrat ed Information Database, present a fair and accurate picture of the CBP drug enforcement mission. b. Financial Systems Security CBP's financial system, SAP, yields data that fairly presents, in all material respects, aggregate obligations from which drug-related obligation estimates are derived. As stated in the IT gen eral and application control weaknesses noted in section A.3, CBP's financial systems issues related to SAP are based on access control and CBP has compensating controls to ensure CBP can provide data that fair ly represent, in all material respects, aggregate obligations. The drug methodology described in section A.1 above is used to estimate what portion of these obligations may reasonably be associated with drug enforcement related activities. 3. Application of Drug Methodology The methodology described in section A.1 above was used to generate the Table of FY 2022 Drug Control Obligations. 4. Material Weaknesses All material weaknesses or other findings by independent sources, or other known weaknesses, including those identified in CBP's Annual Statement of Assurance, which may affect the presentation of prior year drug-related obligations as required by Section 7.a.(4) have been disclosed. 5. Methodology Modifications No modifications were made t o CBP's methodology for reporting drug control resources from the previous year's reporting. Page 8 6. Reprogrammings or Transfers The data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that properly reflects all changes in drug-related budgetary resources th at occurred during the fiscal year, including ONDCP's approval of all reprogramming or transfers affecting drug-related resources that individually or in aggregate for the fiscal year exceed $5 million or 10 percent of a specific program or account included in the National Drug Control Budget (21 U.S.C.\u00a7 1703(c)(4)(A)). 7.

The funds awarded are used in intelligence informed operations, which may assist with counterdrug efforts. Due to the intricate nature of these opera tions, CBP is unable to delimit the amount applied toward counterdrug operations; however, they estimate no more than 15 percent of OPSG funding and activity supports counter drug activities. As OPSG is not specifically a drug enforcement grant program there is no statutory or programmatic requirement under OPSG to specifically delineate drug interdiction activities or expenditures. OPSG grant funds are primarily used for personnel costs, which are no t reported by activity therefore the exact specific amount expended for drug enforcement cannot be determined.

ONDCP FY 2022 Compliance Report DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) Reference: ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews (September 9, 2021) SECTION 6 REPORTING - Budget Formulation Compliance Report 6.a. Summer Budget Formulation Information 6.a.(1) Summer Drug Budget Transmittal The date the FY2022 ONDCP Summer Budget was submitted to ONDCP was July 9th, 2020 6.1.(2) Summer Drug Resource Table Summary 7.a.(2) Drug Methodology The portion of FLETC's total budget considered to be drug resources is identified by historical trends of drug- related training relative to total student- weeks of training and the associated budget authority required to conduct that training. Advanced training programs with a drug nexus are considered to provide 100% support to drug enforcement activities. State and local training programs with a drug nexus are also considered to provide 100% support. All international training has a drug nexus and is also considered to provide 100% support. FLETC drug enforcement training support is in the following three training functions: Investigations, 96%; State and Local Training and Assistance, 3%; and, International Training and Technical Assistance, 1%. The percentage of the Salaries and Expenses appropriation that supports drug enforcement activities remains constant at 20.4%; however, the percentage of FLETC's total budget authority in support of drug enforcement activities fluctuates. 7.a.(3) Methodology Modifications The drug methodology for 2022 has not been modified from the previous year, 2021. 7. a.

Assertions 1: Timeliness of Summer Budget Submission ICE asserts the FY 2024 Summer Drug Budget Transmittal was submitted to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Budget Coordination on July 15, 2022, for further transmission to ONDCP in a timely manner. 2: Funding Levels Represent Bureau- Level Request ICE asserts the funding request in the submission provided in Section 6.a.(2) of ONDCP Circular: Compliance Review, represent the funding levels submitted to DHS Budget Coordination for further transmission to ONDCP without alteration or adjustment by any official at the Department to the best of our knowledge. U.S. Department of Homeland Security U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Detailed Accounting Submission of Drug Control Funding during Fiscal Year 20 22 A. Table of Prior Year FY 2022 Drug Control Obligations Drug Resources by Budget Decision Unit and Function: HIDTA Funds represent total authorized and available during FY2022 (multi-year funds: FY21/22 and FY 22/23) 1: Drug Methodology U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a multi- mission bureau , and obligations are reported pursuant to an approved drug methodology. ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Domestic Investigations , International Operations ( IO) and Office of Intelligence uphold U.S. drug control policy delegated amid the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP ) initiatives, by fully supporting the overall ICE mandate to detect, disrupt, and dismantle smugglin g organizations. Therefore, separate calculations are formulated to determine obligation data for the three ICE HSI sanctioned programs that undertake counter- narcotic investigative activity, presented in the table above. Thereafter, the following three (3) sections cover each program in detail. Domestic Investigations The methodology for HSI Domestic Investigations is based on investigative case hours recorded in ICE's automated Case Management System. ICE officers record the type of investigative work they perform in this system in the form of case hours. These case hours can then be aggregated to sh ow overall level of effort. FY 2022 Final (In Millions ) Drug Resource by Drug Control Function Domestic Investigations $612.835 International Operations $11.797 Intelligence: Domestic $28.455 Intelligence: International $ .628 Total $653.716 Drug Resources by Budget Decision Unit Salaries and Expense s - Immigration Enforcement Total $653.716 High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HID TA) Transfer $2.777 Following the close of the fiscal year, ICE uses Investigative Case Management ( ICM ) reports to identify and report the total investigative case hours coded as general narcotics cases or money - laundering narcotics cases. A second ICM report shows the total Domestic investigative case hours logged. The percentage of Domestic investigative case hours logged is derived by dividing the number of investigative case hours linked to drug-control activities by the total number of Domestic investigative case hours. This percentage may fluctuate from year to y ear. For FY 20 22, the actual percentage for Domestic Investigations was 32.12 percent . To calculate a dollar amount of obligation, the percentage is applied to the FY 20 22 enacted Domestic Investigations budget, excluding reimbursable authority. ICE uses the Federal Financial Management System (FFMS) , ICE's general ledger system, to identify the obligations incurred. International Operations (IO) The methodology for IO is based on investigative case hours recorded in ICE's automated Case Management System. ICE officers record the type of work and related case hours they perform in this system, which interfaces with ICM . Following the close of the fiscal year, an ICM report is run to capture investigative case hours coded as general narcotics cases or money-laundering narcotics cases. A second report is run to capture all investigative case hours logged for international law enforcement operations. The international investigative case hours logged percentage is derived by dividing the number of investigative case hours linked to drug-control activities by the total number of International investigative case hours. For FY 20 22, the actual percentage of hours that were general narcotics related was 8. 06 percent . To calculate the dollar amount of obligations for the IO drug control function , the percentage is applied to the FY 20 22 enacted IO budget, excluding reimbursable authority. The FFMS is the system used to generate the actual obligations incurred. Office of Intelligence ICE Criminal Analysts provide intelligence services for Domestic Investigations and IO to support criminal investigations aimed at disrupting and dismantling criminal organizations involved in transnational drug trade and associated money-laundering crimes. The methodology for the Office of Intelligence is based on intelligence case hours recorded in ICE's automated Case Management System. ICE Criminal Analysts record the type of work and related case hours they perform in this system, which interfaces with ICM . Following the close of the fiscal year, a report in ICM is run to capture investigative case hours coded as general- narcotics cases or money-laundering narcotics cases. A second report is generated capturing all investigative case hours logged. The intelligence investigative case hours percentage is derived by dividing the number of investigative case hours linked to drug-control activities by the total number of Intelligence investigative case hours logged for the Office of Intelligence. For FY 2022, 27.81 percent of the total case hours for the Office of Intelligence were in support of drug-control activities. To calculate the dollar amount of obligations for the Office of Intelligence drug control function, the perc entage is applied to the FY 20 22 enacted Intelligence budget , excluding reimbursable authority. The FFMS is the system used to generate the actual obligations incurred. The Office of Intelligence case hours recorded in ICM captures both domestic and international drug- related activity . The Office of Intelligence calculates the total percentage of case hours that support Domestic and International drug enforcement activity by adding the end of the year total number of Intelligence Domestic and Intelligence Office of International Operations drug-controlled investigative hours in ICM and dividing these totals by the total number of Domestic drug-controlled investigative hours and IO drug-controlled investigative hours. The resulting percentage is used to determine the amount that Intelligence does for international activities (2.12 percent ) and domestic activities (9 7.88 percent ) in FY 20 22. The respective percentages are applied to the total Office of Intelligence drug- related obligations as determined above to identify the relative international and domestic obligations expended by the Office of Intelligence for drug-control activities. 2: Methodology Modifications There were no modifications to the drug methodology from the previous year to report. 3: Material Weaknesses or Other Findings In the Fiscal Year 202 1 Department of Homeland Security (DHS or the Department) Consolidated Financial Statement Audit, ICE contributed to material weaknesses for Information Technology (IT) Controls and System Functionality and Financial Reporting. ICE continues to focus heavily on contr ols for all financial related systems, such as the systems used for financial management, invoice management, real property, time & attendance, and procurement. ICE has completed a full assessment of IT general controls for all CFO designated systems, continues to execute corrective actions for existing weaknesses, is remediating new weaknesses identified and conduct ing routine verification and validation to ensure improvements are being sustained. ICE recognizes weaknesses and will work to improve financial reporting related to accounts payable accrual, validation and verification of undelivered orders, and recording of seized or forfeited property. Last Fiscal Year, ICE made significant improvemen t in the monitoring and recording of obligations and downgraded its Budgetary Resources Management (BRM) Significant Deficiency to a Control Deficiency. Additionally, ICE will continue to improve on entity level controls over IT system Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM). While there were some Notices of Findings and Recommendations (NFR) related to the financial processes and systems, ICE continues to improve on financial reporting control deficiencies. The contributions to material weaknesses identified above, or the NFRs received for financial reporting, did not impair ICE's ability to report complete and accurate obligation data in the Table of Prior Year FY 2022 Drug Control Obligations. 4: Reprogrammings or Transfers During FY 2022, ICE had no reprogrammings or transfers. As a component of DHS, ICE submits all reprogramming and transfer requests through the Department for approval, and the impact of these changes is assessed by the Department. In FY 2022, the Department determined there were no reprogrammings or transfers that materially impacted ICE's drug -related obligations reported in the Table of FY 2022 Drug Control Obligations. 5: Other Disclosures There are no other disclosures necessary to clarify any issues regarding the data reported. B. Assertions 1: Obligations by Budget Decision Unit The Obligations reported are consistent with the application of the approved methodology, as required by ON DCP Circular: Budget Formulation, Section 7, for calculating drug control funding against the bureau's accounting system of record for these Budget Decision Units. 2: Drug Methodology The methodology used to calculate obligations of budgetary resources by budget decision unit and function is reasonable and accurate in regard to the workload data employed and the estimation methods used. The workload data derived from ICM, discussed in the methodology section above, is based on work performed between October 1,2021 and September 30, 2022. There are no other estimation methods used. The financial system used to calculate the drug -related budget obligations is the FFMS, which is reliable and capable of yielding data that fairly presents, in all material respects, aggregate obligations. 3: Application of Drug Methodology The methodology disclosed in Section A, Disclosure No. 1 was the actual methodology used to generate the Table of FY 2022 Drug Control Obligations. 4: Material Weaknesses or Other Findi ngs All material weaknesses or other findings by independent sources, or other known weaknesses, including those identified in the Agency's Annual Statement of Assurance, which may affect the presentation of prior year drug- related obligations as required by Section 7.a.(4) have been disclosed. 5: Methodology Modifications No modifications were made to the methodology for reporting drug control resources for the previous year to report. 6: Reprogrammings or Transfers The data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that, if revised during the fiscal year, properly reflects those changes, including ONDCP's approval of all reprogrammings or transfers affecting drug- related resources that indivi dually or in aggregate for the fiscal year exceed $5 million or 10 percent of a specific program or account included in the National Drug Control Budget (21 U.S.C.\u00a7 1703(c)(4)(A) in FY 2022. 7: Fund Control Notices No Fund Control Notice was issued, as defined by the ONDCP Director under 21 U.S.C. Section 1703(f) and Section 9 of the ONDCP Circular: Budget Execution, to ICE in FY 2022. NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 20 22 Summer Budget 1 FY 202 2 Summer Budget DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DIRECTORATE Resource Summary Budget Authority (in millions ) FY 20 20 Enacted FY 202 1 Enacted FY 202 2 Summer Budget Drug Resources by Budget Decision Unit and Function Research and Development: Interdiction $11.0 $8.4 $8.1 Total Drug Resources by Function $11.0 $8.4 $8.1 Drug Resources Personnel Summary Total FTEs (direct only) 2 2 2 Drug Resources as a Percent of Budget Total Agency Budget (in billions) $0.7 $0.8 $0.9 Drug Resources Percentage 0.02% 0.01% 0.009% Program Summary MISSION The scope and diversity of Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) missions requires the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) to address a wide range of programs including DHS Components' near -term needs for new operational capabilities and improved op erational effectiveness, efficiency, and safety for the Homeland Security Enterprise (HSE). S&T has responsibilities related to understanding and creating solutions for explosives, border security, cyber security, biological and chemical threats, and condu cting the research and development test and evaluation (RDT&E) required to meet other Homeland Security needs. S&T performs research and development (R&D) related to drug control in support of following DHS operational components: U.S. Customs and Borde r Protection (CBP) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) METHODOLOGY S&T's methodology is based on RDT&E projects that directly support drug control efforts. Since the projects directly support drug interdiction, it was determined that the entire ty of project resources was used to for calculating S&T's drug control efforts. NATION AL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 202 2 Summer Budget 2 BUDGET SUMMARY The FY 20 22 S&T Summer Budget was $8.1 million for drug control activities, a decrease of $0.3 million from the FY 2021 Enacted Budget. Research and Development FY 20 22 Summer Budget: $ 8.1 million Opioid/Fentanyl Detection - $6.3 million The FY 2022 S&T Summer Budget was $6.3 million for drug control activities, a n increase of $0.3 million from the FY 2021 Enacted Budget. The final report of the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis recognized challenges that limit DHS's ability to detect and interdict synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, that cross U.S. land, sea, and air borders, including international mail. High volume of mail, trade, and travel, the ability of synthetic opioids to be smuggled in very small quantities, low number of available automated detection systems and trained canines, and inadequate infrastructure are among the top challenges faced. CBP's Office of Field Operations has identified a critical need for technologies to be able to detect opioids and fentanyls and disrupt the illicit opioid supply chain. In coordination with CBP, S&T develop ed a layered set of solutions, including both detection hardware and advanced analytics, which can be deployed rapidly within existing operational environments to allow for efficient screening and interdiction of opioids at ports of entry at the speed of com merce. To enable agile and responsive support to CBP, S&T pursue d an iterative, integrated developmental approach and operational assessment. S&T made use of technologies, such as those used for explosives detection, and then, where technologies do not exi st, employ ed rapid prototyping of systems to identify packages suspected of containing synthetic opioids. S&T develop ed analytics to exploit available data (e.g., advanced electronic data, National Targeting Center, dark web commerce) to discover supply ch ain networks and augment decisions to screen certain packages. While mail and parcel shipments are the initial focus, resulting solutions may also be applicable to other environments such as air cargo processing and land border port of entry screening, amo ng others. This program continues to deliver screening at speed capabilities that enable CBP to screen more packages per day (increase efficiency and reduce the manpower, time, and costs associated with the inspection process) and confidently detect the p resence of synthetic opioids without exposing agents to the hazardous chemical. As a result, this program will likely increase the number of seizures/interdictions of illicit drugs, like synthetic opioids, thereby reducing the overall supply of drugs enter ing the United States and increasing the likelihood of successful identification of supply chain. Tunnel Detection and Surveillance - $1.8 million The FY 2022 S&T Summer Budge t was $1.8 million for tunnel detection and surveillance , a decrease of $ 0.6 million from the FY 2021 Enacted Budget . CBP and ICE have a limited capability to reliably detect cross -border tunnels, investigate discovered tunnels without putting NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY: FY 20 22 Summer Budget 3 an agent in the tunnel , and perform forensic analysis of the discovered tunnel to support investigations and prosecutions. The Tu nnel Detection & Surveillance program conduct ed market research, modeling and simulations, and operational experiments (OpEx) to enhance U nited States Border Patrol's knowledge of the state of technology modalities to detect, exploit and seal cross -border dug tunnels. Program conduct ed technology assessments to investigate the ability to detect tunnels under varying environmental conditions and collect and analyze samples from discovered tunnels to enable investigations/prosecutions. Direct impacts from th ese efforts include: (1) technical risk reduction to future activities of CBP's Cross Border Tunnel Threat (CBTT) program of record, (2) increased ability to investigate/exploit discovered tunnels safely, (3) increased arrests and prosecution of individual s involved in the creation/use of tunnels, (4) reduction of hundreds of tons of drugs kept off U.S. streets, and (5) savings of thousands of CBP and ICE labor hours. The FY 20 22 Summer Budget reflects a reduction in the total drug resources funding available due to an overall decrease in S&T's Research, Development and Innovation funding from previous years.

As ONDCP recommended to Secretary Haaland in its transmittal letters accompanying 2024 ONDCP Formu lation Guidance, If you have questions, please c ontact Hunter Bailey, Chief, Investigative Services Branch - Law Enforcement, Security and Emergency Services at Hunter BaileyDigitally signed by Hunter Bailey Date: 2022.06.22 10:35:28 -05'00' the significant progress we have already achieved cannot be overstated, and the sustainable funding by ONDCP is critical to our continued success as a partner in the National Drug Control Program. Prevention and Deterrence: with the goal of eliminating and preventing clandestine marijuana activities and operations, staff are implementing the following techniques activities: a) learning to integrate GIS and similar tools to identify areas that are likely suitable to support the needs of clandestine operations. This includes data sets such as climate and temperature, surrounding vegetation types and availability of canopy, terrain and soil types, and availability of water sources. A concurrence of these desirable attributes supports a predictive analysis of where future grow sites may be suitable and/or attempted. b) leveraging recent wildland fire damage to identify previously undetected sites as well as learn and understand some of the historical patterns and infrastructure needs of the growers, and c) deploying resources as part of high visibility patrols to make it as difficult as possible to operate undetected. Monitoring and Detection: with the goal of identifying clandestine activity and adjusting patrols and presence as an effective deterrent, staff are implementing the following techniques and activities: a) deployment of trail cameras and surveillance equipment on remote road and trail systems to monitor activity, b) performing water testing to look for dangerous chemical compounds that are consistent with fertilizer frequently used in grow operations. Based upon geography, staff can then work upstream of a positive test to identify the source of the contaminati on. c) frequent and high visibility patrols to monitors trends, suspicious perso ns, activity or vehicles, and overall reinforce the \"ubiquitous ranger\" concept. Early Eradication: with the goal catching clandestine grow operations during their incipient stages and before sites have become well established, staff ar e implementing the following techniques and activities: a) eradicating sites early in the grow season while pl ants remain relatively small, sometimes when still in a \"seedling\" state. This not only prevents the possi bility of mature plants, but also results in other positive benefits such as reducing damage to fragile soil and terrain types, less water consumption (waste) which threatens native vegetation and species, fewer resources required and less risk involved for plant removal, and improved time and cost of site restoration efforts. Rangers are not always able to intercept sites before they become well established, but through aggressive and pro-active techniques we have achieved a significant reduction in the overall number of mature plants indicating forward progress. Interdicting the Flow of Drugs Across Physical Borders: In Washington state, Law Enforcement Rangers continue to work effectively with a variety of state, local and federal partners including: Customs and Bord er Protection (Border Patrol, Office of Field Operations, Air and Marine Division), Homeland Security Investigations, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Agency, US Forest Service, Washington State Fish and Wildlife, Washington State Patrol, and local Sheriff's departments to combat smuggling activities that occur along the International Border with Canada. The remote wilderness terrain of the North Cascades Complex makes this an ideal location for clandestine activitie s given the natural cover and concealment that is available. The efforts of all law enforcement agencies are amplified through joint information and intelligence sharing which guides and directs joint ope rations as well as organic missions on the ground. Rangers perform patrols by vehicle, vessel, air and on foot to combat both smuggling of methamphetamine moving south and cocaine moving north. In addition to smuggling, the area experiences illegal border crossings into the United States as well as some clandestine cultivation sites. Additional techniques and activities include maintaining remote camera and surveillance systems that monitor a network of high use smuggling areas and routes along the physical border. In California, the NPS continues to maintain positive working relationships and cost-shared employees that support the Central Valley HIDTA region which includes numerous NPS units: Yosemite NP, Sequoia - Kings Canyon NP, Whiskeytown NRA, and Lass en Volcanic NP. These positive working The NPS cost management system verifies the location and actual use of funding that is directed to this function. The NPS utilizes these data, combined with annual financial/spending plans, to estimate the level of drug control funding. (2) Drug Methodolo gy The NPS asserts that the drug methodology used to calculate obligations is based on reliable data. a) Data - The NPS utilizes an enterprise -wide system of records known as the Incident Management, Analysis and Reporting System (IMARS), which provides a unified system for Department of the Interior law enforcement agencies to manage law enforcement investigations, measure performance and meet reporting requirements. In concert with incident reporting, review, and data validation requirements established through agency policy, IMARS provides the NPS with the ability to reliably capture and accurately report performance data. b) Financial Systems - The NPS utilizes financial systems to determine park level spending on law enforcement efforts. (3) Application of Drug Methodology The NPS asserts that the drug methodology described above was the actual methodology used to generate the accounting table provided. (4) Material Weakness or Other Findings NA (5) Methodology Modifications NA (6) Reprogrammings or Transfers NA (7) Fund Control Notices The NPS asserts that the data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that fully complies with ONDCP requirements.

Tracy Melton, Executive Officer Date 3/15/23U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division Detailed Accounting Report Related Disclosures For Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022 Disclosure 1: Drug Methodology The Criminal Division (CRM) develops, enforces, and supervises the application of all Federal criminal laws except those specifically assigned to other divisions. In executing its mission, the CRM dedicates specific resources in support of the National Drug Control Strategy that focus on disrupting domestic drug trafficking and production and strengthening international partnerships. CRM's drug budget is the funding available for the Division's drug-related activities. The CRM Sections and Offices contributing to this budget are: x Appellate Section (APP) x Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) x Capital Case Section (CCS) x Fraud Section (FRD) x International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) x Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) x Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section (NDDS) x Organized Crime and Gang Section (OCGS) x Office of Enforcement Operations (OEO) x Office of International Affairs (OIA) x Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) x Office of Policy and Legislation (OPL) Since CRM's accounting system, Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Unified Financial Management System (UFMS), does not track obligation and expenditure data by ONDCP's drug functions, CRM's drug resources figures are derived by estimating the level of involvement of each Division component in drug-related activities. Each component is required to estimate the percentage of work/time that is spent addressing drug-related issues. This percentage is then applied against each component's overall resources to develop an estimate of resources dedicated to drug-related activities. Component totals are then aggregated to determine the Division total. For FY 2022, the Division's drug resources as a percentage of its overall actual obligations were 23.4%. Data - All accounting information for CRM is derived from DOJ's Unified Financial Management System (UFMS). Financial Systems - UFMS is DOJ's financial system that provides CRM with obligation data. Obligations in this system can also be reconciled with the enacted appropriation. Disclosure 2: Methodology Modifications No modifications were made to the methodology from the prior year. Disclosure 3: Material Weaknesses or Other Findings The Criminal Division (CRM) is a component within the DOJ Offices, Boards and Divisions (OBDs). For FY 2022, the OBDs were included in the DOJ consolidated audit and did not receive a separate financial statements audit. The DOJ's consolidated FY 2022 Independent Auditors' Report revealed no material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in CRM internal controls. Additionally, the Department's assessment of risk and internal control in FY 2022 conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A-123 did not identify any findings which may materially affect the presentation of prior year drug-related obligations data. Disclosure 4: Reprogrammings or Transfers No reprogrammings or transfers occurred that affected the CRM's drug-related budgetary resources.

T he drug control obligations are consistent with the application of the approved methodology for calculating drug control funding against the ATF's accounting system of record for this Budget Decision Unit. 2. T he drug methodology used by the ATF to calculate obligations of budgetary resources by function and budget decision unit is reasonable and accurate in allmaterial respects. 3. T he drug methodology disclosed in this statement was the actual drug methodology used to generate the Table of Drug Control Obligations. 4. T here were no material weaknesses or other findings by independent sources identified which may affect the presentation of drug- related obligations. 5. T here were no modifications to the methodology used to report drug control resources. 6. T he data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that did not require revision for reprogrammings or transfers during FY 2022. 7.Th e ATF did not have any ONDCP Fund Control Notices issued in FY 2022. For Francis H. Frand\u00e9 Chief Financial Officer D ate U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Detailed Accounting Report Related Disclosures For Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022 Disclosure 1: Drug Methodology The ATF does not receive a specific appropriation for drug-related work relative to the National Drug Control Strategy (Strategy). However, the ATF does contribute to the Strategy through its mission to combat violent firearms crime by drug offenders in American communities. To quantify how the ATF supports the Strategy, th e total number of cases involving a drug or narcotics charge identified in the ATF's case management system are divided by the total number of actual cases to arrive at a ratio of criminal investi gations with a drug or narcotics nexus. Cases with drug attributes include charges filed under 18 USC 922(g)(3); 18 USC USC 844(a); 21 USC 846 and several other provisions related to narcotics cr imes to derive the drug nexus ratio. Further, the ATF factors in drug charges as a percentage of all charges in drug-related cases. Since many cases involve criminal possession and use of firearms, illegal firearms trafficking, and gang-related violent crime, m any offenders and gang members arrested are often in possession of illegal drugs or narcotics. While not the ATF's primar y mission, the seizure of these drugs/narcotics and the filing of criminal c harges under the drug statutes do support the Strategy. Disclosure 2: Met hodology Modifications There have been no changes in the ATF's Drug Methodology. Disclosure 3: Material Weaknesses or Other Findings There have been no material weaknesses identified that would affect ATF's reporting of drug- related obligations data. Disclosure 4: Reprogr ammings or Transfers There were no reprogrammings or transfers rela ted to drug-related budgetary resources. Disclosure 5: Other Disclosures The ATF has no other disclosures related to dr ug-related obligations, data or methodology.

In accordance with the ONDCP Circular : National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews (Circular), issued September 9, 2021, DOL affirms the assertions identified below are fairly presented in all material respects with the ONDCP established criteria. Statements in this document are assertions to the effect of what is required by the Circular. Budget Formulation Compliance Report Assertions DOL affirms that the FY 2024 Summer Drug Budget (Budget) was submitted to ONDCP on July 27, 2022. DOL affirms that the Budget was submitted to ONDCP at the same time as that budget request was submitted to DOL superiors. DOL affirms that a budget submission was provided without alteration or adjustment by any official at the Department. Detailed Accounting Report Assertions DOL affirms that the data and information presented on prior year obligations has been reported accurately . DOL affirms obligations reported by budget decision unit are the actual obligations derived from the bureau's accounting system of record for these Budget Decision Units or are consistent with the application of the approved methodology, as required by ONDCP Circular: Budget Formulation (Section 7) . DOL affirm s the reasonableness and accuracy of the drug methodology used to calculate obligations of prior year budgetary resources by decision unit and by function. DOL affirms that the drug methodology disclosed in Section 7.a.(2) was the actual methodology used to generate the table required by Section 7.a.(1) of the Circular. U.S. Department of Labor Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management Washington, D.C. 20210 DOL affirm s that all material weaknesses or other findings by independent sources, or other known w eaknesses, which may affect the presentation of prior year drug -related obligations as required by Section 7.a.(4) have been disclosed. DOL affirms th at any modifications made to methodology for reporting drug control resources from the previous year's reporting a re disclosed and, if a modification is reported, whether the modification was approved by ONDCP. DOL affirms that the data presented are associated with obl igations against a financial plan that, if revised during the fiscal year, properly reflects those changes, including ONDCP's approval of all reprogrammings or transfers affecting drug -related resources that individually or in aggregate for the fiscal year exceed $5 million or 10 percent of a specific program or account included in the National Drug Control Budget (21 U.S.C.\u00a7 1703(c)(4)(A)). DOL affirms that the data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that fully complied with all Fund Control Notices issued by the Director of National Drug Control Policy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(f) and Section 9 of the ONDCP Circular : Budget Execution. Inspector General Authentication Exemption As the Department's FY 2022 obligations for drug- related activities fall below the threshold of $50 million, compliance with the Inspector General Authentication requirements of Section 8 of Circular would constitute an unreasonable reporting burden. There fore, an Inspector General attestation review does not accompany the DOL Report. If you have any questions, please contact Emily Page at Sincerely, Geoffrey Kenyon Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget and Performance 2 DRUG METHODOLOGY Opioid abuse impacts both employed and unemployed workers. Research has shown that the number of opioid prescriptions correlates in many areas with a reduction of labor force participation rates, as well as an increase in unemployment rates coincident with increases in opioid -related hospitalizations, although it is unclear whether opioid addiction is a cause of unemployment or an effect of scarce employment opportunities. Additionally, lost workforce productivity in American businesses as a result of opioid abuse \u2014as demonstrated through diminished job performance, absenteeism, incarceration, and even death \u2014has approached $20 billion annually. Researchers have estimated lost wages due to overdose deaths at $800,000 per person. In FY 2019, the Department provided guidance for how states can apply for National Health Emergency (NHE) Disaster Recovery Dislocated Worker Grants (DWGs) to respond to the opioid crisis. Successful opioid Disaster Recovery DWG projects will accomplish the following: facilitate community partnerships that are central to dealing with this complex health crisis; provide training that builds the skilled workforce in professions that could impact the causes and treatment of the opioid crisis; ensure timely delivery of a ppropriate, necessary career, training, and support activities; and create temporary disaster -relief employment that addresses the unique impacts of the opioid crisis in affected communities.

In addition, the budget includes the full cost of drug testing each individual student upon entry. Job Corps implemented a Spring Break from March 16, 2020 to May 10, 2020 and sent all active students home to protect them from the COVID -19 pandemic. From May 11, 2020 until November 7, 2020, Job Corps operated in a predominantly virtual status except for a small number of students who remained at select centers. During virtual instruction, Job Corps suspended all drug testing but continued to provide services to all students, virtually or physically, in the areas of TEAP, mental health, and physical health. As of November 8, 2020, Job Corps centers began welcoming currently enrolled students back to campuses for in- person learnin g. As of May 25, 2021, Job Corps centers began enrolling new students virtually, with the first group of these students arriving on campuses for in-person learning on July 27, 2021. This has been a phased -in and continuing process based on community COVI D-19 risk factors and staffing capacity. Once Job Corps students returned to campuses, drug testing was reinstated.

However, as new drugs enter the market and as questionable prescribing and billing practices evolve to circumvent controls, the FECA program will need new controls to address the changing environment. The program will perform ongoing program integrity efforts through data analytics, payment audits, and improper payment reporting. This effort directly supports the objective of improving access and use of data by providing high quality and timely information to inform evid ence- based decision- making and ongoing initiatives supported by the Secretary to reduce improper payments. In late 2021, the FECA Program implement ed Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) services to improve the safety, quality, and cost -effectiveness of prescription care provided to claimants under the FECA. This cost -sharing service is for use by all federal Departments/Agencies, as the FECA is the exclusive remedy by which federal employees may obtain disability, medical, and/or survivor benefits for workplace injuries. This initiative, combined with its Program Integrity, Prescription Management, and Fraud Prevention activities, enables the FECA program to approve medically appropriate use of opioid medication and provide beneficiaries assistance in transitioning to alternative treatments as appropriate. OWCP ensures parity of coverage for mental and substance use disorders in injury -related treatment access for all FECA beneficiaries as it is paramount to the administration of the program. OWCP is devel oping a detailed ONDCP -related funding level methodology for preparation of the FY 2025 budget cycle. For prior years, funding levels are based on increases provided in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 for the administration of efforts that improve the safety and quality of care as it relates to prescription drugs.

In FY 2022, OIG criminal investigators charged 9,062 hours directly to FECA -related investigative matters. Although our managers and our headquarter support functions do not charge time directly to specific cases, the OIG typically estimates that the number of these hours spent on cases is roughly equivalent to the number of direct hours charged. As a result, the OIG estimated that we spent approximately 18,124 ours on FECA -related investigative matters in FY 22. This is equivalent to approximately 9 FTE.

Tab L Attachments Tab A - FY 2022 INL National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Report Tab B - Copy of State/INL's FY 2024 Summer Drug Budget Submission Transmittal Letter Section 6(b). Assertions Section 6(b)(1). Timeliness of Summer Budget Submission I assert that the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) submitted the Summer Drug Budget submission referenced in section 6(a )(1) to ONDCP on August 4, 2022, under the attached cover letter provided in response to section 9(a) (1) of ONDCP Circular: Budget Formulation. The Summer Drug Budget submission was provided to ONDCP during the timeframe that the budget request was submitted to superiors for review once counternarcotics levels were determined in accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(c)(1)(A). Section 6(b)(2). Funding Levels Represent Bureau -Level Request I assert that the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement ( INCLE ) funding request submitted to ONDCP provided in section 6(a)( 2) of this circular represent s the budget submission made by INL to the Department without alteration or adjustment by any official at the Department. SECTION 7. Detailed Accounting Report The Department is providing a Detailed Accounting Report on the drug control program obligations of the INL bureau in accordance with Section 7(a) of the ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews. The Detailed Accounting Report consists of (a) a table highlighting prior year drug control obligations data , and (b) a narrative section making assertions regarding the prior year obligations data . Section 7(a). Drug Control Funding Obligations Section 7(a)(1). Table of Prior Year Drug Control Obligations by Decision Unit and Drug Control Function The following table presents the obligations of the drug control budgetary resources appropriated and available during FY 2022 by Drug Control Function and Budget Decision Unit. INL Drug Control Obligations Actual Obligations Occu rring During FY 2022 Drug Resources by Drug Control Function * International $486,492,790 Total $486,492,790 Drug Resources by Decision Unit INCLE $486,492,790 Total $486,492,790 Information Total INCLE Budget for Identified Appropriations $3,255,284,106 * This figure reflects all obligations of Drug Control funds during FY 2022, regardless of the fiscal year the funds were appropriated . Section 7(a)(2). Drug Methodology The Department and USAID are required to categorize foreign assistance by the Office of Foreign Assistance (F) Standardized Program Structure and Definitions (SPSD) throughout the budget formulation and execution processes. T he data is recorded in F's Foreign Assistance Coordination and Tracking System (FACTS Info) Next Generation (NextGen) system . FACTS Info NextGen serves as the central information system for all foreign assistance budgeting, operational planning, and performance management processes overseen by F and stands at the nexus of F and operating units worldwide. It is used to create, store, and analyze budgets, Operational Plans, and performance information for Department and USAID programs , as well as for generating reports for OMB, ONDCP , and Congress. Funds that support drug- related activities a re categorized in the F SPSD under the Peace and Security Objective, Counternarcotics Program Area (PS.3). INL calculates the drug control funding levels reported to ONDCP using data from the FACTS Info NextGen system. INCLE funds are obligated using project codes that include strategic goal codes that align to the F SPSD so the accounting system is able to report obligations for drug related activities for ONDCP. The Department 's accounting system of record, Global Business Intelligence (GBI) , tracks obligations through a combination of the appropriation point limitation, function code, allotment code, and project code. This arrangement enables the separation of all the drug control obligations being reported from other funds managed by INL. The accounting reports reflect net negative amounts when obligations and their associated expenditures and de-obligations occur in different fiscal years. Thus, all expenditures and deobligations that occurred in the current year (i.e., FY 2022 for the purposes of this report) that are associated with original obligations that occurred in a prior year (e.g., FY 2021), would result in a negative obligation. For the drug control obligations report, the Drug Resources by Control Function and Drug Resources by Decision Unit obligations levels were produced using GBI. The levels reported reflected INCLE program and Program Development and Support (PD&S) funds (account code 1022) that were obligated in FY 2022 for all project codes aligned with drug control activities . PD&S funds support administrative costs for INL programming. The Total INCLE Budget for Identified Appropriations amount was also produced using GBI and reflects INCLE funding from all active appropriations for drug control activities during FY 2022. a.) Obligations by Budget Decision Unit - All obligations presented in the INL table of drug control obligations are 100 percent drug- related. b.) Obligations by Drug Control Function - All obligations presented in the INL table of drug control obligations are 100 percent drug- related. Section 7(a)(3). Methodology Modifications There are no modifications to INL's methodology from previous years. Section 7(a)(4). Material Weaknesses or Other Findings The Department received an unmodified (\" clean \") audit opinion of its FY 2022 Financial Statements , with no material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting identified by the Independent Auditor. The Department maintains a robust system of internal controls that are validated by senior leadership. For FY 2022, no material weaknesses in internal controls were identified by senior leadership and no material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting were identified by the Senior Assessment Team or the Management Control Steering Committee. As a result, the Secretary was able to provide reasonable assurance on the effectiveness of the Department 's overall internal controls and the internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act. Sectio n 7(a)(5). Reprogrammings or Transfers For this reporting period, INL and the Department processed a total of seven reprogramming actions that resulted in a decrease of drug- related budgetary resources during FY 2022 by a total and FY INCLE- Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds . This decrease is the result of reprogramming actions between the drug- related program area, i.e., C ounternarcotics (PS.3) and Citizen Security and Law Enforcement (PS.9), a non-drug- related program area. These reprogramming actions were in response to emergency requirements in Ukraine and the Europe and Eurasia Region as a result of Russia's invasion, and in Haiti, as a result of the dire threat posed b y gang violence that has worsened since the assassination of President Moise. The Department reprogrammed and renotified over $200 million in INCLE funds to Ukraine, Eastern Europe, and Haiti during FY 2022 to respond to these crises. Per ONDCP guidance (21 U.S.C. 1703 (c)(4)(A)), counternarcotics- related reprogramming actions that individually or in aggregate exceed $5,000,000 or more than 10 percent of the program need to be approved by ONDCP. The insta nces noted above triggering this requirement during FY 2022 are delineated in the table below. The \"Source Program\" and \"Recipient Program\" columns show the country or regional operating unit affected by the reprogramming and the \"Program Area\" and \"Amount\" columns reflect whether country gained (\"to PS.3\") or lost (\"from PS.3\") counternarcotics funds.

Section 7(b) . Assertions Section 7(b)(l). Obligations by Budget Decision Unit I assert that obligations reported by budget decision unit are the actual obligations from the Department's accounting system of record for these Budget Decision Units. Section 7(b)(2). Drug Methodology I assert that the drug methodology used to calculate obligations of prior year budgetary resources is reasonable and accurate, that the data presented is complete and reliable, and that the financial systems supporting the drug methodology yield data that fairly present, in all material respects, aggregate obligations presented in the Table of Prior Year Obligations. Section 7(b)(3). Application of Drug Methodology I assert that the drug methodology disclosed in section 7(a)(2) was the actual methodology used to generate the table required by section 7(a)(1) , that the calculations are sufficiently documented to independently reproduce these data, and the calculation provides a means to ensure consistency of data between reporting years. Section 7(b)(4). Material Weaknesses or Other Findings I assert that there are no material weaknesses or other findings by independent sources, or other known weaknesses that may affect the presentation of prior year drug -related obligations as required by section 7(a) (4). There is therefore nothing to disclose. Section 7(b)(5). Methodology Modifications I assert that th ere were no modifications made to the methodology for reporting drug control resources from the previous year's reporting and there is therefore nothing to disclose. Section 7(b)(6). Reprogrammings or Transfers I assert that the data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that was approved by ONDCP for all drug -related resources. Additionally, I assert, that in accordance with ONDCP's policy to approve counternarcotics- related reprogr amming actions that individually or in aggregate exceed $5,000,000 or more than 10 percent of the program (21 U.S.C. 1703 (c)(4)(A)), INL has informed ONDCP of these required changes. Section 7(b)( 7). Fund Control Notices I assert that the data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that was approved by ONDCP. ONDCP did not issue any Fund Control Notices to the Department in FY 2022. Equity In observance of Executive Order 13985 issued in January 2021, F is in the process of deploying the Racial Equity Key Issue on Advancing Racial Equity and Support to Underserved Communities. All Department bureaus and posts receiving foreign assistance funds will be required to submit Operational Plans that analyze foreign assistance baseline equity data regularly. Over time, the Racial Equity Key Issue definitions will be further honed, establishing critical trend data. In addition to Operational Plan reporting, there will be a corresponding requirement for performance reporting on this Racial Equity Key Issue. Department bureaus and posts will be expected to craft performance narratives in annual Performance Progress Reports. Within INL, the bureau recognizes the importance of addressing systemic inequality in criminal justice systems, and the importance of promoting equity and inclusion, including for members of marginalized communities. In June 2021, INL issued a front-channel cable to all U.S. Embassies overseas with INL funding to emphasize the Bureau's commitment to recognizing bias and discrimination and countering bias-motivated violence within our host country counterparts and in the communities they serve, and providing tools and resources to help INL overseas sections integrate these priorities in their programs.

Washington, DC 20503 The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) submits the attached FY 2024 ONDCP Budget and Performance Summary, which represents the Agency's FY 2024 foreign assistance resource request to address counter-narcotics efforts around the world. USAID advances U.S. foreign policy objectives by supporting economic growth, agriculture, trade, health, democracy, conflict prevention, and providing humanitarian assistance. USAID's programs support the U.S. Government's counter-narcotics objectives by helping countries develop economically viable alternatives to coca cultivation. Specifically , USAID implements alternative livelihoods programs that focus on licit job creation, improve commercial agricultural production, and market linkages in drug production-prone areas, facilitate access to financial services for small businesses and farmer associations, and offer farmers incentives to discontinue planting poppy and other illicit crops. USAID also works to facilitate private sector investment, improve access to digital and financial services, improve basic public services, improve transportation systems, develop agricultural processing facilities and storage networks, and expand irrigation in targeted areas to create and grow a viable agribusiness industry. These works help to catalyze economic growth and job creation in post-eradication zones while also providing support to incentivizes and facilitates participation in the licit economy rather than in illicit drug production, with the objective of reducing the cultivation and production of illicit drugs that contribute to crime and instability in key U.S. partner countries. W e are committed to plan and execute an efficient and effective drug control budget within a constrained budget environment. We look forward to working with you on USAID's FY 2024 Drug Control budget request and please reach out if you have any questions.

Drug Methodology Although NHTSA lacks a formal, written methodology for identifying drug control obligations, the Agency implements standard procedures and controls. NHTSA follows a budget strategy planning process to develop projects each fiscal year. Projects by Decision Unit and Function that address drug -control activities are identified and tracked in accordance with ONDCP C irculars. NHTSA uses DOT's financial management system, Delphi, to account for all program expenditures, including funds dedicated to d rug-impaire d driving initiatives . As part of its annual budget execution process, NHTSA assigns Budget Program Activity Codes (BPACs) , unique accounting codes for each program area . In conjunction with individual agreement/contract numbers, BPACs are used to record a nd track all obligations and expenditures through Delphi . Monthly reconciliation of data recorded in the Delphi accounting system is the key to the program's financial oversight to ensure complete and timely recording. Drug control fund spending plans are reviewed by Contracting Officer's Representatives, Division Chiefs, Office Directors, the Associate Administrator for Research and Program Development, and the Chief Financial Officer. NHTSA's Office of Acquisition Mana gement (OAM) also reviews this information prior to issuing funds . Once OAM approves, o bligating documents (e.g., agreements and contracts) are entered into Delphi and subsequently tracked. Approved invoices are recorded as expen ditures against the obligat ions. 2. Methodology Modifications : A product of NHTSA, NEMSIS is the national database used to store EMS data from states and territories. The University of Utah is the vendor who hosts the NEMSIS Technical Assistance Center. NHTSA's Office of Emergency Med ical Services reported $500,000 for NEMSIS support, in compliance with Federal Information Security Management Act requirements. These funds supported real -time reporting of naloxone administration data. Additionally, a s asterisked in the table above, NHTSA is reporting 50% of the FY 2022 obligation for the National Roadside Survey and select projects that addressed driving while impaired by alcohol and /or other drugs. 3.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE DETAILED ACCOUNTING REPORT a. FY 2022 Drug Control Funding Obligations (1) Table of Prior Year Drug Control Obligations Narcotics Drug Resources by Decision Unit Narcotics Crimes $78,250,154 Total $78,250,154 Drug Resources by Control Function Investigations $78,250,154 Total $78,250,154 (2) Drug Methodology a) All Drug Control Obligations (the resources appropriated and available for these activities) are reported under one Decision Unit and one Control Function, as shown in the above chart. b) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Drug Control Budget encompasses the Criminal Investigation's (CI) Narcotics Program1. CI's overall Direct Investigative Time (DIT) applied to narcotics investigations for FY 2022 was 11.6 percent of the agency's total DIT. The methodology for computing the resources appropriated and realized for the Narcotics Program is the application of DIT attributable to narcotics investigations. The Narcotics DIT percentage is applied to the total realized appropriated resources for a year, excluding reimbursable and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) funds , for which the resources are being reported. The res ult is determined to be the amount of resources expended on the Narcotics Program. This methodology was approved by CI, the IRS Chief Financial Officer, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) during FY 2014 and was effective for FY 2014 and all subsequent fiscal years. 1 The IRS -CI Narcotics Program consist of five sub -programs that includes: 1. Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF); 2. High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA); 3. HIDTA - OCDETF; 4. Terrorism -OCDETF; and 5. Narcotics -Other. 2 (3) Methodology Modifications No changes or modifications in the DIT computation methodology from the prior year were made. (4) Material Weaknesses or Other Findings None (5) Reprogramming or Transfers None (6) Other Disclosures None b. Assertions (1) Obligations by Budget Decision Unit Obligations reported by the Budget Decision Unit are a result of applying DIT data derived from Criminal Investigation's Management Information System (CIMIS) to the actual obligations from the CI realized Financial Plan, exclud ing reimburs ables and EITC funds. (2) Drug Methodology The current methodology used to calculate obligations of prior -year budgetary resources has not changed. There was no impact in the methodology in FY 2022 since the methodology in FY 2021 did not change. a) Data Data is derived from CIMIS to determine the DIT applied to CI's Narcotics Program. Each CI special agent submits CIMIS time reports monthly detailing their activities relating to specific investigations. Each investigation is associated with a specific program and sub- program area. The percentage of DIT applied to each program area is calculated monthly with a final annual percentage determined after the close of the fiscal year to determine the total resources expended to support the U.S. Government's National Drug Control Strategy. The annual percentage of DIT relating to all narcotics sub- programs is appli ed to the total resources expended for FY 2022 in the CI Appropriated Enforcement Budget (excluding reimburs ables and EITC funds ). 3 b) Financial Systems The IRS Integrated Financial System (IFS) is the final authority for the IRS resource obligations and yields data which fairly presents drug related obligation estimates. (3) Application of Drug Methodology The methodology disclosed in this section was the actual methodology used to generate the required table and meets all requirements described in Section 7a (2) of the ONDCP Circular: National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews. Calculations made using this methodology are sufficiently documented to independently reproduce all data and ensure consistency between reporting years. (4) Material Weakness or Other Findings None (5) Methodology Modifications None (6) Reprogramming or Transfers The data presented is associated with obligations against a financial plan and properly reflects any revisions occurring during the fiscal year. (7) Fund Control Notices Criminal Investigation asserts the data presented is associated with obligations against a financial plan that fully complied with all fund control notices issued by the Director under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(f) and Section 9 of the ONDCP Circular: Budget Execution, as applicable. .

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY WASHINGTON, D.C. FY 2024 OFAC Budget Formulation Complianc e Report and Detailed Accounting Report 1 March 3, 2023 MEMORANDUM FOR REGINA M. LABELLE, ACTING DIRECTOR FROM : William Sessions, Treasury De partmental Budget Director SUBJECT : FY 2024 OFAC Budget Formulation Comp liance Report and De tailed Accounting Report This memorandum provides the OFAC FY 2024 Budget Formulation Compliance Report, which is required in the ONDCP Circular : National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews, 9 September 2021). This report is being submitted along with the fall budget formulation tran smittal memo and table. I assert that: x Treasury's Offices' burea u budget office provided OFAC's FY Summer Drug Budget Trans mittal Letter and FY 2024 Summer Budget Resource Summary Table to ONDCP on August 5, 2022, in response to Sections 6.a.(1) the ONDCP Circular: National Drug Contro l Program Agency Compliance Reviews and 9.a.(1) in the ONDCP Circular: Budget Formulation. The FY 2024 Fall Budget Resource Summary Table was submitted to ONDCP on September 27, 2022, and is provided in Attachment A. x OFAC did not submit its FY 2024 budget request to ONDCP at the same time it submitted its request to OFAC's parent organizati on, the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI). OFAC is neither a bureau nor an agency; it is an office within TFI. TFI is an office within Treasury's Departmental Offices' bureau.

Obligations by Budget Decision Unit Treasury asserts that obligations reported by budget decision unit are the actual obligations derived from the bureau's financ ial reports and are consistent with the application of the above methodol ogy, as required by ONDCP Circular: Budget Formulation, Section 7, for calculating drug control funding against the bureau's accounting system of record fo r these Budget Decision Units. 2. Drug Methodology Treasury asserts that the obligations repor ted by budget decision unit are accurate and follow the methodology outlined in the previous section. a) Data - The data reported is based on the above methodology and financial reporting actuals for the identified employees filling the six full-time positions that OFAC has identified as drug-control related. b) Financial Systems - OFAC pulls the obligations data reported above from a data download report from the bureau's budg et office (Assistant Secretary for Management, Office of Fi nancial Management). The bureau's budget office pulls this data directly from the burea u's official financial reporting system. 3. Application of Drug Methodology Treasury asserts that the methodology described above was the actual methodology used to produce the obligations amount. OF AC has specified which positions are drug- control related and pulls the actual labor costs for the employees filling those positions from the financial system in order to produce the obligations amount. 4. Material Weaknesses or Other Findings Treasury asserts that no mate rial weaknesses or other fi ndings have been reported. 5. Methodology Modifications Treasury asserts that ONDCP was made aw are of the methodology changes during the FY 2023 budget formulation cycle. 6. Reprogrammings or Transfers Treasury asserts that no reprogrammings or transfers took place during FY 2022. 7. Fund Control Notices Treasury asserts that the data presented are associated with obligations against a financial plan that fully co mplied with all Fund Control Notices issued by the Director under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(f) and Section 9 of the ONDCP Circular, Budget Execution .

Detailed Accounting Submission 1. Table of FY 2022 Drug Control Obligations 2. Drug Control Methodology Medical Care: The obligation tables for the FY 2022 Drug Control Obligations (above) and the Resource Summary (page 24) showing obligations and FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are based on specific patient encounters. The specific patient encounters include all inpatient and outpatient episodes of care either provided by VHA staff or purchased in the community. The source data for VHA inpatient care is the Patient Treatment File (PTF). For outpatient care, it is the National Patient Care Database Encounter file (SEFILE). For contract care, it is either the PTF or the hospital payment file. For traditional outpatient medical care in the Community (MCC) and Provider Agreements (PA), it is the Provider Payment file. For Third Party Agreements (TPA) Choice, it is the expedited payments from the Office of Community Care (OCC) that are stored in the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). All patient encounters have an associated diagnosis. The primary diagnosis is considered the reason the patient is being treated and is used to determine whether the treatment provided is a substance use disorder treatment and which type of substance use disorder. A list of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) Diagnosis groups used for substance use disorders are shown in the following table: FY 2022 Description Actual Drug Resources by Budget Decision Unit: Medical Care.................................................................... $1,166.779 Medical & Prosthetic Research..................................... $27.931 Total.................................................................................. $1,194.710 Drug Resources by Drug Control Function: Treatment.......................................................................... $1,166.779 Research & Development.............................................. $27.931 Total.................................................................................. $1,194.710(In Millions) 3 of 24 Diagnosis Code Description (DSM-5 and ICD-10-CM) F11xx Opioid /Anxiolytic Related Disorders F14xx Cocaine Related Disorders F15xx Other Stimulant Related Disorders F16xx Hallucinogen Related Disorders F19xx Other Psychoactive Substance Related Disorders It should be noted that Prescriptions and Lab tests do not have linkages to a specific diagnosis and are not included in the report. The cost of VHA provided services is calculated by the Managerial Cost Accounting (MCA) System of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). MCA cost data is used at all levels of the VA for important functions, such as cost recovery (billing), budgeting and resource allocation. Additionally, the system contains a rich repository of clinical information, which is used to promote a more proactive approach to the care of high risk (i.e., diabetes and acute coronary patients) and high-cost patients. VA MCA data is also used to calculate and measure the productivity of physicians and other care providers. The basic unit of MCA cost is the product. For VHA a product can range from a prescription fill made through a mail-out pharmacy, to an outpatient dental exam, to a bed-day of care in an Intensive Care Unit. Every product that is delivered is fully costed. This means that all direct labor, direct supply, and associated indirect costs (to include local and national overhead costs) are applied. Once they are fully costed, products are then assigned to the applicable patient encounter. MCA costs are the basis for the obligations displayed in the ONDCP report. The Allocation Resource Center (ARC) develops ARC cost, which is computed by taking the MCA cost and removing the non- patient specific costs, such as Operating costs for Headquarters, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Support, National Programs, and Capital and State Home costs, and adding in the community care payments. For budget purposes, ARC costs are transformed into obligations to account for the entire VHA Budget. It is a multi-step methodology that is implemented to compute obligations. x The ARC costs are divided into their appropriations using cost centers identified in their Monthly Program Cost Report (MPCR), which is a MCA Account Level Budget (ALB) based report that accounts for all the costs that comprise the MCA system. x A facility specific ratio of obligations to ARC cost for non-capital costs is created and multiplied by the expenditures to create medical center specific obligations. x Assign the medical center capital obligations to VHA services proportional to cost. x Aggregate the national overhead obligations by cost center into their appropriations and assign them to patient services proportional to cost. x Balance the final obligations nationally to the SF133 Report on Budget Execution total proportionately. Medical and Prosthetic Research: The obligation tables for the FY 2022 Drug Control Obligations (above) and the Resource Summary (page 24) showing Medical Research and Prosthetics obligations reflects the budget for addiction research recorded in VA's Research Allocation Forecasting System (RAFT) used for planning and budgeting. Medical and Prosthetic Research budget supports all addiction research, both prevention and treatment, including alcohol and tobacco. 4 of 24 MEDICAL CARE Year in Review In FY 2022, 251,752 Veterans who received services within VHA were diagnosed with a drug use disorder. Of these Veterans, VHA provided services by mental health clinicians in various of settings and modalities, including outpatient, clinical video telehealth, or telephone care to nearly 79% (200,032) of Veterans with any diagnosis of a drug use disorder. Among Veterans receiving services for drug use disorders within VHA in FY 2022, approximately 16% and around 55% (139,336) used cannabis. (These categories are not mutually exclusive.) Data for 2020 reflected a decline in utilization of VHA services by Veterans experiencing substance use concerns believed to be related to the pandemic. The decrease in the number of Veterans with a SUD diagnosis served is not believed to be reflective of a change in demand for SUD services (Mental Health, Substance Use, and Suicidal Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic \u2014 United States, June 24-30, 2020 | MMWR (cdc.gov)). VHA moved rapidly to ensure sustainment of treatment services, rapidly transitioning SUD specialty services to telehealth platforms. VHA also worked closely with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to ensure continued access to medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder (M-OUD). VA is focusing efforts to return utilization of intensive SUD treatment services to pre-pandemic norms (e.g., reopening residential treatment beds and in-person group therapy). Though fewer patients received intensive SUD treatment services than prior the COVID pandemic, the number of patients who received intensive SUD treatment increased 13% from FY 2021 to FY 2022. Consistent with expansion in use of telehealth since the start of the pandemic, VHA continued to utilize telehealth (telephone only and audio/visual, dependent on Veteran preference and access to technology) to support provision of SUD specialty treatment. As requested, VHA is exploring available data that would allow for more precise information related to Veteran requests for SUD treatment and subsequent engagement in care. At the current time, this information is not available. Development of SUD-specific content for the new electronic health record is continuing with the expectation that this information will be available in the future. Expanding Access to Evidence-Based Treatment VHA SUD Service Care Delivery National policy and expectations for managing SUD within VHA is guided by VHA Handbook 1160.04 and the VA / Department of Defense (DoD) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of SUD (http://www.healthquality.va.gov/). VHA is a leader in the prevention and treatment of SUD and uses a stepped care approach to SUD treatment (in which collaborative (patient and provider) selection of treatment intensity is matched to patient characteristics and informed by data from ongoing monitoring of the patient's condition. Patients with at-risk alcohol use or the least severe SUDs may be treated with evidence-based brief interventions and/or medical management in primary care or general mental health. For those with more severe disorders, specialty SUD treatment programs provide intensive services including withdrawal management, evidence-based psychosocial treatments, SUD medication, case management and relapse prevention, all provided across various settings including outpatient, intensive outpatient, residential, and inpatient/hospital. Although the US Preventive Services Taskforce recommends population-based screening of unhealthy drug use, the 2021 VA/DoD SUD CPGs found there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for drug use disorders in primary care to facilitate enrollment in treatment. VHA is nevertheless exploring the provision of universal drug screening through primary care, as it already does for alcohol use disorder, in a manner 5 of 24 that balances the need to better identify and engage Veterans in SUD treatment while mitigating the potential burden that such screening would bring to primary care. As an integrated healthcare system, VHA is uniquely situated to address the needs of Veterans diagnosed with a SUD, including providing support to address co-occurring medical, mental health, and psychosocial needs (e.g., housing, employment). Treatment for SUD occurs across settings and with policy-defining expectations for access to SUD treatment, including expectations for access through Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) and Health Care Centers (HCC). VHA also continues to improve service delivery and efficiency by integrating services for mental health disorders, including SUD, into primary care settings. Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn/Operation Inherent Resolve (OEF/OIF/OND/OIR) and Veterans from other eras are served in primary care teams (Patient Aligned Care Teams: PACTs) that have co-located mental health staff to identify and address potential mental health and substance use treatment needs. Secondary prevention services include diagnosis and assessment of possible substance use disorders in patients presenting medical problems that suggest elevated risk of substance use disorders (e.g., those being treated for Hepatitis C or prescribed opioid medications). Recognizing the importance of PACT-based care, VHA is implementing the Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program - Collaborative Chronic Care Model (BHIP-CCM) at every VHA facility. BHIP - CCM is an \"evidence-based approach to structuring clinical care to ensure coordinated, patient-centered, and anticipatory care\" (available of BHIP - CCM teams within general mental health further supports VA's commitment to providing access to chronic disease management and treatment for substance use disorders beyond specialty SUD treatment settings. Most Veterans with substance use disorders are treated in outpatient programs. Outpatient withdrawal management is available for patients who are medically stable and who have sufficient social support systems to monitor their status. Standard outpatient programs typically treat patients one or two hours per session and patients are generally seen once or twice a week. Intensive SUD outpatient programs generally provide at least three hours of clinical programming per day and patients attend three or more days per week. At the same time, providers in these outpatient and intensive outpatient SUD treatment settings are expected to collaborate with colleagues in inpatient and residential SUD care settings to coordinate Veterans' transitions across these levels of SUD care. Such efforts are necessary for helping ensure continuity of SUD care that is consistent with a chronic disease model of care and responsive to changes in Veterans' clinical status. Considering the frequent co-occurrence of SUDs with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), VHA also has assigned a SUD specialist to each of its hospital-level PTSD services or teams. The staff person is an integral member of the PTSD clinical services team and works to integrate substance use disorder care with all other aspects of PTSD-related care. Among the specialists' responsibilities are the identification and treatment of Veterans with co-occurring SUD and PTSD. Specialists also promote preventive services for Veterans with PTSD who are at risk for developing a SUD. VHA provides two types of 24-hour care to patients with severe or complex substance use disorders. These include inpatient withdrawal management and stabilization in numerous medical and general mental health units, equivalent to Level 4, Medically Managed Intensive Inpatient Treatment as specified by the American Society of Addiction Medicine Patient Placement Criteria (https://www.asam.org/asam-criteria/about-the-asam-criteria), and provision of care in Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (otherwise referred to as Domiciliary beds). VHA offers care in Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (MH RRTPs) to Veterans with complex, co-occurring mental health, substance use, medical, and psychosocial needs. Specialty Domiciliary SUD programs provide treatment equivalent to Level 3.7, Medically Monitored Intensive 6 of 24 Inpatient Services as specified by the American Society of Addiction Medicine Patient Placement Criteria. At the end of 2022, 68 Domiciliary SUD programs were in operation with roughly 1,800 beds focused specifically on intensive, medically monitored residential SUD treatment. In addition to those MH RRTPs formally designated as Domiciliary SUD programs, additional SUD specialized services are offered through tracks in other MH RRTPs and the majority of Veterans served by MH RRTPs are diagnosed with a SUD. Several new Domiciliary SUD programs are under development with the number of programs expected to grow over the next few years. Programs to end homelessness among Veterans are encouraged to have SUD specialists as a part of their multidisciplinary teams. There are SUD specialists working in the Department of Housing and Urban Development - VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH), Grant and Per Diem (GPD) and the Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) programs; however, the use of SUD specialists can vary locally based on site-specific needs. These specialists emphasize early identification of SUDs as a risk for maintaining permanent housing, promote engagement or re-engagement in SUD specialty care programs, provide evidence-based SUD treatment services such as Contingency Management, and serve as linkages between homeless and specialty SUD treatment when Veterans need more intensive SUD treatment services. In 2022, case management for Supported Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) also was supported and included funding for VA case managers expected to work with SSVF grantees and homeless program staff to engage Veterans experiencing SUD concerns into VA services including but not limited to SUD specialty care or residential services. The central goal of the HCHV program is to reduce homelessness among Veterans by connecting homeless Veterans with health care and other needed services. This program provides outreach, case management, and HCHV Contract Residential Services (CRS), ensuring that chronically homeless Veterans, especially those with serious mental illness and/or SUD, can be placed in VA or community- based programs that provide quality housing and services that meet their specialized needs. The GPD program allows VA to award grants to community-based agencies to create transitional housing programs and offer per diem payments. The purpose of the program is to promote the development and provision of supportive housing or related services \u2014 to help homeless Veterans achieve residential stability, increase their skill levels or income, and obtain greater self-sufficiency. In addition, GPD-funded projects offer communities a way to help homeless Veterans by providing housing and other services and assisting VAMCs by augmenting or supplementing care. Through a collaborative program between the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and VA (HUD-VASH), HUD provides eligible homeless Veterans with a Housing Choice rental voucher, and VA provides case management and supportive services so that Veterans can gain housing stability and recover from physical and mental health problems, substance use disorders, and other issues contributing to or resulting from homelessness. HUD-VASH subscribes to the principles of the Housing First model of care. Housing First is an evidence-based practice model that rapidly moves homeless individuals into housing and wraps supportive services around them as needed to help them exit homelessness and achieve housing stability as well as improve their ability and motivation to engage in treatment (available at https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/). The program's goals are to help Veterans and their families gain stable housing while promoting full recovery and independence in their community. Incarceration as an adult male is the most powerful predictor of homelessness. VA therefore also conducts outreach to justice-involved Veterans through two dedicated national programs, both prevention-oriented components of VA's Homeless Programs: Health Care for Reentry Veterans (HCRV) and Veterans Justice Outreach (VJO). Known collectively as the Veterans Justice Programs (VJP), HCRV and VJO facilitate access to needed VA health care and other services for Veterans at all 7 of 24 stages of the criminal justice process, from initial contact with law enforcement through community reentry following extended incarceration. In addition, an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) program provides a mechanism for a non-VA entity to develop and operate supportive housing for homeless and at-risk Veterans and their families on VA property. VA enters into a long-term ground lease with a private, not-for-profit, or local government entity, which develops, constructs/rehabilitates, finances, operates and maintains the housing. This innovative tool provides Veterans with housing and an expanded range of services that would not otherwise be available on medical center campuses. VA's EUL program and implementation process are aligned with the Housing First philosophy. Since 1991, VA has executed 105 EULs, including 49 operational housing EULs nationwide comprised of more than 3,300 housing units. In addition, VA housing EULs have raised over $1.5 billion of non-VA funding. These EUL projects provide safe, affordable living arrangements near health care providers, which contribute to positive health care outcomes for Veterans. The EUL program is managed by the Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM). A list of awarded EUL projects, including EUL housing projects, can be found at: http://www.va.gov/assetmanagement/. Methamphetamine VA recognizes the emerging threat that methamphetamine poses to our nation's Veterans. Specific data on the rates of methamphetamine use disorder are not available. However, the overall rates of amphetamine use disorder have been increasing over the past several years. The number of Veterans who received care for amphetamine use disorder increased over the past year with 40,185 Veterans who received care in VHA during 2022 having an amphetamine use disorder diagnosis. VA's commitment to provision of evidence-based treatment has positioned VA well to respond to this emerging threat. Contingency Management (CM) is an evidence-based treatment with demonstrated efficacy in treating stimulant use disorder. VHA has been able to support CM including its associated costs of toxicology surveillance and incentives to strengthen Veterans' recovery behavior. VHA implemented CM in 2011, and through September 2022, VHA has provided CM to over 5,900 Veterans, with 92% of the nearly 77,000 urine samples testing negative for the target drug(s) (e.g., stimulants or cannabis). In January 2023, VHA plans to launch a stimulant safety initiative that focus on expanding access to evidence- based interventions such as CM and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Veterans with stimulant use disorder. In addition, VA is exploring models for implementing digital therapeutics into the treatment of stimulant use disorder (as well as other SUD care). Opioid Use Disorder Slightly more than 67,198 Veterans with an opioid use disorder (OUD) diagnosis were seen in VHA in 2022. Medication for OUD (M-OUD) has historically been provided in SUD specialty-care clinics, but a significant number of Veterans with clinically diagnosed OUD do not access SUD specialty care. By disseminating evidence-based models for delivery of M-OUD in primary care, mental health, and pain management clinics, Veterans are expected to have timely access to the right treatment at their preferred point of care. In August 2018, VHA launched the Stepped Care for Opioid Use Disorder Train the Trainer (SCOUTT) initiative with the intent of supporting the expansion of M-OUD in level 1 clinics (primary care, general mental health and pain management clinics). Phase One sites in each VISN implemented this expansion during FY 2019. From August 2018 through September 2022 there was a 246% increase in the number of patients receiving buprenorphine in the Phase One level clinics and 209% increase in the number of providers prescribing buprenorphine in these clinics. Further, Veterans are being retained in care with 70% of Veterans retained on buprenorphine for more than 90 days. Phase Two of the SCOUTT initiative was launched in the Fall of 2020 and three regional conferences occurred in April 2021, attracting over 500 participants. Since the launch of Phase Two in October 2020, there has been a 10% increase in the number of patients receiving buprenorphine and a 56% increase in the 8 of 24 number of providers prescribing buprenorphine. Further, the infrastructure developed to support Phase 1 and 2 of the SCOUTT initiative also supports level one clinics at facilities that are not formally involved in the SCOUTT initiative. Phase 3 facilities are now voluntarily being enrolled such that the SCOUTT initiative is within 80 clinics in over 40 facilities. In FY 2023, a pilot collaboration four Comprehensive Health Women's Clinics and four SCOUTT initiative facilities was initiated to improve the access and quality of care of women Veterans who have substance use disorders. The SCOUTT initiative has demonstrated unique models of care delivery for M-OUD in Level 1 clinics. These care models include nurse care management, pharmacy care management, and hub and spoke models. Almost all SCOUTT initiative clinics are involved in telehealth provision of care, proceeding and after the start of the COVID pandemic. The number of patients receiving M-OUD within the SCOUTT clinics on a monthly basis has increased, monthly, even during the pandemic. The number of prescribers prescribing M-OUD has nearly tripled within the SCOUTT initiative clinics. The initiative is popular and valued by clinicians. In 2021, evidence-based M-OUD, including office-based treatment with buprenorphine and extended- injectable naltrexone, was accessible to patients seen at 100% of VHA medical centers. VHA operates federally regulated opioid treatment programs that can provide methadone maintenance on-site at 33 larger urban locations and at a growing number of VHA facilities that maintain contractual arrangements or arrange non-VA care for providing care through community-based licensed opioid treatment programs. VHA continues to expand the availability of M-OUD for Veterans and to that end, is exploring models for mobile medication units with plans to establish pilot units in one to two sites in FY 2023. Given the lead time necessary to purchase a mobile medication unit, VA is considering contracting for these services from community mobile medication service providers. Lessons learned from VA's pilots will inform plans to expand these services more broadly through the enterprise. VA recognizes that one proposed purpose of mobile medication units is to increase access to justice- involved Veterans. VA does not have the authority to treat incarcerated Veterans as they are excluded from the VA medical benefits package under 38 CFR 17.38(c)(5). However, options to increase access of M-OUD for justice-involved Veterans who are not incarcerated are also being explored. VA monitors the percent of patients with OUD who receive M-OUD (46.3% through quarter four of 2022) as part of the Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative (PDSI). PDSI is a nationwide psychopharmacology quality improvement (QI) program that supports facility-level QI through quarterly quality metrics, clinical decision support tools, technical assistance for QI strategic implementation, and a virtual learning collaborative. Since fourth quarter of 2019, VA has seen a 4% increase in the number of Veterans that received M-OUD (total of 27,456 for 2022). Starting in 2021, the PDSI has expanded its focus to include safer prescribing of stimulant medication. The number of providers with a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) X-waiver have also continued to increase since the fourth quarter of 2021 with over 8,300 providers who have written any prescription issued to the VHA pharmacy (VA employed and community providers serving Veterans) as of December 2022 holding an X-Waiver. This reflects an increase of 28% from the same time point in 2021. VA has realized that it will be critical to go beyond providers obtaining a waiver that allows them to prescribe buprenorphine. The number of providers with a DEA X-waiver that prescribed buprenorphine is significantly lower than the number of providers with an X-waiver with only 17% of those providers with an X-waiver issuing a prescription for buprenorphine as of December 2022. While the number of providers is increasing, VA is focusing efforts to remove barriers to prescribing and to support the initiation of buprenorphine when indicated. VHA Notice 2019-18, Buprenorphine Prescribing for Opioid Use Disorder was published in October 2019 (as VHA Notice 2020-30) and re- issued in September 2020 and again in February 2022 (as VHA Notice 2022-02) by the Undersecretary with the intent of clarifying national policy and tasking facilities to remove potential barriers to prescribing if present. In January of 2021, in an effort to reduce prescribing barriers, VHA also 9 of 24 removed the requirement for written consent to provide buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD. In addition, in July 2020, VA formalized efforts to provide training to support efforts to ensure that all providers eligible to obtain an X-waiver had access to the training utilizing primarily an 8-hour half and half (four hours online and four hours live training) for physicians and a 24-hour training model for eligible non-physician prescribing providers. Between the SCOUTT initiative and Medication Addiction Treatment in the VA (MAT-VA) initiative, four monthly one-hour monthly webinars regarding substance use disorder education and training have been attended by 7,315 participants. Between January 2021 and December 2022 VA offered half-day waiver trainings with over 660 providers trained. In addition, shorter trainings were initiated for providers and other interdisciplinary staff who support M-OUD (\"Buprenorphine 101 for the non-Addictionologist\"). The VA has also started offering \"office hour\" sessions for M-OUD treatment consultation with subject matter experts (SMEs) where providers can discuss cases and ask question of SMEs in live sessions as well as continuing consultation via e-mail through the VHA \"Ask the Expert Program\" and direct live patient consultation through the National TeleMental Health Center. VHA also recognizes the importance of capturing more detailed information on providers most likely to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD and has developed tools that will allow for improved understanding of availability of X-waivered providers by practice setting. In support of interprofessional team-based models of care, VA is leveraging Clinical Pharmacist Practitioners (CPPs) to deliver comprehensive medication management services and improve Veteran access to SUD care. In partnership with the VA Office of Rural Health (ORH), the VA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Clinical Pharmacy Practice Office (CPPO) launched a nationwide initiative in 2020 to expand the CPPs workforce focused on improving access to evidence-based treatment in OUD and alcohol use disorder (AUD) for rural Veterans. Since initiation, 51 VA facilities have been awarded funding to hire 64 CPPs across Mental Health, Pain Management, Primary Care and SUD Specialty Care settings. As part of this project, three regional train-the-trainer clinical pharmacy boot camps were held virtually in June and July 2020 and trained 234 VA-CPPs with the goal of advancing CPPs practice in SUD care and harm reduction principles across level one clinics, in alignment with the SCOUTT initiative. All boot camp participants completed 24-hour DEA X-waiver training prior to the boot camp in anticipation that future legislation may include pharmacist practitioners as potential providers of buprenorphine-based therapy, furthering access to M-OUD. In FY 2022, 208 CPPs routinely delivered OUD care across practice settings to almost 28,000 Veterans over 47,000 patient care encounters. This represents double the number of CPPs practicing OUD care delivery since the implementation of the SCOUTT initiative. When looking at SUD care broadly, 516 CPPs routinely delivered SUD care to over 91,000 Veterans and over 162,418 patient care encounters in FY 2022. In partnership with the Pain Management Opioid Safety and Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PMOP), a new project commenced in FY 2022 to support screening and treating OUD in patients with chronic pain through the hiring of CPP and Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant practitioner teams at 78 VA facilities. Given the collaboration with ORH and PMOP, VA expects significant CPP practice growth in OUD (as well as general SUD), to continue in 2023 and beyond. Related to, but not specific to OUD treatment, VHA is expanding the number of Syringe Service Programs (SSPs) enterprise wide (see section on SSPs under harm reduction efforts below). Through SSPs, VA plans to support SUD treatment engagement among Veterans who use drug by injection, and, among those Veterans, increase its capacity for low threshold buprenorphine treatment for Veterans with OUD. As VA expands its implementation of SSP, it plans to evaluate the expansion to identify best practices and challenges experienced by early adopters. Advancing racial equity and diversity in our approach to drug policy In June 2021 VHA brought together a workgroup to better understand gender/ethnic/racial, Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Questioning and others (LGBTQ+) SUD healthcare disparities in VHA with 10 of 24 the goal of piloting target interventions for the largest gaps in 2022 and then based on the results of these pilots disseminating best practices to the field in 2023. The workgroup is comprised of SUD subject matter experts, researchers, and clinical leaders from VA SUD treatment programs. The workgroup currently is focusing its attention on racial and gender disparities in access to medications for opioid use disorder (M-OUD). The Workgroup is identifying VA sites with little to no disparity in access to M-OUD as well as sites with higher rates of disparity. By doing so, the workgroup plans to identify challenges to equitable access to M-OUD as well as best practices to resolve such disparities and promote equity in SUD care in general across the enterprise. This project is consistent with Executive Order 13985 \"Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government\" because it will advance equity because it will take a systematic approach to inform efforts to improve fairness in access to evidence-based medications for opioid use disorder. In addition, Mental Health residential treatment services, including SUD residential services for women Veterans are available in every VISN. Across the residential programs that serve women Veterans, 62% offer gender specific mental health services and 56% offer a separate, secure wing or unit for women Veterans. For those women Veterans requesting a residential program for women Veterans only, there are currently 13 programs that serve as national resources available to meet that need. Five of the women-only programs provide intensive specialty treatment for substance use. Further, about 37% of VA facilities offer women-only outpatient SUD or PTSD-SUD treatment, and all of VA facilities offer individual SUD or SUD-PTSD treatment for women Veterans. Finally, VA is developing at least two additional women only residential SUD treatment programs that will serve as national referral resources for women Veterans. VHA also has pursued educational efforts to promote culturally competent SUD care, e.g., its Best SUD Care Anywhere webinar series has convened webinars on SUD care for women (in 2019), culturally competent SUD care (in 2020) and is convening a webinar on SUD care for Native Americans in January 2022. For the past several years, the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP) has been working collaboratively with VHA's Office of Health Equity (OHE) in identifying issues related to capturing Veteran demographic data in our current electronic health record so that disparities in mental health services can be accurately assessed. Further, OMHSP has been examining data related to staffing and disparities in provision of mental health services. More recently, OMHSP is planning expansion of the collaboration with OHE. Work by OMHSP and OHE are part of broader VA strategies to improve equity. These strategies include improving data to understand and track disparities especially for sexual minority Veterans and Veterans with health-related social risks; supporting recruitment, professional development, and advancement of diverse groups of leaders to ensure an inclusive workforce; establishing safe workplaces that leverage diversity and empower all staff; ensuring equity in pay and contracting; promoting special emphasis programs and employee resource groups to advance equity for all employees; and delivering training and learning to support diversity, equity, and inclusion. Addressing stigma in SUD treatment The VA has proposed language into planned SUD policy aimed at stressing the importance of adopting of consistent, Veteran-centric, science-based language regarding substance use. In addition, this concept is being stressed at multiple community of practice meetings which reach SUD leadership and front-line providers across the VA enterprise. Stigma is also a topic that was recently addressed in the VA webinar series, \"Best SUD Care Anywhere!\" open to federal partners including the Department of Defense. 11 of 24 Make the Connection website The Make the Connection website campaign is an online resource featuring over 600 Veterans who have shared their stories of strength and resilience in the hopes of encouraging others to reach out for support. The campaign connects Veterans, their family members and friends, and other supporters with information, resources, and solutions to mental health challenges affecting their lives. MaketheConnection.net is VA's premier mental health literacy and anti-stigma website allowing users to explore mental health conditions and their signs and symptoms in plain language; and find resources in their community. Individuals can find a number of testimonials related to substance use disorder like \"You don't have to face your challenges alone\". Additional resources available at Make the Connection include education on mental health and SUD treatment, self-assessment, and self-help guidance, and how to access formal care. Resources are just specific to Veterans, their loved ones, clinicians, active-duty service members, and reservists also are available. A subsection of the website is dedicated to SUD: available here as well as related signs and symptoms. Other Communication Efforts VA continues to utilize various communication channels to provide education and awareness as it relates to de-stigmatize SUD care and providing resources. Among those efforts include the following: x VA's Mental Health Website - A website that provides several resources, information on treatment options, and more related to mental health. The site includes specific information as it relates to SUD which includes brief (30 and 15 second videos) aimed at educating audiences about Stimulant Use Disorders and the treatment options available VA (Substance Use: Stimulant Use Disorder - Mental Health (va.gov)) x Utilization of VA communication channels such as posting on VA's Facebook, Instagram and Twitter platform as well as proving blogs for VA News related to: o Alcohol: VA posts VantagePoint blogs intended to educate the public about safer and risky drinking levels as well as treatment available through VA. o Overdose prevention: VA also posts VantagePoint blogs related to overdose protection. Enhancing evidence-based harm reduction efforts Opioid Safety Initiative VHA continues to pursue a comprehensive strategy to promote safe prescribing of opioids when indicated for effective pain management. The purpose of the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) is to ensure pain management is addressed thoughtfully, compassionately, and safely. The OSI makes the totality of opioid use visible at all levels in the organization. Based on comparisons of national data between the quarter beginning in quarter four of 2012 (beginning in July 2012) to quarter four of 2021 (ending in September 2021), many aspects of the OSI continue to show positive results. Fewer than 377,679 Veterans were on long-term opioids. The average dose of selected opioids has continued to decline as 60,652 fewer patients received morphine equivalent daily doses greater than or equal to 90 milligrams, demonstrating that prescribing and consumption behaviors are changing. The desired results of OSI have been achieved when VHA has seen a 6% increase in Veterans that have utilized VHA outpatient pharmacy services. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 50 million adults in the United States have chronic daily pain, with 19.6 million adults experiencing high-impact chronic pain that interferes with daily life or work activities. Chronic pain is a national public health problem as outlined in the 2011 study by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM study describes in detail many concerns of pain management, including system-wide deficits in the training of our Nation's health care professionals in pain management and substance use disorders prevention and management, and the problems caused by a fragmented health care system. The overuse and misuse of opioids for pain 12 of 24 management in the United States is a consequence of a health care system that, until recently, was less than fully prepared to respond to these challenges. VHA has identified and broadly responded to the many challenges of pain management through policies supporting clinical monitoring, education, and training of health professionals and teams with the expansion of clinical resources and programs. VHA's Pain Management Directive defines and describes policy expectations and responsibilities for the overall National Pain Management Strategy and Stepped Care pain model, which is evidence-based and has been adopted by the DoD as well. Our approach to managing opioid overuse fits into this plan, and the VA has employed broad strategies to address the opioid epidemic: education, pain management, risk mitigation, and addiction treatment. First, VHA addressed the problem of clinically inappropriate high-dose prescribing of opioids through the VA's national program, OSI. Second, VHA developed an effective system of interdisciplinary, patient-aligned pain management with the competency to provide safe and effective pain control and quality of life for Veterans for the remainder of their lives. VHA has reduced the reliance on opioid medication for pain management by more than 60% since 2012, largely by starting fewer patients newly on long-term opioid therapy and by offering pain care options that are safer and more effective in the long run. Most of the decline in VHA opioid prescriptions is not due to Veterans \"getting by\" with fewer opioids, but by following a Stepped Care Model for Pain treatment addressing the causes of pain with fewer Veterans requiring the initiation of long-term opioid therapy. VHA has been recognized by many as a leader in the pain management field for the responsible use of opioids. Notably, VHA has organized many types of interdisciplinary pain care teams to help with medication safety, patient education, pain schools, cognitive behavioral therapy and helping patients transition from a biomedical to a biopsychosocial model of pain care. As VHA continues its efforts to address opioid overuse, non-opioid treatments, and complementary and integrative medicine treatments (such as massage therapy, yoga, meditation, occupational therapy, physical therapy, recreational therapy, acupuncture, tai chi, etc.) are an important component to VHA's Pain Management Strategy. Additionally, VHA has formalized a system-wide Academic Detailing program that is in the process of being implemented throughout the organization. Academic Detailing provides specialty teams to visit facilities and provide on-site support and education to providers to further enhance pain management efforts. The Academic Detailing program is another important step to improve mental health, substance use disorder, and pain management medication therapy across all VHA medical centers. As of September 30, 2022, academic detailers (specially trained VA Pharmacists) have held 82,850 outreach visits related to Opioid Safety, Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution, opioid use disorder, and suicide prevention. As VHA continues its efforts to address opioid over-use, complementary and integrative medicine treatments are an important component to VHA's Pain Management Strategy. VHA currently offers many complementary and integrative medicine treatments, many of which may be useful in chronic pain. These treatments include acupressure, acupuncture, biofeedback, chiropractic services, exercise, heated pool therapy, hypnosis/hypnotherapy, massage therapy, meditation, occupational therapy, physical therapy, recreational therapy, relaxation, tai chi, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, yoga and other services. VHA has several other programs that are complementary to the Opioid Safety Initiative and include: x State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP): Fifty (50) States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico are activated for outgoing transmission of VA controlled substances prescription data. Fifty (50) of 54 individual states/regional/territories PDMPs are currently participating in the VA's new integrated PDMP query solution. Since the solution was 13 of 24 deployed across VA on November 9, 2020, over two million queries have been executed with the PDMP button to help guide treatment solutions. This does not include queries that are done manually, for example, from those states that are not yet integrated into the PDMP solution. x Medication Take-Back Program: VA offers free medication take back services to Veterans through mail-back envelopes and on-site receptacles compliant with Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulations. As of September 30, 2021, Veterans have returned over 250 tons of unwanted or unneeded medication using these services. In October 2022, VA also commenced its implementation of the DUMP Opioids Act (P.L. 117-29) with its inaugural controlled substance prescription medication take-back days on October 28 and 29. VA's bi- annual take-back days will coincide with DEA's medication take-back days in April and October of each year, thus expanding opportunities for Veterans and members of the general public to safely and securely dispose of unused controlled substance prescription medications in VA locations. Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution The VA Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program aims to decrease opioid-related overdose deaths among VHA patients by providing education on opioid overdose prevention, recognition of opioid overdose, and training on the rescue response, including provision of naloxone. All three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved forms of naloxone (injectable, nasal spray and auto-injector) that the FDA states can be considered as options for community distribution were added to the VA National Formulary as soon as they were available. The nasal spray formulation is currently available through every VHA facility. VHA assembled injectable naloxone kits as part of its initial OEND program. These were replaced by the auto-injector\u2014specifically designed for layperson use\u2014when that formulation became available. However, the auto-injector was abruptly discontinued by the pharmaceutical manufacturer on September 30, 2020. In response, VHA has started re-assembling the injectable (intramuscular) naloxone kits and also has the new Zimhi\u00ae injection formulation available. VHA recommends offering OEND to Veterans prescribed or using opioids who are at increased risk for opioid overdose or whose provider deems it clinically indicated. Given the increase in opioid-involved stimulant overdoses, VHA also recommends offering OEND to Veterans with stimulant use disorders. Academic Detailing has promoted OEND through individualized, evidence-based educational outreach visits and consultation for clinicians by clinicians. In July 2016, Congress took the important step of eliminating copayment requirements for opioid antagonists (e.g., naloxone) furnished to Veterans at high risk for overdose and for education on their use (per P. L. 114-98, title IX, the Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act). This change has been implemented throughout VHA and a final rule has been published in the Federal Register that amended two of VA's copayment regulations, 38 CFR 17.108 and 17.110, to accurately implement these changes into the Code of Federal Regulations. The proposed rule also defines who VHA considers to be at high risk for overdose. This definition will assist in the implementation of the public law and facilitate identification of high-risk Veterans. Early identification of these Veterans can facilitate provision of lifesaving opioid antagonist medication. Since implementation of the OEND program in 2014, over 46,600 VHA prescribers, representing all VHA facilities, have prescribed naloxone, and more than 882,000 naloxone prescriptions have been dispensed to over 409,900 Veterans (as of December 2022). Through December 2022, as documented through spontaneous reporting of overdose reversal events as well as through a national note, over 3,400 overdose reversals with naloxone have been reported. As of April 2021, 129 VHA facilities had equipped 3,552 VA Police officers with naloxone, with 136 reported opioid overdose reversals with VA Police naloxone, and 77 VHA facilities had equipped 1,095 External Defibrillator Automated (AED) cabinets with naloxone, with ten reported opioid overdose 14 of 24 reversals with AED cabinet naloxone. VHA's Rapid Naloxone Initiative received the 2020 John M. Eisenberg National Level Innovation in Patient Safety and Quality Award. This prestigious award from The Joint Commission (TJC) and National Quality Forum recognizes those who have made significant and long-lasting contributions to improving patient safety and health care quality. Notably, in 2018 VHA dispensed a naloxone prescription for 1 in 6 patients on high- dose opioids, as compared to 1 in 69 patients in the private sector. Finally, as part of the broader OEND effort, VHA has established a community of practice for sharing innovative and promising practices which has included discussion of post-overdose engagement in treatment. Materials developed in support of the OEND initiative also are available to Veterans, their family members, and the broader public. Syringe Service Programs In May of 2021 the Assistant Under Secretary for Clinical Services issued interim guidance on Syringe Services Programs (SSPs) recommending that VA medical Centers develop SSPs or otherwise ensure Veterans enrolled in VHA care have access to SSPs where such programs are not prohibited under state, county, or local law. In addition to providing access to sterile needles, syringes and other supplies, SSPs facilitate safe disposal of used syringes and provide the opportunity to link to other important services, such as low barrier buprenorphine induction, and programs such as OEND, screening and treatment for viral hepatitis and HIV, screening for sexually transmitted infections and referral to social, mental health, and other medical services. VHA is currently in the process of drafting a directive supporting the establishment of SSPs in VHA Medical Centers where not prohibited by under state, county, or local law. In 2022, VHA is working on developing a national electronic medical record note template for SSPs to facilitate documentation of screening for infectious diseases associated with injection drug use, vaccinations, referrals for services, and dispensing of SSP kits along with other harm reduction supplies (e.g., naloxone, fentanyl test strips, condoms). VHA has a contract in place that provides six standard VHA SSP kits for VHA facilities standing up SSPs, facilitating consistent practices in assembling, prescribing, and dispensing a specified set of essential sterile items to Veterans who inject drugs. VHA is also developing a Talent Management System (TMS) training to enhance provider knowledge about harm reduction and SSPs and give them the information they need to educate Veterans on safer injection practices and safer drug use. At the start of 2022, there were four VHA facilities operating SSPs, with another 18 VHA facilities close to standing up and implementing SSPs. By December 2022 there were nine VHA facilities operating SSPs and continuing into 2023, VHA expects the number of programs to increase significantly with implementation of the SSP Directive, SSP National note, and standard SSP kits. FY 2023 efforts will focus on assisting programs with implementation via data tools and other supportive resources. VHA will promote integration of comprehensive harm reduction practices including distribution of fentanyl test strips, and work to disseminate proven innovations to the maximum extent possible. Moreover, in light of the difficulties in identifying potential patients for outreach regarding SSPs given the lack of ICD-10-CM codes to capture injection drug use (IDU), in December 2022, VHA submitted a formal request to add a new ICD-10-CM code to capture IDU. It is also trying to use natural language processing and constellations of ICD-10-CM codes to try to identify potential candidates for SSPs. Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM) To further strengthen the aforementioned Opioid Safety Initiative and Opioid Education and Naloxone Distribution, VHA has deployed state-of-the-art tools to help protect Veteran patients using high-doses of opioids or with other SUD or medical risk factors that put them at an increased risk of complications from opioid overdose. These tools include information about the dosages of opioids and other sedative medication, significant medical problems that could contribute to an adverse reaction and monitoring 15 of 24 data to aid in the review and management of complex patients. Among the tools is the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM), which is available to all clinical staff in the VHA. STORM allows VHA providers to view information about risk factors for opioid overdose, suicide-related events and other harms and recommends patient-specific risk mitigation strategies. The STORM model, which estimates risk of overdose or suicide events or death for all patients, has been incorporated in a decision support tool to support population management and individual patient risk review aimed at reducing fatal overdoses. This system encourages and facilitates naloxone distribution to patients at elevated risk of overdose. In addition to this general decision support, VA mandated that all patients identified as very high risk, per the STORM risk estimates, receive a case review by an interdisciplinary team of providers with expertise spanning pain, mental health, addiction, pharmacy and rehabilitation. Since VA mandated case reviews for all Veterans identified as very high risk for overdose or suicide by STORM, a randomized program evaluation found a 22% reduction in all-cause mortality among patients targeted by this prevention program. Given these findings, efforts to improve implementation of this prevention program have continued. the policy was modified on December 1, 2021, to additionally require interdisciplinary case reviews of patients with past year overdoses and patients who were very high risk and recently discontinued opioids analgesics. Completion of interdisciplinary team reviews for patients on opioid analgesics estimated at very high risk increased from 29.8%, at the time of the evaluation, to 50% in FY 2019 Q4 and to 75.2% in FY 2021 Q4. With expansion of the cohort of very high-risk patients to include patients who had discontinued opioids analgesics in the past 6 months as well as those on opioid analgesics, completion rates declined slightly to 69.3%, though the number of completed reviews increased from to 8,584 in FY 2022 Completion of reviews for patients with past year overdoses also increased. By FY 2022 Q4, VA interdisciplinary teams had reviewed 52.4% of this new patient population. Post-Overdose Assessment and Care Planning During 2019, VHA implemented a process for documenting all overdoses, including accidental and severe adverse effect overdoses as a component of suicide prevention efforts. Implementation of the Suicide Behavior and Overdose Report (SBOR) note template provides a foundation for VHA to implement strategies designed specifically to address the myriad of overdose risk factors from a patient- centered perspective and to support Veteran engagement in timely treatment following a non-fatal overdose (opioid and non-opioid related). In July 2021, VHA mandated use of a national medical record note template to report overdose (e.g., SBOR), with a focus on improving post-overdose care. As past non-fatal overdoses increase the risk of future overdose events, VHA also mandated facilities have a process to ensure that overdose events are reviewed with a focus on engaging patients in treatment. In general, VHA is aligning the required processes for reporting non-fatal overdoses with the already required reporting and post-event treatment interventions for Veterans who make a suicide attempt. This initiative involves a national medical record note template designed to standardize and streamline the process of overdose reporting across VHA, enhancing the visibility of accidental overdoses within the Veteran's medical record, improving clinical care after the suicide/overdose event, and facilitating real-time tracking of overdose event data, for use in clinical decision support tools and local/national aggregate reports. VHA is in the process of implementing a memorandum for Naloxone to High-Risk Veterans aimed to ensure that Veterans with a previous opioid- or stimulant-overdose who do not have naloxone are offered opioid overdose education and a prescription for naloxone no later than December 31, 2023. Advancing recovery-ready workplaces and expanding the addiction workforce/ Expanding access to recovery support services. x Expanding the addiction workforce to support residential and general SUD care delivery (including funding for new SUD providers in our General Mental Health Clinics, Primary Care- 16 of 24 Mental Health Integration Programs and through the addition of telehealth providers in our Clinical Resource Hubs) x Enhancing employment opportunities for Veterans in recovery by funding SUD specific supported employment staff at VA Medical Centers o During 2021, 59% of Veterans newly enrolled in VHA Vocational services had a SUD diagnosis. However, research has shown that Veterans are frequently not assessed for, or if assessed, not referred to vocational services suggesting the number of Veterans in need of vocational support may be higher. Review of the literature suggests the SE has the potential to significantly improve employment outcomes for those Veterans experiencing SUD concerns, particularly those Veterans with other co-occurring conditions (Lones et al., 2017; Rosenheck & Mares, 2007; Mueser et al., 2011). The NDCS emphasizes the need for VA to explore opportunities to support expanded access to employment for those in recovery. VA Supported Employment (SE) is currently available to Veterans diagnosed with a Serious Mental Illness. Expansion to serve Veterans with SUD is being phased in over 2022 and 2023 with sustainment needed in 2024 and 2025 to hire additional staff at VA medical centers to provide the necessary vocational supports as well as support for implementation to include mechanisms for monitoring fidelity to the SE model of care. Considering the current pandemic and impact on unemployment rates nationally, the budget seeks to increase access to SE services for Veterans diagnosed with a SUD with support. x Increasing Peer Support Services by increasing the number of SUD-Specific Peer Specialists at VA Medical Centers. Specific training in SUD is being planned for Peer Specialists. Strategies to help support hiring of Peer Specialists with bilingual skills will be initiated. o Specific training focused on peer specialists' roles in assisting Veterans with SUD was provided to peer specialists and their supervisors at the four-day VHA Peer Specialist and Peer Support Services Virtual National Conference which took place in August 2022. Additional training for staff regarding hiring, training, supervision of peer specialists, and examples of peer specialists' interventions for Veterans with SUD was presented at the VHA Substance Use Disorder Treatment Virtual Conference that occurred in October 2022. x Homeless program SUD coordinator positions were also awarded enterprise-wide to engage homeless Veterans with SUD into VA SUD outpatient and residential services. Other Initiatives Veterans Justice Programs The Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook affirmed that \"Police encounters and pre-trial court proceedings are often missed opportunities to connect Veterans with VA mental health services as a negotiated alternative to incarceration or other criminal sanctions.\" VA medical centers provide outreach to justice-involved Veterans in the communities they serve. VA services for justice-involved Veterans are provided through two dedicated national programs, both prevention-oriented components of VA's Homeless Programs: Health Care for Reentry Veterans (HCRV) and Veterans Justice Outreach (VJO). Known collectively as the Veterans Justice Programs (VJP), HCRV and VJO facilitate access to needed VA health care and other services for Veterans at all stages of the criminal justice process, from initial contact with law enforcement through community reentry following extended incarceration. HCRV Specialists provide outreach to Veterans approaching release from state and Federal prisons. They briefly assess reentry Veterans' probable treatment needs, help Veterans plan to access responsive 17 of 24 services upon release, and provide post-release follow-up as needed to ensure that Veterans are engaged with needed services. Most HCRV Specialists are based at VA medical centers, but they typically serve Veterans across a large area, often conducting outreach to prison facilities in at least one entire state, and sometimes an entire VISN. VJO Specialists serve Veterans at earlier stages of the criminal justice process, with a three-pronged focus on outreach to community law enforcement, jails, and courts. VJO Specialists at each VA medical center work with Veterans in the local criminal courts (including but not limited to the Veterans Treatment Courts, or VTCs), conduct outreach in local jails, and engage with local law enforcement by delivering VA-focused training sessions and other informational presentations. Each VA medical center has at least one VJO Specialist, who serves as a liaison between VA and the local criminal justice system. Public Law 115-240, The Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act of 2018, signed September 17, 2018, required VA to hire 50 new VJO Specialists to serve in VTCs, in addition to their other outreach duties. VA medical centers have filled all of these positions, as well as an additional 46 positions added from 2020 to 2022. Veterans who are seen by HCRV and VJO Specialists access VA mental health and substance use treatment at high rates. Most Veterans seen in the VJO program have a mental health (72%) or SUD (56%) diagnosis, or both (48%). Within one year of their VJO outreach visit, 92% of Veterans with mental health diagnoses participated in at least one VHA mental health visit. Within the same timeframe, 66% of Veterans with substance use disorder diagnoses received at least one VHA substance use disorder visit. These Veterans averaged 12 outpatient visits that year. Veterans seen by HCRV Specialists have a similar profile, with 43% with a mental health diagnosis, 23% with a SUD diagnosis and 18% with both. Veterans in HCRV access VHA care at high rates, but slightly lower than those in VJO with 86% of those with a mental health diagnosis having at least one visit, an average of 11 outpatient visits within one year of their HCRV outreach visit. For those with a SUD, 52% received at least one visit, and an average of six outpatient visits within one year of their HCRV outreach visit. Improving access to treatment and care for this segment of the Veteran population is in direct alignment with the identified agency goals.. In communities where justice programs relevant to Veterans exist (Veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts, and police crisis intervention teams), VA has taken the initiative in building working relationships to ensure that eligible justice-involved Veterans get needed care. In communities where no such programs exist, VA has reached out to potential justice system partners (judges, prosecutors, police, and jail administrators) to connect eligible justice-involved Veterans with needed VA services including addiction treatment. VJO specialists currently serve Veterans in 623 Veterans Treatment Courts and other Veteran-focused courts, with more planned. Their duties in a Veterans Treatment Court include linkage to VHA treatment services. These specialists also educate and advocate for the availability of evidence-based SUD treatments, especially MOUD, in criminal justice settings and in preparation for transition of patients from those settings to community living. In communities without Veterans Treatment Courts, VA medical centers have established relationships with a range of justice system and community partners, including police and sheriffs' departments, local jail administrators, judges, prosecutors, public defenders, probation officers, and community mental health providers. Collaboration with Federal Partners VHA is committed to working collaboratively with other Federal Partners in support of the National Drug Control Strategy and will continue to share insights of VHA efforts and input into the national drug strategy agenda to address SUD care with ONDCP and other interagency partners. With the 18 of 24 support of ONDCP, VHA provided an update on VHA peer support services through a webinar in September 2020 and has presented on VA's experience with Supported Employment initiatives in 2022. VA collaborates with a variety of Federal Agencies on several Interagency Policy Committees (IPCs) and Work Groups (IWGs) including the ONDCP Substance Use Disorder Data IWG; Pregnant People, Substance Use Disorder and Child Welfare Substance Use Disorder in Pregnancy sub-IPC, and the ONDCP-DPC Recovery-Ready Workplace Interagency Workgroup. VHA also works closely with The Department of Health and Human Services/ Substance Abuse and Mental health Services Administration (SAMHSA) on issue related to OTPs, SUD treatment and harm reduction initiatives. Through VHA's interagency work, VA is participating or expects to participate in solutions to a variety of areas in the NDCS including enhancing federal harm reduction efforts to support state and local partners; assessing current evidence base on harm reduction strategies and developing a plan for additional translational research; conducting a national harm reduction needs assessment; consulting with experts on harm reduction; and implementing a national case-finding initiative. Furthermore, VHA has worked collaboratively with the Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) on joint training opportunities in the SUD lane including overdose prevention, opioid safety and evidence-based SUD practice. VHA is also collaborating actively with Health and Human Services (HSS)/ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) on education related to Contingency Management and oversight of the VA Opioid Treatment programs. VHA also recently worked with HSS in FY 2020 to provide access for staff from IHS and the Bureau of Prisons to join the Clinical Pharmacy Boot Camps to support expansion of SUD services supported by Clinical Pharmacy Specialists with 32 Public Health Service partners participating in this virtual program. VHA is currently working collaboratively with the DoD to share lessons learned across the agencies to support access to M-OUD, particularly for transitioning service members and in 2021 VHA along with DoD updated the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Substance Use Disorders. The accompanying Department of Veterans Affairs Resource Summary (page 25) was prepared in accordance with the following ONDCP circulars (a) National Drug Control Program Agency Compliance Reviews dated September 9, 2021, (b) Budget Formulation, dated September 9, 2021, and (c) Budget Execution, dated September 9, 2021. In accordance with the guidance provided in the Office of National Drug Control Policy's letter of September 7, 2004, VA's methodology only incorporates Specialized Treatment costs. Further, in accordance with guidance provided in the Office of National Drug Control Policy's FY 2012 certification letter of November 24, 2010, incorporates Specialized Treatment costs regardless of setting. Specialized Treatment Costs ( Dollars in Millions ) 1 Specialized Treatment VHA Obligations Care in the Community Obligations Total Obligations not add due to rounding VA does not track obligations by ONDCP function. In the absence of such capability, obligations by specialized treatment costs have been furnished, as indicated. 19 of 24 MEDICAL & PROSTHETIC RESEARCH VHA research supports the generation of new knowledge to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of substance use disorders (SUD) (e.g., opioids, alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, cannabis, methamphetamine, etc.), and the harms associated with SUD. Veterans have experienced many of the problems of SUD that is further complicated with the co-existence of mental health and other conditions, including pain and traumatic brain injury. VHA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) continues to support research on SUD by maintaining existing efforts and by developing new programs. Harm Reduction x Naloxone distribution. As of December 2022, over 409,000 Veterans were dispensed naloxone kits with over 3,400 reported reversals. Current research focuses on 1) Characterizing the distribution of kits to patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) and its effectiveness, and 2) At risk patients prescribed opioid analgesics receiving naloxone kits compared to patients that did not receive kits and incidence of accidental overdoses. This study will determine whether VA is meeting its intended goal of reducing opioid overdose among Veterans. x Assessing current evidence base on harm reduction strategies and develop a plan for additional translational research. VHA and ORD have solicited the Health Services Research and Development's Evidence Synthesis Program to conduct a comprehensive analysis on this topic. Evidence based on pertinent publications will be compiled and analyzed then presented to VHA and ORD as an Evidence Compendium. This product will provide an overview of published reviews and primary studies, describing the characteristics of the syringe services programs studied, the methodologies employed by studies in this area, and the outcomes assessed. A gaps analysis will be conducted to guide the development of future funding opportunities in these areas. x Supporting harm reduction training and education for the treatment workforce. Stepped Care for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Train-the-Trainer (SCOUTT) is a model aiming to improve access to OUD treatment and prevent suicide by training non-SUD specialty-care teams to deliver buprenorphine and naltrexone. Once the practice is established, these trained providers then train other individuals at other VA Medical Centers using the same approach. This is an ongoing study. x Promoting access to harm reduction services. Research on access targeting Veterans living in rural communities and whether these Veterans utilize services such as complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches in parallel with opioid tapering regimens and Veterans' access to buprenorphine. In a second study, buprenorphine prescribing practices by providers are compared between rural versus urban Veterans to address health care disparities within the VA. More recent studies focus on the delivery of cognitive behavior therapy delivered via telehealth to improve pain and opioid outcomes, providing access to care for Veterans living in rural communities. x Comprehensive programs on harm reduction. These programs delve into preventing additional adverse events associated with SUD including viral and bacterial infections by working with VA Medical Centers, community agencies and Veterans to develop comprehensive harm reaction \"bundles\". These \"bundles\" include access to sterile syringes, Narcan and overdose prevention education, skin cleaning education and recommendations for infectious disease screening and other prevention resources. The \"bundles\" will be adapted for use in different settings including in- or outpatient as well as in the rural community. 20 of 24 Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Treatment x Improving treatment engagement. An innovative use of saliva toxicology tests providing rapid point-of-care results to inform medication for OUD is being evaluated within the VA. Use of saliva allows patients to self-test, avoiding the requirement to produce urine samples under supervision at the lab or clinic, which is stigmatizing. If successful, saliva toxicology toolkits can be implemented within the VA healthcare system. x Improving treatment quality. VHA ORD funds several studies examining the role of opioid or medication for OUD reduction or discontinuation focusing on the patient and risk for adverse events. These studies examine different tapering and discontinuation procedures and the consequences including changes in pain outcomes, quality of life, and interactions with providers. Recent studies focus on loneliness and SUD, and delivery of care using telehealth. x Emphasizing care for Veterans living with co-existing SUD and mental health conditions. Sleep quality, PTSD/anxiety, TBI and depression are key conditions that often co-exist with SUD. Research in these areas focus on a whole health approach to treat the mind and body. x Treatment for individuals leaving incarceration. Currently there are few psychosocial programs focused on transition from incarceration toward reentry into society, the difficulties encountered and tools to use to assist in the transition process. An ORD study seeks to develop a rehabilitation program for Veterans exiting imprisonment that is rated acceptable and usable by Veterans, and the concurrent development of assessment tools to be used with Veterans exiting incarceration to promote successful transition and avoid reincarceration (NCT04366531).A second program focuses on recidivism risk and the development of a rehabilitation treatment program that includes SUD services, peer support, employment and/or educational support, and trauma-informed care. This approach was found to be successful in several pilot studies and is now in a randomized clinical trial (NCT04523337). Building a Recovery-Ready Nation x Eliminating Barriers and Increasing Opportunities. VA researchers are identifying the barriers to and facilitators of sustained employment among Veterans with OUD/SUD. These studies examine the role of supported employment services on occupational and long-term employment outcomes, as well as sobriety, community integration and quality of life (NCT05388812 and NCT04969081). In summary, VHA ORD continues its commitment to placing substance/opioid use disorders as an area of high priority in the hopes of stimulating the field to develop, test and implement novel strategies towards the treatment of SUD. In addition, VHA continues to reduce excessive reliance on opioid medication, VA will maintain efforts in 2024 on pain-management research in areas responsive to the Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act , Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act , and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act . Towards this goal, VA continues to invest in: x Non-pharmaceutical strategies for painful conditions: VA will continue to test and develop novel non-pharmaceutical strategies for painful conditions including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), traditional complementary and integrative health approaches (e.g., yoga, tai chi, and activity-based therapies), device-based (e.g., electrical stimulation), and even cell therapies for musculoskeletal conditions. x Development of non-opioid medications to treat pain: VA will continue to focus research on understanding the benefits and risks of non-opioid medications for pain management and alleviation. Examples include targeting: 1) Mutations in sodium and other ion channels which have been shown to cause pain associated with phantom limb pain, corneal neuralgia, 21 of 24 chemotherapy-induced pain, diabetes, small fiber neuropathy, knee osteoarthritis, and burns; 2) Blocking melanocortin-4 receptors to treat inflammatory pain common in certain musculoskeletal and arthritic conditions; 3) Endomorphins, naturally occurring molecules found in the brain with powerful pain-relieving effects; and 4) Repurposing FDA approved drugs for treatment of pain and spasticity for people living with spinal cord injury. x Develop and test technologies providing access to treatment for chronic pain and opioid misuse: VA is testing the use of telehealth, smart-apps, web- and phone-based technology to provide outreach and care to Veterans living in rural areas. These interventions include peer coaching, treatment for OUD and alcohol use disorder, provision of biobehavioral approaches, as well as establishing best practices for delivery of care using these modalities. x Using precision medicine approaches to identify biomarkers for individuals with OUD to help guide the clinical course of action. VA investigators are studying the use of imaging-based brain connectivity data and genetic information (Million Veteran Program) to determine the best clinical course of action to treat OUD (e.g., buprenorphine or a switch to a different medication for OUD).

Methodology Modifications - In accordance with the guidance provided in the Office of National Drug Control Policy's letter of September 7, 2004, VA's methodology for calculating Substance Abuse Treatment Costs only incorporates Specialized Treatment costs and does not take into consideration Other Related Treatment costs. Further, VA's methodology for calculating Substance Abuse Treatment Costs includes all costs of treating substance abuse, regardless of setting as stated in the Office of National Drug Control Policy FY 2012 certification letter of November 24, 2010. Drug control methodology detailed in A.1 was the actual methodology used to generate the Resource Summary (page 24). 4. Material Weaknesses or Other Findings - CliftonLarsonAllen LLP provided an unmodified opinion on VA's FY 2022 consolidated financial statements. They identified three material weaknesses, two significant deficiencies, and certain conditions regarding noncompliance with laws and regulations. The material weaknesses relate to: 1) Controls over Significant Accounting Estimates (Repeat); 2) Financial Systems and Reporting (Repeat); and 3) Information Technology (IT) Security Controls (Repeat\\The two significant deficiencies are: 1) Obligations, Undelivered Orders (UDOs), and Accrued Expenses; and 2) Entity Level Controls including CFO Organizational Structure. The conditions regarding noncompliance with laws and regulations include findings of noncompliance in: a) Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) (repeat comment); b) Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) (repeat comment); c) Noncompliance with 38 USC 5315 - collection of interest on debt owed by Veterans to VBA (repeat comment); d) Anti-deficiency Act (repeat comment); e) Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) for FY 2021, as reported by the Office of Inspector General (repeat comment). 5. Reprogrammings or Transfers - There were no reprogramming of funds or transfers that adjusted drug control-related funding because drug control expenditures are reported based on patients served in various VA clinical settings for specialized substance abuse treatment programs. 6. Other Disclosures - This budget accounts for drug control-related costs for VHA Medical Care and Research. It does not include all drug-related costs for the agency. VA incurs costs related to accounting and security of narcotics and other controlled substances and costs of law enforcement related to illegal 22 of 24 drug activity; however, these costs are assumed to be relatively small and would not have a material effect on the reported costs. B. Assertions 1. Obligations by Budget Decision Unit - VA asserts that the obligations reported by budget decision unit are the actual obligations from VA's accounting system and are consistent with the application of the approved methodology as required by ONDCP Circular, Budget Formulation, dated September 9, 2021. 2. Drug Methodology - VA asserts that the methodology used to calculate FY 2022 drug control obligations by function and budget decision unit is reasonable and accurate based on the criteria set forth in the ONDCP Circular, Budget Formulation, dated September 9, 2021. 3. Application of Methodology - VA asserts the methodology described in Section A.1 above was used to prepare the obligations contained in this report. 4. Material Weaknesses or Other Finding - VA asserts that all material weaknesses or finding by independent sources, or other known weaknesses have been disclosed. 5. Methodology Modifications - VA asserts no modifications were made to methodology for reporting drug control resources. 6.
