The human body does not seem to have enzymes that can break down this protein like it could any other natural protein and have us get rid of it.\u201d However, [Dr. McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) explains that there is a [detoxification protocol](https://www.jpands.org/vol28no3/mccullough.pdf) that allows individuals to proactively address the issue head-on by using three natural substances, nattokinase, bromelain, and curcumin, \u201cto help the body clear this very dangerous protein from [their] cells and tissues.\u201d \u201dAlthough the protocol has not yet been scientifically validated through double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, [Dr. McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) argued that clinical observations indicate a positive impact. No Therapeutic Trials Have Been Planned Dr. McCullough said that he had been messaging the scientific community and the public for several weeks about an approach addressing the burden of Spike protein in tissues and organs in the human body that is largely responsible for \u201cpost-COVID and vaccine injury syndromes.\u201d \u201dWhy?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s because this protein is not natural,\u201d argues [McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post). The effects of the unnatural Spike protein have been devastating. The vaccines have left about 15% of those who\u2019ve taken them with some form of a medical problem,\u201d according to [McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post), who rightly says, \u201cThat is a huge number, [\u2026] \u201cNow, fortunately, about a third of people who took the vaccine; have had no side effects whatsoever, and they appear to be exhibiting no side effects emerging. So, if one took the shot and they\u2019re perfectly fine, didn\u2019t even have a sore arm, they\u2019re extremely unlikely now to develop a problem,\u201d It is people who developed an initial reaction and were sick for a few days or weeks afterward that McCullough says he \u201cworries about\u201d because of the \u201clate development of myocarditis and cardiac arrest even two years after the vaccine\u201d and \u201cBlood clots have been seen to have developed even two years after the vaccine\u201d Is There a Prevention? However, the doctor argues that there is a prevention to the spike protein, \u201cThree words\u201d he says \u201c [Base Spike Detoxification](https://www.jpands.org/vol28no3/mccullough.pdf).\u201d and explains that it is the very first [detoxification protocol](https://www.jpands.org/vol28no3/mccullough.pdf) that was \u201cthe very first\u201d published in the U.S. medical literature, namely, the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons. Nattokinase, Bromelain, and Curcumin - Nattokinase: An enzyme derived from the fermentation of soy. It has been traditionally used in Japan for its supposed cardiovascular benefits. Preclinical trials show it degrades the Spike protein. - Bromelain: A set of enzymes derived from pineapple stems, approved by the FDA as a topical treatment for wounds. Like nattokinase, it has also been shown to accelerate the clearance of Spike proteins. - Curcumin: The active compound in turmeric, widely used for its anti-inflammatory properties. It also mitigates further damage from the Spike protein. The Protocol The recommended doses in the protocol are as follows, per [Dr. McCullough\u2019s Substack](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post): \u2022 Nattokinase: 2000 fibrin units a day without food \u2022 Bromelain: 500 milligrams orally once a day without food \u2022 Curcumin: 500 milligrams orally twice a with piperine additive suggested). [Dr. McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) recommended taking this treatment triad for at least three months for anyone suffering from or worried about post-COVID or vaccine syndromes, but he also suggested that those who have received multiple injections may need to take it for twelve months or longer. Clinical Observations and Limitations [In Dr. McCullough\u2019s](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) clinical observations, \u201cpatients indeed are getting better on this approach.\u201d He said he has observed people experience relief from symptoms such as numbness, tingling, heart racing, headaches, and loss of senses under this protocol. However, these observations have not yet been supported by large-scale scientific trials.\u201c Despite a billion-dollar investment in long COVID research by the Biden administration, not a single dollar of funding has been directed toward researching vaccine injuries. So, it won\u2019t be the government but dissenting doctors, like [Dr. McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post), who will be leading the way in discovering optimal treatments and management for vaccine injuries, says [Vigilant News](https://vigilantnews.com/post/first-ever-spike-detox-protocol-appears-in-medical-journal-heres-how-you-can-get-better) Safety Concerns \u201cThe main safety caveats are bleeding and allergic reactions, both of which are manageable. It is our experience that both nattokinase and bromelain can be used in addition to antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs with physician monitoring,\u201d and \u201dBromelain, curcumin, and nattokinase are available over the counter at just about any health food store or pharmacy.

While we are seeing case examples of improvement, we aim to collaborate with others as we did with the McCullough Protocol, to demonstrate clinical effectiveness of Base Spike Detoxification as a fundamental strategy for a large number of individuals who have suffered long-term consequences from SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination.
