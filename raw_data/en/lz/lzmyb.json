Chinese herbal medicine uses herbs to treat and eliminate symptoms and improve health in the long term. Based on traditional Chinese medicine principles, herbs are individual plants or natural substances that synergize to enhance and treat illness. Herbs such as Astragalus Root, Camellia sinensis, Carthamus tinctorius, Bupleurum, etc., are often used in Chinese medicine. At ACA, doctors will create a custom herb formula for patients to treat corresponding conditions. Why should we take Chinese herbs compared to western medicine? From the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, herbs help balance Yin and Yang (Yin and Yang theory is the underlying basis of Traditional Chinese Medicine) and achieve energy balance, adjusting the opposing forces of energy that run through invisible channels in the body. Unlike western medicine, which focuses more on symptoms, herbs concentrate more on the body system and root of diseases with fewer side benefits and help people maintain health for a longer time. How does Chinese herbal medicine work at ACA? At ACA, we use Chinese herbs to treat the underlying causes of illness more than individual symptoms. We apply a comprehensive approach by using herbs to treat physical, emotional, and spiritual problems. Once a doctor knows a patient's specific needs and diagnoses the patient, the doctor will create a custom formula for the patient. Individualization is our feature. We care for our patients, track the patient's situations, and provide holistic aftercare plans to give our patients the best treatment experience.
