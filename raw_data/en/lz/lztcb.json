Argued March 29, 2016\u2014Decided May 16, 2016 The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act) aims to eliminate \"abusive debt collection practices,\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1692(a)-(d), by, as rele- misleading representation[s] . . . in connection debt,\" \u00a7 1692e. Governing \"debt collectors,\" the Act extent that collecting . . . any debt is in the performance of his offcial duties.\" \u00a7 1692a(6)(C). Under Ohio law, overdue debts owed to state-owned agencies and in- strumentalities are certifed to the State's Attorney General for collec-tion or disposition. Carrying out this responsibility, the Attorney Gen-eral appoints, as independent contractors, private attorneys, naming them \"special counsel\" to act on the Attorney General's behalf. The Attorney General requires special counsel to use the Attorney General's letterhead in communicating with debtors. Among the special counsel appointed by the Attorney General in 2012 were petitioners Mark Sher-iff and Eric Jones. Consistent with the Attorney General's direction, Sheriff's law frm and Jones sent debt collection letters on the Attorney General's letterhead to respondents Hazel Meadows and Pamela Gillie, respectively. The signature block of each letter contained the name and address of the signatory as well as the designation \"special\" or \"outside\" counsel to the State Attorney General. Each letter also identifed the sender as a debt collector seeking payment for debts to a state institu-tion. Meadows and Gillie fled a putative class action in Federal Dis-trict Court, alleging that defendants had, by using the Attorney Gener-al's letterhead, employed deceptive and misleading means to attempt to collect consumer debts, in violation of the FDCPA. The Ohio Attorney General intervened, seeking a declaratory judgment that special coun-sel's use of the Attorney General's letterhead is neither false nor mis-leading, and urging that special counsel be deemed offcers of the State exempted from the Act. The District Court granted summary judg-ment for defendants, holding that special counsel are \"offcers\" of the State and, in any event, their use of the Attorney General's letterhead is not false or misleading. The Sixth Circuit vacated that judgment, concluding that special counsel, as independent contractors, are not enti-tled to the FDCPA's state-offcer exemption. The appeals court re-manded for trial the question whether use of the Attorney General's 318 SHERIFF v. GILLIE Syllabus letterhead would mislead a debtor into believing that it is the Attorney General who is collecting the debt. Held: Assuming, arguendo , that special counsel do not rank as \"state off- cers\" within the meaning of the Act, petitioners' use of the Attorney General's letterhead, nevertheless, does not offend \u00a7 1692e. Special counsel's use of the Attorney General's letterhead at the At- torney General's direction does 1692e's Attorney General\u2014and the signature block names the agent\u2014a private lawyer hired as outside counsel to the Attorney General. The character of the relationship between special counsel and the Attorney General bolsters the Court's determination. Special counsel work closely with attorneys in the Attorney General's Offce, providing legal services on the Attorney General's behalf in fur-therance of the Attorney General's debt collection responsibilities for the State. A debtor's impression that a letter from special counsel is a letter from the Attorney General's Offce is thus scarcely inaccurate. Special counsel's use of the Attorney General's letterhead is also with \u00a7 1692e(9)'s against \"falsely represent-[ing]\" that a communication is \"authorized, issued, or approved\" by a State. Because the Attorney General authorized\u2014indeed required\u2014 special counsel to use his letterhead, special counsel create no false im-pression in doing just that. Nor did special counsel use an untrue name in their letters, in violation of \u00a7 1692e(14). Special counsel do not em-ploy a false name when they use the Attorney General's letterhead at his instruction, for special counsel act as the Attorney General's agents in debt-related matters. The Court sees no reason, furthermore, to construe the FDCPA in a manner that would interfere with the Attor-ney General's chosen method of fulflling his statutory obligation to col-lect the State's debts. The Sixth Circuit raises the specter of consumer confusion and the risk of intimidation from special counsel's use of the Attorney General's letterhead, but its exposition is unconvincing.

Ohio law authorizes the State's Attorney General to re- tain, as independent contractors, \"special counsel\" to act on the Attorney General's behalf in collecting certain debts owed to Ohio or an instrumentality of the State. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 109.08 (Lexis 2014). As required by the Attor-ney General, special counsel use the Attorney General's let-terhead in communicating with debtors. App. 93.

See, e. g., \u00a7 1692d (prohibiting harassing, oppres- sive, or representation[s] . connection with the collection of any debt\"); \u00a7 1692g(a) (setting out requirements for the contents of initial notices to consumers). The FDCPA excludes from the defnition of \"debt collector\" \"any offcer or employee of the United States or any State to the extent that collecting . . . any debt is in the performance of his offcial duties.\" \u00a7 1692a(6)(C). This case involves litigation between debtors to Ohio insti- tutions and special counsel who sought to collect money owed to the institutions. The petition raises two questions: (1) Do special counsel appointed by Ohio's Attorney General qualify as \"state offcers\" exempt from the FDCPA's governance? (2) Is special counsel's use of the Attorney General's letter- head a false or misleading representation proscribed by \u00a7 1692e? Assuming, arguendo , that special counsel do not rank as \"state offcers,\" we hold, nevertheless, that their use of the Attorney General's letterhead does not offend \u00a7 1692e. Not fairly described as \"false\" or \"misleading,\" use of the letter-head accurately conveys that special counsel, in seeking to collect debts owed to the State, do so on behalf of, and as instructed by, the Attorney General. I Responding to reports of abusive practices by third-party collectors of consumer debts, Congress enacted the FDCPA \"to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collec-tors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.\" \u00a7 1692(e). Primarily governing \"debt collector[s],\" the to include \"any person . . . in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, Cite as: 578 U. S. 317 (2016) 321 Opinion of the Court or who regularly collects or attempts to collect . . . debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\" \u00a7 1692a(6). Excluded from the defnition is \"any offcer or employee of the United States or any State to the extent that collecting or attempting to collect any debt is in the performance of his offcial duties.\" \u00a7 1692a(6)(C). Among other ban, \u00a7 1692e enumerates 16 categories of conduct that qualify as false or misleading. Two of those categories are pertinent to our review: \"[t]he use or distribution of any written com-munication which simulates or is falsely represented to be a document authorized, issued, or approved by any court, off-cial, or agency of . . . any State, or which creates a false impression as to its source, authorization, or approval,\" \u00a7 1692e(9); and \"[t]he use of any business, company, or organi-zation name other than the true name of the debt collector's business, company, or organization,\" \u00a7 1692e(14). A debt collector who violates the Act is liable for both actual and statutory damages. \u00a7 1692k(a). This case concerns the debt collection practices of those charged with collecting overdue debts owed to Ohio-owned agencies and instrumentalities. Among such debts are past-due tuition owed to public universities and unpaid medical bills from state-run hospitals. Under Ohio law, overdue debts are certifed to the State's Attorney General, who is responsible for collecting, settling, or otherwise disposing of them. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 131.02(A), (C), (F). Carrying out this responsibility, the Attorney General may appoint private attorneys as \"special counsel to represent the state\" in collecting certifed claims. \u00a7 109.08. Special counsel enter into year-long retention agreements \"on an independent contractor basis\" to \"provide legal serv-ices on behalf of the Attorney General to one or more State Clients.\" App. 143-144. The Attorney General's Offce as-322 SHERIFF v. GILLIE Opinion of the Court signs individual claims to special counsel, who are paid a set percentage of the funds they collect for the State. \u00a7 109.08; id., at 144-145, 149-152. With \"the prior approval of the Attorney General,\" special counsel may litigate and settle claims on behalf of the State. Id., at 149. Special counsel may continue to represent private clients so long as doing so does not create a confict of interest with their work for the Attorney General. Among the special counsel appointed by the Attorney General in 2012 were Mark Sheriff, a partner at the law frm of Wiles, Boyle, Burkholder, and Bringardner Co. LPA (Wiles frm), and Eric Jones, of the Law Offces of Eric A. Jones, LLC. When special counsel contact debtors on behalf of the State, the Attorney General requires them to use his letter- head. Id., at 93. Consistent with this requirement, Sarah Sheriff, an employee of the Wiles frm, sent respondent Hazel Meadows a debt collection letter on the Ohio Attorney Gen-eral's letterhead. The letter reads: \"Sir/Madam: Per your request, this is a letter with the current balance owed for your University of Akron loan that has been placed with the Ohio Attorney General. Feel free to contact me at [telephone number] should you have any further questions.\" Gillie v. Law Offce of Eric A. Jones, LLC , 785 F. 3d 1091, 1119 (CA6 2015) (appendix to dissenting opinion of Sutton, J.). The amount Meadows owed is listed in the letter's subject line. Ibid. After the body of the letter, Sheriff's signature appears, followed by the frm's name, its address, and the designation \"Special Counsel to the Attorney General for the State of Ohio.\" Ibid. 1 The letter concludes with a notice that it is \"an attempt to collect a debt\" and that the senders \"are debt collectors.\" Ibid. 1 As noted above, Mark Sheriff, not Sarah Sheriff, was appointed spe- cial counsel. Cite as: 578 U. S. 317 (2016) 323 Opinion of the Court Respondent Pamela Gillie received a letter, also on the Ohio Attorney General's letterhead, in relation to a debt she owed to a state-run hospital: \"Dear Sir/Madam, You have chosen to to resolv[e] the referenced . . . medical claim. If you cannot make immediate full payment call DE-NISE HALL at Eric A. Jones, L.L.C., [phone number] at my offce to make arrangements to pay this debt.\" Id., at 1118. That text is followed by a bolded, all-caps notice that the letter is \"a communication from a debt collector.\" Ibid. Signed by Eric A. Jones, \"Outside Counsel for the Attorney General's Offce,\" the letter includes Jones's telephone and fax numbers. Ibid. A tear-away portion at the bottom of the page for return of payment is addressed to Jones's law offce. Ibid. After receiving these letters, Meadows and Gillie fled a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, asserting that Mark Sheriff, Sarah Sheriff, Jones, and their law frms had violated the FDCPA. By sending debt collection notices on the Attor-ney General's letterhead rather than the letterhead of their private frms, Meadows and Gillie alleged, defendants had employed deceptive and misleading means to attempt to col-lect consumer debts. The Ohio Attorney General inter-vened as a defendant and counterclaimant, seeking a declara-tory judgment that special counsel's use of his letterhead, as authorized by Ohio law, 2 is neither false nor misleading. Further, the Attorney General urged, special counsel should 2 Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 109.08 (Lexis 2014) requires the Attorney Gen- eral to provide special counsel with his \"offcial letterhead stationery\" for the collection of tax debts. The Attorney General has interpreted this provision as mandating the use of his letterhead for tax claims, but permit-ting its use for the collection of other debts. Whether this is a correct interpretation of Ohio law is not before us. 324 SHERIFF v. GILLIE Opinion of the Court be deemed offcers of the State and therefore outside the FDCPA's compass. The District Court granted summary judgment for defend- ants, concluding that special counsel are \"offcers\" of the State of Ohio and, in any event, their use of the Attorney General's letterhead is not false or misleading. Gillie v. Law Offce of Eric A. Jones, LLC , 37 F. Supp. 3d 928 (2014). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated the District Court's judgment. Because special counsel are in-dependent contractors, the court determined, they are not entitled to the FDCPA's state-offcer exemption. 785 F. 3d, at 1097-1098. Turning to the deceptive and misleading practices charge, the Court of Appeals concluded that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an unsophis-ticated consumer would be misled \"into believing it is the Attorney General who is collecting on the account.\" Id., at 1106. The court therefore remanded the case for trial on this issue. Id., at 1110. Judge Sutton dissented from both holdings. In his view, \"deputizing . . . private lawyers to act as assistant attorneys general makes them `offcers' of the State for . . . collection purposes.\" Ibid. He further concluded sel's use of the Attorney General's letterhead \"accurately describes the relevant legal realities\u2014that the law frm acts as an agent of the Attorney General and stands in [his] shoes . . . in collecting money owed to the State.\" Id., at 1110-1111. The Sixth Circuit denied en banc rehearing. We granted certiorari, 577 U. S. 1045 (2015), and now reverse. 3 II As they did below, petitioners maintain that, as special counsel appointed by the Attorney General, they are \"off- 3 We granted the petition for certiorari fled by Mark Sheriff, Sarah Sheriff, the Wiles frm, and the Ohio Attorney General.

We pretermit the question whether, as petitioners contend and Judge Sutton would have held, special counsel qualify as state offcers. For purposes of this decision, we assume, arguendo , that special counsel are not \"offcers\" within the meaning of the Act and, therefore, rank simply as \"debt collectors\" within the FDCPA's compass. We conclude, nevertheless, that petitioners complied with the Act, as their use of the Attorney General's letterhead accurately conveys that special counsel act on behalf of the Attorney General. Special counsel's use of the Attorney General's letterhead at the Attorney General's direction does not 1692e's general prohibition Attorney General\u2014and the signature block names the agent\u2014a private lawyer hired as outside counsel to the At-torney General. It would not transgress \u00a7 1692e, respond-ents acknowledge, if, in lieu of using the Attorney General's letterhead, special counsel's communications opened with a boldface statement: \"We write to you as special counsel to the [A]ttorney [G]eneral who has authorized us to collect a debt you owe to [the State or an instrumentality thereof].\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 31 (internal quotation marks omitted). If that representation is accurate, i. e., not \"false . . . or mislead- ing,\" it would make scant sense to rank as unlawful use of a letterhead conveying the very same message, particularly in view of the inclusion of special counsel's separate contact in-formation and the conspicuous notation that the letter is sent by a debt collector. 4 4Although respondents argued below that Sarah Sheriff's inaccurate use of the \"special counsel\" designation also violates the FDCPA, they have not pursued that argument before this Court. In any case, the letter merely conveyed the debtor's remaining balance, without any suggestion of followup action. Sarah Sheriff's misstatement of her title thus qualifes as an immaterial, harmless mistake. 326 SHERIFF v. GILLIE Opinion of the Court Our conclusion is bolstered by the character of the rela- tionship between special counsel and the Attorney General. As earlier recounted, special counsel \"provide legal services on behalf of the Attorney General to one or more State Cli-ents\" in furtherance of the Attorney General's responsibil-ities as debt collector for state-owned entities and instru-mentalities. App. 143-144. In performing this function, special counsel work closely with attorneys in the Attorney General's Offce. For example, Assistant Attorneys General \"frequently assist Special Counsel in drafting pleadings, and sometimes join cases as co-counsel to assist Special Counsel with particularly sensitive or complex cases.\" Id., at 102. Special counsel and Assistant Attorneys General even stand in one another's stead, as needed, to cover proceedings in ongoing litigation. Ibid. Given special counsel's alliance with attorneys within the Attorney General's Offce, a debt-or's impression that a letter from special counsel is a letter from the Attorney General's Offce is scarcely inaccurate. 5 On safe ground with respect to \u00a7 1692e's general proscrip- tion against false and misleading representations, special counsel's use of the Attorney General's letterhead is \u00a7 1692e(9)'s represent[ing]\" that a communication is \"authorized, issued, or approved\" by a State. In enacting this provision, Congress sought to prevent debt collectors from \"misrepresenting\" that they are \"government offcial[s].\" S. Rep. No. 95-382, p. 8 (1977). Here, the Attorney General authorized\u2014indeed required\u2014special counsel to use his letterhead in sending debt collection communications. Special counsel create no false impression in doing just what they have been in-structed to do. Instead, their use of the Attorney General's letterhead conveys on whose authority special counsel writes to the debtor. As a whole, the communication alerts the debtor to both the basis for the payment obligation and the 5We address here only \"special counsel.\" The considerations relevant to that category may not carry over to other debt-collector relationships. Cite as: 578 U. S. 317 (2016) 327 Opinion of the Court offcial responsible for enforcement of debts owed to the State, while the signature block conveys who the Attorney General has engaged to collect the debt. Nor did special counsel, in sending letters on the Attorney General's letterhead, use a name other than their \"true name,\" in violation of \u00a7 1692e(14). Although the FDCPA does not say \"what a `true name' is, its import is straightfor-ward: A debt collector may not lie about his institutional affliation.\" 785 F. 3d, at 1115 (Sutton, J., dissenting). Spe-cial counsel do not employ a false name when using the At-torney General's letterhead at his instruction, for special counsel, as the Attorney General's agents, act for him in debt-related matters. Far from misrepresenting special counsel's identity, letters sent by special counsel accurately identify the offce primarily responsible for collection of the debt (the Attorney General), special counsel's affliation with that offce, and the address (special counsel's law frm) to which payment should be sent. 6 We further note a federalism concern. \"Ohio's enforce- ment of its civil code\u2014by collecting money owed to it\u2014[is] a core sovereign function.\" Gillie v. Law Offce of Eric A. Jones, LLC , No. 14-3836 (CA6, July 14, 2015), App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Ohio's Attorney General has chosen to appoint special counsel to assist him in fulflling his obligation to col-lect the State's debts, and he has instructed his appointees to use his letterhead when acting on his behalf. There is no cause, in this case, to construe federal law in a manner that interferes with \"States' arrangements for conducting their 6 Because we conclude that the letters sent by petitioners were truthful, we need not consider the parties' arguments as to whether a false or mis- leading statement must be material to violate the FDCPA, or whether a potentially false or misleading statement should be viewed from the perspective of \"the least sophisticated consumer,\" Brief for Respondent Gillie et al. 57, or \"[t]he average consumer who has defaulted on a debt,\" Brief for Petitioners 41. 328 SHERIFF v. GILLIE Opinion of the Court own governments.\" Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League , 541 U. S. 125, 140 (2004) (citing Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991)). The Sixth Circuit's contrary exposition is unconvincing. Use of the Attorney General's letterhead, the Court of Ap- peals emphasized, has led to confusion among debtors, as the Attorney General has received phone calls inquiring whether letters sent by special counsel are authentic. 785 F. 3d, at 1107. But the Sixth Circuit overlooked that the Attorney General's prompt and invariable answer to those inquiries was \"yes.\" To the extent that consumers may be concerned that the letters are a \"scam,\" the solution is for special coun-sel to say more, not less, about their role as agents of the Attorney General. Special counsel's use of the Attorney General's letterhead, furthermore, encourages consumers to use offcial channels to ensure the legitimacy of the letters, assuaging the very concern the Sixth Circuit identifed. In addition to the specter of consumer confusion, the Sixth Circuit stressed the risk of intimidation\u2014that the Attorney General's letterhead would \"place pressure on those individ-uals receiving the letters\" to pay their state debts. Id., at 1105. There are two bases for this concern, neither of which is persuasive. First, invocation of the Attorney General's imprimatur could lead debtors to prioritize their debt to the State over other, private debts out of a belief that the conse-quences of failing to pay a state debt would be more severe. This impression is not false; the State does have enforcement powers beyond those afforded private creditors. A debtor's tax refund, for example, \"may be applied in satisfaction\" of her debt, regardless of whether the State has obtained a judgment, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 5747.12 (Lexis 2013), and a debt owed to the State takes priority over most private debts in state probate proceedings, \u00a7 2117.25(A) (Lexis Supp. 2015). \"The special consequences of state debts explain why the Act bars debt collectors unaffliated with a State from using the State's name to scare debtors into paying. When Cite as: 578 U. S. 317 (2016) 329 Opinion of the Court the State itself is doing the demanding, however, nothing about the resulting fear misleads.\" 785 F. 3d, at 1116 (Sut-ton, J., dissenting). In other words, \u00a7 1692e bars debt collec-tors from deceiving or misleading consumers; it does not pro-tect consumers from fearing the actual consequences of their debts. Second, debtors might worry that the letters imply that the Attorney General, as the State's top law enforcement offcial, intends to take punitive action against them. \"But neither of the milquetoast letters [received by respondents] threatens criminal prosecution, civil penalties, or any action whatsoever.\" Id., at 1116-1117. Use of the Attorney Gen- eral's letterhead merely clarifes that the debt is owed to the State, and the Attorney General is the State's debt collector. The FDCPA is not sensibly read to require special counsel to obscure that reality. 7 * * * For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Ap- peals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is re-manded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. 7 Having determined that use of the Attorney General's letterhead inac- curately suggested that the letters were from the Attorney General's Of- fce, the Sixth Circuit remanded to the District Court for trial on whether this practice was \"materially false, deceptive and misleading.\" Gillie v. Law Offce of Eric A. Jones, LLC , 785 F. 3d 1091, 1109-1110 (2015). But all of the relevant facts are undisputed, and the application of the FDCPA to those facts is a question of law. The District Court therefore properly granted summary judgment for defendants. 330 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 Syllabus SPOKEO, INC. v. ROBINS certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 13-1339. Argued November 2, 2015\u2014Decided May 16, 2016 The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA) requires consumer report- ing agencies to \"follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possi- ble accuracy of\" consumer reports, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681e(b), and imposes liability on \"[a]ny person who willfully fails to comply with any require-ment [of the Act] with respect to any\" individual, \u00a7 Spokeo, an agency, oper- ates a \"people search engine,\" which searches a wide spectrum of data-bases to gather and provide personal information about individuals to a variety of users, including employers wanting to evaluate prospective employees. After respondent Thomas Robins discovered that his Spokeo-generated profle contained inaccurate information, he fled a federal class-action complaint against Spokeo, alleging that the company willfully failed to comply with the FCRA's requirements. The District Court dismissed Robins' complaint, holding that he had not properly pleaded injury in fact as required by Article III. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Based on Robins' allegation that \"Spokeo vio-lated his statutory rights\" and the fact that Robins' \"personal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized,\" the court held that Robins had adequately alleged an injury in fact. Held: Because the Ninth Circuit failed to consider both aspects of the injury-in-fact requirement, its Article III standing analysis was incom-plete. Pp. 337-343. (a) A plaintiff invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of estab- lishing the \"irreducible constitutional minimum\" of standing by demon-strating (1) an injury in fact, (2) fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555, 560- 561. Pp. 337-338. (b) As relevant here, the injury-in-fact requirement requires a plain- tiff to show that he or she suffered \"an invasion of a legally protected interest\" that is \"concrete and particularized\" and \"actual or analysis elided the independ- ent \"concreteness\" requirement. Both observations it made concerned only \"particularization,\" i. e., the requirement that an injury \"affect the Cite as: 578 U. S. 330 (2016) 331 Syllabus plaintiff in a personal and individual way,\" Lujan, supra, at 560, n. 1, but an injury in fact must be both concrete and particularized, see, e. g., Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U. S. 149, 158. Concreteness is quite different from particularization and requires an injury to be \"de facto ,\" that is, to actually exist. Pp. 339-340. (2) The Ninth Circuit also failed to address whether the alleged procedural violations entail a degree of risk suffcient to meet the con-creteness requirement. A \"concrete\" injury need not be a \"tangible\" injury. See, e. g., Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460. To determine whether an intangible harm constitutes injury in fact, both history and the judgment of Congress are instructive. Congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum Article III requirements, but a plaintiff does not automatically satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a right and purports to authorize a suit to vindicate it. Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation. This does not mean, however, that the risk of real harm cannot satisfy that requirement. See, e. g., Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U. S. 398. The violation of a procedural right granted by statute can be suffcient in some circum-stances to constitute injury in fact; in such a case, a plaintiff need not allege any additional harm beyond the one identifed by Congress, see Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins, 524 U. S. 11, 20-25. This Court takes no position on the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's ultimate con-clusion, but these general principles demonstrate two things: that Con-gress plainly sought to curb the dissemination of false information by adopting procedures designed to decrease that risk and that Robins can-not satisfy the demands of Article III by alleging a bare procedural violation.

S. 330 (2016) 333 Opinion of the Court Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court. This case presents the question whether respondent Rob- ins has standing to maintain an action in federal court against petitioner Spokeo under the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA or Act), 84 Stat. 1127, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681 et seq. Spokeo operates a \"people search engine.\" If an individ- ual visits Spokeo's Web site and inputs a person's name, a phone number, or an e-mail address, Spokeo conducts a com-puterized search in a wide variety of databases and provides information about the subject of the search. Spokeo per-formed such a search for information about Robins, and some of the information it gathered and then disseminated was incorrect. When Robins learned of these inaccuracies, he fled a complaint on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals. The District Court dismissed Robins' complaint for lack of standing, but a panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed. The Ninth Circuit noted, frst, that Robins had alleged that \"Spokeo violated his statutory rights, not just the statutory of Oregon, and Robert W.

ROBINS Opinion of the Court rights of other people,\" and, second, that \"Robins's personal interests in the handling of his credit information are indi-vidualized rather than collective.\" 742 F. 3d 409, 413 (2014). Based on these two observations, the Ninth Circuit held that Robins had adequately alleged injury in fact, a requirement for standing under Article III of the Constitution. Id., at 413-414. This analysis was incomplete. As we have explained in our prior opinions, the injury-in-fact requirement requires a plaintiff to allege an injury that is both \"concrete and partic- ularized.\" Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environ- mental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 180-181 (2000) (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit's analysis focused on the second characteristic (particularity), but it overlooked the frst (concreteness). We therefore vacate the decision below and remand for the Ninth Circuit to consider both as- pects of the injury-in-fact requirement. I The FCRA seeks to ensure \"fair and accurate credit re- porting.\" \u00a7 1681(a)(1). To achieve this end, the Act regu-lates the creation and the use of \"consumer report[s]\" 1 by \"consumer reporting agenc[ies]\" 2 for certain defnes the term \"consumer report\" as: \"any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a con- sumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal charac-teristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility for\u2014 \"(A) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; \"(B) employment purposes; or \"(C) any other purpose authorized under section 1681b of this title.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681a(d)(1). 2 \"The term `consumer reporting agency' means any person which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonproft basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of Cite as: 578 U. S. 330 (2016) 335 Opinion of the Court poses, including credit transactions, insurance, licensing, consumer-initiated business transactions, and employment. See \u00a7\u00a7 1681a(d)(1)(A)-(C), 1681b. Enacted long before the advent of the Internet, the FCRA applies to companies that regularly disseminate information bearing on an individual's \"credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, charac-ter, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.\" \u00a7 1681a(d)(1). The FCRA imposes a host of requirements concerning the creation and use of consumer reports. As relevant here, the Act requires consumer reporting agencies to \"follow reason-able procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of\" consumer reports, \u00a7 1681e(b); to notify providers and users of consumer information of their responsibilities under the Act, \u00a7 1681e(d); to limit the circumstances in which such agencies provide consumer reports \"for employment pur-poses,\" \u00a7 1681b(b)(1); and to post toll-free numbers for con-sumers to request reports, \u00a7 1681j(a). The Act also provides that \"[a]ny person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement [of the Act] with respect to any [individual 3] is liable to that [individual]\" for, among other things, either \"actual damages\" or statutory damages of $100 to $1,000 per violation, costs of the action and attor-ney's fees, and possibly punitive damages. \u00a7 1681n(a). Spokeo is alleged to qualify as a \"consumer reporting agency\" under the FCRA. 4 It operates a Web site that allows users to search for information about other individu-als by name, e-mail address, or phone number. In response to an inquiry submitted online, Spokeo searches a wide spec- trum of databases and gathers and provides information such furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports.\" \u00a7 1681a(f). 3 This statutory provision uses the term \"consumer,\" but that term is defned to mean \"an individual.\" \u00a7 1681a(c). 4 For purposes of this opinion, we assume that Spokeo is a consumer reporting agency. 336 SPOKEO , INC. v. ROBINS Opinion of the Court as the individual's address, phone number, marital status, approximate age, occupation, hobbies, fnances, shopping habits, and musical preferences. App. 7, 10-11. According to Robins, Spokeo markets its services to a variety of users, including not only \"employers who want to evaluate prospec-tive employees\" but also \"those who want to investigate prospective romantic partners or seek other personal in-formation.\" Brief for Respondent 7. Persons wishing to perform a Spokeo search need not disclose their identities, and much information is available for free. At some point in time, someone (Robins' complaint does not specify who) made a Spokeo search request for informa-tion about Robins, and Spokeo trawled its sources and gener-ated a profle. By some means not detailed in Robins' com-plaint, he became aware of the contents of that profle and discovered that it contained inaccurate information. His profle, he asserts, states that he is married, has children, is in his ffties, has a job, is relatively affuent, and holds a grad-uate degree. App. 14. According to Robins' complaint, all of this information is incorrect. Robins fled a class-action complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, claim-ing, among other things, that Spokeo willfully failed to com-ply with the FCRA requirements enumerated above. The District Court initially denied Spokeo's motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, but later recon-sidered and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a. The court found that Robins had not \"properly pled\" an injury in fact, as required by Article III. Ibid. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Re- lying on Circuit precedent, 5 the court began by stating that 5 See Edwards v. First American Corp ., 610 F. 3d 514 (CA9 2010), cert. granted sub nom. First American Financial Corp. v. Edwards, 564 U. S. 1018 (2011), cert. dism'd as improvidently granted, 567 U. S. 756 (2012) (per curiam ). Cite as: 578 U. S. 330 (2016) 337 Opinion of the Court \"the violation of a statutory right is usually a suffcient in- jury in fact to confer standing.\" 742 F. 3d, at 412. The court recognized that \"the Constitution limits the power of Congress to confer standing.\" Id., at 413. But the court held that those limits were honored in this case because Rob-ins alleged that \"Spokeo violated his statutory rights, not just the statutory rights of other people,\" and because his \"personal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized rather than collective.\" Ibid. (emphasis in original). The court thus concluded that Robins' \"alleged violations of [his] statutory rights [were] suffcient to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.\" Id., at 413-414. We granted certiorari. 575 U. S. 982 (2015). II A The Constitution confers limited authority on each branch of the Federal Government. It vests Congress with enu-merated \"legislative Powers,\" Art. I, \u00a7 1; it confers upon \"[t]he executive Power,\" Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 1; and it endows the federal courts with \"[t]he judicial Power of the United States,\" Art. III, \u00a7 1. In order to remain faithful to this tripartite structure, the power of the Federal Judiciary may not be permitted to intrude upon the powers given to the other branches. See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno , 547 U. Lujan of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555, 559-560 (1992). Although the Constitution does not fully explain what is meant by \"[t]he judicial Power of the United States,\" Art. III, \u00a7 1, it does specify that this power extends only to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies,\" Art. III, \u00a7 2. And \" `[n]o prin-ciple is more fundamental to the judiciary's proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controver-sies.' \" Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 818 (1997). 338 SPOKEO , INC. v. ROBINS Opinion of the Court Standing to sue is a doctrine rooted in the traditional un- derstanding of a case or controversy. The doctrine devel- oped in our case law to ensure that federal courts do not exceed their authority as it has been traditionally under-stood. See id., at 820. The doctrine limits the category of litigants empowered to maintain a lawsuit in federal court to seek redress for a legal wrong. See Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 473 (1982); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498-499 (1975). In this way, \"[t]he law of Article III standing . . . serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches,\" Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, Lujan, supra, at 576-577, and confnes the federal courts to a properly judicial role, see Warth, supra, at 498. Our cases have established that the \"irreducible constitu- tional minimum\" of standing consists of three elements. Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560. The plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be re-dressed by a favorable judicial decision. Id., at 560-561; Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U. S., at 180-181. The plain-tiff, as the party invoking federal jurisdiction, bears the bur-den of establishing these elements. FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dal- las, 493 U. S. 215, 231 (1990). Where, as here, a case is at the pleading stage, the plaintiff must \"clearly . . . allege facts demonstrating\" each element. Warth, supra, at 518. 6 B This case primarily concerns injury in fact, the \"[f]irst and foremost\" of standing's three elements. Steel Co. v. Citizens 6 \"That a suit may be a class action . . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class `must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentifed members of the class to which they be-long.' \" Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 40, n. 20 (1976) (quoting Warth, 422 U. S., at 502). Cite as: 578 U. S. 330 (2016) 339 Opinion of the Court for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 103 (1998). Injury in fact is a constitutional requirement, and \"[i]t is settled that Congress cannot erase Article III's standing requirements by statutorily granting the right to sue to a plaintiff who would not otherwise have standing.\" Raines, supra, at 820, n. 3; see Summers v. Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. 488, 497 (2009); Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U. 91, 100 (1979) (\"In no event . . . may Congress abrogate the Art. III minima\"). To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered \"an invasion of a legally protected interest\" that is \"concrete and particularized\" and \"actual or immi-nent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560 (internal quotation marks omitted). We discuss the par-ticularization and concreteness requirements below. 1 For an injury to be \"particularized,\" it \"must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.\" Ibid., n. 1; see also, e. g., Cuno injury' \"); Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155 (1990) (\" `distinct' \"); Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984) (\"personal\"); Valley Forge , supra, at 472 (standing requires that the plaintiff \" `personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury' \"); United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 177 (1974) (not \"undifferentiated\"); Public Citizen, Inc. v. National Hwy. Traffc Safety Admin., 489 F. 3d 1279, 1292-1293 (CADC 2007) (collecting cases). 7 Particularization is necessary to establish injury in fact, but it is not suffcient. An injury in fact must also be \"con-crete.\" Under the Ninth Circuit's analysis, however, that independent requirement was elided. As previously noted, 7 The fact that an injury may be suffered by a large number of people does not of itself make that injury a nonjusticiable generalized grievance. The victims' injuries from a mass tort, for example, are widely shared, to be sure, but each individual suffers a particularized harm. 340 SPOKEO , INC. v. ROBINS Opinion of the Court the Ninth Circuit concluded that Robins' complaint alleges \" `concrete, de facto' \" injuries for essentially two reasons. 742 F. 3d, at 413. First, the court noted that Robins \"alleges that Spokeo violated his statutory rights, not just the statu- tory rights of other people.\" Ibid. Second, the court wrote that \"Robins's personal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized rather than collective .\" Ibid. (emphasis added). Both of these observations concern particularization, not concreteness. We have made it clear time and time again that an injury in fact must be both con-crete and particularized. See, e. g., Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U. S. 149, 158 (2014); Summers, supra, at 493; Sprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., 554 U. S. 269, 274 (2008); Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 517 (2007). A \"concrete\" injury must be \"de facto\"; that is, it must actually exist. See Black's Law Dictionary 506 (10th ed. 2014). When we have used the adjective \"concrete,\" we have meant to convey the usual meaning of the term\u2014\"real,\" and not \"abstract.\" 1 Webster's Third New International Dictionary 472 (1971); Random House Dictionary of the Eng-lish Language 305 (1966). Concreteness, therefore, is quite different from particularization. 2 \"Concrete\" is not, however, necessarily synonymous with \"tangible.\" Although tangible injuries are perhaps easier to recognize, we have confrmed in many of our previous cases that intangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete. See, e. g., Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460 (2009) (free speech); Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520 (1993) (free exercise). In determining whether an intangible harm constitutes in- jury in fact, both history and the judgment of Congress play important roles. Because the doctrine of standing derives from the case-or-controversy requirement, and because that Cite as: 578 U. S. 330 (2016) 341 Opinion of the Court requirement in turn is grounded in historical practice, it is instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts. See Vermont Agency of Natural Re- sources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 775- 777 (2000). In addition, because Congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum Article III requirements, its judgment is also instructive and important. Thus, we said in Lujan that Congress may \"elevat[e] to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, de facto inju- ries that were previously inadequate in law.\" 504 U. S., at 578. Similarly, Justice Kennedy's concurrence in that case explained that \"Congress has the power to defne inju-ries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.\" Id., at 580 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Congress' role in identifying and elevating intangible harms does not mean that a plaintiff automatically satisfes the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that per-son to sue to vindicate that right. Article III standing re-quires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation. For that reason, Robins could not, for example, allege a bare procedural violation, divorced from any con-crete harm, and satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Ar-ticle III. See Summers, supra, at 496 (\"[D]eprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is af-fected by the deprivation . . . is insuffcient to create Article III standing\"); see also Lujan, supra, at 572. This does not mean, however, that the risk of real harm cannot satisfy the requirement of concreteness. See, e. g., Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U. S. 398. For example, the law has long permitted recovery by certain tort victims even if their harms may be diffcult to prove or measure. See, e. g., Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 569 (libel), 570 342 SPOKEO , INC. v. ROBINS Opinion of the Court (slander per se) (1938). Just as the common law permitted suit in such instances, the violation of a procedural right granted by statute can be suffcient in some circumstances to constitute injury in fact. In other words, a plaintiff in such a case need not allege any additional harm beyond the one Congress has identifed. See Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins, 524 U. S. 11, 20-25 (1998) (confrming that a group of voters' \"inability to obtain information\" that Congress had decided to make public is a suffcient injury in fact to satisfy Article III); Public Citizen v. Department of Justice , 491 U. S. 440, 449 (1989) (holding that two advocacy organiza- tions' failure to obtain information subject to disclosure under the Federal Advisory Committee Act \"constitutes a suffciently distinct injury to provide standing to sue\"). In the context of this particular case, these general princi- ples tell us two things: On the one hand, Congress plainly sought to curb the dissemination of false information by adopting procedures designed to decrease that risk. On the other hand, Robins cannot satisfy the demands of Article III by alleging a bare procedural violation. A violation of one of the FCRA's procedural requirements may result in no harm. For example, even if a consumer reporting agency fails to provide the required notice to a user of the agency's consumer information, that information regardless may be entirely accurate. In addition, not all inaccuracies cause harm or present any material risk of harm. An example that comes readily to mind is an incorrect zip code. It is diffcult to imagine how the dissemination of an incorrect zip code, without more, could work any concrete harm. 8 Because the Ninth Circuit failed to fully appreciate the distinction between concreteness and particularization, its standing analysis was incomplete. It did not address the question framed by our discussion, namely, whether the par- 8 We express no view about any other types of false information that may merit similar treatment. We leave that issue for the Ninth Circuit to consider on remand. Cite as: 578 U. S. 330 (2016) 343 Thomas, J., concurring ticular procedural violations alleged in this case entail a de- gree of risk suffcient to meet the concreteness requirement. We take no position as to whether the Ninth Circuit's ulti-mate conclusion\u2014that Robins adequately alleged an injury in fact\u2014was correct. * * * The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Thomas, concurring. The Court vacates and remands to have the Court of Ap- peals determine \"whether the particular procedural viola- tions alleged in this case entail a degree of risk suffcient to meet the concreteness requirement.\" Ante, at 342 and this page. In defning what constitutes a concrete injury, the Court explains that \"concrete\" means \" `real,' \" and \"not `ab-stract,' \" but is not \"necessarily synonymous with `tangi-ble.' \" Ante , at 340. I join the Court's opinion. I write separately to explain how, in my view, the injury-in-fact requirement applies to different types of rights. The judicial power of common-law courts was historically limited depending on the nature of the plaintiff's suit. Common-law courts more readily enter-tained suits from private plaintiffs who alleged a violation of their own rights, in contrast to private plaintiffs who as-serted claims vindicating public rights. Those limitations persist in modern standing doctrine. I A Standing doctrine limits the \"judicial power\" to \" `cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.' \" Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 344 SPOKEO , INC. v. ROBINS Thomas, J., concurring 765, 774 (2000) (quoting Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Envi- ronment, 523 U. S. 83, 102 (1998)). To understand the limits that standing imposes on \"the judicial Power,\" therefore, we must \"refer directly to the traditional, fundamental limita-tions upon the powers of common-law courts.\" Honig v. Doe, 484 U. S. 305, 340 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting). These limitations preserve separation of powers by preventing the Judiciary's entanglement in disputes that are primarily polit-ical in nature. This concern is generally absent when a pri-vate plaintiff seeks to enforce only his personal rights against another private party. Common-law courts imposed different limitations on a plaintiff's right to bring suit depending on the type of right the plaintiff sought to vindicate. Historically, common-law courts possessed broad power to adjudicate suits involving the alleged violation of private rights, even when plaintiffs alleged only the violation of those rights and nothing more. \"Private rights\" are rights \"belonging to individuals, consid-ered as individuals.\" 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *2 (hereinafter Blackstone). \"Private rights\" have tradition-ally included rights of personal security (including security of reputation), property rights, and contract rights. See 1 id., at *130-*139; Woolhander & Nelson, Does History Defeat Standing Doctrine? 102 Mich. L. Rev. 689, 693 (2004). In a suit for the violation of a private right, courts historically presumed that the plaintiff suffered a de facto injury merely from having his personal, legal rights invaded. Thus, when one man placed his foot on another's property, the property owner needed to show nothing more to establish a traditional case or controversy. See Entick v. Carrington, 2 Wils. K. B. 275, 291, 95 Eng. Rep. 807, 817 (1765). Many traditional remedies for private-rights causes of action\u2014such as for trespass, infringement of intellectual property, and unjust enrichment\u2014are not contingent on a plaintiff's allegation of damages beyond the violation of his private legal right. See Brief for Restitution and Remedies Scholars as Amici Cu-Cite as: 578 U. S. 330 (2016) 345 Thomas, J., concurring riae 6-18; see also Webb v. Portland Mfg. Co., 29 F. Cas. 506, 508 (No. 17,322) (Me. 1838) (stating that a legal injury \"im- ports damage in the nature of it\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Common-law courts, however, have required a further showing of injury for violations of \"public rights\"\u2014rights that involve duties owed \"to the whole community, consid-ered as a community, in its social aggregate capacity.\" 4 Blackstone *5. Such rights include \"free navigation of wa-terways, passage on public highways, and general compli-ance with regulatory law.\" Woolhander & Nelson, 102 Mich. L. Rev., at 693. Generally, only the government had the au- thority to vindicate a harm borne by the public at large, such as the violation of the criminal laws. See id., at 695-700. Even in limited cases where private plaintiffs could bring a claim for the violation of public rights, they had to allege that the violation caused them \"some extraordinary damage, beyond the rest of the [community].\" 3 Blackstone *220 (dis-cussing nuisance); see also Commonwealth v. Webb , 27 Va. 726, 729 (Gen. Ct. 1828).* An action to redress a public nui-sance, for example, was historically considered an action to vindicate the violation of a public right at common law, lest \"every subject in the kingdom\" be able to \"harass the of-fender with separate actions.\" 3 Blackstone *219; see also 4 id., at *167. But if the plaintiff could allege \"special dam- age\" as the result of a nuisance, the suit could proceed. The existence of special, individualized damage had the effect of creating a private action for compensatory relief to an other-wise public-rights claim. See 3 id., at *220. Similarly, a plaintiff had to allege individual damage in disputes over the use of public lands. E. g., Robert Marys's Case , 9 Co. Rep. 111b, 112b-113a, 77 Eng. Rep. 895, 897-899 (K. B. 1613) (com- *The well-established exception for qui tam actions allows private plain- tiffs to sue in the government's name for the violation of a public right. See Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Ste- vens, 529 U. S. 765, 773-774 (2000). 346 SPOKEO , INC. v. ROBINS Thomas, J., concurring moner must not only injuria damnum [damage] to challenge another's overgrazing on the commons). B These differences between legal claims brought by private plaintiffs for the violation of public and private rights under- lie modern standing doctrine and explain the Court's descrip-tion of the injury-in-fact requirement. \"Injury in fact\" is the frst of three \"irreducible\" requirements for Article III standing. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992). The injury-in-fact requirement often stymies a pri-vate plaintiff's attempt to vindicate the infringement of pub- lic rights. The Court has said time and again that, when a plaintiff seeks to vindicate a public right, the plaintiff must allege that he has suffered a \"concrete\" injury particular to himself. See Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 221-223 (1974) (explaining this where plaintiffs sought to enforce the Incompatibility Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 2, against Members of Congress holding re-serve commissions in the Armed Forces); see also Lujan, supra, at 572-573 (evaluating standing where plaintiffs sought to enforce the Endangered Species Act); Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 183-184 (2000) (Clean Water Act). This requirement applies with special force when a plaintiff fles suit to require an executive agency to \"follow the law\"; at that point, the citizen must prove that he \"has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as the result of that [challenged] action and it is not suffcient that he has merely a general interest common to all members of the public.\" Ex parte Levitt, 302 U. S. 633, 634 (1937) (per curiam ). Thus, in a case where private plaintiffs sought to compel the U. S. Forest Service to follow certain procedures when it regulated \"small fre-rehabilitation and timber-salvage projects,\" we held that \"deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the Cite as: 578 U. S. 330 (2016) 347 Thomas, J., concurring deprivation . . . is insuffcient to create Article III standing,\" even if \"accorded by Congress.\" Summers v. Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. 488, 490, 496-497 (2009). But the concrete-harm requirement does not apply as rig- orously when a private plaintiff seeks to vindicate his own private rights. Our contemporary decisions have not re-quired a plaintiff to assert an actual injury beyond the viola-tion of his personal legal rights to satisfy the \"injury-in-fact\" requirement. See, e. g., Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 266 (1978) (holding that nominal damages are appropriate when a plaintiff's constitutional rights have been infringed but he cannot show further injury). The separation-of-powers concerns underlying our public- rights decisions are not implicated when private individuals sue to redress violations of their own private rights. But, when they are implicated, standing doctrine keeps courts out of political disputes by denying private litigants the right to test the abstract legality of government action. See Schle- singer , supra, at 222. And by limiting Congress' ability to delegate law enforcement authority to private plaintiffs and the courts, standing doctrine preserves executive discretion. See Lujan, supra, at 577 (\" `To permit Congress to convert the undifferentiated public interest in executive offcers' compliance with the law into an `individual right' vindicable in the courts is to permit Congress to transfer from the Pres-ident to the courts the Chief Executive's most important con-stitutional duty, to `take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed' \"). But where one private party has alleged that another private party violated his private rights, there is generally no danger that the private party's suit is an imper-missible attempt to police the activity of the political branches or, more broadly, that the Legislative Branch has impermissibly delegated law enforcement authority from the Executive to a private individual. See Hessick, Standing, Injury in Fact, and Private Rights, 93 Cornell L. Rev. 275, 317-321 (2008). 348 SPOKEO , INC. v. ROBINS Thomas, J., concurring C When Congress creates new private causes of action to vindicate private or public rights, these Article III principles circumscribe federal courts' power to adjudicate a suit alleg-ing the violation of those new legal rights. Congress can create new private rights and authorize private plaintiffs to sue based simply on the violation of those private rights. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 500 (1975). A plaintiff seeking to vindicate a statutorily created private right need not allege actual harm beyond the invasion of that private right. See Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U. S. 363, 373-374 (1982) (recognizing standing for a violation of the Fair Housing Act); Tennessee Elec. Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U. S. 118, 137-138 (1939) (recognizing that standing can exist where \"the right invaded is a legal right,\u2014one of property, one arising out of contract, one protected against tortious invasion, or one founded on a statute which confers a privi-lege\"). A plaintiff seeking to vindicate a public right em-bodied in a federal statute, however, must demonstrate that the violation of that public right has caused him a concrete, individual harm distinct from the general population. See Lujan, supra, at 578 (noting that, whatever the scope of Con- gress' power to create new legal rights, \"it is clear that in suits against the Government, at least, the concrete injury requirement must remain\"). Thus, Congress cannot author-ize private plaintiffs to enforce public rights in their own names, absent some showing that the plaintiff has suffered a concrete harm particular to him. II Given these principles, I agree with the Court's decision to vacate and remand. The Fair Credit Reporting Act cre-ates a series of regulatory duties. Robins has no standing to sue Spokeo, in his own name, for violations of the duties that Spokeo owes to the public collectively, absent some Cite as: 578 U. S. 330 (2016) 349 Ginsburg, J., dissenting showing that he has suffered concrete and particular harm. See supra, at 346-347. These consumer protection require- ments include, for example, the requirement to \"post a toll-free telephone number on [Spokeo's] website through which consumers can request free annual fle disclosures.\" App. 23, First Amended Complaint \u00b674; see 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681j; 16 CFR \u00a7 610.3(a)(1) (2010). But a remand is required because one claim in Robins' complaint rests on a statutory provision that could arguably establish a private cause of action to vindicate the violation of a privately held right. Section 1681e(b) requires Spokeo to \"follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. \" \u00a7 1681e(b) (emphasis added). If Congress has created a private duty owed personally to Rob-ins to protect his information, then the violation of the legal duty suffces for Article III injury in fact. If that provision, however, vests any and all consumers with the power to po-lice the \"reasonable procedures\" of Spokeo, without more, then Robins has no standing to sue for its violation absent an allegation that he has suffered individualized harm. On remand, the Court of Appeals can consider the nature of this claim. Justice Ginsburg , with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, dissenting. In the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA or Act), 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681 et seq., Congress required consumer report- ing agencies, whenever preparing a consumer report, to \"fol-low reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accu-racy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.\" \u00a7 1681e(b). To promote adher-ence to the Act's procedural requirements, Congress granted adversely affected consumers a right to sue noncomplying reporting agencies. \u00a7 1681n (willful noncompliance); \u00a7 1681o 350 , INC. v. ROBINS Ginsburg, J., dissenting (negligent noncompliance).1 Thomas Robins instituted suit against Spokeo, Inc., alleging that Spokeo was a reporting agency governed by the FCRA, and that Spokeo maintains on its Web site an inaccurate consumer report about Robins. App. 13. In particular, Robins alleged that Spokeo posted \"a picture . . . purport[ing] to be an image of Robins [that] was not in fact [of him],\" and incorrectly reported that Robins \"was . . . married, . . . has children.\" Id., at 14. Robins further alleged that Spokeo's profle of him continues to misrepre-sent \"that he has a graduate degree, that his economic health is `Very Strong[,]' and that his wealth level [is in] \" Ibid. Spokeo displayed tion, asserts, when was \"out of work\" and \"ac-tively seeking employment.\" Ibid. Because of the misin- formation, Robins stated, he encountered \"[imminent and ongoing] actual harm to [his] employment prospects.\" Ibid. 2 As Robins elaborated on brief, Spokeo's report made him appear overqualifed for jobs he might have gained, expec-tant of a higher salary than employers would be willing to pay, and less mobile because of family responsibilities. See Brief for Respondent 44. I agree with much of the Court's opinion. Robins, the Court holds, meets the particularity requirement for stand-ing under Article III. See ante, at 339-340, 342-343 (re- manding only for concreteness inquiry). The Court ac-knowledges that Congress has the authority to confer rights 1 Congress added the right of action for willful violations in 1996 as part of the Consumer Credit Reporting Reform Act, 110 Stat. 3009-426. 2 Because this case remains at the pleading stage, the court of frst in- stance must assume the truth of Robins' factual allegations. In particu- lar, that court must assume, subject to later proof, that Spokeo is a con-sumer reporting agency under 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1681a(f) and that, in preparing consumer reports, Spokeo does not employ reasonable procedures to en-sure maximum possible accuracy, in violation of the FCRA. Cite as: 578 U. S. 330 (2016) 351 Ginsburg, J., dissenting and delineate claims for relief where none existed before. Ante, at 341; see Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins, 524 U.

S. 555, 580 (1992) (Kennedy , J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"As Government programs and pol-icies become more complex and far reaching, we must be sensitive to the articulation of new rights of action . . . .\"); Brief for Restitution and Remedies Scholars as Amici Cu- riae 3 (\"Congress cannot authorize individual plaintiffs to enforce generalized rights that belong to the whole public. But Congress can create new individual rights, and it can enact effective remedies for those rights.\"). See generally Sunstein, Informational Regulation and Informational Standing: Akins and Beyond, 147 U. Pa. L. Rev. 613 (1999). I part ways with the Court, however, on the necessity of a remand to determine whether Robins' particularized in- 3 Just as the right to truthful information at stake in Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U. S. 363 (1982), was closely tied to the Fair Housing Act's goal of eradicating racial discrimination in housing, so the right here at stake is closely tied to the FCRA's goal of protecting consumers against dissemination of inaccurate credit information about them. 352 SPOKEO , INC. v. ROBINS Ginsburg, J., dissenting jury was \"concrete.\" See ante, at 342. Judged by what we have said about \"concreteness,\" Robins' allegations carry him across the threshold. The Court's opinion observes that time and again, our decisions have coupled the words \"con-crete and particularized.\" Ante, at 340 (citing as examples, Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U. S. 149, 158 (2014); Summers v. Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. 488, 493 (2009); Sprint Communications Co. v. APCC Services, Inc., 554 U. S. 269, 274 (2008); Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 517 (2007)). True, but true too, in the four cases cited by the Court, and many others, opinions do not discuss the separate offces of the terms \"concrete\" and \"particularized.\" Inspection of the Court's decisions suggests that the par- ticularity requirement bars complaints raising generalized grievances, seeking relief that no more benefts the plaintiff than it does the public at large. See, e. g., Lujan, 504 U. S., at 573-574 (a plaintiff \"seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefts him than it does the public at large does not state an Article III case or controversy\" (punctua-tion omitted)); Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U. S. 113, 125 (1940) (plaintiffs lack standing because they failed to show injury to \"a particular right of their own, as distinguished from the public's interest in the administration of the law\"). Robins' claim does not present a question of that character. He seeks redress, not for harm to the citizenry, but for Spokeo's spread of misinformation specifcally about him. Concreteness as a discrete requirement for standing, the Court's decisions indicate, refers to the reality of an injury, harm that is real, not abstract, but not necessarily tangible. See ante, at 340; ante, at 343 (Thomas, J., concurring). Il- lustrative opinions include Akins, 524 U.

Robins would not qualify, the Court observes, if he alleged a \"bare\" procedural violation, ante, at 342, one that results in no harm, for example, \"an incorrect zip code,\" ibid. Far from an incorrect zip code, Robins complains of misinforma-tion about his education, family situation, and economic sta-tus, inaccurate representations that could affect his fortune in the job market. See Brief for Center for Democracy & Technology et al. as Amici Curiae 13 (Spokeo's inaccuracies bore on Robins' \"ability to fnd employment by creating the erroneous impression that he was overqualifed for the work he was seeking, that he might be unwilling to relocate for a 354 SPOKEO , INC. v.

I therefore see no utility in returning this case to the Ninth Circuit to underscore what Robins' complaint already con-veys concretely: Spokeo's misinformation \"cause[s] actual harm to [his] employment prospects.\" App. 14. * * * For the reasons stated, I would affrm the Ninth Circuit's judgment. OCTOBER TERM, 2015 355 Syllabus HUSKY INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONICS, INC. v. RITZ certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fth circuit No. 15-145. Argued March 1, 2016\u2014Decided May 16, 2016 Chrysalis Manufacturing Corp. incurred a debt to petitioner Husky Inter- national Electronics, Inc., of nearly $164,000. Respondent Daniel Lee Ritz, Jr., Chrysalis' director and part owner at the time, drained Chrysa-lis of assets available to pay the debt by transferring large sums of money to other entities Ritz controlled. Husky sued Ritz to recover on the debt. Ritz then fled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, prompting Husky to fle a complaint in Ritz' bankruptcy case, seeking to hold him person-ally liable and contending that the debt was not dischargeable because Ritz' intercompany-transfer scheme constituted \"actual fraud\" under the Bankruptcy Code's discharge exceptions. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). The District Court held that Ritz was personally liable under state law but also held that the debt was not \"obtained by . . . actual fraud\" under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and thus could be discharged in bankruptcy. The Fifth Circuit affrmed, holding that a misrepresentation from a debtor to a creditor is a necessary element of \"actual fraud\" and was lacking in this case, because Ritz made no false representations to Husky regard-ing the transfer of Chrysalis' assets. Held: The term \"actual fraud\" in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) encompasses fraudulent conveyance schemes, even when those schemes do not involve a false representation. Pp. 359-366. (a) It is sensible to presume that when Congress amended the Bank- ruptcy Code in 1978 and added to debts obtained by \"false pretenses or false representations\" an additional bankruptcy discharge exception for debts obtained by \"actual fraud,\" it did not intend the term \"actual fraud\" to mean the same thing as the already-existing term \"false rep-resentations.\" See United States v. Quality Stores, Inc., 572 U. S. 141, 148. Even stronger evidence that \"actual fraud\" encompasses the kind of conduct alleged to have occurred here is found in the phrase's historical meaning. At common law, \"actual fraud\" meant fraud com-mitted with wrongful intent, Neal v. Clark, 95 U. S. 704, 709. And the term \"fraud\" has, since the beginnings of bankruptcy practice, been used to describe asset transfers that, like Ritz' scheme, impair a creditor's ability to collect a debt. 356 HUSKY INT'L ELECTRONICS, INC. v. RITZ Syllabus One of the frst bankruptcy Acts, the Fraudulent Conveyances Act of 1571, 13 ch. 5, identifed to delay hynder or defraude [c]reditors.\" The degree to which that statute remains embedded in fraud-related laws today, see, e. g., BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation, 511 U. S. 531, 540, clarifes that the common-law term \"actual fraud\" is broad enough to incorporate fraudulent conveyances. The common law also indicates that fraudu-lent conveyances do not require a misrepresentation from a debtor to a creditor, see id., at 541, as they lie not in dishonestly inducing a credi- tor to extend a debt but in the acts of concealment and hindrance. Pp. 359-362. (b) Interpreting 523(a)(2)(A) to encompass fraudu- lent conveyances would not, as Ritz contends, render duplicative two of \u00a7 523's other discharge exceptions, \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(4), (6), given that \"actual fraud\" captures much conduct not covered by those other provisions. Nor does this interpretation create a redundancy in \u00a7 727(a)(2), which is meaningfully different from \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). It is also not incompatible with \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A)'s \"obtained by\" requirement. Even though the transferor of a fraudulent conveyance does not obtain assets or debts through the fraudulent conveyance, the transferee\u2014who, with the requi-site intent, also commits fraud\u2014does. At minimum, those debts would not be dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). Finally, reading the phrase \"actual fraud\" to restrict, rather than expand, the discharge exception's reach would untenably require reading the disjunctive \"or\" in the phrase \"false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud\" to mean \"by.\" Pp. 362-366. 787 F. 3d 312, reversed and remanded. Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., fled a dissenting opinion, post, p. 366.

S. 355 (2016) 357 Opinion of the Court Erin E. Murphy argued the cause for respondent. With her on the brief were Stephen V. Potenza and William D. Weber.* Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court. The Bankruptcy Code prohibits debtors from discharging debts \"obtained by . . . false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.\" 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). The Fifth Cir-cuit held that a debt is \"obtained by . . . actual fraud\" only if the debtor's fraud involves a false representation to a credi-tor. That ruling deepened an existing split among the Cir-cuits over whether \"actual fraud\" requires a false represen-tation or whether it encompasses other traditional forms of fraud that can be accomplished without a false representa-tion, such as a fraudulent conveyance of property made to evade payment to creditors. We granted certiorari to re-solve that split, 577 U. S. 971 (2015), and now reverse. I Husky International Electronics, Inc., is a Colorado-based supplier of components used in electronic devices. Between 2003 and 2007, Husky sold its products to Chrysalis Manufac-turing Corp., and Chrysalis incurred a debt to Husky of $163,999.38. During the same period, respondent Daniel Lee Ritz, Jr., served as a director of Chrysalis and owned at least 30% of Chrysalis' common stock. *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were fled for Bankruptcy Law Professors by Jerrold J.

RITZ Opinion of the Court All parties agree that between 2006 and 2007, Ritz drained Chrysalis of assets it could have used to pay its debts to creditors like Husky by transferring large sums of Chrysalis' funds to other entities Ritz controlled. For instance\u2014and Ritz' actions were by no means limited to these examples\u2014 Ritz transferred $52,600 to CapNet Risk Management, Inc., a company he owned in full; $121,831 to CapNet Securities Corp., a company in which he owned an 85% interest; and $99,386.90 to Dynalyst Manufacturing Corp., a company in which he owned a 25% interest. In May 2009, Husky fled a lawsuit against Ritz seeking to hold him personally responsible for Chrysalis' $163,999.38 debt. Husky argued that Ritz' intercompany-transfer scheme was \"actual fraud\" for purposes of a Texas law that allows creditors to hold shareholders responsible for corpo-rate debt. See Tex. Bus. Orgs. Code Ann. \u00a7 21.223(b) (West 2012). In December 2009, Ritz fled for Chapter 7 bank-ruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the South-ern District of Texas. Husky then initiated an adversarial proceeding in Ritz' bankruptcy case again seeking to hold Ritz personally liable for Chrysalis' debt. Husky also con-tended that Ritz could not discharge that debt in bankruptcy because the same intercompany-transfer scheme constituted \"actual fraud\" under 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A)'s exemption to discharge. 1 The District Court held that Ritz was personally liable for the debt under Texas law, but that the debt was not \"ob-tained by . . . actual fraud\" under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and could be discharged in his bankruptcy. The Fifth Circuit affrmed. It did not address whether Ritz was responsible for Chrysalis' debt under Texas law be- 1 Husky also alleged that Ritz' debt should be exempted from discharge under two other exceptions, see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 523(a)(4) (excepting debts for 523(a)(6) (excepting debts for \"willful and malicious injury\"), but does not press those claims in this petition. Cite as: 578 U. S. 355 (2016) 359 Opinion of the Court cause it agreed with the District Court that Ritz did not commit \"actual fraud\" under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). Before the Fifth Circuit, Husky argued that Ritz' asset-transfer scheme was effectuated through a series of fraudulent conveyances\u2014 or transfers intended to obstruct the collection of debt. And, Husky said, such transfers are a recognizable form of \"actual fraud.\" The Fifth Circuit disagreed, holding that a necessary element of \"actual fraud\" is a misrepresentation from the debtor to the creditor, as when a person applying for credit adds an extra zero to her income or falsifes her employment history. In re Ritz, 787 F. 3d 312, 316 (2015). In transferring Chrysalis' assets, Ritz may have hindered Husky's ability to recover its debt, but the Fifth Circuit found that he did not make any false representations to Husky regarding those assets or the transfers and therefore did not commit \"actual fraud.\" We reverse. The term \"actual fraud\" in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) en- compasses forms of fraud, like fraudulent conveyance schemes, that can be effected without a false representation. II A Before 1978, the Bankruptcy Code prohibited debtors from discharging debts obtained by \"false pretenses or false rep-resentations.\" \u00a7 35(a)(2) (1976 ed.). In the Bankruptcy Re-form Act of 1978, Congress added \"actual fraud\" to that list. 92 Stat. 2590. The prohibition now reads: \"A discharge under [Chapters 7, 11, 12, or 13] of this title does not dis-charge an individual debtor from any debt . . . for money, property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refnancing of credit, to the extent obtained by . . . false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.\" \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) (2012 ed.). When \" `Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it intends its amendment to have real and substantial effect.' \" United States v. Quality Stores, Inc., 572 U. S. 141, 148 360 HUSKY INT'L ELECTRONICS, INC. v. RITZ Opinion of the Court (2014). It is therefore sensible to start with the presump- tion that Congress did not intend \"actual fraud\" to mean the same thing as \"a false representation,\" as the Fifth Circuit's holding suggests. But the historical meaning of \"actual fraud\" provides even stronger evidence that the phrase has long encompassed the kind of conduct alleged to have oc-curred here: a transfer scheme designed to hinder the collec-tion of debt. This Court has historically construed the terms in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) to contain the \"elements that the common law has defned them to include.\" Field v. Mans, 516 U. S. 59, 69 (1995). \"Actual fraud\" has two parts: actual and fraud. The word \"actual\" has a simple meaning in the context of common-law fraud: It denotes any fraud that \"involv[es] moral turpitude or intentional wrong.\" Neal v. Clark, 95 U. S. 704, 709 (1878). \"Actual\" fraud stands in contrast to \"implied\" fraud or fraud \"in law,\" which describe acts of de-ception that \"may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.\" Ibid. Thus, anything that counts as \"fraud\" and is done with wrongful intent is \"actual fraud.\" Although \"fraud\" connotes deception or trickery gener- ally, the term is diffcult to defne more precisely. See 1 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 189, p. 221 (6th ed. 1853) (Story) (\"Fraud . . . being so various in its nature, and so extensive in its application to human concerns, it would be diffcult to enumerate all the instances in which Courts of Equity will grant relief under this head\"). There is no need to adopt a defnition for all times and all circum-stances here because, from the beginning of English bank-ruptcy practice, courts and legislatures have used the term \"fraud\" to describe a debtor's transfer of assets that, like Ritz' scheme, impairs a creditor's ability to collect the debt. One of the frst bankruptcy acts, the Statute of 13 Eliza- beth, has long been relied upon as a restatement of the law of so-called fraudulent conveyances (also known as \"fraudulent transfers\" or \"fraudulent alienations\"). See generally G. Cite as: 578 U. S. 355 (2016) 361 Opinion of the Court Glenn, The Law of Fraudulent Conveyances 89-92 (1931). That statute, also called the Fraudulent Conveyances Act of 1571, identifed as 13 Eliz., ch. 5. In modern terms, Parliament made it fraudulent to hide assets from creditors by giving them to one's family, friends, or associates. The principles of the Statute of 13 Elizabeth\u2014and even some of its lan-guage\u2014continue to be in wide use today. See BFP v. Reso- lution Trust Corporation, 511 U. S. 531, 540 (1994) (\"The modern law of fraudulent transfers had its origin in the Stat-ute of 13 Elizabeth\"); id., at 541 (\"Every American bank- ruptcy law has incorporated a fraudulent transfer provi-sion\"); Story \u00a7 353, at 393 (\"[T]he statute of 13 Elizabeth . . . has been universally adopted in America, as the basis of our jurisprudence on the same subject\"); Boston Trading Group, Inc. v. Burnazos, 835 F. 2d 1504, 1505-1506 a uniform state law that codifes both common and statutory law stretching back at least to 1571 and the Statute of Eliza-beth\"). The degree to which this statute remains embedded in laws related to fraud today clarifes that the common-law term \"actual fraud\" is broad enough to incorporate a fraudu-lent conveyance. Equally important, the common law also indicates that fraudulent conveyances, although a \"fraud,\" do not require a misrepresentation from a debtor to a creditor. As a basic point, fraudulent conveyances are not an inducement-based fraud. Fraudulent conveyances typically involve \"a transfer to a close relative, a secret transfer, a transfer of title with-out transfer of possession, or grossly inadequate consider-ation.\" BFP , 511 U. S., at 540-541 (citing Twyne's Case , 3 Co. Rep. 80b, 76 Eng. Rep. 809 (K. B. 1601); O. Bump, Fraud-ulent Conveyances: A Treatise Upon Conveyances Made by Debtors To Defraud Creditors 31-60 (3d ed. 1882)). In such 362 HUSKY INT'L ELECTRONICS, INC. v. RITZ Opinion of the Court cases, the fraudulent conduct is not in dishonestly inducing a creditor to extend a debt. It is in the acts of concealment and hindrance. In the fraudulent conveyance context, therefore, the opportunities for a false representation from the debtor to the creditor are limited. The debtor may have the opportunity to put forward a false representation if the creditor inquires into the whereabouts of the debtor's assets, but that could hardly be considered a defning feature of this kind of fraud. Relatedly, under the Statute of 13 Elizabeth and the laws that followed, both the debtor and the recipient of the con-veyed assets were liable for fraud even though the recipient of a fraudulent conveyance of course made no representation, true or false, to the debtor's creditor. The famous Twyne's Case , which this Court relied upon in BFP , illustrates this point. See Twyne's Case , 76 Eng. Rep., at 823 (convicting Twyne of fraud under the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, even though he was the recipient of a debtor's conveyance). That principle underlies the now-common understanding that a \"conveyance which hinders, delays or defrauds creditors shall be void as against it in good faith and for consideration.\" Glenn, Law of Fraudulent Conveyances \u00a7 233, at 312. That princi-ple also underscores the point that a false representation has never been a required element of \"actual fraud,\" and we de-cline to adopt it as one today. B Ritz concedes that fraudulent conveyances are a form of \"actual fraud,\" 2 but contends that 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A)'s particular use of the phrase means something else. Ritz' strained reading of the provision fnds little support. 2 See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30 (Justice Kagan: \"[Y]ou're not contesting that fraudulent conveyance is a form of actual fraud; is that right?\" Ms. Mur- phy: \"[Y]es, that's right\"); id., at 27 (Ms. Murphy: \"[T]o be clear, we don't dispute that fraudulent conveyance is a form of actual fraud\"). Cite as: 578 U. S. 355 (2016) 363 Opinion of the Court First, Ritz contends that interpreting \"actual fraud\" in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) to encompass fraudulent conveyances would render duplicative two other exceptions to discharge in \u00a7 523. Section 523(a)(4) exempts from discharge \"any debt . . . for fraud or defalcation while capacity, em-bezzlement, . . . for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.\" Ritz makes the unremarkable point that the traditional defnition of \"actual fraud\" will cover some of the same con-duct as those exceptions: for example, a trustee who fraudu- lently conveys away his trust's assets. But Ritz' interpreta-tion does not avoid duplication, nor does our interpretation fail to preserve a meaningful difference between \u00a7 523(a) (2)(A) and \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(4), (6). Just as a fduciary who engages in a fraudulent conveyance may fnd his debt exempted from discharge under either \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) or \u00a7 523(a)(4), so too would a fduciary who engages in one of the fraudulent mis-representations that form the core of Ritz' preferred inter-pretation of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). The same is true for \u00a7 523(a)(6). The debtors who commit fraudulent conveyances and the debtors who make false representations under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) could likewise also infict \"willful and malicious injury\" under \u00a7 523(a)(6). There is, in short, overlap, but that over-lap appears inevitable. And, of course, our interpretation of \"actual fraud\" in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) also preserves meaningful provision and \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(4), (a)(6). Section 523(a)(4), for instance, covers only debts for fraud while act-ing as a fduciary, whereas \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) has no similar limi-tation. Nothing in our interpretation alters that distinction. And \u00a7 523(a)(6) covers debts \"for willful and malicious in-jury,\" whether or not that injury is the result of fraud, see Kawaauhau v. Geiger , 523 U. S. 57, 61 (1998) (discussing inju- ries resulting from \" `intentional torts' \"), whereas \u00a7 523(a) (2)(A) covers only fraudulent acts. Nothing in our interpre-364 HUSKY INT'L ELECTRONICS, INC. v. RITZ Opinion of the Court tation alters that distinction either. Thus, given the clear differences between these provisions, we see no reason to craft an artifcial defnition of \"actual fraud\" merely to avoid narrow redundancies in \u00a7 523 that appear unavoidable. Ritz also says that our interpretation creates redundancy with a separate section of the Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 727(a)(2), which prevents a debtor from discharging all of his debts if, within the year preceding the bankruptcy petition, he \"transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed\" property \"with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor or an offcer of the estate charged with custody of property.\" Although the two provisions could cover some of the same conduct, they are meaningfully different. Section 727(a)(2) is broader than \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) in scope\u2014preventing an offend-ing debtor from discharging all debt in bankruptcy. But it is narrower than \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) in timing\u2014applying only if the debtor fraudulently conveys assets in the year preceding the bankruptcy fling. In short, while \u00a7 727(a)(2) is a blunt remedy for actions that hinder the entire bankruptcy proc-ess, \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) is a tailored remedy for behavior con-nected to specifc debts. Ritz' next point of resistance rests on \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A)'s re- quirement that the relevant debt be \"for services, or . actual fraud.\" (Emphasis added.) The argument, which the dissent also emphasizes, has two parts: First, it posits that fraudulent conveyances (unlike other forms of actual fraud) cannot be used to \"obtai[n]\" debt because they function instead to hide valuables that a debtor already possesses. Brief for Re-spondent 20, 31. There is, the dissent says, no debt at the end of a fraudulent conveyance that could be said to \" `resul[t] from' \" or be \" `traceable to' \" the fraud. Post, at 368 (quot- ing Field, 516 U. S., at 61, 64). Second, it urges that \"actual fraud\" not be interpreted to encompass forms of fraud that are incompatible with the provision's \"obtained by\" requirement. Cite as: 578 U. S. 355 (2016) 365 Opinion of the Court It is of course true that the transferor does not \"obtai[n]\" debts in a fraudulent conveyance. But the recipient of the transfer\u2014who, with the requisite intent, also commits fraud\u2014can \"obtai[n]\" assets \"by\" his or her participation in the fraud. See, e. g., McClellan v. Cantrell, 217 F. 3d 890 (CA 7 2000); see also supra, at 362. If that recipient later fles for bankruptcy, any debts \"traceable to\" the fraudulent conveyance, see Field, 516 U. S., at 61; post, at 368, will be nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). Thus, at least some-times a debt \"obtained by\" a fraudulent conveyance scheme could be nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). Such cir-cumstances may be rare because a person who receives fraudulently conveyed assets is not necessarily (or even likely to be) a debtor on the verge of bankruptcy, 3 but they make clear that fraudulent conveyances are not wholly in-compatible with the \"obtained by\" requirement. The dissent presses further still, contending that the phrase \"obtained by . . . actual fraud\" requires not only that the relevant debts \" `resul[t] from' \" or be \" `traceable to' \" fraud but also that they \"result from fraud at the inception of a credit transaction.\" Post, at 368 (emphasis added). Nothing in the text of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) supports that additional requirement. The dissent bases its conclusion on this Court's opinion in Field, in which the Court noted that cer- tain forms of bankruptcy fraud require a degree of direct reliance by a creditor on an action taken by a debtor. But Field discussed such \"reliance\" only in setting forth the re- quirements of the form of fraud alleged in that case\u2014namely, fraud perpetrated through a misrepresentation to a creditor. See 516 U. S., at 61. The Court was not establishing a \"reli- 3 Ritz' situation may be unusual in this regard because Husky contends that Ritz was both the transferor and the transferee in his fraudulent conveyance scheme, having transferred Chrysalis assets to other compa-nies he controlled. We take no position on that contention here and leave it to the Fifth Circuit to decide on remand whether the debt to Husky was \"obtained by\" Ritz' asset-transfer scheme. 366 HUSKY INT'L ELECTRONICS, INC. v. RITZ Thomas, J., dissenting ance\" requirement for frauds that are not premised on such a misrepresentation. Finally, Ritz argues that Congress added the phrase \"ac- tual fraud\" to \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) not to expand the exception's reach, but to restrict it. In Ritz' view, \"actual fraud\" was inserted as the last item in a disjunctive list\u2014\"false pre-tenses, a false representation, or actual fraud\"\u2014in order to make clear that the \"false pretenses\" and \"false representa-tion[s]\" covered by the provision needed to be intentional. Brief for Respondent 29-31. Ritz asks us, in other words, to ignore what he believes is Congress' \"imprudent use of the word `or,' \" id., at 32, and read the fnal item in the list to modify and limit the others. In essence, he asks us to change the word \"or\" to \"by.\" That is an argument that defeats itself. We can think of no other example, nor could petitioner point to any at oral argument, in which this Court has attempted such an unusual statutory modifcation. * * * Because we must give the phrase \"actual fraud\" in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) the meaning it has long held, we interpret \"ac-tual fraud\" to encompass fraudulent conveyance schemes, even when those schemes do not involve a false representa-tion. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Fifth Cir-cuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. So ordered. Justice Thomas, dissenting. The Bankruptcy Code exempts from discharge \"any debt . . . for money, false pretenses, a false or actual fraud.\" 11 U. S. C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The Court holds that \"actual fraud\" encompasses fraudulent transfer schemes effectuated without any false representa-tion to a creditor and concludes that a debt for goods may Cite as: 578 U. S. 355 (2016) 367 Thomas, J., dissenting \"sometimes\" be \"obtained by\" a fraudulent transfer scheme. Ante , at 359, 365. Because \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) does not apply so expansively, I respectfully dissent. I In my view, \"actual fraud\" within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(2) does not encompass fraudulent transfer schemes. There are two types of fraudulent transfer schemes: \"trans-fers made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, referred to as actual fraudulent transfers,\" and \"transfers made for less than reasonably equivalent [value] when a debtor was in fnancial trouble, [which is] referred to as constructive fraudulent transfers.\" 2 Bankruptcy Law Manual \u00a7 9A:29, p. 333 (5th ed. 2015). I do not quibble with the majority's conclusion that the common-law defnition of \"actual fraud\" included fraudulent transfers. Ante , at 360- 362. And I agree that, generally, we should give a common- law term of art its established common-law meaning. Ante , at 360. Nevertheless, the \"general rule that a common-law term of art should be given its established common-law mean-ing\" gives way \"where that meaning does not ft.\" United States v. Castleman, 572 U. S. 157, 163 (2014) (internal quota- tion marks omitted). Ultimately, \"[s]tatutory language must be read in context and a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it.\" Jones v. United States, 527 U. S. 373, 389 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). In my view, con-text dictates that \"actual fraud\" ordinarily does not include fraudulent transfers because \"that meaning does not ft\" with the rest of \u00a7 523(a)(2). Castleman, supra, at 163 (inter- nal quotation marks omitted). Section 523(a)(2) covers only situations in which \"money, property, \"obtained by . . . actual fraud\" and result in a debt. See Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 218 (1998). The statutory phrase \"obtained by\" is an important limitation on the reach of the provision. Section 523(a)(2)(A) applies only when the fraudulent conduct occurs 368 HUSKY INT'L ELECTRONICS, INC. v. RITZ Thomas, J., dissenting at the inception of the debt, i. e., when the debtor commits a fraudulent act to induce the creditor to part with his money, property, services, or credit. The logical conclusion then is that \"actual fraud\"\u2014as it is used in the statute\u2014covers only those situations in which some sort of fraudulent conduct caused the creditor to enter into a transaction with the debtor. A fraudulent transfer generally does not ft that mold, unless, perhaps, the fraudulent transferor and the fraudulent transferee conspired to fraudulently drain the assets of the creditor. But the fraudulent transfer here, like all but the rarest fraudulent transfers, did not trick the cred-itor into selling his goods to the buyer, Chrysalis Manufac-turing Corporation. It follows that the goods that resulted in the debt here were not \"obtained by\" actual fraud. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). A I reach this conclusion based on the plain meaning of the phrase \"obtained by,\" which has an \"inherent\" \"element of causation,\" to those debts \"resulting from\" or \"traceable to\" fraud. Field v. Mans, 516 U. S. 59, 61, 64, 66 (1995). As I have stated, \"in order for a creditor to establish that a debt is not dischargeable, he must demonstrate that there is a causal nexus between the fraud and the debt.\" Archer v. Warner , 538 U. S. 314, 325 (2003) (dissenting opin- ion) (relying on Field, supra, at 61, 64, and Cohen, supra, at 218). There is also \"[n]o . . . doub[t] that some degree of reliance is required to satisfy th[is] element of causation.\" Field, 516 U. S., at 66. The upshot of the phrase \"obtained by\" is that \u00a7 523(a)(2) covers only those debts that result from fraud at the inception of a credit transaction. Such a debt caused by fraud necessarily \" follows a transfer of value or extension of credit induced by falsity or fraud.\" Ibid. (emphasis added). Bankruptcy treatises confrm that \"[t]he phrase `to the ex- tent obtained by' is properly read as meaning `obtained from' the creditor.\" 3 W. Norton & W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law Cite as: 578 U. S. 355 (2016) 369 Thomas, J., dissenting and Practice \u00a7 57:15, p. 57-35 (3d ed. 2015). The \"term `by' refers to the manner in which such money, property, or serv-ices is obtained and the creditor defrauded.\" Ibid. Accord- ing to Collier on Bankruptcy, to based on a debtor's \"representation,\" the debtor \"knew to be false\" and made \"with the intent and purpose of deceiving the\" creditor and that the creditor \"sus-tained a loss or damage as the proximate consequence.\" 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6523.08[1][e], p. 523-47 (A. Resnick & H. Sommer eds., 16th ed. 2015). Norton Bankruptcy Law and Practice is in accord: Section 523(a)(2)(A) requires 57-33 to 57-34. B Applying those principles here, Husky cannot invoke \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) to except the debt owed to it from discharge because, ordinarily, it would be nonsensical to say that a fraudulent transfer created the debt at issue. As the major-ity notes, the debt at issue did not originate from any trans-action between Ritz and Husky. Ante , at 357-358. Instead, Husky sold goods to Chrysalis, a company that Ritz fnan-cially controlled. Ante , at 357. In turn, Chrysalis\u2014not Ritz\u2014incurred a debt to Husky of $163,999.38 for the goods. Ibid. As the Bankruptcy Court found, there is no evidence that Ritz made \"any oral or written representations to Husky inducing Husky to enter into a contract with Chrysa-lis.\" In re Ritz, 459 B. R. 623, 628 (SD Tex. 2011). In fact, the only communication between Ritz and Husky occurred after Husky and Chrysalis entered into the contract and after Husky had shipped the goods to Chrysalis. Ibid. The Bankruptcy Court also found that there was no evidence that Ritz transferred the funds to avoid Chrysalis' obligations to pay the debt it owed to Husky\u2014an unsecured creditor. Id., 370 HUSKY INT'L ELECTRONICS, INC. v. RITZ Thomas, J., dissenting at 635. Because Husky does not contend that Ritz fraudu- lently induced it to sell goods to Chrysalis and cannot show that the constructive fraudulent conveyance had anything to do with its decision to contract with Chrysalis, Husky has not established that \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) covers any debt owed to it. II The majority reaches the opposite conclusion and holds that \u00a7 523(a)(2) may prevent an individual debtor from ob-taining a discharge even if (1) the debtor makes no false rep-resentation to the creditor, (2) the creditor does not rely on any of the debtor's actions or inactions, and (3) there was no actual fraudulent conveyance at the inception of the credit transaction between the creditor and the debtor. Ante , at 361-362, 365. It does so by giving new meaning to the phrase \"obtained by\" in cases involving fraudulent transfers, disregarding our case law, and second-guessing Congress' choices. Ante , at 365. The majority admits that a transferor \"does not `obtai[n]' debts in a fraudulent conveyance,\" but contends that \"the recipient of the transfer\u2014who, with the requisite intent, also commits fraud\u2014can `obtain' assets `by' his or her participa-tion in the Ibid. (brackets omitted). \"If that recipi- ent later fles for bankruptcy, any debts traceable to the fraudulent conveyance,\" the majority states, \"will be nondis-chargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The majority thus holds that \"at least sometimes a debt `obtained by' a fraudulent conveyance scheme could be nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\" Ibid. But \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) does not exempt from discharge any debts \"traceable to the fraudulent conveyance.\" Instead, \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) exempts from discharge \"any debt for\" goods that are \"obtained by\" actual fraud. And, as explained, it is extremely rare that a creditor will use an actual fraudulent transfer scheme to induce a creditor to depart with property, services, money, or credit. See supra, at 367-369. Cite as: 578 U. S. 355 (2016) 371 Thomas, J., dissenting In reaching its conclusion, the majority also disregards this Court's precedents interpreting \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), presum- ably because those cases did not involve fraudulent transfers. The majority cites Field only for the elemental proposition that this Court \"has historically construed the terms in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) to contain the `elements that the common law has defned them to include.' \" Ante , at 360 (quoting 516 U. S., at 69). The majority omits Field's conclusion that one of the elements of \"actual fraud\" in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) is \"reli-ance\" on some sort of false statement, misrepresentation, or omission. Id., at 70 (emphasis added). To be sure, like the rest of our cases interpreting \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), Field involves a false statement. But that factual distinction is immaterial. Cases like Field\u2014which interpret the phrase \"obtained by\"\u2014are as relevant in cases that involve false statements and misrepresentations as they are in a case like this one. After all, \"obtained by\" modifes false pretenses, false repre-sentations, and actual fraud in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). And in no case has this Court suggested\u2014never mind held\u2014that \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) may apply to circumstances in which there was no false statement, misrepresentation, or omission when the debt was frst obtained. The majority ostensibly creates a new defnition of \"ob- tained by\" because it thinks that this move is necessary to avoid rendering \"actual fraud\" superfuous. See ante, at 359- 360, 363-364. Not so. Actual fraud is broader than false pre-tenses or false representations, and \"consists of any deceit, ar-tifce, trick, or design involving direct and active operation of the mind, used to circumvent and cheat another.\" 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6523.08[1][e], at 523-46. \"Unlike false pre-tenses or false representation, actual fraud, within the mean-ing of the dischargeability exception, can focus on a promise of future performance made with intent not to perform.\" 2F Bankruptcy Service \u00a7 27:211, p. 59 (Supp. Jan. 2016). In this way, \"the actual fraud\" exception \"permit[s] the courts to except from discharge debts incurred without intent to 372 HUSKY INT'L ELECTRONICS, INC. v. RITZ Thomas, J., dissenting repay, or by use of other false implied representations, with- out the need to stretch the false pretenses and false repre-sentations language.\" Zaretsky, The Fraud Exception to Discharge Under the New Bankruptcy Code, 53 Am. Bank-ruptcy L. J. 253, 257 (1979). Some courts, for example, have held that \"a debtor commits actual fraud within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) when he incurs credit card debt with no ac-tual, subjective intent to repay it,\" but has not made an af-frmatively false representation or engaged in false pretense. In re Morrow , 488 B. R. 471, 479-480 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ga. 2012); see also, e. Alam, 314 B. R. 834, 841 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ga. 2004). Defning actual fraud this way does not render that term superfuous and\u2014unlike the majority's defnition\u2014does not render \"obtained by\" a nullity. Regardless, even if there is some overlap between the of \"false pretenses,\" \"false un-usual events in drafting.\" Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Ger- main, 503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992). \"[T]he canon against sur-plusage assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.\" Marx v. Gen- eral Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. 371, 385 (2013) (internal quota-tion marks omitted). \"But, in this case, no interpretation of [\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A)] gives effect to every word.\" Ibid. Under either my reading or the majority's reading, \"actual fraud\" is broader than some redundancy in the statute is not dispositive. At bottom, the majority's attempt to broaden \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) to cover fraudulent transfers impermissibly second-guesses Congress' choices. When Congress wants to stop a debtor from discharging a debt that he has concealed through a fraudulent transfer scheme, it ordinarily says so. See \u00a7 727(a)(2) (stating that a court shall grant the debtor a dis-charge unless the debtor engages in an actual fraudulent transfer scheme within a certain time of fling a bankruptcy Cite as: 578 U. S. 355 (2016) 373 Thomas, J., dissenting petition). If Congress wanted \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) to cover fraud- ulent transfer situations, \"it would have spoken more clearly to that effect.\" Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 620 (1994). Ultimately, \"it is not for us to substitute our view of policy for the legislation which has been passed by Con-gress.\" Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. 33, 52 (2008) (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted). * * * The majority today departs from the plain language of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), as interpreted by our precedents. Because I fnd no support for the Court's conclusion in the text of the Bankruptcy Code, I respectfully dissent. 374 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 Syllabus MERRILL L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. et al. v. MANNING et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit No. 14-1132. Argued December 1, 2015\u2014Decided May 16, 2016 Respondent Greg Manning held over two million shares of stock in Escala Group, Inc. He claims that he lost most of his investment when the share price plummeted after petitioners, Merrill Lynch and other fnan-cial institutions (collectively, Merrill Lynch), devalued Escala through \"naked short sales\" of its stock. Unlike a typical short sale, where a person borrows stock from a broker, sells it to a buyer on the open market, and later purchases the same number of shares to return to the broker, the seller in a \"naked\" short sale does not borrow the stock he puts on the market, and so never delivers the promised shares to the buyer. This practice, which can injure shareholders by driving down a stock's price, is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation SHO, which prohibits short sellers from intentionally failing to deliver securities, thereby curbing market manipulation. Manning and other former Escala shareholders (collectively, Manning) fled suit in New Jersey state court, alleging that Merrill Lynch's actions violated New Jersey law. Though Manning chose not to bring any claims under federal securities laws or rules, his complaint referred ex-plicitly to Regulation SHO, cataloging past accusations against Merrill Lynch for fouting its requirements and suggesting that the transactions at issue had again violated the regulation. Merrill Lynch removed the case to Federal District Court, asserting federal jurisdiction on two grounds. First, it invoked the general federal question statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331, which grants district courts jurisdiction of \"all civil ac- tions arising under\" federal law. It also invoked \u00a7 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), which grants federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction \"of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the rules or regulations thereunder.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78aa(a). Manning moved to remand the case to state court, arguing that neither statute gave the federal court authority to adjudicate his state-law claims. The District Court denied his motion, but the Third Circuit reversed. The court frst decided that \u00a7 1331 did not confer jurisdiction, because Man-ning's claims all arose under state law and did not necessarily raise any federal issues. Nor was the District Court the appropriate forum under \u00a7 27 of the Exchange Act, which, the court held, covers only those Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 375 Syllabus cases that would satisfy \u00a7 1331's \"arising under\" test for general fed- eral jurisdiction. Held: The jurisdictional test established by \u00a7 27 is the same as \u00a7 1331's test for deciding if a case \"arises under\" a federal law. Pp. 380-393. (a) Section 27's text more readily supports this meaning than it does the parties' two alternatives. Merrill Lynch argues that \u00a7 27's plain language requires an expansive rule: Any suit that either explicitly or implicitly asserts a breach of an Exchange Act duty is \"brought to en-force\" that duty even if the plaintiff seeks relief solely under state law. Under the natural reading of that text, however, \u00a7 27 confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an Exchange Act requirement. The \"brought to enforce\" language thus stops short of embracing any complaint that happens to mention a duty established by the Exchange Act. Meanwhile, Manning's far more re-strictive interpretation\u2014that a suit is \"brought to enforce\" only if it is brought directly under that statute\u2014veers too far in the opposite direc-tion. Instead, \u00a7 27's language is best read to capture both suits brought under the Exchange Act and the rare suit in which a state-law claim rises and falls on the plaintiff's ability to prove the violation of a federal duty. An existing jurisdictional test well captures both of these classes of suits \"brought to enforce\" such a duty: 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331's provision of federal jurisdiction of all civil actions \"arising under\" federal law. Federal jurisdiction most often attaches when federal law creates the cause of action asserted, but it may also attach when the state-law claim \"necessarily raise[s] a stated federal issue, actually disputed and sub-stantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance\" of federal and state power. Gra- ble & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 314. Pp. 380-385. (b) This Court's precedents interpreting the term \"brought to en- force\" have likewise interpreted \u00a7 27's jurisdictional grant as the Court's construction of \u00a7 1331's \"arising under\" standard. See Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court of Del. for New Castle Cty., 366 U. S. 656; Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U. S. 367. Pp. 385-389. (c) Construing \u00a7 27, consistent with both text and precedent, to cover suits that arise under the Exchange Act serves the goals the Court has consistently underscored in interpreting jurisdictional statutes. It gives due deference to the important role of state courts. And it pro-motes \"administrative simplicity[, which] is a major virtue in a jurisdic-tional statute.\" Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. 77, 94. Both judges and litigants are familiar with the \"arising under\" standard and how it works, and that test generally provides ready answers to jurisdictional questions.

We hold today that the jurisdictional test established by that provision is the same as the one used to decide if a case \"arises under\" a federal law. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331. I Respondent Greg Manning held more than two million shares of stock in Escala Group, Inc., a company traded on the NASDAQ. Between 2006 and 2007, Escala's share price plummeted and Manning lost most of his investment. Man-ning blames petitioners, Merrill Lynch and several other f-nancial institutions (collectively, Merrill Lynch), for devalu-ing Escala during that period through \"naked short sales\" of its stock. A typical short sale of a security is one made by a bor- rower, rather than an owner, of stock. In such a transac-tion, a person borrows stock from a broker, sells it to a buyer on the open market, and later purchases the same number of shares to return to the broker. The short seller's hope is that the stock price will decline between the time he sells the borrowed shares and the time he buys replacements to pay back his loan. If that happens, the seller gets to pocket the difference (minus associated transaction costs). In a \"naked\" short sale, by contrast, the seller has not borrowed (or otherwise obtained) the stock he puts on the market, and so never delivers the promised shares to the buyer. See \"Naked\" Short Selling Antifraud Rule, Securi-ties and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) Release No. 34-58774, 73 Fed. Reg. 61666 (2008). That practice (be-yond its effect on individual purchasers) can serve \"as a tool to drive down a company's stock price\"\u2014which, of course, injures shareholders like Manning. Id., at 61670. The SEC regulates such short sales at the federal level: The Commis-sion's Regulation SHO, issued under the Exchange Act, pro-hibits short sellers from intentionally failing to deliver secu-378 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Opinion of the Court rities and thereby curbs market manipulation. See 17 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 242.203-242.204 (2015). In this lawsuit, Manning (joined by six other former Es- cala shareholders) alleges that Merrill Lynch facilitated and engaged in naked short sales of Escala stock, in violation of New Jersey law. His complaint asserts that Merrill Lynch participated in \"short sales at times when [it] neither pos-sessed, nor had any intention of obtaining[,] suffcient stock\" to deliver to buyers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a, Amended Complaint \u00b639. That conduct, Manning charges, contra-vened provisions of the New Jersey Racketeer Infuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), New Jersey Crimi-nal Code, and New Jersey Uniform Securities Law; it also, he adds, ran afoul of the New Jersey common law of negli-gence, unjust enrichment, and interference with contractual relations. See id., at 82a-101a, \u00b6\u00b688-161. Manning chose not to bring any claims under federal securities laws or rules. His complaint, however, referred explicitly to Regulation SHO, both describing the purposes of that rule and catalog-ing past accusations against Merrill Lynch for fouting its requirements. See id., at 51a-54a, \u00b6\u00b628-30; 75a-82a, \u00b6\u00b681- 87. And the complaint couched its description of the short selling at issue here in terms suggesting that Merrill Lynch had again violated that regulation, in addition to infringing New Jersey law. See id., at 57a-59a, \u00b6\u00b639-43. Manning brought his complaint in New Jersey state court, but Merrill Lynch removed the case to Federal District Court. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1441 (allowing removal of any civil action of which federal district courts have original jurisdic-tion). Merrill Lynch asserted federal jurisdiction on two grounds. First, it invoked the general federal question stat-ute, \u00a7 1331, which grants district courts jurisdiction of \"all civil actions arising under\" federal law. Second, it main-tained that the suit belonged in federal court by virtue of \u00a7 27 of the Exchange Act. That provision, in relevant part, grants district courts exclusive jurisdiction of \"all suits in Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 379 Opinion of the Court equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regula-tions thereunder.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78aa(a). Manning moved to remand the case to state court, arguing that neither statute gave the federal court authority to adjudicate his collection of state-law claims. The District Court denied his motion. See No. 12-4466 (D NJ, Mar. 18, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a-38a. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, or- dering a remand of the case to state court. See 772 F. 3d 158 (2014). The Third Circuit frst decided that the federal question statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331, did not confer jurisdiction of the suit, because all Manning's claims were \"brought under state law\" and none \"necessarily raised\" a federal issue. 772 F. 3d, at 161, 163. Nor, the court held, did \u00a7 27 of the Exchange Act make the district court the appropriate forum. Relying on this Court's construction of a nearly identical jurisdictional provision, the Court of Appeals found that \u00a7 27 covers only those cases involving the Exchange Act that would satisfy the \"arising under\" test of the federal question statute. See id., at 166-167 (citing Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court of Del. for New Castle Cty., 366 U. S. 656 (1961)). Because the District Court lacked jurisdiction of Manning's suit under \u00a7 1331, so too it was not the exclusive forum under \u00a7 27. Merrill Lynch sought this Court's review solely as to whether \u00a7 27 commits Manning's case to federal court. See Pet. for Cert. i. Because of a Circuit split about that provi-sion's meaning, 1 we granted certiorari. 576 U. S. 1083 (2015). We now affrm. 1 Compare 772 F. 3d 158 (CA3 2014) (case below) with Barbara v. New York Stock Exchange, Inc., 99 F. 3d 49, 55 (CA2 1996) (construing \u00a7 27 more narrowly), Sparta Surgical Corp. v. National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 159 F. 3d 1209, 1211-1212 (CA9 1998) (construing \u00a7 27 more broadly), and Hawkins v. National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 149 F. 3d 330, 331-332 (CA5 1998) (per curiam ) (same). 380 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Opinion of the Court II Like the Third Circuit, we read \u00a7 27 as conferring exclu- sive federal jurisdiction of the same suits as \"aris[e] under\" the Exchange Act pursuant to the general federal question statute. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331. The text of \u00a7 27 more readily supports that meaning than it does either of the par-ties' two alternatives. This Court's precedents interpreting identical statutory language positively compel that conclu-sion. And the construction fts with our practice of reading jurisdictional laws, so long as consistent with their language, to respect the traditional role of state courts in our federal system and to establish clear and administrable rules. A Section 27, as noted earlier, provides federal district courts with exclusive jurisdiction \"of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regulations thereun-der.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78aa(a); see supra, at 378-379. 2 Much the same wording appears in nine other federal jurisdictional provisions\u2014mostly enacted, like \u00a7 27, as part of New Deal-era regulatory statutes. 3 2 Section 27 also grants federal courts exclusive jurisdiction of \"viola- tions of [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regulations thereunder.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78aa(a). Manning argues that the \"violations\" language applies only to criminal proceedings and SEC enforcement actions. See Brief for Respondents 28. Merrill Lynch, although not conceding that much, believes the \"violations\" clause irrelevant here because, in private suits for damages, it goes no further than the \"brought to enforce\" language quoted in the text. See Reply Brief 1, n. 1. Given that both parties have thus taken the \"violations\" language off the table, we do not address its meaning. 3 See Securities Act of 1933, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 77v(a); Federal Power Act of 1935, 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 825p; Connally Hot Oil Act of 1935, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 715i(c); Natural Gas Act of 1938, 15 U. S.

C. \u00a7 80b-14(a); International Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 381 Opinion of the Court Merrill Lynch argues that the \"plain, unambiguous lan- guage\" of \u00a7 27 requires an expansive understanding of its scope. Brief for Petitioners 23. Whenever (says Merrill Lynch) a plaintiff 's complaint either explicitly or implicitly \"assert[s]\" that \"the defendant breached an Exchange Act duty,\" then the suit is \"brought to enforce\" that duty and a federal court has exclusive jurisdiction. Id., at 22; Reply Brief 10-11; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8 (confrming that such allegations need not be express). That is so, Merrill Lynch contends, even if the plaintiff, as in this case, brings only state-law claims in his complaint\u2014that is, seeks relief solely under state law. See Reply Brief 3-6. And it is so, Merrill Lynch continues, even if the plaintiff can prevail on those claims without proving that the alleged breach of an Ex-change Act duty\u2014here, the violation of Regulation SHO\u2014 actually occurred. See id., at 7-13; Tr. of Oral Arg. 3 (\"[T]he words `brought to enforce' [do not focus] on what the court would necessarily have to decide\"). But a natural reading of \u00a7 27's text does not extend so far. \"Brought\" in this context means \"commenced,\" Black's Law Dictionary 254 (3d ed. 1933); \"to\" is a word \"expressing pur- pose \"give force [or] effect to,\" 1 Web-ster's New International Dictionary of the English Lan-guage 725 (1927). So \u00a7 27 confers federal jurisdiction when an action is commenced in order to give effect to an Ex-change Act requirement. That language, in emphasizing what the suit is designed to accomplish, stops short of em-bracing any complaint that happens to mention a duty estab-lished by the Exchange Act. Consider, for example, a sim-ple state-law action for breach of contract, in which the plaintiff alleges, for atmospheric reasons, that the defend-ant's conduct also violated the Exchange Act\u2014or still less, that the defendant is a bad actor who infringed that statute Wheat Agreement Act of 1949, 7 U. S. C. \u00a7 1642(e); Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act of 1968, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1719. 382 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Opinion of the Court on another occasion. On Merrill Lynch's view, \u00a7 27 would cover that suit; indeed, Merrill Lynch points to just such inci-dental assertions as the basis for federal jurisdiction here. See Brief for Petitioners 20-21; supra, at 378. But that hy- pothetical suit is \"brought to enforce\" state contract law, not the Exchange Act\u2014because the plaintiff can get all the relief he seeks just by showing the breach of an agreement, with-out proving any violation of federal securities law. The suit, that is, can achieve all it is supposed to even if issues involv-ing the Exchange Act never come up. Critiquing Merrill Lynch's position on similar grounds, Manning proposes a far more restrictive interpretation of \u00a7 27's language\u2014one going beyond what he needs to prevail. See Brief for Respondents 27-33. According to Manning, a suit is \"brought to enforce\" the Exchange Act's duties or lia-bilities only if it is brought directly under that statute\u2014that is, only if the claims it asserts (and not just the duties it means to vindicate) are created by the Exchange Act. On that view, everything depends (as Justice Holmes famously said in another jurisdictional context) on which law \"creates the cause of action.\" American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916). If a complaint asserts a right of action deriving from the Exchange Act (or an asso-ciated regulation), the suit must proceed in federal court. But if, as here, the complaint brings only state-created claims, then the case belongs in a state forum. And that is so, Manning claims, even if\u2014contrary to what the Third Cir-cuit held below\u2014the success of the state claim necessarily hinges on proving that the defendant breached an Exchange Act duty. See Brief for Respondents 31. Manning's view of the text's requirements, although better than Merrill Lynch's, veers too far in the opposite direction. There is no doubt, as Manning says, that a suit asserting an Exchange Act cause of action fts within \u00a7 27's scope: Bring-ing such a suit is the prototypical way of enforcing an Ex-change Act duty. But it is not the only way. On rare occa-Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 383 Opinion of the Court sions, as just suggested, a suit raising a state-law claim rises or falls on the plaintiff's ability to prove the violation of a federal duty. See, e. g., Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 314-315 (2005); Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U. S. 180, 201 (1921). If in that manner, a state-law action necessarily de-pends on a showing that the defendant breached the Ex-change Act, then that suit could also fall within \u00a7 27's com-pass. Suppose, for example, that a state statute simply makes illegal \"any violation of the Exchange Act involving naked short selling.\" A plaintiff seeking relief under that state law must undertake to prove, as the cornerstone of his suit, that the defendant infringed a requirement of the fed-eral statute. (Indeed, in this hypothetical, that is the plain-tiff 's only project.) Accordingly, his suit, even though as- serting a state-created claim, is also \"brought to enforce\" a duty created by the Exchange Act. An existing jurisdictional test well captures both classes of suits \"brought to enforce\" such a duty. As noted earlier, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331 provides federal jurisdiction of all civil ac-tions \"arising under\" federal law. See supra, at 378. This Court has found that statutory term satisfed in either of two circumstances. Most directly, and most often, federal jurisdiction attaches when federal law creates the cause of action asserted. That set of cases is what Manning high-lights in offering his view of \u00a7 27. But even when \"a claim fnds its origins\" in state law, there is \"a special and small category of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still lies.\" Gunn v. Minton, 568 U. S. 251, 258 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). As this Court has explained, a federal court has jurisdiction of a state-law claim if it \"neces-sarily raise[s] a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance\" of federal and state power. Grable , 545 U. S., at 314; see Gunn, 568 U. S., at 258 (framing the same standard as a four-part test). 384 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Opinion of the Court That description typically fts cases, like those described just above, in which a state-law cause of action is \"brought to enforce\" a duty created by the Exchange Act because the claim's very success depends on giving effect to a federal requirement. Accordingly, we agree with the court below that \u00a7 27's jurisdictional test matches the one we have formu-lated for \u00a7 1331, as applied to cases involving the Exchange Act. If (but only if) such a case meets the \"arising under\" standard, \u00a7 27 commands that it go to federal court. 4 Merrill Lynch objects that our rule construes \"completely different language\"\u2014i. e., the phrases \"arising under\" and 4 The concurrence adopts a slightly different approach, placing in federal court Exchange Act claims plus all state-law claims necessarily raising an Exchange Act issue. See post, at 394-396 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). In other words, the concurrence would not ask, as the \"aris- ing under\" test does, whether the federal issue embedded in such a state-law claim is also substantial, actually disputed, and capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the congressionally approved federal-state balance. See post, at 398-399; Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 314 (2005). But this Court has not construed any jurisdictional statute, whether using the words \"brought to enforce\" or \"arising under\" (or for that matter, any other), to draw the concurrence's line. For as long as we have contemplated exer-cising federal jurisdiction over state-law claims necessarily raising federal issues, we have inquired as well into whether those issues are \"really and substantially\" disputed. See, e. g., Hopkins v. Walker, 244 U. S. 486, 489 (1917); Shulthis v. McDougal, 225 U. S. 561, 569 (1912). And similarly, we have long emphasized the need in such circumstances to make \"sensitive judgments about congressional intent, judicial power, and the federal sys-tem.\" Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 810 (1986). At this late juncture, we see no virtue in trying to pull apart these interconnected strands of necessity and substantiality-plus. In-deed, doing so here\u2014and thus creating a gap \"brought to enforce\" and \"arising under\" standards\u2014would confict with this Court's precedent and undermine important goals of interpreting jurisdictional statutes. See infra, at 385-389 (discussing our prior decisions equating the two tests), 389-393 (highlighting the need to respect state courts and the benefts of using a single, time-tested standard). Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 385 Opinion of the Court \"brought to enforce\" in \u00a7 1331 and \u00a7 27, respectively\u2014\"to mean exactly the same thing.\" Reply Brief 7. We cannot deny that point. But we think it far less odd than Merrill Lynch does. After all, the test for \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction is not grounded in that provision's particular phrasing. This Court has long read the words \"arising under\" in Article III to extend quite broadly, \"to all cases in which a federal ques-tion is `an ingredient' of the action.\" Merrell Dow Pharma- ceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 807 (1986) (quoting Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 823 (1824)). In the statutory context, however, we opted to give those same words a narrower scope \"in the light of [\u00a7 1331's] his-tory[,] the demands of reason and coherence, and the dictates of sound judicial policy.\" Romero v. International Termi- nal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 379 (1959). Because the resulting test does not turn on \u00a7 1331's text, there is nothing remarkable in its ftting as, or even more, neatly a differently worded statutory provision. Nor can Merrill Lynch claim that Congress's use of the new \"brought to enforce\" language in \u00a7 27 shows an intent to depart from a settled (even if linguistically ungrounded) test for statutory \"arising under\" jurisdiction. That is be-cause no such well-defned test then existed. As we re-cently noted, our caselaw construing \u00a7 1331 was for when the Exchange Act passed\u2014highly \"unruly.\" Gunn, 568 U. S., at 258 (referring to the \"canvas\" of our old opinions as \"look[ing] like one that Jackson Pollock got to frst\"). Against that muddled backdrop, it is impossi-ble to infer that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 27, wished to depart from what we now understand as the \"arising under\" standard. B This Court has reached the same conclusion before. In two unrelated decisions, we addressed the \"brought to en-force\" language at issue here. See Pan American, 366 U. S. 386 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Opinion of the Court 656; Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U. S. 367 (1996). Each time, we viewed that phrase as coexten- sive with our construction of \"arising under.\" Pan American involved \u00a7 22 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 717u\u2014an exclusive jurisdiction provision containing language materially indistinguishable from \u00a7 27's. 5 The case began in state court when a natural gas purchaser sued a producer for breach of a contract setting sale prices. Prior to the alleged breach, the producer had fled those con-tractual rates with the Federal Power Commission, as the NGA required. Relying on that submission (which the com-plaint did not mention), the producer claimed that the buy-er's suit was \"brought to enforce\" a liability deriving from the NGA\u2014i. e., a fled rate\u2014and so must proceed in federal court. See 366 U. S., at 662. This Court rejected the argument. Our decision explained that \u00a7 22's use of the term \"brought to enforce,\" rather than \"arising under,\" made no difference to the jurisdictional analysis. The inquiry, we wrote, was \"not affected by want\" of the language contained in the fed-eral question statute. Id., at 665, n. 2. The \"limitation[s]\" associated with \"arising under\" jurisdiction, we continued, were \"clearly implied\" in \u00a7 22's alternative phrasing. Ibid. In short, the linguistic distinction between the two jurisdic-tional provisions did not extend to their meaning. Pan American thus went on to analyze the jurisdictional issue in the manner set out in our \"arising under\" prece-dents. Federal question jurisdiction lies, the Court wrote, only if \"it appears from the face of the complaint that deter-mination of the suit depends upon a question of federal law.\" Id., at 663. That inquiry focuses on \"the particular claims a suitor makes\" in his complaint\u2014meaning, whether the plain- 5 Section 22 grants federal courts exclusive jurisdiction \"of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by . . . [the NGA] or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.\" 52 Stat. 833. Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 387 Opinion of the Court tiff seeks relief under state or federal law. Id., at 662. In addition, the Court suggested, a federal court could adjudi- cate a suit stating only a state-law claim if it included as \"an element, and an essential one,\" the violation of a federal right. Id., at 663 (quoting Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Me- ridian, 299 U. S. 109, 112 (1936)). With those principles of \"arising under\" jurisdiction laid out, the Court held that \u00a7 22 did not enable a federal court to resolve the buyer's case, because he could prevail merely by proving breach of the contract. See 366 U. S., at 663-665. Pan American estab- lishes, then, that an action \"brought to enforce\" a duty or liability created by a federal statute is nothing more (and nothing less) than an action \"arising under\" that law. Merrill Lynch reads Pan American more narrowly, as holding only that \u00a7 22 does not confer federal jurisdiction when a complaint (unlike Manning's) fails to reference fed-eral law at all. See Brief for Petitioners 32-33, 38. But that argument ignores Pan American's express statement of equivalence between \u00a7 27's language and the federal question statute's: \"Brought to enforce\" has the same \"limitation[s]\" (meaning, the same scope) as \"arising under.\" 366 U. S., at 665, n. 2. And just as important, Merrill Lynch disregards Pan American's analytical structure: The decision proceeds by reviewing this Court's \"arising under\" precedents, articu-lating the principles animating that caselaw, and then apply-ing those tenets to the dispute at hand. Id., at 662-665. The Court thus showed (as well as told) that \"brought to enforce\" jurisdiction mirrors that of \"arising under.\" As a fallback, Merrill Lynch claims that Pan American is irrelevant here because it relied on legislative history dis-tinct to the NGA in for Peti-tioners 38-39. The premise of that argument is true enough: In support of its holding, the Court quoted a Com-mittee Report describing \u00a7 22 as conferring federal jurisdic-tion \"over cases arising under the act.\" 366 U. S., at 665, 388 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Opinion of the Court n. 2. But we cannot accept the conclusion Merrill Lynch draws from that statement: that courts should give two iden- tically worded statutory provisions, passed less than fve years apart, markedly different meanings. Indeed, the re-sult of Merrill Lynch's approach is still odder, for what of the eight other jurisdictional provisions containing \"brought to enforce\" language? See n. 3, supra. Presumably, Merrill Lynch would have courts inspect each of their legislative his-tories to decide whether to read those statutes as reproduc-ing the \"arising under\" standard, adopting Merrill Lynch's alternative view, or demanding yet another jurisdictional test. We are hard pressed to imagine a less sensible way of construing the repeated iterations of the phrase \"brought to enforce\" in the jurisdictional provisions of the Federal Code. In any event, this Court in Matsushita addressed \u00a7 27 it- self, and once again equated the \"brought to enforce\" and \"arising under\" standards. That decision arose from a state-law action against corporate directors for breach of f-duciary duty. The issue was whether the state court han-dling the suit could approve a settlement releasing, in addi-tion to the state claims actually brought, potential Exchange Act claims that \u00a7 27 would have committed to federal court. In deciding that the state court could do so, we described \u00a7 27\u2014not once, not twice, but three times\u2014as conferring ex-clusive jurisdiction of suits \"arising under\" the Exchange Act. See 516 U. S., at 380 (Section 27 \"confers exclusive ju-risdiction upon the federal courts for suits arising under the [Exchange] Act\"); id., at 381 (Section 27 \"prohibits state courts from adjudicating claims arising under the Exchange Act\"); id., at 385 (Section 27 \"prohibit[s] state courts from exercising jurisdiction over suits arising under the Ex- change Act\") (emphases added). Over and over, then, the Court took as a given that \u00a7 27's jurisdictional test mimicked the one in the general federal question statute. And still more: The Matsushita Court thought clear that the suit as fled\u2014which closely resembled Manning's in its Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 389 Opinion of the Court mix of state and federal law\u2014fell outside \u00a7 27's grant of ex- clusive jurisdiction. As just noted, the claims brought in the Matsushita complaint sought relief for breach of a state-law duty. But in support of those claims, the plaintiffs charged, much as Manning did here, that the defendants' conduct also violated federal securities laws. See 516 U. S., at 370; supra, at 378. We found the presence of that accusation in- suffcient to trigger \u00a7 27. \"[T]he cause pleaded,\" we wrote, remained \"a state common-law action,\" 516 U. S., at 382, n. 7: Notwithstanding the potential federal issue, the suit \"was not `brought to enforce' any rights or obligations under the [Exchange] Act,\" id., at 381. The Court thus rejected the very position Merrill Lynch takes here\u2014i. e., that \u00a7 27 pre-cludes a state court from adjudicating any case, even if brought under state law, in which the plaintiff asserts an Exchange Act breach. C Construing \u00a7 27, consistent with both text and precedent, to cover suits that arise under the Exchange Act serves the goals we have consistently underscored in interpreting juris-dictional statutes. Our reading, unlike Merrill Lynch's, gives due deference to the important role of state courts in our federal system. And the standard we adopt is more straightforward and administrable than the alternative Mer-rill Lynch offers. Out of respect for state courts, this Court has time and again declined to construe federal jurisdictional statutes more expansively than their language, most fairly read, re-quires. We have reiterated the need to give \"[d]ue regard [to] the rightful independence of state governments\"\u2014and more particularly, to the power of the States \"to provide for the determination of controversies in their courts.\" Ro- mero , 358 U. S., at 380 (quoting Healy v. Ratta, 292 U. S. 263, 270 (1934)); Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U. S. 100, 109 (1941). Our decisions, as we once put the point, refect a \"deeply felt and traditional reluctance . . . to expand 390 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Opinion of the Court the jurisdiction of the federal courts through a broad reading of jurisdictional statutes.\" Romero , 358 U. S., at 379.6 That interpretive stance serves, among other things, to keep state-law actions like Manning's in state court, and thus to help maintain the constitutional balance between state and federal judiciaries. Nor does this Court's concern for state court prerogatives disappear, as Merrill Lynch suggests it should, in the face of a statute granting exclusive federal jurisdiction. See Brief for Petitioners 23-27. To the contrary, when a statute man-dates, rather than permits, federal jurisdiction\u2014thus depriv-ing state courts of all ability to adjudicate certain claims\u2014 our reluctance to endorse \"broad reading[s],\" Romero , 358 U. S., at 379, if anything, grows stronger. And that is espe- cially so when, as here, the construction offered would place in federal court actions bringing only claims created by state law\u2014even if those claims might raise federal issues. To be sure, a grant of exclusive federal jurisdiction, as Merrill Lynch reminds us, indicates that Congress wanted \"greater uniformity of construction and more effective and expert ap-plication\" of federal law than usual. Brief for Petitioners 24 (quoting Matsushita, 516 U. S., at 383). But \"greater\" and \"more\" do not mean \"total,\" and the critical question remains how far such a grant extends. In resolving that issue, we will not lightly read the statute to alter the usual consti-tutional balance, as it would by sending actions with all state-law claims to federal court just because a complaint references a federal duty. Our precedents construing other exclusive grants of fed- eral jurisdiction illustrate those principles. In Pan Ameri- can, for example, we denied that a state court's resolution of 6 The Romero Court continued: \"A reluctance which must be even more forcefully felt when the expansion is proposed, for the frst time, eighty- three years after the jurisdiction has been conferred.\" 358 U. S., at 379. The Exchange Act was passed a mere 82 years ago, but we believe the point still stands. Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 391 Opinion of the Court state-law claims potentially implicating the NGA's meaning would \"jeopardize the uniform system of regulation\" that the statute established. 366 U. S., at 665. We reasoned that this Court's ability to review state court decisions of federal questions would suffciently protect federal interests. And similarly, in Taffin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 464-467 (1990), we permitted state courts to adjudicate civil RICO actions that might raise issues about the scope of federal crimes al-leged as predicate acts, even though federal courts have ex-clusive jurisdiction \"of all offenses against the laws of the United States,\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3231. There, we expressed con- fdence that state courts would look to federal court interpre-tations of the relevant criminal statutes. Accordingly, we saw \"no signifcant danger of inconsistent application of fed-eral criminal law\" and no \"incompatibility with federal inter-ests.\" Taffin, 493 U. S., at 464-465, 467 (internal quotation marks omitted). So too here, when state courts, in deciding state-law claims, address possible issues of the Exchange Act's mean-ing. Not even Merrill Lynch thinks those decisions wholly avoidable: It admits that \u00a7 27 does nothing to prevent state courts from resolving Exchange Act questions that result from defenses or counterclaims. See Brief for Petitioners 32-33; Pan American, 366 U. S., at 664-665. We see little difference, in terms of the uniformity-based policies Merrill Lynch invokes, if those issues instead appear in a complaint like Manning's. And indeed, Congress likely contemplated that some complaints intermingling state and federal ques-tions would be brought in state court: After all, Congress specifcally affrmed the capacity of such courts to hear state-law securities actions, which predictably raise issues coincid-ing, overlapping, or intersecting with those under the Act itself. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78bb(a)(2); Matsushita, 516 U. S., at 383. So, for example, it is hardly surprising in a suit like this one, alleging short sales in violation of state securities law, that a plaintiff might say the defendant previously breached 392 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Opinion of the Court a federal prohibition of similar conduct. See supra, at 378 (describing Manning's complaint). And it is less troubling for a state court to consider such an issue than to lose all ability to adjudicate a suit raising only state-law causes of action. Reading \u00a7 27 in line with our \u00a7 1331 caselaw also promotes \"administrative simplicity[, which] is a major virtue in a ju-risdictional statute.\" Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. 77, 94 (2010). Both judges and litigants are familiar with the \"arising under\" standard and how it works. For the most part, that test provides ready answers to jurisdictional ques-tions. And an existing body of precedent gives guidance whenever borderline cases crop up. See supra, at 383-384. By contrast, no one has experience with Merrill Lynch's alter-native standard, which would spring out of nothing to govern suits involving not only the Exchange Act but up to nine other discrete spheres of federal law. See n. 3, supra (list- ing statutes with \"brought to enforce\" language); supra, at 387-388 (noting Merrill Lynch's backup claim that legislative histories might compel different tests for different statutes). Adopting such an untested approach, and forcing courts to toggle back and forth between it and the \"arising under\" standard, would undermine consistency and predictability in litigation. That result disserves courts and parties alike. Making matters worse, Merrill Lynch's rule is simple for plaintiffs to avoid\u2014or else, excruciating for courts to police. Under that rule, a plaintiff electing to bring state-law claims in state court will purge his complaint of any references to federal securities law, so as to escape removal. Such omis-sions, after all, will do nothing to change the way the plain-tiff can present his case at trial; they will merely make the complaint less informative. Recognizing the potential for that kind of avoidance, Merrill Lynch argues that a judge should go behind the face of a complaint to determine whether it is the product of \"artful pleading.\" See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 (If the plaintiffs \"had just literally whited out, deleted the references to Reg[ulation] SHO,\" the court Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 393 Thomas, J., concurring in judgment should still understand the complaint to allege a breach of that rule; \"the fact [that the plaintiffs] didn't cite it wouldn't change the fact\"). We have no idea how a court would make that judgment, and get cold comfort from Merrill Lynch's assurance that the question would arise not in this case but in \"the next third, fourth, ffth case down the road.\" Id., at 8. Jurisdictional tests are built for more than a single dispute: That Merrill Lynch's threatens to become either a useless drafting rule or a tortuous inquiry into artful plead-ing is one more good reason to reject it. III Section 27 provides exclusive federal jurisdiction of the same class of cases as \"arise under\" the Exchange Act for purposes of \u00a7 1331. The text of \u00a7 27, most naturally read, supports that rule. This Court has adopted the same view in two prior cases. And that reading of the statute pro-motes the twin goals, important in interpreting jurisdic-tional grants, of respecting state courts and providing ad-ministrable standards. Our holding requires remanding Manning's suit to state court. The Third Circuit found that the District Court did not have jurisdiction of Manning's suit under \u00a7 1331 because all his claims sought relief under state law and none neces-sarily raised a federal issue. See supra, at 379. Merrill Lynch did not challenge that ruling, and we therefore take it as a given. And that means, under our decision today, that the District Court also lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 27. Accordingly, we affrm the judgment below. It is so ordered. Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, concurring in the judgment. The Court concludes that respondents' suit belongs in state court because it does not satisfy the multifactor, atex-tual standard that we have used to assess whether a suit is 394 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Thomas, J., concurring in judgment one \"arising under\" federal law, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331. Ante, at 393. I agree that this suit belongs in state court, but I would rest that conclusion on the statute before us, \u00a7 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78aa. That statute does not use the phrase \"arising under\" or pro-vide a sound basis for adopting the arising-under standard. It instead provides federal jurisdiction where a suit is \"brought to enforce\" Exchange Act requirements. \u00a7 78aa(a). That language establishes a straightforward test: If a com-plaint alleges a claim that necessarily depends on a breach of a requirement created by the Act, \u00a7 27 confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over that suit. Because the complaint here does not allege such claims\u2014and because no other stat-ute confers federal jurisdiction\u2014this suit should return to state court. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment. I A Section 27 provides that \"[t]he district courts . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction . . . of all suits in equity and ac-tions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.\" \u00a7 78aa(a).* As the Court explains, under a \"natural read-ing,\" \u00a7 27 \"confers federal jurisdiction when an action is com-menced in order to give effect to an Exchange Act require-ment.\" Ante, at 381; see also Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language 725 (1927) (\"enforce\" means \"give force to\" or \"give effect to\"). And by providing \"exclusive jurisdiction\" to federal district courts over certain suits, \u00a7 27 strips state courts of jurisdiction over such suits. Put differently, under \u00a7 27 a suit belongs in federal court when the complaint requires a court to enforce an Exchange *As the Court explains, the parties have not pressed us to construe \u00a7 27's language conferring jurisdiction over \"violations\" of the Exchange Act, its rules, or its regulations. See ante, at 380, n. 2. Like the Court, I focus on \u00a7 27's \"brought to enforce\" language. Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 395 Thomas, J., concurring in judgment Act duty or liability. In contrast, a suit belongs in state court when the complaint \"assert[s] purely state-law causes of action\" that do not require \"binding legal determinations of rights and liabilities under the Exchange Act\" or \"a judg-ment on the merits of\" an Exchange Act breach. Matsu- shita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516 U. S. 367, 382, 384 (1996). Such a suit is \"not `brought to enforce' any rights or obligations under the Act,\" and thus does not fall within \u00a7 27's scope. Id., at 381. So \u00a7 27 does not provide federal jurisdiction over suits brought to enforce liabilities or duties under state law or over every case that happens to involve allegations that the Act was violated. The provision leaves state courts with some authority over suits involving the Act or its regulations. The statutory context bolsters this understanding. That context confrms that Congress reserved some authority to state courts to adjudicate securities-law matters. Although the Act provides numerous federal \"rights and remedies,\" it also generally preserves \"all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity,\" such as claims that could be litigated in state courts of general jurisdiction. 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 78bb(a)(2). That provision shows that \"Congress plainly contemplated the possibility of dual litigation in state and federal courts relating to securities transactions.\" Matsu- shita, supra, at 383. A natural reading of \u00a7 27's text pre- serves the dual role for federal and state courts that Con-gress contemplated, and it confrms that mere allegations of Exchange Act breaches do not alone deprive state courts of jurisdiction. A natural reading promotes the uniform interpretation of the federal securities laws that Congress sought to ensure when it gave federal courts \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over fed-eral securities-law suits. \u00a7 78aa(a). The uniformity because it leaves to federal courts\u2014which are presumptively more familiar with the intricate federal securities laws\u2014the task of \"adjudicat[ing] . . . Exchange Act 396 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Thomas, J., concurring in judgment claims.\" Matsushita, 516 U. S., at 383. When state courts decide cases where the complaint pleads only state-law claims and do not resolve the merits of Exchange Act rights or liabilities, they are not \"trespass[ing] upon the exclusive territory of the federal courts.\" Id., at 382. The statutory text and structure thus support a straight- forward test: Section 27 confers federal jurisdiction over a case if the complaint alleges claims that necessarily depend on establishing a breach of an Exchange Act requirement. B The Third Circuit was correct to remand this suit to state court. Respondents' complaint does not seek \"to enforce any liability or duty created by\" the Exchange Act or its regulations. \u00a7 78aa(a). Although respondents' complaint alleges at different places that petitioners violated the Exchange Act or its regu-lations, the complaint does not bring claims requiring en-forcement of the Exchange Act or its regulations. The com-plaint instead brings 10 state-law causes of action that seek to enforce duties and liabilities created by state law. Count 2 alleges that petitioners violated state law by investing money derived from racketeering. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 91a-93a, Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6114-122 (citing N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:41-2a (West 2005)). Counts 3 through 9 al-lege standard state-law contract and tort claims: unjust en-richment, unlawful interference with economic advantage, tortious interference with contractual relations, unlawful in-terference with contractual relations, third-party-benefciary claims, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and negligence. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 93a-101a, Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6123-158. Count 10 pleads a free-standing claim for punitive and exemplary damages. See id., at 101a, Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6159-161. None of these claims requires a court to \"enforce\"\u2014to give effect to\u2014a re-quirement created by the Act, thus, \u00a7 27 does not confer fed-eral jurisdiction over them. Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 397 Thomas, J., concurring in judgment Count 1 presents a closer call, but it too does not trigger federal jurisdiction. That count pleads that petitioners vio- lated a state law that makes it unlawful for a person to participate in a racketeering enterprise. Id., at 82a-90a, Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b688-113 (citing N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:41-2c). The alleged racketeering includes violating the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law (through fraud, decep-tion, and misappropriation), committing \"theft by taking\" under state law, and committing \"theft by deception\" under state law. App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a-90a, Amended Com-plaint \u00b6\u00b688-113. Respondents allege that \"[t]he SEC has expressly noted that naked short selling involves the omis-sion of a material fact\" as part of their state-law securities fraud allegation. Id., at 85a, Amended Complaint \u00b6100. Vindicating that claim would not require the enforcement of a federal duty or liability. New Jersey law encompasses fraudulent conduct that does not necessarily rest on a viola-tion of federal law or regulation. See, e. g., \u00a7 49:3-49(e)(1) (West 2001) (fraud and deceit include \"[a]ny misrepresenta-tion by word, conduct or in any manner of any material fact, either present or past, and any omission to disclose any such fact\"); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a-86a (invoking \u00a7 49:3-49 et seq.). So although count 1 refers to the Securities and Exchange Commission's view about naked short selling, that count does not require respondents to establish a violation of federal securities law to prevail on their fraud claim. Be-cause respondents' cause of action in count 1 seeks to enforce duties and liabilities created by state law and does not neces-sarily depend on the breach of an Exchange Act duty or lia-bility, \u00a7 27 does not provide federal jurisdiction over that claim. II Although the Court acknowledges the \"natural reading\" of \u00a7 27, ante, at 381, it holds that \u00a7 27 adopts the jurisdictional test that this Court uses to evaluate federal-question juris-diction under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331. See ante, at 383-385; see also ante, at 385-393. Federal courts have the power to re-398 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Thomas, J., concurring in judgment view cases \"arising under\" federal law, \u00a7 1331, including those in which the complaint brings state-law claims that \"necessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain with-out disturbing any congressionally approved balance of fed-eral and state judicial responsibilities.\" Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 314 (2005). The Court wrongly equates the phrase \"arising under\" in \u00a7 1331 with the phrase \"brought to en-force\" in \u00a7 27, and interprets the latter to require that a case raising state-law claims \"mee[t] the `arising under' standard\" for that case to proceed in federal court. Ante, at 384; see ante, at 383-385. None of the Court's rationales for adopt- ing that rule is persuasive. A The Court frst argues that \"it is impossible to infer that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 27, wished to depart from what we now understand as the `arising under' standard\" because there was no \"well-defned test\" to depart from. Ante, at 385. The Court's case law construing \u00a7 1331, the Court ex- plains, Ex-change Act passed\u2014highly unruly.\" Ibid. (internal quota- tion marks omitted). But when Congress enacts a statute that uses different language from a prior statute, we normally presume that Congress did so to convey a different meaning. See, e. g., Crawford v. Burke , 195 U. S. 176, 190 (1904) (explaining that \"a change in phraseology creates a presumption of a change in intent\" and that \"Congress would not have used such dif-ferent language [in two statutes] without thereby intending a change of meaning\"). Given what we know about \u00a7 1331, that presumption has force here. Our \u00a7 1331 case law was, as the Court notes, \"highly unruly\" when the Exchange Act was enacted in 1934. Given the importance of clarity in ju-risdictional statutes, see Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. 77, Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 399 Thomas, J., concurring in judgment 94 (2010), it is quite a stretch to infer that Congress wished to embrace such an unpredictable test. That is especially true given that \u00a7 27 does not use words supporting the convoluted arising-under standard. Section 27 does not ask (for example) whether a federal issue is sub-stantial or whether a ruling on that issue will upset the con-gressionally approved balance of federal and state power. Indeed, \u00a7 1331 itself does not even use words supporting the arising-under standard. See ante, at 385 (acknowledging that the arising-under standard \"does not turn on \u00a7 1331's text\"). Rather, the Court has refused to give full effect to \u00a7 1331's \"broa[d] phras[ing]\" and has instead \"continuously construed and limited\" that provision based on extratextual considerations, such as \"history,\" \"the demands of reason and coherence,\" and \"sound judicial policy.\" Romero v. Interna- tional Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 379 (1959). Faced with a plain and focused text like \u00a7 27, however, we should not rely on such considerations. And importing fac-tors from our \u00a7 1331 arising-under jurisprudence\u2014such as a substantiality requirement and a federal-state balance re-quirement\u2014risks narrowing the class of cases that Congress meant to cover with \u00a7 27's plain text. For these reasons, it is unwise to read into \u00a7 27 a decision to adopt the arising-under standard. B The Court next relies on two prior decisions\u2014Pan Ameri- can Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court of Del. for New Cas- tle Cty., 366 U. S. 656 (1961), and Matsushita, 516 U. S. 367. See ante, at 386-389. Neither case justifes the Court's de- cision to apply the arising-under standard to \u00a7 27. In Pan American, the Court held that Delaware state courts had jurisdiction over state-law contract claims that arose from contracts for the sale of natural gas. 366 U. S., at 662-665. The Court reached that decision even though a provision of the Natural Gas Act provided exclusive federal jurisdiction over suits \" `brought to enforce any liability or 400 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Thomas, J., concurring in judgment duty created by' \" that Act. Id., at 662 (quoting statute). Pan American lends some support to the Court's view today. It applied the Court's arising-under precedents and \"ex- plained that [the Natural Gas Act's] use of the term `brought to enforce,' rather than `arising under,' made no difference to the jurisdictional analysis.\" Ante, at 386; see Pan Amer- ican, supra, at 665, n. 2; see also ante, at 386-389. But Pan American does not require the Court to engraft the arising-under standard onto \u00a7 27. Pan American did not carefully analyze the Natural Gas Act's text or assess the contemporary meaning of the central phrase \"brought to enforce.\" Instead, the Court relied on legislative history, reasoning that \"authoritative [congressional] Committee Re-ports\" implied a limitation on the Natural Gas Act's jurisdic-tional text. 366 U. S., at 665, n. 2. That reasoning does not warrant our respect. That is especially true because Pan American's holding is consistent with the Natural Gas Act's \"brought to enforce\" language. The complaint in that case did not \"asser[t]\" any \"right . . . under the Natural Gas Act\" and instead asked the court to adjudicate standard state-law \"contract or quasi-contract\" claims. Id., at 663, 664. The Court's disposition in Pan American rests as comfortably on the statutory text as it does on the arising-under standard. Matsushita provides even less support for the Court's holding today. In that case the Court held that Delaware courts could issue a judgment approving a settlement releas-ing securities-law claims even though the settlement re-leased claims that were (by virtue of \u00a7 27) \"solely within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.\" 516 U. S., at 375; see id., at 370-372. The Court explained that, \"[w]hile \u00a7 27 prohib-its state courts from adjudicating claims arising under the Exchange Act, it does not prohibit state courts from approv-ing the release of Exchange Act claims in the settlement of suits over which they have properly exercised jurisdiction, i. e., suits arising under state law or under federal law for which there is concurrent jurisdiction.\" Id., at 381. Be-Cite as: 578 U. S. 374 (2016) 401 Thomas, J., concurring in judgment cause the complaint in that case \"assert[ed] purely state-law causes of action\" and the state courts did not issue \"a judg-ment on the merits of the [exclusively federal] claims,\" \u00a7 27 did not deprive state courts of jurisdiction. Id., at 382. The Court relies on Matsushita because in that case we three times \"described\" \u00a7 27 \"as conferring exclusive juris-diction of suits `arising under' the Exchange Act.\" Ante, at 388 (citing 516 U. S., at 380, 381, 385). But Matsushita did not decide whether \u00a7 27 adopts the arising-under standard, so its passing use of the phrase \"arising under\" cannot bear the weight that the Court now places on it. To be sure, Matsushita does support the Court's judgment today: Mat- sushita emphasized that state courts could adjudicate a suit involving securities-law issues where the complaint \"as-sert[ed] purely state-law causes of action\" and did not re-quire the state courts to issue \"binding legal determinations of rights and liabilities under the Exchange Act\" or \"a judg-ment on the merits of\" an Exchange Act breach. Id., at 382, 384. But those statements are more consistent with \u00a7 27's text than they are with the arising-under standard. See supra, at 394-396 (invoking Matsushita). C Finally, the Court argues that its interpretation \"serves the goals\" that our precedents have \"consistently under-scored in interpreting jurisdictional statutes\"\u2014affording proper deference to state courts and promoting administra-ble jurisdictional rules. Ante, at 389; see ante , at 389-393. But hewing to \u00a7 27's text serves these goals as well as or better than does adopting the arising-under standard. First, the text-based view preserves state courts' author- ity to adjudicate numerous securities-law claims and provide relief consistent with the Exchange Act's design. See supra, at 394-396. As explained above, that view places all of respondents' state-law causes of action in state court. See supra, at 396-397. The text-based view thus \"decline[s] 402 MERRIL L L YNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INC. v. MANNING Thomas, J., concurring in judgment to construe [a] federal jurisdictional statut[e] more expan- sively than [its] language, most fairly read, requires.\" Ante, at 389. Second, the textual test is also more administrable than the arising-under standard. The arising-under standard \"is anything but clear.\" Grable , 545 U. S., at 321 (Thomas, J., concurring). The standard involves numerous judgments about matters of degree that are not readily susceptible to bright lines. As noted, to satisfy that standard, a state-law claim must raise a federal issue that is (among other things) \"actually disputed,\" is \"substantial,\" and will not \"distur[b]\" a congressionally approved federal-state \"balance.\" Id., at 314 (opinion of the Court). The standard \"calls for a `common-sense accommodation of judgment to [the] kaleidoscopic situ-ations' that present a federal issue, in `a selective process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside.' \" Id., at 313 (quoting Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109, 117-118 (1936)). The arising-under standard may be many things, but it is not one that consistently \"provides ready answers\" to hard jurisdic-tional questions. Ante, at 392. The text-based view prom- ises better. I would adopt that view and apply it here. * * * For these reasons, I concur in the judgment. OCTOBER TERM, 2015 403 Syllabus ZUBIK et al. v. BURWELL, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit No. 14-1418. Argued March 23, 2016\u2014Decided May 16, 2016* Federal regulations require petitioners, primarily nonproft organizations, to cover certain contraceptives as part of the health plans they provide to their employees unless they submit a form to their insurer or the Federal Government stating that they object to such coverage on reli-gious grounds. Petitioners allege that the notice requirement substan-tially burdens the exercise of their religion in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. Following oral argument, this Court requested supplemental briefng addressing \"whether contraceptive coverage could be provided to petitioners' employees, through petition-ers' insurance companies, without any such notice from petitioners.\" Both petitioners and the Government confrmed the feasibility of such an option. Held: The judgments below are vacated, and the cases are remanded to their respective Courts of Appeals. On remand, the parties should be afforded an opportunity to arrive at an approach that accommodates petitioners' religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners' health plans receive full and equal cover-age that includes contraceptive coverage.

BURWELL Per Curiam exercise is not infringed where they \"need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception,\" even if their em-ployees receive cost-free contraceptive coverage from the same insurance company. Supplemental Brief for Petition-ers 4. The Government has confrmed that the challenged procedures \"for employers with insured plans could be modi-fed to operate in the manner posited in the Court's order while still ensuring that the affected women receive contra-ceptive coverage seamlessly, together with the rest of their health coverage.\" Supplemental Brief for Respondents 14-15. In light of the positions asserted by the parties in their supplemental briefs, the Court vacates the judgments below and remands to the respective United States Courts of Ap-peals for the Third, Fifth, Tenth, and D. C. Circuits. Given the gravity of the dispute and the substantial clarifcation and refnement in the positions of the parties, the parties on remand should be afforded an opportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that accommodates petitioners' reli-gious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners' health plans \"receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.\" Id., at 1. We anticipate that the Courts of Appeals will allow the parties suffcient time to resolve any outstanding issues between them. The Court fnds the foregoing approach more suitable than addressing the signifcantly clarifed views of the parties in the frst instance. Although there may still be areas of dis-agreement between the parties on issues of implementation, the importance of those areas of potential concern is uncer-tain, as is the necessity of this Court's involvement at this point to resolve them. This Court has taken similar action in other cases in the past. See, e. g., Madison County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y ., 562 U. S. 42, 43 (2011) (per curiam ) (vacating and remanding for the Second Circuit to Cite as: 578 U. S. 403 (2016) 409 Per Curiam \"address, in the frst instance, whether to revisit its rul- ing on sovereign immunity in light of [a] new factual devel-opment, and\u2014if necessary\u2014proceed to address other ques-tions in the case consistent with its sovereign immunity ruling\"); Kiyemba v. Obama, 559 U. S. 131, 132 (2010) (per curiam ) (vacating and remanding for the D. C. Circuit to \"determine, in the frst instance, what further proceedings in that court or in the District Court are necessary and ap-propriate for the full and prompt disposition of the case in light of the new developments\"); Villarreal v. United States, 572 U. S. 1084, 1085 (2014) (vacating and remanding to the Fifth Circuit \"for further consideration in light of the posi-tion asserted by the Solicitor General in his brief for the United States\"). The Court expresses no view on the merits of the cases. In particular, the Court does not decide whether petitioners' religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the Government has a compelling interest, or whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving that interest. Nothing in this opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, is to affect the ability of the Government to ensure that women covered by petitioners' health plans \"ob-tain, without cost, the full range of Food and Drug Adminis-tration approved contraceptives.\" Wheaton College v. Bur- well, 573 U. S. 958, 959 (2014). Through this litigation, petitioners have made the Government aware of their view that they meet \"the requirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement on religious grounds.\" Ibid. Nothing in this opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, \"precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the extent it considers it necessary, to facili-tate the provision of full contraceptive coverage\" going for-ward. Ibid. Because the Government may rely on this no- tice, the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on petitioners for failure to provide the relevant notice. 410 ZUBIK v. BURWELL Sotomayor, J., concurring The judgments of the Courts of Appeals are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Sotomayor , with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring. I join the Court's per curiam opinion because it expresses no view on \"the merits of the cases,\" \"whether petitioners' religious exercise has been substantially burdened,\" or \"whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving\" a compelling governmental interest. Ante , at 409. Lower courts, therefore, should not construe either today's per curiam or our order of March 29, 2016, as signals of where this Court stands. We have included similarly explicit disclaimers in previous orders. See, e. g., Wheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U. S. 958, 959 (2014) (\"[T]his order should not be construed as an expression of the Court's views on the merits\"). Yet some lower courts have ignored those instructions. See, e. g., Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. De- partment of Health and Human Servs., 801 F. 3d 927, 944 (CA8 2015) (\"[I]n Wheaton College, Little Sisters of the Poor , and Zubik, the Supreme Court approved a method of notice to [Health and Human Services] that is arguably less onerous than [existing regulations] yet permits the government to further its interests. Although the Court's orders were not fnal rulings on the merits, they at the very least collectively constitute a signal that less restrictive means exist by which the government may further its interests\"). On remand in these cases, the Courts of Appeals should not make the same mistake. I also join the Court's opinion because it allows the lower courts to consider only whether existing or modifed regula-tions could provide seamless contraceptive coverage \" `to petitioners' through petitioners' insurance com-panies, without any . notice from petitioners.' \" Ante, Cite as: 578 U. S. 403 (2016) 411 Sotomayor, J., concurring at 407. The opinion does not, by contrast, endorse the peti- tioners' position that the existing regulations substantially burden their religious exercise or that contraceptive cover-age must be provided through a \"separate policy, with a sep-arate enrollment process.\" Supp. Brief for Petitioners 1; Supp. Reply Brief for Petitioners 5. Such separate contraceptive-only policies do not currently exist, and the Government has laid out a number of legal and practical ob-stacles to their creation. See Supp. Reply Brief for Re-spondents 3-4. Requiring standalone contraceptive-only coverage would leave in limbo all of the women now guaran-teed seamless preventive-care coverage under the Afford-able Care Act. And requiring that women affrmatively opt into such coverage would \"impose precisely the kind of bar-rier to the delivery of preventive services that Congress sought to eliminate.\" Id., at 6. Today's opinion does only what it says it does: \"afford[s] an opportunity\" for the parties and Courts of Appeals to re-consider the parties' arguments in light of petitioners' new articulation of their religious objection and the Government's clarifcation about what the existing regulations accomplish, how they might be amended, and what such an amendment would sacrifce. Ante, at 408. As enlightened by the par- ties' new submissions, the Courts of Appeals remain free to reach the same conclusion or a different one on each of the questions presented by these cases. 412 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 Syllabus KERNAN, SECRETARY, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION v. HINOJOSA on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 15-833. Decided May 16, 2016 At the time that respondent Hinojosa was incarcerated, he was permitted to accrue good-time credits under California law. After the law was amended, prisoners such as Hinojosa\u2014who had been \"validated\" as prison-gang associates and placed in a secured housing unit\u2014were left without the ability to earn future good-time credits. Hinojosa fled a state habeas petition, arguing that the new law's application to him vio-lated the Constitution's prohibition of ex post facto laws. The Superior Court denied his claim for improper venue. Rather than fle a new petition in the correct venue, he turned to the appellate court, which summarily denied his petition. Then, instead of appealing that denial, he sought a writ of habeas corpus in the California Supreme Court, which summarily denied relief without explanation. A petition for fed-eral habeas relief followed. The District Court denied his ex post facto claim under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996's (AEDPA's) deferential review standard. The Ninth Circuit reversed, looking through the State Supreme Court's summary denial to the last reasoned decision adjudicating Hinojosa's claim\u2014the Superior Court's dismissal for improper venue, see Ylst v. Nunnemaker , 501 U. S. 797; reasoned that the Superior Court's decision was not entitled to AEDPA deference because it was not a determination on the merits; and granted Hinojosa's petition for habeas relief. Held: Because the Supreme Court of California's summary denial of Hino- josa's petition was on the merits, the Ninth Circuit should have re-viewed his ex post facto claim through AEDPA's deferential lens. Ylst's rebuttable \"look through\" presumption is amply refuted here. Improper venue could not possibly have been a ground for the high court's summary denial of Hinojosa's claim. Thus, it cannot be that the State Supreme Court's denial \"rest[ed] upon the same ground\" as the Superior Court's. 501 U. S., at 803. Nor is there any indication that the summary denial was without prejudice, thus refuting Hinojosa's speculation that the State Supreme Court exercised its discretion to deny the petition with-out prejudice because it was not fled frst in a proper lower court. Certiorari granted; 803 F. 3d 412, reversed. Cite as: 578 U. S. 412 (2016) 413 Per Curiam Per Curiam. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) requires a state prisoner seeking federal ha- beas relief frst to \"exhaus[t] the remedies available in the courts of the State.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). If the state courts adjudicate the the merits,\" \u00a7 AEDPA mandates deferential, rather than de novo , review, prohibiting federal courts from grant- ing habeas relief unless the state-court decision \"was con-trary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\" \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts,\" \u00a7 2254(d)(2). The Ninth Circuit in this case decided that the Supreme Court of California's summary denial of a habeas petition was not \"on the merits,\" and therefore AEDPA's deferential-review pro-visions did not apply. We summarily reverse. Respondent Antonio Hinojosa was serving a 16-year sen- tence for armed robbery and related crimes when, in 2009, California prison offcials \"validated\" him as a prison-gang associate and placed him in a secured housing unit. At the time of Hinojosa's offense and conviction, California law had permitted prisoners placed in a secured housing unit solely by virtue of their prison-gang affliations to continue to ac-crue good-time credits. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 2933.6 (West 2000). In 2010, the California Legislature amended the law so that prison-gang associates placed in a secured housing unit could no longer earn future good-time credits, although they would retain any credits already earned. \u00a7 2933.6(a) (West Supp. 2016). Hinojosa fled a state habeas petition, arguing (as relevant here) that applying the new law to him violated the Federal Constitution's prohibition of ex post facto laws. See Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1; Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24 (1981). The Orange County Superior Court denied the claim \"on grounds petitioner has not sought review of his claim of error in the proper judicial venue.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. The court explained: 414 KERN AN v. HINOJOSA Per Curiam \" `Although any superior court has jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate a petition for writ of habeas corpus, it does not follow that it should do so in all instances.' Challenges to conditions of an inmate's con-fnement should be entertained by the superior court of county wherein the inmate is confned. (Griggs v. Supe-rior Court (1976) 16 Cal. 3d 341, 347.) \"The petition for writ of habeas corpus is DENIED.\" Id., at 44a-45a. 1 Rather than fle a new petition in the correct venue (Kings County Superior Court), Hinojosa turned to the appellate court, which summarily denied his petition. Instead of ap-pealing that denial, see Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1506 (West Supp. 2016), Hinojosa sought an original writ of habeas cor-pus in the Supreme Court of California, see Cal. Const., Art. 6, \u00a7 10, which summarily denied relief without explanation. A petition for federal habeas relief followed. Adopting the Magistrate Judge's fndings and recommendation, the District Court denied Hinojosa's ex post facto claim under AEDPA's deferential review. A Ninth Circuit panel re-versed. Hinojosa v. Davey , 803 F. 3d 412 (2015). Citing our decision in Ylst v. Nunnemaker , 501 U. S. 797 (1991), the panel \"looked through\" the Supreme Court of California's summary denial to the last reasoned decision adjudicating Hinojosa's claim: the Superior Court's dismissal for improper venue. The panel reasoned that the Superior Court's deci-sion \"is not a determination `on the merits' \" and that as a result it was \"not bound by AEDPA.\" 803 F. 3d, at 419. 1 In Griggs v. Superior Ct. of San Bernardino Cty., 16 Cal. 3d 341, 347, 546 P. 2d 727, 731 (1976), the Supreme Court of California stated that \"[a]s a general rule,\" if a prisoner fles a habeas petition challenging the condi-tions of his confnement in a county other than the one in which he is confned, the court should not deny the petition unless it fails to state a prima facie case. In this case, however, there is no hint in the opinion of the Superior Court that it followed this approach, and petitioner does not claim that it did. Cite as: 578 U. S. 412 (2016) 415 Per Curiam Having thus freed itself from AEDPA's strictures, the court granted Hinojosa's petition for habeas relief. We reverse. In Ylst, we said that where \"the last rea- soned opinion on the claim explicitly imposes a procedural default, we will presume that a later decision rejecting the claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.\" 501 U. S., at 803. We adopted this presumption because \"silence implies consent, not the opposite\u2014and courts generally behave accordingly, affrming without fur-ther discussion when they agree, not when they disagree, with the reasons given below.\" Id., at 804. But we point- edly refused to make the presumption irrebuttable; \"strong evidence can refute it.\" Ibid. It is amply refuted here. Improper venue could not possi- bly have been a ground for the high court's summary denial of Hinojosa's claim. There is only one Supreme Court of California\u2014and thus only one venue in which Hinojosa could have sought an original writ of habeas corpus in that court. Under these circumstances, it cannot be that the State Su-preme Court's denial \"rest[ed] upon the same ground\" as the Superior Court's. Id., at 803. It quite obviously rested upon some different ground. Ylst's \"look-through\" approach is therefore inapplicable. 2 Hinojosa resists this conclusion, remarking that \"a review- ing court has discretion to deny without prejudice a habeas corpus petition that was not fled frst in a proper lower court.\" In re Steele , 32 Cal. 4th 682, 692, 85 P. 3d 444, 449 (2004) (emphasis added). But there is no indication that the summary denial here was without prejudice, thus refuting Hinojosa's speculation. 2 Alternatively, if the Superior Court in fact followed Griggs' instruc- tions and silently concluded that the claim did not state a prima facie case for relief, see n. 1, supra, the decision of the Supreme Court of California would still be a decision on the merits, and the AEDPA standard of review would still apply. 416 KERN AN v. HINOJOSA Sotomayor, J., dissenting Containing no statement to the contrary, the Supreme Court of California's summary denial of Hinojosa's petition was therefore on the merits. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U. S. 86, 99 (2011). Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit should have reviewed Hinojosa's ex post facto claim through AEDPA's deferential lens. And although we express no view on the merits of that claim, we note that the Ninth Circuit has already held that state-court denials of claims identical to Hinojosa's are not contrary to clearly established federal law. See Nevarez v. Barnes, 749 F. 3d 1124 (CA9 2014); see also In re Efstathiou, 200 Cal. App. 4th 725, 730- 732, 133 Cal. Rptr. 3d 34, 37-40 (2011); In re Sampson, 197 Cal. App. 4th 1234, 1240-1244, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 39, 43-46 (2011). The panel below recognized as much: \"If AEDPA applies here, we are bound by our decision in Nevarez and must affrm the district court's denial of Hinojosa's petition.\" 803 F. 3d, at 418. AEDPA applies here. The petition for a writ of certiorari and Hinojosa's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed. It is so ordered. Justice Sotomayor , with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting. When faced with a state-court order that denies a habeas petition without explanation, this Court has long presumed that the order agrees with the \"last reasoned state-court opinion\" in the case unless there is \"strong evidence\" to the contrary. Ylst v. Nunnemaker , 501 U. S. 797, 804-805 (1991). In this case, the parties agree that a California Su-perior Court denied a petition for improper venue because it was fled in the wrong county. The California Supreme Court later denied the same petition for no explained reason. Applying Ylst's commonsense presumption, it is \"most im- probable\" that the California Supreme Court's unexplained Cite as: 578 U. S. 412 (2016) 417 Sotomayor, J., dissenting order disagreed with the Superior Court's reasoned order. Id., at 804. We should therefore presume that the Califor- nia Supreme Court denied Antonio Hinojosa's habeas peti-tion because he fled the frst one in the wrong county. The Court, however, believes there is strong evidence to the contrary\u2014for two inexplicable reasons. The frst rea-son\u2014the California Supreme Court could not have denied the petition for \"improper venue\" because there is only one California Supreme Court, ante, at 414\u2014is a straw man, and a poorly constructed one at that. Obviously the California Supreme Court did not deny Hinojosa's petition because he fled it in the wrong State Supreme Court. But it easily could have denied his petition because it agreed with the Superior Court's conclusion that he fled the frst petition in the wrong county. See In re Steele , 32 Cal. 4th 682, 692, 85 P. 3d 444, 449 (2004). That possibility becomes even more likely in light of California's atypical habeas rules, which treat an original habeas petition to the California Supreme Court as the commonplace method for seeking review of a lower court's order. See Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 221-222 (2002).* By issuing a silent order after reviewing the lower court's reasoned decision, the California Supreme Court presumably denied Hinojosa's petition on the same ground. Cf. Ylst, 501 U. S., at 800 (applying its presumption on an identical posture out of California). The majority's second reason is even fimsier. The major- ity suggests that the California Supreme Court's order did not include the words \"without prejudice\" and therefore could not have agreed with the Superior Court's denial\u2014 which the majority assumes was without prejudice. Ante , *Contrary to the majority's characterization, Hinojosa did not fle his petition \"[i]nstead of appealing\" the lower court's denial, ante , at 414\u2014his petition was itself his appeal. See Carey , 536 U. S., at 225 (calling an original habeas petition and the alternative \"petition for hearing\" \" inter- changeable\" methods of appeal, \"with neither option bringing adverse con- sequences to the petitioner\"). 418 KERN AN v. HINOJOSA Sotomayor, J., dissenting at 415-416. But as the majority quotes, the Superior Court simply \" `DENIED' \" the petition; neither it nor the Califor-nia Supreme Court \"DENIED\" it \"without prejudice.\" Ante, at 414, 415. It is mindboggling how one opinion neces- sarily disagrees with another opinion merely because it omits language that the other opinion also lacks. I would hold, as the Ninth Circuit did, that the California Supreme Court presumably agreed with the reasoning of the Superior Court. See Ylst, 501 U. S., at 804. At the very least, I would not hold that there is such \"strong evidence\" to the contrary that we should summarily reverse the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the California Supreme Court's order\u2014and, in the process, reverse the Ninth Circuit's sepa-rate conclusion that Hinojosa's incarceration had been uncon-stitutionally extended. OCTOBER TERM, 2015 419 Syllabus CRST V AN EXPEDITED, INC. v. EQUAL EMPLOY - MENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit No. 14-1375. Argued March 28, 2016\u2014Decided May 19, 2016 Petitioner CRST, a trucking company using a system under which two employees share driving duties on a single truck, requires its drivers to graduate from the company's training program before becoming a certi-fed driver. In 2005, new driver Monika Starke fled a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (Commission), alleging that she was sexually harassed by two male trainers during the road-trip portion of her training. Following the procedures set out in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b), the Commission informed CRST about the charge and investigated the alle-gation, ultimately informing CRST that it had found reasonable cause to believe that CRST subjected Starke and \"a class of employees and prospective employees to sexual harassment\" and offering to conciliate. In 2007, having determined that conciliation had failed, the Commission, in its own name, fled suit against CRST under \u00a7 706 of Title VII. Dur-ing discovery, the Commission identifed over 250 allegedly aggrieved women. The District Court, however, dismissed all of the claims, in-cluding those on behalf of 67 women, which, the court found, were barred on the ground that the Commission had not adequately investi-gated or attempted to conciliate its claims on their behalf before fling suit. The District Court then dismissed the suit, held that CRST is a prevailing party, and invited CRST to apply for attorney's fees. CRST fled a motion for attorney's fees. The District Court awarded the com-pany over $4 million in fees. The Eighth Circuit reversed the dismissal of only two claims\u2014on behalf of Starke and one other employee\u2014but that led it to vacate, without prejudice, the attorney's fees award. On remand, the Commission settled the claim on behalf of Starke and with-drew the other. CRST again sought attorney's fees, and the District Court again awarded it more than $4 million, fnding that CRST had prevailed on the claims for over 150 of the allegedly aggrieved women, including the 67 claims dismissed because of the Commission's failure to satisfy its presuit requirements. The Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded once more. It held that a Title VII defendant can be a \"pre-vailing party\" only by obtaining a \"ruling on the merits,\" and that the District Court's dismissal of the claims was not a ruling on the merits. 420 CRST V AN EXPEDITED, INC. v. EEOC Syllabus Held: A favorable ruling on the merits is not a necessary predicate to fnd that a defendant is a prevailing party. Pp. 431-436. (a) Common sense undermines the notion that a defendant cannot \"prevail\" unless the relevant disposition is on the merits. A plaintiff seeks a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties. But a defendant seeks to prevent an alteration in the plaintiff 's favor, and that objective is fulflled whenever the plaintiff's challenge is re-buffed, irrespective of the precise reason for the court's decision, i. e., even if the court's fnal judgment rejects the plaintiff 's claim for a non-merits reason. There is no indication that Congress intended that de-fendants should be eligible to recover attorney's fees only when courts dispose of claims on the merits. Title VII's fee-shifting statute allows prevailing defendants to recover whenever the plaintiff's \"claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\" Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC , 434 U. S. 412, 422. Congress thus must have intended that a defendant could recover fees expended in frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless litigation when the case is resolved in the defendant's favor, whether on the merits or not. Christiansburg itself involved a defend- ant's request for attorney's fees in a case where the District Court had rejected the plaintiff's claim for a nonmerits reason. Various Courts of Appeals likewise have applied the Christiansburg standard when claims were dismissed for nonmerits reasons. Pp. 431-434. (b) The Court declines to decide the argument, raised by the Commis- sion for the frst time during the merits stage of this case, whether a defendant must obtain a preclusive judgment in order to prevail. The Commission's failure to articulate its preclusion theory earlier has re-sulted in inadequate briefng on the issue, and the parties dispute whether the District Court's judgment was in fact preclusive. The Commission also submits that the Court should affrm on the alternative ground that, even if CRST is a prevailing party, the Commission's posi-tion that it had satisfed its presuit obligations was not frivolous, unrea-sonable, or groundless. These matters are left for the Eighth Circuit to consider in the frst instance. It is not this Court's usual practice to adjudicate either legal or predicate factual questions in the frst in-stance, see Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 110, and that is the proper course here, given the extensive record in this case and the Commission's change of position between the certiorari and merits stages.

Fletcher argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Verrilli, Deputy Solicitor General Gershengorn, P . David Lopez, Jennifer S. Goldstein, Gail S. Coleman, and Susan R. Oxford.* Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. This case involves the interpretation of a statutory provi- sion allowing district courts to award attorney's fees to de- fendants in employment discrimination actions. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., which prohibits discrimination in employment, a district court may award attorney's fees to \"the prevailing party.\" \u00a7 2000e-5(k). The Court of Ap-peals for the Eighth Circuit held that a Title VII defendant prevails only by obtaining a \"ruling on the merits.\" 774 F. 3d 1169, 1179 (2014); Marquart v. Lodge 837, Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 26 F. 3d 842, 851-852 (1994). This Court disagrees with that conclusion. The Court now holds that a favorable ruling on the merits is not a necessary predi-cate to fnd that a defendant has prevailed. I Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes an award of attorney's fees in certain circumstances. The stat-ute provides that *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were fled for Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World, LLC, et al. by Michael W. Johnston, Rebecca Cole Moore , Daryl L.

EEOC Opinion of the Court \"[i]n any action or proceeding under this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the [Equal Employment Opportunity] Com-mission or the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee (including expert fees) as part of the costs, and the Com-mission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.\" \u00a7 2000e-5(k). Before deciding whether an award of attorney's fees is ap-propriate in a given case, then, a court must determine whether the party seeking fees has prevailed in the litiga-tion. Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782, 789 (1989); Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 433 (1983). Congress has included the term \"prevailing party\" in vari- ous fee-shifting statutes, and it has been the Court's ap-proach to interpret the term in a consistent manner. See Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 602- 603, and n. 4 (2001). The Court has said that the \"touch-stone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.\" Texas State Teachers Assn., supra, at 792-793. This change must be marked by \"judicial imprimatur .\" Buckhannon, 532 U. S., at 605. The Court has explained that, when a plaintiff secures an \"enforceable judgmen[t] on the merits\" or a \"court-ordered consent decre[e],\" that plaintiff is the prevail-ing party because he has received a \"judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\" Id., at 604- 605. The Court, however, has not set forth in detail how courts should determine whether a defendant has prevailed. Although the Court has not articulated a precise test for when a defendant is a prevailing party, in the Title VII con-text it has addressed how defendants should be treated under the second part of the inquiry\u2014whether the district court should exercise its discretion to award fees to the pre-vailing party. When a defendant is the prevailing party on Cite as: 578 U. S. 419 (2016) 423 Opinion of the Court a civil rights claim, the Court has held, district courts may award attorney's fees if the plaintiff's \"claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless,\" or if \"the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\" Christiansburg Gar- ment Co. v. EEOC , 434 U. S. 412, 422 (1978); see also id., at 421. The Court of Appeals' determination of the frst part of the fee-shifting inquiry\u2014whether petitioner is a prevailing party\u2014presents the central issue in this case. Before ad-dressing this question, however, a discussion of the facts and complex procedural history is warranted. II Petitioner CRST is a trucking company that employs a team driving system under which two employees share driv-ing duties on a single truck. CRST requires its drivers to graduate from the company's training program before be-coming a certifed driver. Part of that training is a 28-day over-the-road trip with a veteran driver. In 2005, a new driver named Monika Starke fled a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (Com-mission) alleging that two male trainers sexually harassed her during her over-the-road training trip. The Commission's receipt of a charge of an unlawful work- place practice starts Title VII's \"detailed, multi-step proce-dure through which the Commission enforces the statute's prohibition on employment discrimination.\" Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC , 575 U. S. 480, 483 (2015). Under \u00a7 706 of Title VII, the Commission frst must inform the employer about the charge and the details of the allegations. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b). The Commission next must investi- gate the allegation. Ibid. If the agency \"determines after such investigation that there is not reasonable cause to be-lieve that the charge is true,\" it shall dismiss the charge and notify the parties. Ibid. At that point, the Commission is no longer involved, and the aggrieved individual may sue the 424 CRST V AN EXPEDITED, INC. v. EEOC Opinion of the Court employer in his or her own name. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). If, on the other hand, the Commission determines that there is rea-sonable cause to believe that a Title VII violation did occur, it \"shall endeavor to eliminate any such alleged unlawful em-ployment practice by informal methods of conference, concili-ation, and persuasion.\" \u00a7 2000e-5(b). Only if the agency's attempt at conciliation fails may it fle a court action in its own name on behalf of the aggrieved person who brought the charge. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). Following these procedures, the Commission notified CRST of Starke's charge and requested information regard- ing Starke's allegations. In response CRST denied any wrongdoing. During the investigation, the Commission dis-covered that four other women had fled formal charges against the company with the Commission. The Commis-sion then sent CRST several followup requests. It asked if CRST had received other allegations of harassment, de-manded contact information for any women who were in-structed by the trainers Starke accused of harassment, and sought \"detailed contact information for\" CRST's dispatch-ers and female drivers. 679 F. 3d 657, 667 (CA8 2012). Over a year and a half after Starke fled her charge, the Commission sent CRST a letter of determination informing the company that the Commission had found reasonable cause to believe that CRST subjected Starke and \"a class of employees and prospective employees to sexual harassment\" and offering to conciliate. App. 811. Counsel for the Com-mission and for CRST discussed conciliation, but were unable to reach an agreement, and the Commission promptly noti-fed the company that, in the agency's view, the conciliation efforts had failed. In September 2007 the Commission, in its own name, fled suit against CRST under \u00a7 706 of Title VII. It alleged that CRST subjected Starke and \"[o]ther similarly of CRST . . . to sexual harassment and a sexually hostile and offensive work environment\" in violation of Cite as: 578 U. S. 419 (2016) 425 Opinion of the Court \u00a7\u00a7 703(a) and 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2 and 2000e-3. App. 794-795. The Commission is allowed to \"seek specifc relief for a group of aggrieved individuals 706] without frst obtaining class certifcation pursu-ant to\" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, because that Rule \"is not applicable to\" a \u00a7 706 enforcement action. General Telephone Co. of Northwest v. EEOC , 446 U. S. 318, 323, 333- 334 (1980). The Commission sought to enjoin CRST from engaging in discriminatory employment practices and to ob-tain an order requiring CRST to take proactive steps to rem-edy and prevent sex-based discrimination in the workplace. The Commission also sought damages and costs. During discovery, the Commission identifed over 250 al- legedly aggrieved women\u2014far more than the Commission had forecast. CRST fled a motion for an order to show cause, alleging that the Commission \"did not have a good-faith basis\" for seeking relief on behalf of all the women. 2009 WL 2524402, *10 (ND Iowa, Aug. 13, 2009). The Dis-trict Court did not strike any allegedly aggrieved persons at that time, although it did note its concern \"that CRST still might unfairly face a `moving target' of prospective plaintiffs as discovery winds down and trial approaches.\" Ibid. (al- teration and internal quotation marks omitted). The District Court proceeded to dispose of the Commis- sion's claims in a series of orders responsive to various mo-tions fled by CRST. Section 707 of Title VII authorizes the Commission to bring a claim \"that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice\" of illegal sex-based discrimination. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-6. In the early stage of this litigation the Commission \"made clear to the [district] court and CRST that it believe[d] CRST had engaged in `a pattern or practice' of tolerating sexual harass-ment.\" Order in No. 07-CV-95 (ND Iowa), Doc. 197, p. 25. CRST sought summary judgment on the Commission's per-ceived pattern-or-practice claim. The District Court granted the motion. The court explained that, although 426 CRST V AN EXPEDITED, INC. v. EEOC Opinion of the Court courts have allowed the Commission to use a pattern-or- practice theory when litigating a \u00a7 706 claim, the Commission did not plead a violation of \u00a7 707 or use the phrase \"pattern or practice\" in its complaint. Id., at 24-25. Instead, the \"[Commission's] Complaint reads as if the [Commission] were asserting a prototypical \u00a7 706 action.\" Ibid. But, the court noted, CRST did not argue that the Commission failed to state a pattern-or-practice claim in the complaint; and the court presumed that CRST would not have sought summary judgment on a claim \"it does not believe to exist.\" Id., at 26. Because both parties accepted that the claim was live, \"the court assume[d] without deciding that this is a sexual harassment pattern or practice case.\" Ibid. After review- ing the parties' arguments, the court held that the Commis-sion had \"not established a pattern or practice of tolerating sexual harassment\" and dismissed with prejudice the as-sumed pattern-or-practice claim. Id., at 67. The court, as a fnal matter, advised that \"[n]othing in this opinion . . . should be construed as a fnal ruling on the individual claims of sexual harassment that the [Commission] presses in this action.\" Ibid. Next, the District Court ruled in several orders that the Commission's claims on behalf of all but 67 of the women were barred on a variety of grounds. The court had pre-viously dismissed claims on behalf of nearly 100 women as a discovery sanction due to the Commission's failure to produce the women for deposition. In rejecting the Com-mission's other claims, the court relied on (1) the expiration of the statute of limitations; (2) judicial estoppel; (3) the em-ployee's failure to report the alleged harassment in a timely fashion; (4) CRST's prompt and effective response to reports of harassment; and (5) the lack of severity or pervasiveness of the alleged harassment. The District Court then barred the Commission from seek- ing relief for the remaining 67 women on the ground that the Commission had not satisfed its \u00a7 706 presuit requirements Cite as: 578 U. S. 419 (2016) 427 Opinion of the Court before fling the lawsuit. The court concluded that the suit was \"one of those exceptionally rare\" cases where the Com-mission \"wholly abandoned its investi-gate and conciliate. 2009 WL 2524402, *16. The court noted, however, that it \"expresse[d] no view as to whether the [Commission's] investigation, determination and concilia-tion of Starke's Charge would be suffcient to support a pattern[-]or-practice lawsuit.\" Ibid., n. 21. The District Court then dismissed the suit, held that CRST is a prevailing party, and invited CRST to apply for attorney's fees. CRST fled a motion for attorney's fees. After describing how it disposed of the Commission's claims piece by piece, the District Court held that the Commission's failure to sat-isfy its presuit obligations for its claims on behalf of the fnal 67 women was \"unreasonable,\" and that an award of attor-ney's fees was therefore appropriate. App. 140. The court awarded CRST over $4 million in attorney's fees. Id., at 173-174. The Commission appealed the District Court's order dis- missing the claims on behalf of the 67 women that the Dis-trict Court rejected for failure to satisfy Title VII's presuit requirements as well as the District Court's dismissal of some of the Commission's other claims. As relevant here, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court's dismissal of the 67 claims for a lack of investigation and conciliation was proper. The Commission, according to the Court of Appeals, \"did not reasonably investigate the class allegations of sexual harassment during a reasonable investigation of the charge,\" but rather used \"discovery in the resulting lawsuit as a fsh-ing expedition to uncover more violations.\" 679 F. 3d, at 676 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Commission in fact \"did not investigate the specifc allegations of any of the 67 allegedly aggrieved persons . . . until after the Complaint was fled.\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals affrmed the District Court's dis- missal of almost all of the other claims on which the Commis-428 CRST V AN EXPEDITED, INC. v. EEOC Opinion of the Court sion had appealed, reversing only the claims on behalf of Starke and one other employee\u2014Tillie Jones\u2014for reasons not material to the question at issue here. Like the District Court before it, the Court of Appeals declined to comment on whether the presuit investigation and attempted conciliation would have been suffcient to support a pattern-or-practice claim. The Court of Appeals also vacated, without preju-dice, the attorney's fees award. \"In light of our reversals\" of the District Court's summary-judgment orders with re-spect to Starke and Jones, the court reasoned, \"CRST is no longer a `prevailing' defendant because the [Commission] still asserts live claims against it.\" Id., at 694-695. Judge Murphy dissented from the court's holding that the Commis-sion had failed to satisfy its obligation to investigate and con-ciliate the fnal 67 claims, arguing that the Commission did not need to \"complete its presuit duties for each individual alleged victim of discrimination when pursuing a class claim.\" Id., at 695. After the case was remanded, the Commission withdrew its claim on behalf of Jones and settled its claim on behalf of Starke. The Commission thus had no claims left. The company again moved for attorney's fees, and the District Court again awarded CRST more than $4 million in fees. The court frst concluded \"that this case contained multiple and distinct claims for relief,\" thereby rejecting the Commis-sion's contention that it had brought a single claim on which it had prevailed. 2013 WL 3984478, *9 (ND Iowa, Aug. 1, 2013). Noting that the defendant does not have to prevail on every claim in a suit to obtain attorney's fees, see Fox v. Vice , 563 U. S. 826 (2011), the court then determined the claims on which CRST had prevailed. Applying Circuit precedent requiring a ruling on the merits of a claim before a defendant can be considered a prevailing party, the court found that CRST did not prevail on the claims that were dismissed because of the Commission's failure to produce many of the allegedly aggrieved women for deposition. The Cite as: 578 U. S. 419 (2016) 429 Opinion of the Court court also found that CRST had not prevailed on the merits with respect to a handful of the Commission's other claims. The court found that CRST did prevail, however, on the Commission's pattern-or-practice claim and on the claims on behalf of over 150 of the allegedly aggrieved women, includ-ing the 67 claims dismissed because of the Commission's fail-ure to satisfy its presuit requirements. The court held that its dismissal of those 67 claims was a ruling on the merits because the Commission's obligation to investigate and con-ciliate \"is not a jurisdictional prerequisite; rather, it is an ingredient of the [Commission's] claim.\" 2013 WL 3984478, *10. The court further concluded that an award of attor-ney's fees was appropriate because the Commission's failure to investigate and conciliate those 67 claims was unreason-able, as were the pattern-or-practice claim and the other claims on which it prevailed. The Commission appealed, and the Court of Appeals again reversed and remanded. The Court of Appeals frst agreed with the District Court that the Commission brought many individual claims, not just a single claim. The Court of Appeals disagreed, however, with the District Court's con-clusion that CRST could recover attorney's fees for the pattern-or-practice claim. The Commission did not allege a pattern-or-practice claim in its complaint, the Court of Ap-peals noted, and the District Court had \"merely assumed without deciding that the [Commission] brought a pattern- or-practice claim.\" 774 F. 3d, at 1179. The Court of Ap-peals concluded that the District Court erred by awarding fees \"based on a purported\" claim. Ibid. The Court of Appeals, bound by its own precedent in Mar- quart, then held that before a defendant can be deemed to have prevailed and to be eligible for fees there must have been a favorable \" `judicial determination . . . on the merits.' \" 774 F. 3d, at 1179 (quoting Marquart, 26 F. 3d, at 852). A merits-based disposition is necessary, the court reasoned, be-cause \" `[p]roof that a plaintiff 's case is frivolous, unreason-430 CRST V AN EXPEDITED, INC. v. EEOC Opinion of the Court able, or groundless is not possible without a judicial determi- nation of the plaintiff 's case on the merits.' \" 774 F. 3d, at 1179 (quoting Marquart, supra, at 852). A case has not been decided on the merits, according to the Court of Appeals, if the defendant secured a \"dismissal for lack of subject mat-ter jurisdiction, on res judicata grounds, . . . on statute-of-limitations grounds,\" or for something similar. 774 F. 3d, at 1179. The Court of Appeals distinguished \"claim elements,\" on the one hand, from \"jurisdictional prerequisites or nonju-risdictional prerequisites to fling suit,\" on the other. Id., at 1180. As relevant here, the court held that because Title VII's presuit requirements are not elements of a Title VII claim, the dismissal of the claims regarding the 67 women on the ground that the Commission failed to investigate or conciliate was not a ruling on the merits, and CRST did not prevail on those claims. Id., at 1181. As a result, the court concluded, CRST was \"not entitled to an award of attorneys' fees on such claims.\" Ibid. The Court of Appeals also crit- icized the District Court for \"mak[ing] a universal fnding that all of the [Commission's] claims were without founda-tion,\" instead of laying out \"particularized fndings . . . as to each individual claim upon which it granted summary judg-ment on the merits to CRST.\" Id., at 1183. Such fndings are necessary, the court reasoned, to avoid providing the de-fendant with \" `compensation for any fees that he would have paid in the absence of the frivolous claims.' \" Ibid. (quoting Fox, supra, at 841). In particular, the court found it \"prob- lematic\" that the District Court's blanket fnding included \"(1) the purported pattern-or-practice claim and (2) the claims dismissed for the [Commission's] failure to satisfy its presuit obligations.\" 774 F. 3d, at 1183. The District Court was ordered to undertake a proper, particularized inquiry on remand. By precluding the defendant from recovering attorney's fees when the claims in question have been dismissed be-cause the Commission failed to satisfy its presuit obligations, Cite as: 578 U. S. 419 (2016) 431 Opinion of the Court the decision of the Court of Appeals conficts with the deci- sions of three other Courts of Appeals. See EEOC v. Pro- pak Logistics, Inc., 746 F. 3d 145, 152-154 (CA4 2014); EEOC v. Asplundh Tree Expert Co., 340 F. 3d 1256, 1261 (CA11 2003); EEOC v. Pierce Packing Co., 669 2d 605, 608-609 (CA9 1982). This Court granted certiorari. 577 U. S. 1025 (2015). III A The Court of Appeals held that CRST did not prevail on the claims brought on behalf of 67 women because the Dis-trict Court's disposition of these claims for failure to investi-gate and conciliate was not a ruling on the merits. In this Court the Commission now takes the position that the court erred by applying an on-the-merits requirement. Brief for Respondent 29 (\"[A]sking whether a judgment is `on the mer-its' in some abstract sense risks confusion\"); Tr. of Oral Arg. 30 (\"We have abandoned the Eighth Circuit's view that you need a disposition on the merits\"). This Court agrees and now holds that a defendant need not obtain a favorable judg-ment on the merits in order to be a \"prevailing party.\" Common sense undermines the notion that a defendant cannot \"prevail\" unless the relevant disposition is on the merits. Plaintiffs and defendants come to court with differ-ent objectives. A plaintiff seeks a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties. A defendant seeks to prevent this alteration to the extent it is in the plaintiff 's favor. The defendant, of course, might prefer a judgment vindicating its position regarding the substantive merits of the plaintiff 's allegations. The defendant has, however, fulflled its primary objective whenever the plaintiff 's chal-lenge is rebuffed, irrespective of the precise reason for the court's decision. The defendant may prevail even if the court's fnal judgment rejects the plaintiff 's claim for a non-merits reason. 432 CRST V AN EXPEDITED, INC. v. EEOC Opinion of the Court There is no indication that Congress intended that defend- ants should be eligible to recover attorney's fees only when courts dispose of claims on the merits. The congressional policy regarding the exercise of district court discretion in the ultimate decision whether to award fees does not distin-guish between merits-based and non-merits-based judg-ments. Rather, as the Court explained in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC , one purpose of the fee-shifting provi- sion is \"to deter the bringing of lawsuits without founda-tion.\" 434 U. S., at 420 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Fox, 563 U. S., at 836 (noting, in the context of 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1988's closely related provision, that Congress wanted \"to relieve defendants of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litigation\"). The Court, therefore, has interpreted the statute to allow prevailing defendants to re-cover whenever the plaintiff 's \"claim was frivolous, unrea-sonable, or groundless.\" Christiansburg , supra, at 422. It little sense if Congress' policy of \"sparing de-fendants from the costs of frivolous litigation,\" Fox, supra, at 840, depended on the distinction between merits-based and non-merits-based frivolity. Congress must have in-tended that a defendant could recover fees expended in frivo-lous, unreasonable, or groundless litigation when the case is resolved in the defendant's favor, whether on the merits or not. Imposing an on-the-merits requirement for a defend-ant to obtain prevailing party status would undermine that congressional policy by blocking a whole category of defend-ants for whom Congress wished to make fee awards available. Christiansburg itself involved a defendant's request for at- torney's fees in a case where the District Court had rejected the plaintiff 's claim for a nonmerits reason. That case in-volved a claim under Title VII, as originally enacted, which did not give the Commission the authority to sue in its own name on behalf of an aggrieved person. Rosa Helm had fled Cite as: 578 U. S. 419 (2016) 433 Opinion of the Court a charge of discrimination against Christiansburg Garment Co. with the Commission in 1968. A few years later, the Commission determined that its conciliation efforts had failed and told Helm of her right to sue Christiansburg, which she did not exercise. Then in 1972, Congress amended Title VII to allow the Commission to sue in its own name on behalf of an aggrieved person, including where the employee's charge was \"pending with the Commission\" when the amendments took effect. Equal Employment Opportu-nity Act of 1972, \u00a7 14, 86 Stat. 113. The Commission sued Christiansburg based on Helm's charge, but the District Court granted summary judgment to the defendant on the ground that the charge was not pending on the amendments' effective date. EEOC v. Christiansburg Garment Co., 376 F. Supp. 1067, 1073-1074 (WD Va. 1974). This Court was asked \"what standard should inform a district court's discre-tion in deciding whether to award attorney's fees to a suc-cessful defendant in a Title VII action.\" Christiansburg , 434 U. S., at 417 (emphasis deleted). If a ruling on the mer-its were necessary for the defendant to prevail and be eligi-ble for attorney's fees, the lack of a ruling on the merits would have been dispositive to this Court's analysis. But the Court said nothing to suggest that the fact that the rul-ing was not on the merits ended the inquiry. Its reasoning was to the contrary. This Court noted with approval that the District Court had applied the correct standard and found that the \"Commission's statutory interpretation of \u00a7 14 of the 1972 amendments was not frivolous.\" Id., at 424 (in- ternal quotation marks omitted). Various Courts of Appeals likewise have applied the Christiansburg standard when claims were dismissed for nonmerits reasons. A plaintiff 's claim may be frivolous, un-reasonable, or groundless if the claim is barred by state sov-ereign immunity, C. W. v. Capistrano Unifed School Dist., 784 F. 3d 1237, 1247-1248 (CA9 2015), or is moot, Propak 434 CRST V AN EXPEDITED, INC. v. EEOC Opinion of the Court Logistics, 746 F. 3d, at 152. See also Brief for Petitioner 33- 34 (collecting Courts of Appeals cases in which the defendant received attorney's fees and the District Court's judgment was not on the merits). In cases like these, signifcant attor-ney time and expenditure may have gone into contesting the claim. Congress could not have intended to bar defendants from obtaining attorney's fees in these cases on the basis that, although the litigation was resolved in their favor, they were nonetheless not prevailing parties. Neither the text of the fee-shifting statute nor the policy which underpins it counsels in favor of adopting the Court of Appeals' on-the-merits requirement. B Having abandoned its defense of the Court of Appeals' rea- soning, the Commission now urges this Court to hold that a defendant must obtain a preclusive judgment in order to pre-vail. The Court declines to decide this issue, however. The Commission changed its argument between the certiorari and merits stages. As a result, the Commission may have forfeited the preclusion argument by not raising it earlier. The Commission's failure to articulate its preclusion theory before the eleventh hour has resulted in inadequate brief-ing on the issue. The Commission and CRST dispute, more-over, whether the District Court's judgment was in fact preclusive. Compare Brief for Respondent 38-45 with Reply Brief 8-13. The Court leaves these legal and factual issues for the Court of Appeals to consider in the frst instance. The Commission submits the Court should affrm on the alternative ground that, even if CRST is a prevailing party, the Commission's position that it had satisfed its presuit ob-ligations was not frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless. The Commission acknowledges that the Court of Appeals has not decided this issue, but nevertheless invokes the Court's authority to affrm \"on any ground properly raised below.\" Cite as: 578 U. S. 419 (2016) 435 Opinion of the Court Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 476, n. 20 (1979); see Brief for Re- spondent 49-50. In light of this case's intricate procedural history, see supra, at 423-431, this is not an appropriate case to reach and settle this fact-sensitive issue. It has been over 10 years since Starke frst fled her charge and close to 9 years since the Commission fled its complaint. The dispute over the award of attorney's fees has continued over much of that period and is still unresolved. When it appeared the litigation was coming to a close in the District Court, the trial judge considered this a case in which attor-ney's fees should be assessed against the Commission. The Court of Appeals then made the rulings it considered proper in response, and there were further proceedings in the trial court and once again on appeal. Against this background of protracted and expensive litigation on the fee issue, the Court is aware of the need to resolve the outstanding issues without unnecessary delay. As the Court has noted in ear-lier cases, \"the determination of fees `should not result in a second major litigation.' \" Fox, 563 U. S., at 838 (quoting Hensley , 461 U. S., at 437). It is not prudent, however, for the Court to attempt to resolve all the pending issues under the circumstances here. It is not the Court's usual practice to adjudicate either legal or predicate factual questions in the frst instance. See Ad- arand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 110 (2001) (per curiam ) (noting \"that this is a court of fnal review and not frst view\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). That precept is applicable here, especially in light of the extensive record in the case and the Commission's change in its posi-tion. This Court is confdent that the Court of Appeals, and, if necessary, the District Court, will resolve the case by tak-ing any proper steps to expedite its resolution in a manner consistent with their own procedures and their responsibil-ities in other pending cases. 436 CRST V AN EXPEDITED, INC. v. EEOC Thomas, J., concurring The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Thomas, concurring. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a district court may award attorney's fees to \"the prevailing party.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). In Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC , 434 U. S. 412 (1978), this Court concluded that a pre- vailing plaintiff \"ordinarily is to be awarded attorney's fees in all but special circumstances,\" but a prevailing defendant is to be awarded fees only \"upon a fnding that the plaintiff 's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\" Id., at 417, 421. That holding \"mistakenly cast aside the statutory language\" in interpreting the phrase \"prevailing party.\" Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517, 538 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the Court of Appeals com-pounded Christiansburg 's error by requiring a district court to make yet another fnding before a Title VII defendant may be considered a \"prevailing party\": The defendant must also obtain a \"ruling on the merits.\" 774 F. 3d 1169, 1181 (CA8 2014). Today, the Court correctly vacates that ruling and holds that \"a favorable ruling on the merits is not a nec-essary predicate to fnd that a defendant has prevailed.\" Ante , at 421. I therefore join the Court's opinion in full. Nevertheless, I continue to adhere to my view that Chris- tiansburg is a \"dubious precedent\" that any further. Fogerty , supra, at 539 (opinion of Thomas, J.). OCTOBER TERM, 2015 437 Syllabus BETTERMAN v. MONTANA certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 14-1457. Argued March 28, 2016\u2014Decided May 19, 2016 Petitioner Brandon Betterman pleaded guilty to bail jumping after failing to appear in court on domestic assault charges. He was then jailed for over 14 months awaiting sentence, in large part due to institutional delay. He was eventually sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, with four of the years suspended. Arguing that the 14-month gap between conviction and sentencing violated his speedy trial right, Betterman ap-pealed, but the Montana Supreme Court affrmed the conviction and sentence, ruling that the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause does not apply to postconviction, presentencing delay. Held: The Sixth Amendment's speedy trial guarantee does not apply once a defendant has been found guilty at trial or has pleaded guilty to crimi-nal charges. Pp. 441-449. (a) Criminal proceedings generally unfold in three discrete phases. First, the State investigates to determine whether to arrest and charge a suspect. Once charged, the suspect is presumed innocent until convic-tion upon trial or guilty plea. After conviction, the court imposes sen-tence. There are checks against delay geared to each particular phase. P. 441. (b) Statutes of limitations provide the primary protection against delay in the frst stage, when the suspect remains at liberty, with the Due Process Clause safeguarding against fundamentally unfair prosecu-torial conduct. United States v. Lovasco , 431 U. S. 783, 789. P. 441. (c) The Speedy Trial Clause right attaches when the second phase begins, that is, upon a defendant's arrest or formal accusation. United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 320-321. The right detaches upon con- viction, when this second stage ends. Before conviction, the accused is shielded by the presumption of innocence, Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 4, which the Speedy Trial Clause implements by minimizing the likelihood of lengthy incarceration before trial, lessening the anxiety and concern associated with a public accusation, and limiting the effects of long delay on the accused's ability to mount a defense, Marion, 404 U. S., at 320. The Speedy Trial Clause thus loses force upon conviction. This reading comports with the historical understanding of the speedy trial right. It \"has its roots at the very foundation of our English law heritage,\" Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 223, and it was the contemporaneous understanding of the Sixth Amendment's language 438 BETTERMAN v. MONTANA Syllabus that \"accused\" described a status preceding \"convicted\" and \"trial\" meant a discrete episode after which judgment (i. e., sentencing) would follow. The Court's precedent aligns with the text and history of the Speedy Trial Clause. See Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 532-533. Just as the right to speedy trial does not arise prearrest, Marion, 404 U. S., at 320-322, adverse consequences of postconviction delay are out- side the purview of the Speedy Trial Clause. The sole remedy for a violation of the speedy trial right\u2014dismissal of the charges\u2014fts the preconviction focus of the Clause, for it would be an unjustifed windfall to remedy sentencing delay by vacating validly obtained convictions. This reading also fnds support in the federal Speedy Trial Act of 1974 and numerous state analogues, which impose time limits for charging and trial but say nothing about sentencing. The prevalence of guilty pleas and the resulting scarcity of trials in today's justice system do not bear on the presumption-of-innocence protection at the heart of the Speedy Trial Clause. Moreover, a central feature of contemporary sen-tencing\u2014the preparation and review of a presentence investigation re-port\u2014requires some amount of wholly reasonable presentencing delay. Pp. 441-447. (d) Although the Constitution's presumption-of-innocence-protective speedy trial right is not engaged in the sentencing phase, statutes and rules offer defendants recourse. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(b)(1), for example, directs courts to \"impose sentence without unnec-essary delay.\" Further, as at the prearrest stage, due process serves as a backstop against exorbitant delay. Because Betterman advanced no due process claim here, however, the Court expresses no opinion on how he might fare under that more pliable standard. Pp. 447-448. 378 Mont. 182, 342 P. 3d 971, affrmed. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Thomas, J., fled a concurring opinion, in which Alito, J., joined, post, p. 449. So- tomayor , J., fled a concurring opinion, post, p. 450. Fred A. Rowley, Jr., argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Daniel B. Levin, Eric C. Tung , and Stuart Banner . Dale Schowengerdt, Solicitor General of Montana, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Timo- thy C. Fox, Attorney General, C. Mark Fowler , and Tammy A. Hinderman and Jonathan M. Krauss, Assistant Attor- neys General. Cite as: 578 U. S. 437 (2016) 439 Opinion of the Court Ginger D. Anders argued the cause for the United States as amicus curiae urging affrmance. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Verrilli, Assistant Attorney General Caldwell, Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben, and Ross B. Goldman.* Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. The Sixth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury . . . .\" Does the Sixth Amendment's speedy trial guar-antee apply to the sentencing phase of a criminal prosecu-tion? That is the sole question this case presents. We hold that the guarantee protects the accused from arrest or in-dictment through trial, but does not apply once a defendant has been found guilty at trial or has pleaded guilty to crimi-nal charges. For inordinate delay in sentencing, although the Speedy Trial Clause does not govern, a defendant may have other recourse, including, in appropriate circumstances, tailored relief under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

Schimel of Wisconsin, and Peter K. Mi- chael of Wyoming. 440 BETTERMAN v. MONTANA Opinion of the Court man, however, advanced in this Court only a Sixth Amend- ment speedy trial claim. He did not preserve a due process challenge. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19. We, therefore, confne this opinion to his Sixth Amendment challenge. I Ordered to appear in court on domestic assault charges, Brandon Betterman failed to show up and was therefore charged with bail jumping. 378 Mont. 182, 184, 342 P. 3d 971, 973 (2015). After pleading guilty to the bail-jumping charge, he was jailed for over 14 months awaiting sentence on that conviction. Id., at 184-185, 342 P. 3d, at 973-974. The holdup, in large part, was due to institutional delay: The presentence report took nearly fve months to complete; the trial court took several months to deny two presentence mo-tions (one seeking dismissal of the charge on the ground of delay); and the court was slow in setting a sentencing hear-ing. Id., at 185, 195, 342 P. 3d, at 973-974, 980. Betterman was eventually sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, with four of those years suspended. Id., at 185, 342 P. 3d, at 974. Arguing that the 14-month gap between conviction and sentencing violated his speedy trial right, Betterman ap-pealed. The Montana Supreme Court affrmed his convic-tion and sentence, ruling that the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause does not apply to postconviction, pre-sentencing delay. Id., at 188-192, 342 P. 3d, at 975-978. We granted certiorari, 577 U. S. 1025 (2015), to resolve a split among courts over whether the Speedy Trial Clause applies to such delay. 1 Holding that the Clause does not 1 Compare Burkett v.

II Criminal proceedings generally unfold in three discrete phases. First, the State investigates to determine whether to arrest and charge a suspect. Once charged, the suspect stands accused but is presumed innocent until conviction upon trial or guilty plea. After conviction, the court im-poses sentence. There are checks against delay throughout this progression, each geared to its particular phase. In the frst stage\u2014before arrest or indictment, when the suspect remains at liberty\u2014statutes of limitations provide the primary protection against delay, with the Due Process Clause as a safeguard against fundamentally unfair prosecu-torial conduct. United States v. Lovasco , 431 U. S. 783, 789 (1977); see id., at 795, n. 17 (Due Process Clause may be violated, for instance, by prosecutorial delay that is \"tacti-cal\" or \"reckless\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause homes in on the second period: from arrest or indictment through convic-tion. The constitutional right, our precedent holds, does not attach until this phase begins, that is, when a defendant is arrested or formally accused. United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 320-321 (1971). Today we hold that the right de- taches upon conviction, when this second stage ends. 2 A. 2d 909, 912 (1987) (Speedy Trial Clause applies to sentencing delay), with United States v. Ray, 578 F. 3d 184, 198-199 (CA2 2009); State v. Drake , 259 N. W. 2d 862, 866 (Iowa 1977), abrogated on other grounds by State v. Kaster , 469 N. W. 2d 671, 673 (Iowa 1991); State v. Pressley , 290 Kan. 24, 29, 223 P. 3d 299, 302 (2010); State v. Johnson, 363 So. 2d 458, 460 (La. 1978); 378 Mont. 182, 192, 342 P. 3d 971, 978 (2015) (case below); and Ball v. Whyte , 170 W. Va. 417, 418, 294 S. E. 2d 270, 271 (1982) (Speedy Trial Clause does not apply to sentencing delay). 2 We reserve the question whether the Speedy Trial Clause applies to bifurcated proceedings in which, at the sentencing stage, facts that could increase the prescribed sentencing range are determined (e. g., capital cases in which eligibility for the death penalty hinges on aggravating fac-442 BETTERMAN v. MONTANA Opinion of the Court Prior to conviction, the accused is shielded by the pre- sumption of innocence, the \"bedrock[,] axiomatic and elemen- tary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.\" Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 4 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Speedy Trial Clause implements that presumption by \"pre-vent[ing] undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial, . . . minimiz[ing] anxiety . . . limit[ing] the possibilities that long delay will impair the ability of an accused to defend himself.\" Marion, 404 U. S., at 320 (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Barker v. Wingo , 407 U. S. 514, 532-533 (1972). As a measure protecting the presumptively innocent, the speedy trial right\u2014like other similarly aimed measures\u2014loses force upon conviction. Compare In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970) (requiring \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime\"), with United States v. O'Brien, 560 U. S. 218, 224 (2010) (\"Sentencing factors . . . can be by a preponderance of the evidence.\"). Compare 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3142(b) (bail presumptively avail-able for accused awaiting trial) with \u00a7 3143(a) (bail presump-tively unavailable for those convicted awaiting sentence). Our reading comports with the historical understanding. The speedy trial right, we have observed, \"has its roots at the very foundation of our English law heritage. Its frst articulation in modern jurisprudence appears to have been Magna Carta 386 U. S. 213, 223 (1967). Regarding the Framers' comprehension of the right as it existed at the founding, we have cited Sir Edward Coke's Institutes of the Laws of Eng-land. See id., at 223-225, and nn. 8, 12-14, 18. Coke wrote that \"the innocent shall not be worn and wasted by long imprisonment, but . . . speedily come to his tria[l].\" 1 E. tor fndings). Nor do we decide whether the right reattaches upon re- newed prosecution following a defendant's successful appeal, when he again enjoys the presumption of innocence. Cite as: 578 U. S. 437 (2016) 443 Opinion of the Court Coke, Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 315 (1797) (emphasis added). Refecting the concern that a presumptively innocent per- son should not languish under an unresolved charge, the Speedy Trial Clause guarantees \"the accused\" \"the right to a speedy . . . trial.\" U. S. Const., Amdt. 6 (emphasis added). At the founding, \"accused\" described a status preceding \"convicted.\" See, e. g., 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 322 (1769) (commenting on process in which \"persons accused of felony . . were . and convicted\" (emphasis added)). And \"trial\" meant a discrete episode after which judgment (i. e., sentencing) would follow. See, e. g., id., at 368 (\"We are now to consider the next stage of criminal prosecution, after trial and conviction are past . . . : which is that of judgment.\"). 3 This understanding of the Sixth Amendment language\u2014 \"accused\" as distinct from \"convicted,\" and \"trial\" as sepa-rate from \"sentencing\"\u2014endures today. See, e. g., Black's Law Dictionary 26 (10th ed. 2014) (defning \"accused\" as \"a person who has been arrested and brought before a magis- trate or who has been formally charged\" (emphasis added)); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32 (governing \"Sentencing and Judg-ment,\" the Rule appears in the chapter on \"Post-Conviction Procedures,\" which follows immediately after the separate chapter headed \"Trial\"). 4 3 As Betterman points out, at the founding, sentence was often imposed promptly after rendition of a verdict. Brief for Petitioner 24-26. But that was not invariably the case. For the court's \"own convenience, or on cause shown, [sentence could be] . . . to a future or term.\" 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 1291, p. 767 (3d ed. 1880) (footnote omit-ted). See also 1 J. Chitty, A Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law 481 (1819) (\"The sentence . . . is usually given immediately after the conviction, but the court may adjourn to another day and then give judgment.\"). 4 We do not mean to convey that provisions of the Sixth Amendment protecting interests other than the presumption of innocence are inapplica-ble to sentencing. In this regard, we have held that the right to defense counsel extends to some postconviction proceedings. See Mempa v. Rhay , 389 U. S. 128, 135-137 (1967). 444 BETTERMAN v. MONTANA Opinion of the Court This Court's precedent aligns with the text and history of the Speedy Trial Clause. Detaining the accused pretrial, we have said, disadvantages him, and the imposition is \"espe-cially unfortunate\" as to those \"ultimately found to be inno-cent.\" Barker , 407 U. S., at 532-533. And in Marion, 404 U. S., at 320, addressing \"the major evils protected against by the speedy trial guarantee,\" we observed: \"Arrest is a public act that may seriously interfere with the defendant's liberty, whether he is free on bail or not, and that may dis-rupt his employment, drain his fnancial resources, curtail his associations, subject him to public obloquy, and create anxiety in him, his family and his friends.\" We acknowl-edged in Marion that even prearrest\u2014a stage at which the right to a speedy trial does not arise\u2014the passage of time \"may impair memories, cause evidence to be lost, deprive the defendant of witnesses, and otherwise interfere with his ability to defend himself.\" Id., at 321. Nevertheless, we determined, \"this possibility of prejudice at trial is not itself suffcient reason to wrench the Sixth Amendment from its proper [arrest or charge triggered] context.\" Id., at 321- 322. Adverse consequences of postconviction delay, though subject to other checks, see infra, at 447-448, are similarly outside the purview of the Speedy Trial Clause. 5 The sole remedy for a violation of the speedy trial right\u2014 dismissal of the charges, see Strunk v. United States, 412 U. S. 434, 440 (1973); Barker , 407 U. S., at 522\u2014fts the pre- conviction focus of the Clause. It would be an unjustifed windfall, in most cases, to remedy sentencing delay by vacat- 5 Smith v. Hooey , 393 U. S. 374 (1969), on which Betterman relies, is not to the contrary. There we concluded that a defendant, though already convicted and imprisoned on one charge, nevertheless has a right to be speedily brought to trial on an unrelated charge. Id., at 378. \"[T]here is reason to believe,\" we explained in Smith, \"that an outstanding untried charge (of which even a convict may, of course, be innocent) can have fully as depressive an effect upon a prisoner as upon a person who is at large.\" Id., at 379. Smith is thus consistent with comprehension of the Speedy Trial Clause as protective of the presumptively innocent. Cite as: 578 U. S. 437 (2016) 445 Opinion of the Court ing validly obtained convictions. Betterman concedes that a dismissal remedy ordinarily would not be in order once a defendant has been convicted. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6; cf. Bozza v. United States, 330 U. S. 160, 166 (1947) (\"[A]n error in passing the sentence\" does not permit a convicted defend-ant \"to escape punishment altogether.\"). 6 The manner in which legislatures have implemented the speedy trial guarantee matches our reading of the Clause. Congress passed the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3161 et seq., \"to give effect to the sixth amendment right.\" United States v. MacDonald, 456 U. S. 1, 7, n. 7 (1982) (quot- ing S. Rep. No. 93-1021, p. 1 (1974)). \"The more stringent provisions of the Speedy Trial Act have mooted much litiga-tion about the requirements of the Speedy Trial Clause . . . .\" United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 304, n. 1 (1986) (citation omitted). With certain exceptions, the Act di- rects\u2014on pain of dismissal of the charges, \u00a7 3162(a)\u2014that no more than 30 days pass between arrest and indictment, \u00a7 3161(b), and that no more than 70 days pass between indict-ment and trial, \u00a7 3161(c)(1). The Act says nothing, however, about the period between conviction and sentencing, sug-gesting that Congress did not regard that period as falling within the Sixth Amendment's compass. Numerous state analogues similarly impose precise time limits for charging and trial; they, too, say nothing about sentencing. 7 6 Betterman suggests that an appropriate remedy for the delay in his case would be reduction of his sentence by 14 months\u2014the time between his conviction and sentencing. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. We have not read the Speedy Trial Clause, however, to call for a fexible or tailored remedy. Instead, we have held that violation of the right demands termination of the prosecution. 7 See, e. g., Alaska Rule Crim. Proc. 45 (2016); Ark. Rules Crim. Proc. Cal. Penal Code (West 2011); Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22-3402 (2014 446 BETTERMAN v. MONTANA Opinion of the Court Betterman asks us to take account of the prevalence of guilty pleas and the resulting scarcity of trials in today's jus- tice system. See Lafer v. Cooper , 566 U. S. 156, 170 (2012) (\"[C]riminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.\"). The sentencing hearing has largely replaced the trial as the forum for dispute resolution, Betterman urges. Therefore, he maintains, the concerns supporting the right to a speedy trial now recommend a speedy sentencing hearing. The modern reality, however, does not bear on the presumption-of-innocence protection at the heart of the Speedy Trial Clause. And factual disputes, if any there be, at sentencing, do not go to the question of guilt; they are geared, instead, to ascertaining the proper sentence within boundaries set by statutory minimums and maximums. Moreover, a central feature of contemporary sentencing in both federal and state courts is preparation by the probation offce, and review by the parties and the court, of a presen- tence investigation report. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3552; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(c)-(g); 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 26.5(b), pp. 1048-1049 (4th ed. 2015) (noting reliance on presentence reports in federal and state courts).

As we have explained, at the third phase of the criminal- justice process, i. e., between conviction and sentencing, the Constitution's presumption-of-innocence-protective speedy trial right is not engaged. 9 That does not mean, however, that defendants lack any protection against undue delay at this stage. The primary safeguard comes from statutes and rules. The Federal Rule on point directs the court to \"impose sentence without unnecessary delay.\" Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(b)(1). Many States have provisions to the same effect, 10 and some States prescribe numerical time 9 It is true that during this period the defendant is often incarcerated. See, e. g., \u00a7 3143(a) (bail presumptively unavailable for convicted awaiting sentence). Because postconviction incarceration is considered punish- ment for the offense, however, a defendant will ordinarily earn time-served credit for any period of presentencing detention. See \u00a7 3585(b); A. Campbell, Law of Sentencing \u00a7 9:28, pp. 444-445, and n. 4 (3d ed. 2004) (\"[State c]rediting statutes routinely provide that any period of time dur-ing which a person was incarcerated in relation to a given offense be counted toward satisfaction of any resulting sentence.\"). That such de-tention may occur in a local jail rather than a prison is of no constitutional moment, for a convicted defendant has no right to serve his sentence in the penal institution he prefers. See Meachum v. Fano , 427 U. S. 215, 224-225 (1976). 10 See, e. g., Alaska Rule BETTERMAN v. MONTANA Opinion of the Court limits.11 Further, as at the prearrest stage, due process serves as a backstop against exorbitant delay. See supra, at 441. After conviction, a defendant's due process right to liberty, while diminished, is still present. He retains an in-terest in a sentencing proceeding that is fundamentally fair. But because Betterman advanced no due process claim here, see supra, at 439-440, we express no opinion on how he might fare under that more pliable standard. See, e. g., United States v. $8,850, 461 U. S. 555, 562-565 (1983). 12 * * * The course of a criminal prosecution is composed of dis- crete segments. During the segment between accusation and conviction, the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause protects the presumptively innocent from long enduring un-resolved criminal charges. The Sixth Amendment speedy trial right, however, does not extend beyond conviction, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 874 (West 2016); Crim. Proc. (2011); Ark. 9.94A.500(1) (2016 Supp.). These sentencing provisions are sepa-rate from state analogues to the Speedy Trial Act. See supra, at 445, and n. 7. 12 Relevant considerations may include the length of and reasons for delay, the defendant's diligence in requesting expeditious sentencing, and prejudice. Cite as: 578 U.

Justice Thomas , with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring. I agree with the Court that the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause does not apply to sentencing proceed-ings, except perhaps to bifurcated sentencing proceedings where sentencing enhancements operate as functional ele-ments of a greater offense. See ante, at 440-441, and n. 2. I also agree with the Court's decision to reserve judgment on whether sentencing delays might violate the Due Process Clause. Ante, at 448. Brandon Betterman's counsel re- peatedly disclaimed that he was raising in this Court a chal-lenge under the Due Process Clause. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8 (\"We haven't included that. We didn't include that in the question presented, Your Honor\"); id., at 8 (\"[W]e are not advancing that claim here\"); id., at 19 (\"[W]e didn't pre- serve a\u2014a due process challenge. Our challenge is solely under the Sixth Amendment\"). We have never decided whether the Due Process Clause creates an entitlement to a reasonably prompt sentencing hearing. Today's opinion leaves us free to decide the proper analytical framework to analyze such claims if and when the issue is properly before us. Justice Sotomayor suggests that, for such claims, we should adopt the factors announced in Barker v. Wingo , 407 U. S. 514, 530-533 (1972). Post, at 451 (concurring opinion). I would not prejudge that matter. The factors listed in Barker may not necessarily translate to the delayed sentenc- ing context. The Due Process Clause can be satisfed where a State has adequate procedures to redress an improper dep-rivation of liberty or property. See Parratt v. Taylor , 451 U. S. 527, 537 (1981). In unusual cases where trial courts 450 BETTERMAN v. MONTANA Sotomayor, J., concurring fail to sentence a defendant within a reasonable time, a State might fully satisfy due process by making traditional ex-traordinary legal remedies, such as mandamus, available. Or, much like the federal Speedy Trial Act regulates trials, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3161, a State might remedy improper sen-tencing delay by statute.* And a person who sleeps on these remedies, as Betterman did, may simply have no right to complain that his sentencing was delayed. We should await a proper presentation, full briefng, and argument be-fore taking a position on this issue. The Court thus correctly \"express[es] no opinion on how [Betterman] might fare\" under the Due Process Clause. Ante, at 448. Justice Sotomayor , concurring. I agree with the Court that petitioner cannot bring a claim under the Speedy Trial Clause for a delay between his guilty plea and his sentencing. As the majority notes, however, a defendant may have \"other recourse\" for such a delay, \"in-cluding, in appropriate circumstances, tailored relief under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" Ante, at 439. The Court has no reason to consider today the appropriate test for such a Due Process Clause challenge because petitioner has forfeited any such claim. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19. I write separately to em-phasize that the question is an open one. The Due Process Clause is \"fexible and calls for such pro- cedural protections as the particular situation demands.\" Morrissey v. Brewer , 408 U. S. 471, 481 (1972). This Court *Montana law, for example, secures the right to a prompt sentencing hearing. See Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(a) (2015) (\"Sentencing and punishment must be certain, timely, consistent, and understandable\"); \u00a7 46-18-102(3)(a) (\"[I]f the verdict or fnding is guilty, sentence must be pronounced and judgment rendered within a reasonable time\"); \u00a7 46-18- 115 (\"[T]he court shall conduct a sentencing hearing, without unreason-able delay\"). Cite as: 587 U. S. 437 (2016) 451 Sotomayor, J., concurring thus uses different tests to consider whether different kinds of delay run afoul of the Due Process Clause. In evaluating whether a delay in instituting judicial proceedings following a civil forfeiture violated the Due Process Clause, the Court applied the test from Barker v. Wingo , 407 U. S. 514 (1972)\u2014 the same test that the Court applies to violations of the Speedy Trial Clause. See United States v. $8,850, 461 U. S. 555, 564 (1983). Under the Barker test, courts consider four factors\u2014the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. $8,850, 461 U. S., at 564. None is \"either . . . necessary has a \"talismanic qualit[y].\" Barker , 407 U. S., at 533. The Montana Supreme Court did not use the Barker test in evaluating petitioner's Due Process Clause claim. 378 Mont. 182, 193-194, 342 P. 3d 971, 979 (2015). But it seems to me that the Barker factors capture many of the concerns posed in the sentencing delay context and that because the Barker test is fexible, it will allow courts to take account of any differences between trial and sentencing delays. See 407 U. S., at 531. The majority of the Circuits in fact use the Barker test for that purpose. See United States v. Sanders, 452 F. 3d 572, 577 (CA6 2006) (collecting cases). In the appropriate case, I would thus consider the correct test for a Due Process Clause delayed sentencing challenge. 452 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 Syllabus LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH, ATTORNEY GENERAL certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit No. 14-1096. Argued November 3, 2015\u2014Decided May 19, 2016 Any alien convicted of an \"aggravated felony\" after entering the United States is deportable, ineligible for several forms of discretionary relief, and subject to expedited removal. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (3). An \"aggravated felony\" is defned as any of numerous offenses listed in \u00a7 1101(a)(43), each of which is typically identifed either as an offense \"described in\" a specifc federal statute or by a generic label (e. g., \"mur- der\"). Section 1101(a)(43)'s penultimate sentence states that each enu-merated crime is an aggravated felony irrespective of whether it vio-lates federal, state, or foreign law. Petitioner Jorge Luna Torres (Luna), a lawful permanent resident, pleaded guilty in a New York court to attempted third-degree arson. When immigration offcials discovered his conviction, they initiated re-moval proceedings. The Immigration Judge determined that Luna's arson conviction was for an \"aggravated felony\" and held that Luna was therefore ineligible for discretionary relief. The Board of Immigration Appeals affrmed. It found the federal and New York arson offenses to be identical except for the former's requirement that the crime have a connection to interstate or foreign commerce. Because the federal statute's commerce element serves only a jurisdictional function, the Board held, New York's arson offense is \"described in\" the federal statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i), for purposes of determining whether an alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony. The Second Circuit denied review. Held: A state offense counts as a \u00a7 1101(a)(43) \"aggravated felony\" when it has every element of a listed federal crime except one requiring a connection to interstate or foreign commerce. Because Congress lacks general constitutional authority to punish crimes, most federal offenses include a jurisdictional element to tie the substantive crime to one of Congress's enumerated powers. State leg-islatures are not similarly constrained, and so state crimes do not need such a jurisdictional hook. That discrepancy creates the issue here\u2014 whether a state offense lacking a jurisdictional element but otherwise mirroring a particular federal offense can be said to be \"described\" by that offense. Dictionary defnitions of the word \"described\" do not clearly resolve this question one way or the other. Rather, two contextual con- siderations decide this case: \u00a7 1101(a)(43)'s penultimate sentence and a Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 453 Syllabus well-established background principle that distinguishes between sub- stantive and jurisdictional elements in criminal statutes. Pp. 457-473. (a) Section 1101(a)(43)'s penultimate sentence shows that Congress meant the term \"aggravated felony\" to capture serious crimes regard-less of whether they are made illegal by the Federal Government, a State, or a foreign country. But Luna's view would substantially undercut that function by excluding from the Act's coverage all state and foreign versions of any enumerated federal offense containing an interstate commerce element. And it would do so in a particularly per-verse fashion\u2014excluding state and foreign convictions for many of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)'s gravest crimes (e. g., most child pornography offenses), while reaching convictions for far less harmful offenses (e. g., operating an unlawful gambling business). Luna theorizes that such haphazard coverage might refect Congress's belief that crimes with an interstate connection are generally more serious than those without. But it is implausible that Congress viewed the presence of an interstate com-merce element as separating serious from non-serious conduct. Luna's theory misconceives the function of interstate commerce elements and runs counter to the penultimate sentence's central message\u2014that the state, federal, or foreign nature of a crime is irrelevant. And his claim that many serious crimes excluded for want of an interstate commerce element would nonetheless count as \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) \"crime[s] of vio-lence\" provides little comfort: That alternative would not include nearly all such offenses, nor even the worst ones. Pp. 460-466. (b) The settled practice of distinguishing between substantive and jurisdictional elements in federal criminal statutes also supports read-ing \u00a7 1101(a)(43) to include state analogues that lack only an interstate commerce requirement. Congress uses substantive and jurisdictional elements for different reasons and does not expect them to receive iden-tical treatment. See, e. g., United States v. Yermian, 468 U. S. 63, 68. And that is true where, as here, the judicial task is to compare federal and state offenses. See Lewis v. United States, 523 U. S. 155, 165. Pp. 467-471. 764 F. 3d 152, affrmed.

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA or Act) im- poses certain adverse immigration consequences on an alien convicted of an \"aggravated felony.\" The INA defnes that term by listing various crimes, most of which are identifed as offenses \"described in\" specifed provisions of the federal criminal code. Immediately following that list, the Act pro-vides that the referenced offenses are aggravated felonies irrespective of whether they are \"in violation of Federal[,] State[,]\" or foreign law. 108 Stat. 4322, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). In this case, we must decide if a state crime counts as an aggravated felony when it corresponds to a specifed federal offense in all ways but one\u2014namely, the state crime lacks the interstate commerce element used in the federal statute to establish legislative jurisdiction (i. e., Congress's power to enact the law). We hold that the ab-sence of such a jurisdictional element is immaterial: A state crime of that kind is an aggravated felony. I The INA makes any alien convicted of an \"aggravated fel- ony\" after entering the United States deportable. See \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Such an alien is also ineligible for sev-eral forms of discretionary relief, including cancellation of removal\u2014an order allowing a deportable alien to remain in the country. See \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). And because of his felony, the alien faces expedited removal proceedings. See \u00a7 1228(a)(3)(A). *Briefs for amici curiae urging reversal were fled for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. by David Debold, Manuel D. Dratel, Sarah S. Gannett, Daniel Kaplan, Donna F. Coltharp, and Sara B. Thomas; and for the National Immigrant Justice Center et al. by Linda T. Coberly and Charles G. Roth. Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 455 Opinion of the Court The Act defnes the term \"aggravated felony\" by way of a long list of offenses, now codifed at \u00a7 1101(a)(43). In all, that provision's 21 subparagraphs enumerate some 80 differ-ent crimes. In more than half of those subparagraphs, Con-gress specifed the crimes by citing particular federal stat-utes. According to that common formulation, an offense is an aggravated felony if it is \"described in,\" say, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2251 (relating to child pornography), \u00a7 922(g) (relating to unlawful gun possession), or, of particular relevance here, \u00a7 844(i) (relating to arson and explosives). 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E), (I). Most of the remaining subparagraphs refer to crimes by their generic labels, stating that an offense is an aggravated felony if, for example, it is \"murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\" \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Following the entire list of penultimate sentence reads: \"The term [aggravated felony] applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law and applies to such an offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years.\" So, putting aside the 15-year curlicue, the penultimate sentence provides that an offense listed in \u00a7 1101(a)(43) is an aggravated felony whether in violation of federal, state, or foreign law. Petitioner Jorge Luna Torres, who goes by the name George Luna, immigrated to the United States as a child and has lived here ever since as a lawful permanent resident. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to attempted arson in the third de-gree, in violation of New York law; he was sentenced to one day in prison and fve years of probation. Seven years later, immigration offcials discovered his conviction and initiated proceedings to remove him from the country. During those proceedings, Luna applied for cancellation of removal. But the Immigration Judge found him ineligible for that discre-tionary relief because his arson conviction qualifed as an ag-gravated felony. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a-22a. The Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) affrmed, based on a comparison of the federal and New York arson 456 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Opinion of the Court statutes. See id., at 15a-17a. The INA, as just noted, pro- vides that \"an offense described in\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i), the federal arson and explosives statute, is an aggravated felony. Section 844(i), in turn, makes it a crime to \"maliciously dam-age[ ] or destroy[ ], or attempt[ ] to damage or destroy, by means of fre or an explosive, any building [or] vehicle . . . used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.\" For its part, the New York law that Luna was convicted under prohibits \"in-tentionally damag[ing],\" or attempting to damage, \"a build-ing or motor vehicle by starting a fre or causing an explo-sion.\" N. Y . Penal Law Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 110, 150.10 (West 2010). The state law, the Board explained, thus matches the federal statute element-for-element with one exception: The New York law does not require a connection to interstate com-merce. According to the Board, that single difference did not matter because the federal statute's commerce element is \"ju- risdictional\"\u2014that is, its function is to establish Congress's power to legislate. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a-17a. Given that the two laws' substantive (i. e., non-jurisdictional) elements map onto each other, the Board held, the New York arson offense is \"described in\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied Luna's petition for review of the Board's ruling. See 764 F. 3d 152 (2014). The court's decision added to a Circuit split over whether a state offense is an aggravated felony when it has all the elements of a listed federal crime except one requir-ing a connection to interstate commerce. 1 We granted cer- tiorari. 576 U. S. 1053 (2015). 1 Compare Espinal-Andrades v. Holder , 777 F. 3d 163 (CA4 2015) (fnd- ing an aggravated felony in that circumstance); Spacek v. , 688 F. (same); Nieto Hernandez , v. Castillo-Rivera, 244 F. 3d 1020 (CA9 2001) (same), with Bautista v. Attorney General, 744 F. 3d 54 (CA3 2014) (declining to fnd an aggravated felony). Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 457 Opinion of the Court II The issue in this case arises because of the distinctive role interstate commerce elements play in federal criminal law. In our federal system, \"Congress cannot punish felonies gen-erally,\" Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 428 (1821); it may enact only those criminal laws that are connected to one of its constitutionally enumerated powers, such as the authority to regulate interstate commerce. As a result, most federal offenses include, in addition to substantive elements, a juris-dictional one, like the interstate commerce requirement of \u00a7 844(i). The substantive elements \"primarily defne[ ] the behavior that the statute calls a `violation' of federal law,\" Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., 547 U. S. 9, 18 (2006)\u2014or, as the Model Penal Code puts the point, they relate to \"the harm or evil\" the law seeks to pre-vent, \u00a7 1.13(10). The jurisdictional element, by contrast, ties the substantive offense (here, arson) to one of Congress's constitutional powers (here, its authority over interstate commerce), thus spelling out the warrant for Congress to legislate. See id., at 17-18 (explaining that Congress in- tends \"such statutory commerce' or `in com-merce' . . as terms of art connecting the congressional exer-cise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision (here, the Commerce Clause) that grants Congress that authority\"). For obvious reasons, state criminal laws do not include the jurisdictional elements common in federal statutes. 2 State 2 That fat statement is infnitesimally shy of being wholly true. We have found a handful of state criminal laws with an interstate commerce element, out of the tens (or perhaps hundreds) of thousands of state crimes on the books. Mississippi, for example, lifted essentially verbatim the text of the federal money laundering statute when drafting its own, and thus wound up with such an element. See Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 97-23-101 (rev. 2014). But because the incidence of such laws is so vanishingly small, and the few that exist play no role in Luna's arguments, we proceed without qualifying each statement of the kind above. 458 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Opinion of the Court legislatures, exercising their plenary police powers, are not limited to Congress's enumerated powers; and so States have no reason to tie their substantive offenses to those grants of authority. See, e. g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 567 (1995). In particular, state crimes do not contain inter-state commerce elements because a State does not need such a jurisdictional hook. Accordingly, even state offenses whose substantive elements match up exactly with a federal law's will part ways with respect to interstate commerce. That slight discrepancy creates the issue here: If a state of-fense lacks an interstate commerce element but otherwise mirrors one of the federal statutes listed in \u00a7 1101(a)(43), does the state crime count as an aggravated felony? Or, alternatively, does the jurisdictional difference refected in the state and federal laws preclude that result, no matter the laws' substantive correspondence? Both parties begin with the statutory text most directly at issue, disputing when a state offense (here, arson) is \"de-scribed in\" an enumerated federal statute (here, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i)). Luna, armed principally with Black's Law in\" means \"expressed\" or \"set forth\" in\u2014which, he says, requires the state offense to include each one of the federal law's elements. Brief for Petitioner 15-16. 3 The Government, brandishing dictionar- ies of its own, contends that the statutory phrase has a looser meaning\u2014that \"describing entails . . . impression\" or of a thing's \"central features.\" Brief for Respondent 17. 4 On 3 Black's Law Dictionary 401 (5th ed. 1979) (defning \"describe\" as to \"express, explain, set forth, relate, recount, narrate, depict, delineate, por- tray\"). Luna also cites Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 307 (1976), which defnes \"describe\" to mean \"to represent or give an account of in words.\" 4 See American Heritage Dictionary 490 (5th ed. 2011) (defning \"de- scribe\" as \"[t]o convey an idea or impression of\"); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 610 (1986) (defning \"describe\" as \"to convey an image or notion of\" or \"trace or traverse the outline of\"). Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 459 Opinion of the Court that view, \"described in,\" as opposed to the more precise \"defned in\" sometimes found in statutes, denotes that the state offense need only incorporate the federal law's core, substantive elements. But neither of those claims about the bare term \"described in\" can resolve this case. Like many words, \"describe\" takes on different meanings in different contexts. Consider two ways in which this Court has used the word. In one case, \"describe\" conveyed exactness: A contractual provision, we wrote, \"describes [matter] great particu-larity[,] of pounds [of to-bacco], the tax for which each pound was liable, and the ag-gregate of the tax.\" Ryan v. United States, 19 Wall. 514, 517 (1874). In another case, not: \"The disclosure provision is meant,\" we stated, \"to describe the law to consumers in a manner that is concise and comprehensible to the layman\u2014 which necessarily means that it will be imprecise.\" Compu- Credit Corp. v. Greenwood, 565 U. S. 95, 102 (2012). So star- ing at, or even looking up, the words \"described in\" cannot answer whether a state offense must replicate every last ele-ment of a listed federal statute, including its jurisdictional one, to qualify as an aggravated felony. In considering that issue, we must, as usual, \"interpret the relevant words not in a vacuum, but with reference to the statutory context.\" Abramski v. United States, 573 U. S. 169, 179 (2014). 5 5 The dissent disagrees, contending that the word \"describe\" decides this case in Luna's favor because a \"description cannot refer to features that the thing being described does not have.\" Post, at 477 (opinion of Soto- mayor , J.). Says the dissent: If a Craigslist ad \"describes\" an apartment as having an \"in-unit laundry, a dishwasher, rooftop access, central A/C, and a walk-in closet,\" it does not describe an apartment lacking rooftop access. Ibid. That is true enough, but irrelevant. The dissent is right that when someone describes an object by a list of specifc characteristics, he means that the item has each of those attributes. But things are dif-ferent when someone uses a more general descriptor\u2014even when that descriptor (as here, a federal statute) itself has a determinate set of ele-ments. It would be natural, for example, to say (in the exact syntax of 460 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Opinion of the Court Here, two contextual considerations decide the matter. The frst is \u00a7 1101(a)(43)'s penultimate sentence, which shows that Congress meant the term \"aggravated felony\" to cap-ture serious crimes regardless of whether they are prohib-ited by federal, state, or foreign law. The second is a well-established background principle distinguishing between substantive and jurisdictional elements in federal criminal statutes. We address each factor in turn. A Section 1101(a)(43)'s penultimate sentence, as noted above, provides: \"The term [aggravated felony] applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law and applies to such an offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years.\" See supra, at 455. That sentence (except for the time limit on foreign convictions) declares the source of criminal law irrelevant: The listed offenses count as aggravated felonies regardless of whether they are made illegal by the Federal Government, a State, or a foreign country. That is true of the crimes identifed by reference to federal statutes (as here, an offense described in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i)), as well as those employing generic labels (for example, murder). As even Luna recog-nizes, state and foreign analogues of the enumerated federal crimes qualify as aggravated felonies.

The whole point of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)'s penultimate sentence is to make clear that a listed offense should lead to swift removal, no matter whether it violates federal, state, or foreign law. Luna's jot-for-jot view of \"described in\" would substan- tially undercut that function by excluding from the Act's coverage all state and foreign versions of any enumerated federal offense that (like \u00a7 844(i)) contains an interstate com-merce element. Such an element appears in about half of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)'s listed statutes\u2014defning, altogether, 27 seri-ous crimes. 6 Yet under Luna's reading, only those federal 6 See 8 U. S.

L YNCH Opinion of the Court crimes, and not their state and foreign counterparts, would provide a basis for an alien's removal\u2014because, as explained earlier, only Congress must ever show a link to interstate commerce. See supra, at 457-458. No state or foreign leg- islature needs to incorporate a commerce element to estab-lish its jurisdiction, and so none ever does. Accordingly, state and foreign crimes will never precisely replicate a fed-eral statute containing a commerce element. And that means, contrary to \u00a7 1101(a)(43)'s penultimate sentence, that the term \"aggravated felony\" would not apply to many of the Act's listed offenses irrespective of whether they are \"in violation of Federal[,] State[, or foreign] law\"; instead, that term would apply exclusively to the federal variants. 7 Indeed, Luna's view would limit the penultimate sen- tence's effect in a peculiarly perverse fashion\u2014excluding state and foreign convictions for many of the gravest crimes listed in \u00a7 1101(a)(43), while reaching those convictions for less harmful offenses. Consider some of the state and for-eign crimes that would not count as aggravated felonies on Luna's reading because the corresponding federal law has a commerce element: most child pornography offenses, includ-ing selling a child for the purpose of manufacturing such material, see \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(I); demanding or receiving a ran- inalizes transporting a person for purposes of prostitution); ibid. (\"an of- fense described 2422, which criminalizes coercing or entic- ing a person to travel for purposes of prostitution); ibid. (\"an offense described in\" 18 U. S.

See post, at 482. After all, it reasons, some listed federal statutes\u2014specifcally, those prohibiting treason, levying war against the United States, and disclosing national defense information\u2014will lack state or foreign analogues even under our construction. See post, at 481-482. But Congress's inclusion of a few federal offenses that, by their nature, have no state or foreign analogues hardly excuses expelling from the Act's coverage the countless state and foreign versions of 27 other serious crimes. Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 463 Opinion of the Court som for kidnapping, see \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(H); and possessing a frearm after a felony conviction, see \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii). Conversely, the term \"aggravated felony\" in Luna's world would include state and foreign convictions for such compar-atively minor offenses as operating an unlawful gambling business, see \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(J), and possessing a frearm not identifed by a serial number, see \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(iii), be-cause Congress chose, for whatever reason, not to use a com-merce element when barring that conduct. And similarly, the term would cover any state or foreign conviction for such nonviolent activity as receiving stolen property, see \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), or forging documents, see \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R), because the INA happens to use generic labels to describe those crimes. This Court has previously refused to con-strue \u00a7 1101(a)(43) so as to produce such \"haphazard\"\u2014in-deed, upside-down\u2014coverage. Nijhawan v. Holder , 557 U. S. 29, 40 (2009). We see no reason to follow a different path here: Congress would not have placed an alien convicted by a State of running an illegal casino at greater risk of re-moval than one found guilty under the same State's law of selling a child. 8 8 Luna's position, in addition to producing this bizarre patchwork of cov- erage, conficts with our ordinary assumption that Congress, when draft- ing a statute, gives each provision independent meaning. See United States v. Butler , 297 U. S. 1, 65 (1936) (\"These words cannot be meaning- less, else they would not have been used\"). Until its most recent amend-ment, \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(J) provided that the term \"aggravated felony\" included \"offense described in [18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1962] (relating to racketeer infu-enced corrupt organizations) for which a sentence of 5 years' imprisonment or more may be imposed.\" 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(J) (1994 ed., Supp. I). (That provision now incorporates two more federal crimes, and uses one year of prison as the threshold.) The federal racketeering statute cited has an interstate commerce element; analogous state and foreign laws (per usual) do not, and therefore would fall outside \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(J) on Luna's reading. But if Congress had meant to so exclude those state and foreign counterparts, then \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(J)'s fnal clause\u2014\"for which a sentence of 5 years' imprisonment may be imposed\"\u2014would have been superfuous, because federal racketeering is always punishable by more than fve years' 464 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Opinion of the Court In an attempt to make some sense of his reading, Luna posits that Congress might have believed that crimes having an interstate connection are generally more serious than those lacking one\u2014for example, that interstate child pornog-raphy is \"worse\" than the intrastate variety. Brief for Peti-tioner 35. But to begin with, that theory cannot explain the set of crazy-quilt results just described: Not even Luna main-tains that Congress thought local acts of selling a child, re-ceiving explosives, or demanding a ransom are categorically less serious than, say, operating an unlawful casino or receiv-ing stolen property (whether or not in interstate commerce). And it is scarcely more plausible to view an interstate com-merce element in any given offense as separating serious from non-serious conduct: Why, for example, would Congress see an alien who carried out a kidnapping for ransom wholly within a State as materially less dangerous than one who crossed state lines in committing that crime? The essential harm of the crime is the same irrespective of state borders. Luna's argument thus misconceives the function of interstate commerce elements: Rather than distinguishing greater from lesser evils, they serve (as earlier explained) to connect a given substantive offense to one of Congress's enumerated powers. See supra, at 457. And still more fundamentally, Luna's account runs counter to the penultimate sentence's central message: that the national, local, or foreign character of a crime has no bearing on whether it is grave enough to warrant an alien's automatic removal. 9 imprisonment, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1963(a). That language's presence shows that Congress thought \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(J) would sweep in some state and for-eign laws: The fnal clause served to flter out such statutes when\u2014but only when\u2014they applied to less serious conduct than the federal rack-eteering offense. 9 The dissent attempts a variant of Luna's \"not so serious\" argument, but to no better effect. Claims the dissent: Even if Congress could not have viewed \"interstate crimes [as] worse than wholly intrastate crimes,\" it might have thought that, say, \"arsons prosecuted as federal crimes are more uniformly serious than arsons prosecuted as state crimes.\" Post, Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 465 Opinion of the Court Luna (and the dissent, see post, at 478) must therefore fall back on a different defense: that his approach would exclude from the universe of aggravated felonies fewer serious state and foreign offenses than one might think. To make that argument, Luna relies primarily on a part of the Act specify-ing that the term \"aggravated felony\" shall include \"a crime of violence (as defned in [18 U. S. C. \u00a7 16]) for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\" \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F); see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 16 (defning \"crime of violence\" as involving the use of \"physical force\" against the person or property of an-other). According to Luna, many state and foreign offenses failing to match the Act's listed federal statutes (for want of an interstate commerce element) would count as crimes of violence and, by that alternative route, trigger automatic re-moval. A different statutory phrase, or so Luna says, would thus plug the holes opened by his construction of the \"de-scribed in\" provisions. Luna's argument does not reassure us. We agree that state counterparts of some enumerated federal offenses would qualify as aggravated felonies through the \"crime of violence\" provision. But not nearly all such offenses, and not even the worst ones. Consider again some of the listed offenses described earlier. See supra, at 462-463. The \"crime of violence\" provision would not pick up demanding a at 486 (emphasis added). But we see no call to suppose that Congress regarded state prosecutions as Grapefruit League versions of the Big Show. Cf. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 427 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting). In our federal system, \"States possess primary authority for defning and enforcing\" criminal laws, including those prohibiting the gravest crimes. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993) (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 128 (1982)). For that reason, even when U. S. Attorneys have jurisdiction, they are generally to defer to, rather than supplant, state prosecutions of serious offenses. See U. S. Attor-neys' Manual: Principles of Federal Prosecution \u00a7 9-27.240 (1997). And still more obviously, the dissent's theory fails with respect to foreign con-victions. That a foreign sovereign prosecutes a given crime refects noth-ing about its gravity, but only about its location. 466 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Opinion of the Court ransom for kidnapping. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 875(a) (defning the crime without any reference to physical force). It would not cover most of the listed child pornography offenses, involving the distribution, receipt, and possession of such materials. It would not reach felon-in-possession laws and other frearms offenses. And indeed, it would not reach arson in the many States defning that crime to include the destruction of one's own property. See Jordison v. Gonzales, 501 F. 3d 1134, 1135 (CA9 2007) (holding that a violation of California's arson statute does not count as a crime of violence for that reason); Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29 (Solicitor General agreeing with that interpretation). 10 So under Luna's reading, state and for- eign counterparts to a broad swath of listed statutes would remain outside \u00a7 1101(a)(43)'s coverage merely because they lack an explicit interstate commerce connection. And for all the reasons discussed above, that result would signifcantly restrict the penultimate sentence's force and effect, and in an utterly random manner. 11 10 In all those States, arsons of every description (whether of one's own or another's property) would fall outside the \"crime of violence\" provision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, 46 (Solicitor General noting that the categorical approach to comparing federal and state crimes produces that effect). And contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 479, n. 2, that would be true of the most dangerous arsons, as well as of less serious ones. The dissent similarly fails to take into account the categorical approach's rigor-ous requirements when discussing a couple of the non-arson offenses dis-cussed above. (Still others, the dissent wholly ignores.) It speculates that if the exact right state charge is fled, some of that conduct \"may\" qualify, through the crime-of-violence provision or some other route, as an aggravated felony. Ibid. \"May\" is very much the operative word there, because\u2014depending on the elements of the state offense chosen\u2014that conduct also \"may not.\" And the dissent never explains why Congress would have left the deportation of dangerous felons to such prosecutorial happenstance. 11 The dissent well-nigh embraces those consequences, arguing that a narrow reading of \"aggravated felony\" would make more convicted crimi-nals removable under other statutory provisions, all of which allow for re- lief at the Attorney General's discretion. See post, at 480, 487 (lamenting that aliens convicted of aggravated felonies may not \"even appeal[ ] to the Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 467 Opinion of the Court B Just as important, a settled practice of distinguishing be- tween substantive and jurisdictional elements of federal criminal laws supports reading \u00a7 1101(a)(43) to include state analogues lacking an interstate commerce requirement. As already explained, the substantive elements of a federal stat-ute describe the evil Congress seeks to prevent; the jurisdic-tional element connects the law to one of Congress's enumer-ated powers, thus establishing legislative authority. See supra, at 457; ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.13(10) (1962). Both kinds of elements must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; and because that is so, both may play a real role in a criminal case. But still, they are not created equal for every purpose. To the contrary, courts have often recognized\u2014including when comparing federal and state of-fenses\u2014that Congress uses substantive and jurisdictional elements for different reasons and does not expect them to receive identical treatment. Consider the law respecting mens rea. In general, courts interpret criminal statutes to require that a defendant pos-sess a mens rea, or guilty mind, as to every element of an offense. See Elonis v. United States, 575 U. S. 723, 734-735 (2015). That is so even when the \"statute by its terms does not contain\" any demand of that kind. United States v. X- Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 70 (1994). In such cases, courts read the statute against a \"background rule\" that the defendant must know each fact making his conduct illegal. Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 619 (1994). Or other- wise said, they infer, absent an express indication to the contrary, that Congress intended such a mental-state requirement. mercy of the Attorney General\"). But Congress made a judgment that aliens convicted of certain serious offenses (irrespective of whether those convictions were based on federal, state, or foreign law) should be not only removable but also ineligible for discretionary relief. It is not our place to second-guess that decision. 468 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Opinion of the Court Except when it comes to jurisdictional elements. There, this Court has stated, \"the existence of the fact that confers federal jurisdiction need not be one in the mind of the actor at the time he perpetrates the act made criminal by the fed-eral statute.\" United States v. Feola, 420 U. S. 671, 676- 677, n. 9 (1975); see United States v. Yermian, 468 U. S. 63, 68 (1984) (\"Jurisdictional language need not contain the same culpability requirement as other elements of the offense\"); Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02. So when Congress has said noth-ing about the mental state pertaining to a jurisdictional ele-ment, the default rule fips: Courts assume that Congress wanted such an element to stand outside the otherwise appli-cable mens rea requirement. In line with that practice, courts have routinely held that a criminal defendant need not know of a federal crime's interstate commerce connection to be found guilty. See, e. g., United States v. Jinian, 725 F. 3d 954, 964-966 (CA9 2013); United Lindemann, 85 (CA7 1996); Blackmon, 839 900, 907 (CA2 1988). Those courts have recog-nized, as we do here, that Congress viewed the commerce element as distinct from, and subject to a different rule than, the elements describing the substantive offense. Still more strikingly, courts have distinguished between the two kinds of elements in contexts, similar to this one, in which the judicial task is to compare federal and state of-fenses. The Assimilative Crimes Act (ACA), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 13(a), subjects federal enclaves, like military bases, to state criminal laws except when they punish the same conduct as a federal statute. The ACA thus requires courts to decide when a federal and a state law are suffciently alike that only the federal one will apply. And we have held that, in mak-ing that assessment, courts should ignore jurisdictional ele-ments: When the \"differences among elements\" of the state and federal crimes \"refect jurisdictional, or other technical, considerations\" alone, then the state law will have no effect in the area. Lewis v. United States, 523 U. S. 155, 165 Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 469 Opinion of the Court (1998); see also id., at 182 (Kennedy , J., dissenting) (agreeing that courts should \"look beyond . . . jurisdictional elements,\" and focus only on substantive ones, in determining whether \"the elements of the two crimes are the same\"). In such a case, we reasoned\u2014just as we do now\u2014that Congress meant for the federal jurisdictional element to be set aside. And lower courts have uniformly adopted the same ap- proach when comparing federal and state crimes in order to apply the federal three-strikes statute. That law imposes mandatory life imprisonment on a person convicted on three separate occasions of a \"serious violent felony.\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3559(c)(1). Sounding very much like the INA, the three-strikes statute defnes such a felony to include \"a Federal or State offense, by whatever designation and wherever com-mitted, consisting of\" specifed crimes (e. g., murder, man- slaughter, robbery) \"as described in\" listed federal criminal statutes. \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F). In deciding whether a state crime of conviction thus corresponds to an enumerated fed-eral statute, every court to have faced the issue has ignored the statute's jurisdictional element. See, e. g., United States v. Rosario-Delgado , 198 F. 3d 1354, 1357 (CA11 1999) (per curiam ); United States v. Wicks, 132 F. 3d 383, 386-387 (CA7 1997). Judge Wood, writing for the Seventh Circuit, high-lighted the phrase \"a Federal or State offense, by whatever designation and wherever committed\"\u2014the three-strikes law's version of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)'s penultimate sentence. \"It is hard to see why Congress would have used this language,\" she reasoned, \"if it had meant that every detail of the federal offense, including its jurisdictional element[ ], had to be repli-cated in the state offense.\" Id., at 386-387. Just so, too, in the INA\u2014whose \"aggravated felony\" provisions operate against, and rely on, an established legal backdrop distin-guishing between jurisdictional and substantive elements. 12 12 The dissent declares our discussion of the three-strikes law, the ACA, and mens rea \"unhelpful\" on the ground that all three contexts are some- how \"differ[ent].\" Post, at 483-484. But what makes them relevantly so 470 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Opinion of the Court Luna objects to drawing that line on the ground that it is too hard to tell the difference between the two. See Brief for Petitioner 26-28 (discussing, in particular, statutes crimi-nalizing the destruction of federal property and sending threats via the Postal Service). But that contention collides with the judicial experience just described. Courts regu-larly separate substantive from jurisdictional elements in applying federal criminal statutes' mens rea requirements; so too in implementing other laws that require a comparison of federal and state offenses. And from all we can see, courts perform that task with no real trouble: Luna has not pointed to any divisions between or within Circuits arising from the practice. We do not deny that some tough ques- the dissent fails to explain. First, the dissent errs in suggesting that the uniform judicial interpretation of the three-strikes law ignores only \"place-based jurisdiction elements\" (because, so says the dissent, of the phrase \"wherever committed\"). Post, at 484-485. As Judge Wood's anal- ysis indicates, that is a theory of the dissent's own creation; the actual appellate decisions apply to all jurisdictional elements, not just territorial ones. Next, the dissent goes wrong in claiming that the ACA is not perti-nent because this Court adopted a different method for matching substan- tive elements under that law than under the INA. See post, at 482-483. For even as the Court made that choice, it unanimously agreed that, how-ever substantive elements should be compared, jurisdictional elements should be disregarded. See Lewis v. United States, 523 U. S. 155, 165 (1998); id., at 182 (Kennedy , J., dissenting). And fnally, the dissent does nothing to undermine our point on mens rea by noting that Congress very occasionally dispenses with that requirement for substantive elements. See post, at 483-484. As just shown, the default rule respecting mental states fips as between jurisdictional and substantive elements, see supra, at 468\u2014refecting the view (also at play in the three-strikes and ACA contexts) that Congress generally means to treat the two differently. That leaves the dissent with nothing except its observation that when applying the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt and jury-trial requirements, the Court does not distinguish between jurisdictional and substantive ele-ments. See post, at 482-483. But the dissent forgets that those com- mands are constitutional in nature; a principle of statutory interpretation distinguishing between the two kinds of elements, as best refecting Con-gress's intent, could not bear on those mandates. Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 471 Opinion of the Court tions may lurk on the margins\u2014where an element that makes evident Congress's regulatory power also might play a role in defning the behavior Congress thought harmful. But a standard interstate commerce element, of the kind ap-pearing in a great many federal laws, is almost always a simple jurisdictional hook\u2014and courts may as easily ac-knowledge that fact in enforcing the INA as they have done in other contexts. C Luna makes a fnal argument opposing our reading of \u00a7 1101(a)(43): If Congress had meant for \"ordinary state-law\" crimes like arson to count as aggravated felonies, it would have drafted the provision to make that self-evident. Id., at 20. Congress, Luna submits, would have used the ge-neric term for those crimes\u2014e. g., \"arson\"\u2014rather than de-manding that the state law of conviction correspond to a listed federal statute. See id., at 20-23. Or else, Luna (and the dissent) suggests, see id., at 24; post, at 485, Congress would have expressly distinguished between substantive and jurisdictional elements, as it did in an unrelated law mandat-ing the pretrial detention of any person convicted of a federal offense \"described in [a certain federal statute], or of a State or local offense that would have been an offense described in [that statute] if a circumstance giving rise to Federal juris-diction had existed,\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3142(e)(2)(A). But as an initial matter, Congress may have had good reason to think that a statutory reference would capture more accurately than a generic label the range of state con-victions warranting automatic deportation. The clause of \u00a7 1101(a)(43) applying to Luna's case well illustrates the point. By referring to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i), that provision in-corporates not only the garden-variety arson offenses that a generic \"arson\" label would cover, but various explosives offenses too. See Brief for Petitioner 23, n. 7 (conceding that had Congress used the term \"arson,\" it would have had to separately identify the explosives crimes encompassed in 472 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Opinion of the Court \u00a7 844(i)). And the elements of generic arson are themselves so uncertain as to pose problems for a court having to decide whether they are present in a given state law. See Poulos, The Metamorphosis of the Law of Arson, 51 Mo. L. Rev. 295, 364, 387-435 (1986) (describing multiple conficts over what conduct the term \"arson\" includes). Nor is the clause at issue here unusual in those respects: Section 1101(a)(43) in-cludes many other statutory references that do not convert easily to generic labels. See, e. g., \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii) (listing federal statutes defning various frearms offenses). To be sure, Congress used such labels to describe some crimes qualifying as aggravated felonies\u2014for example, \"murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\" \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). But what is good for some crimes is not for others. The use of a federal statutory reference shows only that Congress thought it the best way to identify certain substantive crimes\u2014not that Congress wanted (in confict with the pen-ultimate sentence) to exclude state and foreign versions of those offenses for lack of a jurisdictional element. Still more, Congress's omission of statutory language spe- cifcally directing courts to ignore those elements cannot tip the scales in Luna's favor. We have little doubt that \"Con-gress could have drafted [\u00a7 1101(a)(43)] with more precision than it did.\" Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U. S. 409, 422 (2005). But the same could be said of many (even most) stat-utes; as to that feature, \u00a7 1101(a)(43) can join a well-populated club. And we have long been mindful of that fact when interpreting laws. Rather than expecting (let alone demanding) perfection in drafting, we have routinely con-strued statutes to have a particular meaning even as we ac-knowledged that Congress could have expressed itself more clearly. See, e. g., ibid.; Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Picca- dilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. 33, 41 (2008); Scarborough v. United States, 431 U. S. 563, 570-571, 575 (1977). The ques-tion, then, is not: Could Congress have indicated (or even did Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 473 Sotomayor, J., dissenting Congress elsewhere indicate) in more crystalline fashion that comparisons of federal and state offenses should disregard elements that merely establish legislative jurisdiction? The question is instead, and more simply: Is that the right and fair reading of the statute before us? And the answer to that question, given the import of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)'s penultimate sentence and the well-settled background rule distinguishing between jurisdictional and substantive elements, is yes. III That reading of \u00a7 1101(a)(43) resolves this case. Luna has acknowledged that the New York arson law differs from the listed federal statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i), in only one respect: It lacks an interstate commerce element. See Pet. for Cert. 3. And Luna nowhere contests that \u00a7 844(i)'s com-merce element\u2014featuring the terms \"in interstate or foreign commerce\" and \"affecting interstate or foreign commerce\"\u2014 is of the standard, jurisdictional kind. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, 19; Scheidler , 547 U. S., commerce\" and \"in commerce\" as conventional \"juris-dictional language\"). For all the reasons we have given, such an element is properly ignored when determining if a state offense counts as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43). We accordingly affrm the judgment of the Second Circuit. It is so ordered. Justice Sotomayor , with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Breyer join, dissenting. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) metes out severe immigration consequences to a noncitizen convicted of any of a number of \"aggravated felon[ies].\" 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). offense \"described in\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i)\u2014 a federal arson statute\u2014qualifes as such a crime. In this case, petitioner, who goes by George Luna, was convicted of third-degree arson under N. Y . Penal Law Ann. 474 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Sotomayor, J., dissenting \u00a7 150.10 (West 2010), which punishes anyone who (1) \"inten- tionally\" (2) \"damages,\" by (3) \"starting a fre or causing an explosion,\" (4) \"a building or motor vehicle.\" By contrast, the federal arson statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i), applies when someone (1) \"maliciously\" (2) \"damages or destroys,\" (3) \"by means of fre or an explosive,\" (4) \"any building, vehicle, or other real or personal property\" (5) \"used in interstate or foreign commerce.\" There is one more element in the fed-eral offense than in the state offense\u2014(5), the interstate or foreign commerce element. Luna thus was not convicted of an offense \"described in\" the federal statute. Case closed. Not for the majority. It dubs the ffth element \"jurisdic- tional,\" then relies on contextual clues to read it out of the statute altogether. As a result of the majority's sleuthing, Luna\u2014a long-time legal permanent resident\u2014is foreclosed from even appealing to the sound discretion of the Attorney General to obtain relief from removal. Because precedent and the text and structure of the INA require the opposite result, I respectfully dissent. I A Noncitizens convicted of crimes face various consequences under the INA. Among the harshest of those consequences fall on noncitizens convicted of 1 of the approximately 80 \"ag-gravated felonies.\" A crime that falls into one of the listed provisions can be an aggravated felony \"whether in violation of Federal or State law\" or \"in violation of the law of a for-eign country.\" See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). An aggravated felony conviction has two primary reper- cussions for noncitizens: It renders them deportable, \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and it makes them categorically ineligible for several forms of immigration relief ordinarily left to the discretion of the Attorney General. See, e. g., \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(a)- (b) (cancellation of removal). Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 475 Sotomayor, J., dissenting The dozens of aggravated felonies in the INA are specifed in two main ways. First, some are specifed by reference to a generic crime. It is an aggravated felony, for instance, to commit \"murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\" \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Some of those crimes use a federal defni-tion as one of the elements. For example: \"Illicit traffcking in a controlled substance ( as defned in [21 U. S. C. \u00a7 802]).\" U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (emphasis added). (\"Illicit traf-fcking\" is a generic crime; the element of \"controlled sub-stance\" takes the meaning in 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 802, the \"Defni-tions\" provision of the Controlled Substances Act.) Second, it lists crimes that are wholly \"described in\" the Federal Criminal Code. See, e. g., \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(H) (\"an of- fense described in section 875, 876, 877, or 1202 of title 18 (relating to the demand for or receipt of ransom)\"); \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(I) (\"an offense described in section 2251, 2251A, or 2252 of title 18 (relating to child pornography)\"). The Government contends that Luna committed a crime in this second category: an \"offense described in\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i), which criminalizes arson. 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(i). B In 2006, Luna was found removable from the United States. He attempted to apply for cancellation of removal, a form of relief available to long-time legal permanent resi-dents at the discretion of the Attorney General. \u00a7 1229b(a). Nothing in Luna's history would otherwise preclude cancel-lation. He was the sole source of fnancial support for his U. S. citizen fance, enrolled in college and studying engineer- ing, a homeowner, and a law-abiding legal permanent resi-dent since he was brought to the United States as a child over 30 years ago, aside from the one third-degree arson con-viction at issue in this case, for which he served a day in jail. But the Immigration Judge found\u2014and the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Second Circuit confrmed\u2014 that Luna was ineligible for cancellation of removal. Luna's 476 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Sotomayor, J., dissenting New York State arson conviction, the judge held, qualifed as an aggravated felony under the provision for \"an offense described in\" \u00a7 844(i), a federal arson statute. See \u00a7 1101(a) (43)(E)(i). Aggravated felons are ineligible for cancella-tion of removal. See \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). Luna's cancellation-of-removal application was thus summarily denied. II But the offense of which Luna was convicted is not \"de- scribed in\" \u00a7 844(i). This Court's ordinary method of inter-preting the aggravated felony statute, the plain text of that provision, and the structure of the INA all confrm as much. A This is not the frst time the Court has been tasked with determining whether a state offense constitutes an \"aggra-vated felony\" under the INA. Until today, the Court has always required the state offense to match every element of the listed \"aggravated felony.\" Kawashima v. Holder , 565 U. S. 478, 482 (2012); see also Moncrieffe v. Holder , 569 U. S. 184, 190 (2013); Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder , 560 U. S. 563, 580 (2010); Nijhawan v. Holder , 557 U. S. 29, 33 (2009); Gon- zales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U. S. 183, 185 (2007); Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U. S. 47, 52-53 (2006); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 8 (2004). Our ordinary methodology thus confrms that the federal arson statute does not describe the New York arson statute under which Luna was convicted. As I have outlined above, see supra, at 474, the federal statute is more limited: It ap- plies only to fres that involve \"interstate or foreign com-merce.\" The state statute contains no such limitation. Thus, under the approach we have used in every case to date, the omission of the interstate commerce element means that Luna's state arson conviction was not an aggravated felony under the INA. Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 477 Sotomayor, J., dissenting B The plain language of the statute supports this straightfor- ward approach. The word \"describe\" means to \"express,\" \"portray,\" or \"represent.\" See Black's Law Dictionary 445 (6th ed. 1990); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 610 (1986). A description may be \"detailed\" or it may be general, setting forth only the \"recognizable features, or characteristic marks,\" of the thing described while leaving the rest to the imagination. 4 Oxford English Dictionary 512 (2d ed. 1989). For example, a Craigslist ad describing an apartment with \"in-unit laundry, a dishwasher, rooftop access, central A/C, and a walk-in closet\" may leave much to the imagination. After all, the description does not mention the apartment's square footage, windows, or foor number. But though the ad omits features, we would still call it a \"description\" because it accurately conveys the \"recognizable features\" of the apartment. However, even the most general description cannot refer to features that the thing being described does not have. The ad is only an accurate description if the apartment \"described in\" it has at least the fve features listed. If the apartment only has four of the fve listed features\u2014 there is no rooftop access, say, or the walk-in closet is not so much walk-in as shimmy-in\u2014then the Craigslist ad no longer \"describes\" the apartment. Rather, it misde- scribes it. So, too, with the statutes in this case. The federal de- scription can be general as long as it is still accurate\u2014that is, as long as the state law has at least all of the elements in the federal law. But there is no meaning of \"describe\" that allows the Court to say \u00a7 844(i) \"describes\" the New York offense when the New York offense only has four of the fve elements listed in \u00a7 844(i). Section 844(i) misdescribes the New York offense just as surely as the too-good-to-be-true Craigslist ad misdescribes the real-life apartment. 478 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Sotomayor, J., dissenting C The structure of the INA confrms that conclusion and makes clear that we need not contort the ordinary, accepted meaning of the phrase \"described in.\" The INA has many overlapping provisions that assign carefully calibrated conse-quences to various types of criminal convictions. The Court thus need not interpret any provision\u2014and certainly none of the aggravated felony provisions, among the harshest in the INA\u2014as broadly as possible because the INA as a whole ensures that serious criminal conduct is adequately captured. That overlapping structure is apparent throughout the INA. First, the aggravated felony list itself has multiple fail-safe provisions. Most serious offenses, for instance, will qualify as \"crime[s] of violence . . . for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year,\" 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a) (43)(F), even if they are not covered by a more specifc provi-sion in the aggravated felony list. Had his crime been charged as a more serious arson and had he been punished by one year of imprisonment instead of one day, Luna might have qualifed as an aggravated felon under that provision. See Santana v. Holder , 714 F. 3d 140, 145 (CA2 2013) (second-degree arson in New York is a \"crime of violence\"). 1 1 Many of the majority's own examples of \"the gravest\" state offenses supposedly excluded from the aggravated felony list by Luna's reading actually fall within these fail-safe provisions. Ante, at 462. Many state arsons will qualify as \"crime[s] of violence\" under 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a) (43)(F), see, e. g., Mbea v. Gonzales, 482 F. 3d 276, 279 (CA4 2007); an even greater fraction of the most serious arsons will fall under that head-ing because States like New York have enacted gradated statutes under which more severe degrees of arson are crimes of violence, see Santana, 714 F. 3d, at 145. To take another of the majority's examples, while a state conviction for demanding a ransom in a kidnaping is not \"an offense described in [18 U. S. C. \u00a7 875]\" under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(H), a state conviction for kidnaping or conspiring to kidnap may qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). See United States v. Kaplansky , 42 F. 3d 320 (CA6 1994). And even under the majority's reading, a state-law conviction will only qualify as an aggravated felony if the \"right state charge is fled.\" Ante, Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 479 Sotomayor, J., dissenting Second, other sections of the INA provide intertwining coverage for serious crimes. Some examples of provisions that encompass many offenses include those for the commis-sion of a \"crime involving moral turpitude,\" a frearms of-fense, or a controlled substance offense, all of which will ren-der a noncitizen removable, even if he or she has not committed an aggravated felony. See \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), 565 U. S. 42, 48 (2011) (commenting on the breadth of the \"crime involving moral turpitude\" provision). 2 And fnally, in Luna's case or anyone else's, the Attorney General can exercise her discretion to deny relief to a serious criminal whether or not that criminal has been convicted of an aggravated felony. See Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U. S., at 581 (doubting that a narrow reading of \u00a7 1101(a)(43) will have \"any practical effect on policing our Nation's borders\"). To be sure, on Luna's reading, some serious conduct may not be captured by the INA. But not nearly so much as the majority suggests. By contrast, once the aggravated felony statute applies to a noncitizen, no provision in the INA\u2014and at 466, n. 10. For example, even on the majority's reading, a state-court defendant who sells a child for purposes of child pornography is unlikely to be convicted of \"an offense described in [18 U. S. C.] \u00a7 2251A,\" see \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(I). That is because virtually no States have a statute corre-sponding to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2251A, with or without the interstate commerce element. (But see Fla. Stat. \u00a7 847.0145 (2015).) Such a defendant may, however, be convicted of a state offense that qualifes as an aggravated felony for conspiring to commit sexual abuse of a minor under 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(U) and 1101(a)(43)(A). 2 Other crimes in the majority's list of serious offenses, ante, at 462-463, will be covered by these separate INA provisions. For example, the Board of Immigration Appeals has held that any child pornography offense is a \"crime involving moral turpitude,\" rendering a noncitizen removable in many See \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), 1182(a)(2)(A)(i); In re Olquin- Rufno , 23 I. & N. Dec. 896 (BIA 2006). Any offense involving a gun would make a noncitizen deportable under one of the catchall provisions for buying, selling, or possessing a frearm in violation of \"any law.\" See \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C). 480 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Sotomayor, J., dissenting virtually no act by the Attorney General\u2014can prevent him or her from being removed. Looking for consistency in the aggravated felony provi- sions of the INA is often a fool's errand. See Kawashima, 565 U. S., at 497, n. 2 (Ginsburg , J., dissenting) (noting the absurdity of making a tax misdemeanor, but not driving while drunk and causing serious bodily injury, an aggravated felony). But the structure of the INA gives the Court no reason to read the aggravated felony provisions as broadly as possible. 3 That is why this Court has repeatedly cautioned against interpreting the aggravated felony section to sweep in offenses that\u2014like many state arson convictions\u2014may be neither aggravated nor felonies. See Carachuri-Rosendo , 560 U. S., at 574; Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 28-29 (collecting state misdemeanor arson statutes). 3 If the aggravated felony provisions were the primary mechanism for removing serious noncitizen criminals, we would expect any noncitizen convicted of an aggravated felony to face immigration consequences. In fact, the aggravated felony provisions only apply to noncitizens who are lawfully admitted or later paroled. Matter of Alyazji, 25 I. & N. Dec. 397, 399 (BIA 2011). Other noncitizens\u2014such as undocumented immigrants, noncitizens applying for a visa, or some legal permanent residents return-ing after an extended stay abroad\u2014cannot be removed based on the con-viction of an aggravated felony; the Government must rely on the other provisions of the INA, including the statute's other criminal provisions, to remove such noncitizens. See \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A), 1182, 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Similarly, if the aggravated felony provision were the only way to en- sure that the Attorney General exercised her discretion wisely, we would expect that discretion to be constrained as to all noncitizens who poten- tially pose a threat to the United States. In fact, the Attorney General is not prevented from granting cancellation of removal\u2014the discretionary relief at issue in this case\u2014to, for instance, a noncitizen who has not been convicted of a crime but is removable for having \"received military-type training\" from a terrorist organization. See \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(4)(B), 1182(a)(3) (B)(i)(VIII), 1229b(a). In short, it cannot be the case that the aggravated felony provisions were intended to be the statute's sole mechanism for identifying the most dangerous noncitizens. Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 481 Sotomayor, J., dissenting III The majority denies Luna the opportunity to present his case to the Attorney General based on two \"contextual con- siderations,\" ante, at 460, and an intuition about how the statute ought to work. None are suffciently persuasive to overcome the most natural reading of the aggravated fel-ony statute. A The majority frst perceives a confict between Luna's reading of the INA and what it calls the \"penultimate sen-tence\" of the aggravated felony statute. The \"penultimate sentence\" provides that an offense can be an aggravated fel-ony \"whether in violation of Federal or State law\" or \"in violation of the law of a foreign country.\" 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). The majority claims that Luna's reading of the INA would vitiate the quoted proviso. Ante, at 461-462. It is true that, on Luna's reading, some of the aggravated felonies listed in the INA (including \"an offense described in\" \u00a7 844(i)) will have no state or foreign analog. But the proviso still applies to generic offenses, which constitute nearly half of the entries in the aggravated felony list. See, e. g., \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), (G), (M)(i). And that already-large portion jumps to close to three-quarters of the offenses after counting those many listed federal statutes with no jurisdic-tional element. See, e. g., \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(C), (E)(ii), (J). In fact, it applies to the vast majority of offenses adjudicated under the INA given that most serious crimes are also \"crimes of violence.\" See \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). 4 And the majority must admit that its interpretation will also leave entries in the aggravated felony section with no state or foreign analogs. For instance, it seems unlikely 4 When the proviso was added to the INA in 1990, it would have applied to an even greater fraction of the aggravated felonies: At that time, the aggravated felony statute listed only fve offenses, four of which would have had state analogs even on Luna's reading. See 104 Stat. 5048 (1990). 482 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Sotomayor, J., dissenting that the proviso contemplates state analogs for the aggra- vated felony provisions regarding treason, levying war against the United States, or disclosing national defense in-formation. See \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(L)(i), (P). In other words, under Luna's reading, the \"penultimate sentence\" applies to most, but not all, of the entries of the aggravated felony statute; under the majority's reading, the \"penultimate sentence\" also applies to most, but not all, of the entries of the aggravated felony statute. The majority's frst \"contextual consideration\" thus supplies no reason to prefer one reading over the other. B Just as important, the majority suggests, is a \"settled practice of distinguishing between substantive . . . element[s],\" which merely \"estab-lis[h] legislative authority.\" Ante, at 467. The majority admits that the Court does not distinguish between substan- tive and jurisdictional elements for many purposes, such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the right to a jury trial. Ante , at 468; see Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 606 (2002). But it nonetheless insists on a standard distinction so en-trenched that Congress must have intended it to apply even absent any particular indication in the INA. None of the three examples that the majority proffers is evidence of such a strong norm. First, the majority invokes our rules for interpreting criminal statutes. Ante, at 468. Whereas our general assumption is that a defendant must know each fact making his conduct illegal, courts generally hold that a criminal defendant need not know the facts that satisfy the jurisdictional element of a statute. But jurisdictional elements are not the only elements a defendant need not know. Under the \"default rule,\" ante, at 470, n. 12 (emphasis deleted), for interpreting so-called \"public Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 483 Sotomayor, J., dissenting welfare\" offenses, courts have held that a defendant need not know that the substance he possesses is a narcotic, that the device he possesses is unregistered, or that he reentered the United States after previously being deported. See Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 606-609, 611 (1994) (citing United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250 (1922), and United States v. Freed, 401 U. S. 601 (1971)); United States v. Bur- well, 690 F. 3d 500, 508-509 (CADC 2012); United States v. Giambro , 544 F. 3d 26, 29 (CA1 2008); United States v. Martinez-Morel, 118 F. 3d 710, 715-717 (CA10 1997). But surely the majority would not suggest that if we agree with those holdings regarding mens rea, we must then ignore the \"controlled substance\" element of the drug traffcking aggra-vated felony, the \"unregistered\" element of the unregistered frearms aggravated felony, or the \"following deportation\" element of the illegal reentry aggravated felony. See 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), (E)(iii), (M)(i), (O). So there is likewise no reason to believe that the \"default rule\" for as-signing mens rea to jurisdictional elements is embedded in the INA. The majority next points to two of the many statutes that, like the INA, require comparing the elements of federal and state offenses. But in each case, it is the statute's language and context, not some \"settled practice,\" ante, at 467, that command the omission of the jurisdictional element. The majority's frst example, ante, at 468-469, is the As- similative Crimes Act, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 13(a), a gap-flling statute that incorporates state criminal law into federal enclaves if the \"act or omission\" is not \"made punishable by any enactment of Congress\" but \"would be punishable if committed or omit-ted within the jurisdiction of the State.\" The Court held that, in identifying such a gap, courts should ignore \"jurisdic-tional, or other technical,\" differences between a state and federal statute. Lewis v. United States, 523 U. S. 155, 165 (1998). But the way courts match the elements of a state 484 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Sotomayor, J., dissenting law to a federal analog under the Assimilative Crimes Act differs fundamentally from our INA inquiry. The basic question under the Assimilative Crimes Act is whether \"fed-eral statutes reveal an intent to occupy so much of a feld as would exclude the use of the particular state statute at issue.\" Id., at 164. Under the Assimilative Crimes Act, the state statute is not compared to a single federal statute, but rather to a complex of federal statutes that roughly cover the same general conduct and \"policies.\" Ibid. That statute thus has little to teach us about 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43): In interpreting the Assimilative Crimes Act, every Member of the Court rejected the simple elements-matching approach that the Court generally employs to con-strue the aggravated felony provisions of the INA. See 523 U. S., at 182 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (allowing \"slight dif- ferences\" in defnition between federal and state statute and using \"same-elements inquiry\" only as a \"starting point\"). The majority's analogy to the federal three strikes statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F), ante, at 469, is similarly unhelpful. That provision counts as a predicate \" `serious violent fel-ony' \" any \" `Federal or offense . . . wherever com- mitted, consisting of' \" various crimes, including several \" `as described in' \" federal statutes. Ante, at 469 (emphasis added). Though this Court has not construed the statute, the majority notes that courts of appeals disregard the juris-dictional element of federal statutes in assessing whether a state conviction is for a \"serious violent felony.\" Ibid. But nearly all of the statutes listed in \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F) contain place-based jurisdiction elements\u2014the crime must take place \"within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,\" e. g., \u00a7 1111(b), or within \"the special air- craft jurisdiction of the United States,\" 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 46502, and so on. In the two cases cited by the majority, for in-stance, ante, at 469, Courts of Appeals concluded that a state robbery offense qualifed as an offense \"described in\" the fed-eral bank robbery statute even though the robbery did not Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 485 Sotomayor, J., dissenting take place in a bank. See United States v. Wicks, 132 F. 3d 383, 387 (CA7 1997); United Rosario-Delgado , 198 F. 3d 1354, 1357 (CA11 1999). In that statute, it is the \"wherever committed,\" not some loose construction of \"de- scribed in,\" that specifcally instructs the courts that the lo-cation where a crime occurs does not matter. Moreover, in other statutes where Congress wants to exclude jurisdictional elements when comparing state and federal offenses, it ordinarily just says so. See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3142(e)(2)(A) (requiring detention of defendant pending trial if \"the person has been convicted . . . of a State or local offense that would have been an offense described in subsection (f)(1) of this section if a circumstance giving rise to Federal jurisdiction 5106a(b)(2)(B)(xvi)(I)-(II). Absent com-parably clear language, the Court should not presume that the INA intended deportability to depend on a not-so-\"settled practice,\" ante , at 467, of occasionally distinguishing between substantive and jurisdictional elements. C Finally, the majority suggests that it would be \"peculiarly perverse,\" ante, at 462, to adopt Luna's plain-text reading of the statute because it would draw a distinction among crimes based on a jurisdictional element that the majority assumes is wholly divorced from \"the evil Congress seeks to prevent,\" ante, at 467. The jurisdictional element of a federal statute, the majority asserts, is as trivial as the perfunctory warning on a new electronic device: \"[A] person would say that she had followed the instructions for setting up an iPhone that are `described in' the user's manual even if she in fact ig-nored the one\" instructing that she \"begin by `read[ing] im-portant safety information.' \" Ante, at 460, n. 5; see also ibid. (comparing jurisdictional element to a \" `detour' \" in a 3-week itinerary). 486 LUNA TORRES v. L YNCH Sotomayor, J., dissenting For instance, the majority assumes that it would not be \"plausible,\" ante, at 464, for Congress to have thought that interstate crimes are worse than wholly intrastate crimes. Perhaps. But when faced with an offense that, like arson, admits of a range of conduct, from the minor to the serious, Congress could plausibly have concluded that arsons prose- cuted as federal crimes are more uniformly serious than arsons prosecuted as state crimes and counted only the former as aggravated felonies. See, e. g., Klein et al., Why Federal Prosecutors Charge: A Comparison of Federal and New York State Arson and Robbery Filings, 2006- 2010, 51 Houston L. Rev. 1381, 1406, 1416-1419 (2014) (fnd- ing that arsons prosecuted federally involve more property damage and more injury than arsons prosecuted under state law). That is because, far from being token, \"conventional juris- dictional elements\" serve to narrow the kinds of crimes that can be prosecuted, not just to specify the sovereign that can do the prosecuting. Take the federal statute at issue in this case. Section 844(i) requires that the property destroyed be \"used in interstate . . . commerce.\" The Court has held that \"standard, jurisdictional\" element, ante, at 473, demands the property's \"active employment for commercial purposes, and not merely a passive, passing, or past connection to com-merce,\" Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 855 (2000). As a result, the Court held that a defendant who threw a Molo-tov cocktail through the window of an owner-occupied resi-dential house could not be guilty under \u00a7 844(i) because the house was not actively \" `used in' \" interstate commerce. Id., at 850-851. Surely, however, a New York prosecutor could have secured a conviction under N. Y . Penal Law Ann. \u00a7 150.10 had the same crime been prosecuted in state, rather than federal, court. The difference between an offense under N. Y . Penal Law Ann. \u00a7 150.10 and an offense under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 844(i) is thus more than a technical consideration about which authority Cite as: 578 U. S. 452 (2016) 487 Sotomayor, J., dissenting chooses to prosecute. It is a difference that goes to the magnitude and nature of the \"evil,\" ante, at 467, itself. * * * On the majority's reading, long-time legal permanent resi- dents with convictions for minor state offenses are foreclosed from even appealing to the mercy of the Attorney General. Against our standard method for comparing statutes and the text and structure of the INA, the majority stacks a sup-posed superfuity, a not-so-well-settled practice, and its con-viction that jurisdictional elements are mere technicalities. But an element is an element, and I would not so lightly strip a federal statute of one. I respectfully dissent. 488 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 Syllabus FOSTER v. CHATMAN, WARDEN certiorari to the supreme court of georgia No. 14-8349. Argued November 2, 2015\u2014Decided May 23, 2016 Petitioner Timothy Foster was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in a Georgia court. During jury selection at his trial, the State used peremptory challenges to strike all four black prospective jurors qualifed to serve on the jury. Foster argued that the State's use of those strikes was racially motivated, in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79. The trial court rejected that claim, and the Georgia Su-preme Court affrmed. Foster then renewed his Batson claim in a state habeas proceeding. While that proceeding was pending, Foster, through the Georgia Open Records Act, obtained from the State copies of the fle used by the prosecution during his trial. Among other docu-ments, the fle contained (1) copies of the jury venire list on which the names of each black prospective juror were highlighted in bright green, with a legend indicating that the highlighting \"represents Blacks\"; (2) a draft affdavit from an investigator comparing black prospective jurors and concluding, \"If it comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors, [this one] might be okay\"; (3) notes identifying black prospective jurors as \"B#1,\" \"B#2,\" and \"B#3\"; (4) notes with \"N\" (for \"no\") appear-ing next to the names of all black prospective jurors; (5) a list titled \"[D]efnite NO's\" containing six names, including the names of all of the qualifed black prospective jurors; (6) a document with notes on the Church of Christ that was annotated \"NO . No Black Church\"; and (7) the questionnaires flled out by fve prospective black jurors, on which each juror's response indicating his or her race had been circled. The state habeas court denied relief. It noted that Foster's Batson claim had been adjudicated on direct appeal. Because Foster's renewed Batson claim \"fail[ed] to demonstrate purposeful discrimination,\" the court concluded that he had failed to show \"any change in the facts suffcient to overcome\" the state law doctrine of res judicata. The Georgia Supreme Court denied Foster the Certifcate of Probable Cause necessary to fle an appeal. Held: 1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court denying Foster a Certifcate of Probable Cause on his Batson claim. Although this Court cannot ascertain the grounds for that unelaborated judgment, there is no indication that it rested on a state law ground that is both \"independent of the merits\" of Foster's Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 489 Syllabus Batson claim and an \"adequate basis\" for that decision, so as to preclude jurisdiction. Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 260. The state habeas court held that the state law doctrine of res judicata barred Foster's claim only by examining the entire record and determining that Foster had not alleged a change in facts suffcient to overcome the bar. Based on this lengthy \"Batson analysis,\" the state habeas court concluded that Foster's renewed Batson claim was \"without merit.\" Because the state court's application of res judicata thus \"depend[ed] on a federal constitu-tional ruling, [that] prong of the court's holding is not independent of federal law, and [this Court's] jurisdiction is not precluded.\" Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75; see also Three Affliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P . C., 467 U. S. 138, 152. Pp. 496-499. 2. The decision that Foster failed to show purposeful discrimination was clearly erroneous. Pp. 499-514. (a) Batson provides a three-step process for adjudicating claims such as Foster's. \"First, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question; and third, in light of the parties' submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.\" Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472, 477 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Only Batson's third step is at issue here. That step turns on factual fndings made by the lower courts, and this Court will defer to those fndings unless they are clearly erroneous. See 552 U. S., at 477. Pp. 499-501. (b) Foster established purposeful discrimination in the State's strikes of two black prospective jurors: Marilyn Garrett and Eddie Hood. Though the trial court accepted the prosecution's justifcations for both strikes, the record belies much of the prosecution's reasoning. Pp. 501-512. (i) The prosecution explained to the trial court that it made a last-minute decision to strike Garrett only after another juror, Shirley Powell, was excused for cause on the morning that the strikes were exercised. That explanation is fatly contradicted by evidence showing that Garrett's name appeared on the prosecution's list of \"[D]efnite NO's\"\u2014the six prospective jurors whom the prosecution was intent on striking from the outset. The record also refutes several of the reasons the prosecution gave for striking Garrett instead of Arlene Blackmon, a white prospective juror. For example, while the State told the trial court that it struck Garrett because the defense did not ask her for her thoughts about such pertinent trial issues as insanity, alcohol, or pre-490 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Syllabus trial publicity, the record reveals that the defense asked Garrett multi- ple questions on each topic. And though the State gave other facially reasonable justifcations for striking Garrett, those are diffcult to credit because of the State's willingness to accept white jurors with the same characteristics. For example, the prosecution claims that it struck Gar- rett because she was divorced and, at age 34, too young, but three out of four divorced white prospective jurors and eight white prospective jurors under age 36 were allowed to serve. Pp. 501-507. (ii) With regard to prospective juror Hood, the record similarly undermines the justifcations proffered by the State to the trial court for the strike. For example, the prosecution alleged in response to Foster's pretrial Batson challenge that its only concern with Hood was the fact that his son was the same age as the defendant. But then, at a subse-quent hearing, the State told the court that its chief concern was with Hood's membership in the Church of Christ. In the end, neither of those reasons for striking Hood withstands scrutiny. As to the age of Hood's son, the prosecution allowed white prospective jurors with sons of similar age to serve, including one who, in contrast to Hood, equivo-cated when asked whether Foster's age would be a factor at sentencing. And as to Hood's religion, the prosecution erroneously claimed that three white Church of Christ members were excused for cause because of their opposition to the death penalty, when in fact the record shows that those jurors were excused for reasons unrelated to their views on the death penalty. Moreover, a document acquired from the State's fle contains a handwritten note stating, \"NO . NO Black Church,\" while asserting that the Church of Christ does not take a stand on the death penalty. Other justifcations for striking Hood fail to withstand scru-tiny because no concerns were expressed with regard to similar white prospective jurors. Pp. 507-512. (c) Evidence that a prosecutor's reasons for striking a black pro- spective juror apply equally to an otherwise similar nonblack prospec-tive juror who is allowed to serve tends to suggest purposeful discrimi-nation. Miller-El v. Dretke , 545 U. S. 231, 241. Such evidence is compelling with respect to Garrett and Hood and, along with the prose- cution's shifting explanations, misrepresentations of the record, and persistent focus on race, leads to the conclusion that the striking of those prospective jurors was \"motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\" Snyder , 552 U. S., at 485. Pp. 512-513. (d) Because Batson was decided only months before Foster's trial, the State asserts that the focus on black prospective jurors in the prose-cution's fle was an effort to develop and maintain a detailed account should the prosecution need a defense against any suggestion that its reasons were pretextual. That argument, having never before been Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 491 Opinion of the Court raised in the 30 years since Foster's trial, \"reeks of afterthought.\" Miller-El, 545 U. S., at 246. And the focus on race in the prosecution's fle plainly demonstrates a concerted effort to keep black prospective jurors off the jury. Pp. 513-514. Reversed and remanded. Roberts, C.

Olens, Attorney General, Sabrina D. Graham, Se- nior Assistant Attorney General, and Richard W. Tangum, Assistant Attorney General.* Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court. Petitioner Timothy Foster was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in a Georgia court. During jury se-lection at his trial, the State exercised peremptory strikes against all four black prospective jurors qualifed to serve. Foster argued that the State's use of those strikes was ra-cially motivated, in violation of our decision in Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986). The trial court and the Geor- gia Supreme Court rejected Foster's Batson claim. Foster then sought a writ of habeas corpus from the Supe- rior Court of Butts County, Georgia, renewing his Batson objection. That court denied relief, and the Georgia Su-preme Court declined to issue the Certifcate of Probable Cause necessary under Georgia law for Foster to pursue an appeal. We granted certiorari and now reverse. *Paul M. Smith and Michael B. DeSanctis fled a brief for Joseph diGen- ova et al. as amici curiae urging reversal. 492 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court I On the morning of August 28, 1986, police found Queen Madge White dead on the foor of her home in Rome, Geor- gia. White, a 79-year-old widow, had been beaten, sexually assaulted, and strangled to death. Her home had been bur-glarized. Timothy Foster subsequently confessed to killing White, and White's possessions were recovered from Fos-ter's home and from Foster's two sisters. The State in-dicted Foster on charges of malice murder and burglary. He faced the death penalty. Foster v. State , 258 Ga. 736, 374 S. E. 2d 188 (1988). District Attorney Stephen Lanier and Assistant District Attorney Douglas Pullen represented the State at trial. Jury selection proceeded in two phases: removals for cause and peremptory strikes. In the frst phase, each prospective juror completed a detailed questionnaire, which the prosecu-tion and defense reviewed. The trial court then conducted a juror-by-juror voir dire of approximately 90 prospective jurors. Throughout this process, both parties had the op-portunity to question the prospective jurors and lodge chal-lenges for cause. This frst phase whittled the list down to 42 \"qualifed\" prospective jurors. Five were black. In the second phase, known as the \"striking of the jury,\" both parties had the opportunity to exercise peremptory strikes against the array of qualifed jurors. Pursuant to state law, the prosecution had ten such strikes; Foster twenty. See Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-12-165 (1985). The proc-ess worked as follows: The clerk of the court called the quali-fed prospective jurors one by one, and the State had the option to exercise one of its peremptory strikes. If the State declined to strike a particular prospective juror, Foster then had the opportunity to do so. If neither party exer-cised a peremptory strike, the prospective juror was selected for service. This second phase continued until 12 jurors had been accepted. Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 493 Opinion of the Court The morning the second phase began, Shirley Powell, one of the fve qualifed black prospective jurors, notifed the court that she had just learned that one of her close friends was related to Foster. The court removed Powell for cause. That left four black prospective jurors: Eddie Hood, Evelyn Hardge, Mary Turner, and Marilyn Garrett. The striking of the jury then commenced. The State ex- ercised nine of its ten allotted peremptory strikes, removing all four of the remaining black prospective jurors. Foster immediately lodged a Batson challenge. The trial court re- jected the objection and empaneled the jury. The jury con-victed Foster and sentenced him to death. Following sentencing, Foster renewed his Batson claim in a motion for a new trial. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion. The Georgia Supreme Court affrmed, 258 Ga., at 747, 374 S. E. 2d, at 197, and we denied certiorari, Foster v. Georgia, 490 U. S. 1085 (1989). Foster subsequently sought a writ of habeas corpus from the Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia, again pressing his Batson claim. While the state habeas proceeding was pending, Foster fled a series of requests under the Georgia Open Records Act, see Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 50-18-70 to 50-18- 77 (2002), seeking access to the State's fle from his 1987 trial. In response, the State disclosed documents related to the jury selection at that trial. Over the State's objections, the state habeas court admitted those documents into evidence. They included the following: (1) Four copies of the jury venire list. On each copy, the names of the black prospective jurors were highlighted in bright green. A legend in the upper right corner of the lists indicated that the green highlighting \"represents Blacks.\" See, e. g., App. 253. The letter \"B\" also appeared next to each black prospective juror's name. See, e. g., ibid. Ac- cording to the testimony of Clayton Lundy, an investigator who assisted the prosecution during jury selection, these 494 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court highlighted venire lists were circulated in the district attor- ney's offce during jury selection. That allowed \"everybody in offce\"\u2014approximately \"10 to 12 people,\" including \"[s]ecretaries, investigators, [and] district attorneys\"\u2014to look at them, share information, and contribute thoughts on whether the prosecution should strike a particular juror. Pl. Exh. 1, 2 Record 190, 219 (Lundy deposition) (hereinafter Tr.). The documents, Lundy testifed, were returned to La-nier before jury selection. Id., at 220. (2) A draft of an affdavit that had been prepared by Lundy \"at Lanier's request\" for submission to the state trial court in response to Foster's motion for a new trial. Id., at 203. The typed draft detailed Lundy's views on ten black prospective jurors, stating \"[m]y evaluation of the jurors are a[s] follows.\" App. 343. Under the name of one of those jurors, Lundy had written: \"If it comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors, [this one] might be okay. This is solely my opin-ion. . . . Upon picking of the jury after listening to all of the jurors we had to pick, if we had to pick a black juror I recommend that [this juror] be one of the jurors.\" Id., at 345 (paragraph break omitted). That text had been crossed out by hand; the version of the affdavit fled with the trial court did not contain the crossed-out language. See id., at 127-129. Lundy testifed that he \"guess[ed]\" the redactions had been done by Lanier. Tr. 203. (3) Three handwritten notes on black prospective jurors Eddie Hood, Louise Wilson, and Corrie Hinds. Annotations denoted 295-297. Lundy testifed that these were examples of the type of \"notes that the team\u2014the State would take down during voir dire to help select the jury in Mr. Foster's case.\" Tr. 208-210. Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 495 Opinion of the Court (4) A typed list of the qualifed jurors remaining after voir dire . App. 287-290. It included \"Ns\" next to ten ju- rors' names, which Lundy told the state habeas court \"signi- f[ied] the ten jurors that the State had strikes for during jury selection.\" Tr. 211. Such an \"N\" appeared alongside the names of all fve qualifed black prospective jurors. See App. 287-290. The fle also included a handwritten version of the same list, with the same markings. Id., at 299-300; see Tr. 212. Lundy testifed that he was unsure who had prepared or marked the two lists. (5) A handwritten document titled \"defnite NO's,\" listing six names. The frst fve were those of the fve qualifed black prospective jurors. App. 301. The State concedes that either Lanier or Pullen compiled the list, which Lundy testifed was \"used for preparation in jury selection.\" Tr. 215; Tr. of Oral Arg. 45. (6) A handwritten document titled \"Church of Christ.\" A notation on the document read: \"NO . No Black Church.\" App. 302. (7) The questionnaires that had been completed by several of the black prospective jurors. On each one, the juror's re-sponse indicating his or her race had been circled. Id., at 311, 317, 323, 329, 334. In response to the admission of this evidence, the State introduced short affdavits from Lanier and Pullen. La-nier's affdavit stated: \"I did not make any of the highlighted marks on the jury venire list. It was common practice in the offce to highlight in yellow those jurors who had prior case experience. I did not instruct anyone to make the green highlighted marks. I reaffrm my testimony made during the motion for new trial hearing as to how I used my peremptory jury strikes and the basis and reasons for those strikes.\" Id., at 169 (paragraph nu- meral omitted). 496 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court Pullen's affdavit averred: \"I did not make any of the highlighted marks on the jury venire list, and I did not instruct anyone else to make the highlighted marks. I did not rely on the high-lighted jury venire list in making my decision on how to use my peremptory strikes.\" Id., at 171 (paragraph numeral omitted). Neither affdavit provided further explanation of the docu-ments, and neither Lanier nor Pullen testifed in the habeas proceeding. After considering the evidence, the state habeas court de- nied relief. The court frst stated that, matter,\" Foster's Batson claim was \"not reviewable based on the doctrine of res judicata\" because it had been \"raised and litigated adversely to [Foster] on his direct appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.\" App. 175. The court nonethe-less announced that it would \"mak[e] fndings of fact and con-clusions of law\" on that claim. Id., at 191. Based on what it referred to as a \"Batson . . . analysis,\" the claim is without merit,\" be- cause he had \"fail[ed] to demonstrate purposeful discrimina-tion.\" Id., at 192, 195, 196. The Georgia Supreme Court denied Foster the \"Certifcate of Probable Cause\" necessary under state law for him to pur-sue an appeal, determining that his claim had no \"arguable merit.\" Id., at 246; see Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-14-52 (2014); Ga. Sup. Ct. Rule 36 (2014). We granted certiorari. 575 U. S. 1025 (2015). II Before turning to the merits of Foster's Batson claim, we address a threshold issue. Neither party contests our juris-diction to review Foster's claims, but we \"have an independ-ent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdic-tion exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party.\" Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006). Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 497 Opinion of the Court This Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a federal claim on review of a state court judgment \"if that judgment rests on a state-law ground that is both `independent' of the merits of the federal claim and an `adequate' basis for the court's decision.\" Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 260 (1989). The state habeas court noted that Foster's Batson claim was \"not reviewable based on the doctrine of res judicata\" under Georgia law. App. 175. The Georgia Supreme Court's unelaborated order on review provides no reasoning for its decision. 1 That raises the question whether the Geor- gia Supreme Court's order\u2014the judgment from which Fos-ter sought certiorari 2\u2014rests on an adequate and independ- ent state law ground so as to preclude our jurisdiction over Foster's federal claim. We conclude that it does not. When application of a state law bar \"depends on a federal constitutional ruling, the state-law prong of the court's holding is not independent of federal law, and our jurisdiction is not precluded.\" Ake v. 1 The order stated, in its entirety: \"Upon consideration of the Applica- tion for Certifcate of Probable Cause to appeal the denial of habeas cor- pus, it is ordered that it be hereby denied. All the Justices concur, except Benham, J., who dissents.\" App. 246. 2 We construe Foster's petition for writ of certiorari as seeking review of the Georgia Supreme Court's order denying him a \"Certifcate of Probable Cause.\" App. 246. The Georgia Supreme Court Rules provide that such a certifcate \"will be issued where there is arguable merit.\" 1231- 1232 (CA11 2014). A decision by the Georgia Supreme Court that Fos-ter's appeal had no \"arguable merit\" would seem to be a decision on the merits of his claim. In such circumstances the Georgia Supreme Court's order is subject to review in this Court pursuant to a writ of certiorari under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1257(a). R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Durham County , 479 U. S. 130, 138-139 (1986); see Sears v. Upton, 561 U. S. 945 (2010) (per curiam ) (exercising jurisdiction over order from Georgia Su- preme Court denying a Certifcate of Probable Cause). We reach the con-clusion that such an order is a decision on the merits \"[i]n the absence of positive assurance to the contrary\" from the Georgia Supreme Court. R. J. Reynolds, 479 U. S., at 138. 498 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75 (1985); see also Three Affliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P . C., 467 U. S. 138, 152 (1984). In this case, the Georgia habeas court's analysis in the sec- tion of its opinion labeled \"Batson claim\" proceeded as follows: \"The [State] argues that this claim is not reviewable due to the doctrine of res judicata. However, because [Fos-ter] claims that additional evidence allegedly supporting this ground was discovered subsequent to the Georgia Supreme Court's ruling [on direct appeal], this court will review the Batson claim as to whether [Foster] has shown any change in the facts suffcient to overcome the res judicata bar.\" App. 192. To determine whether Foster had alleged a suffcient \"change in the facts,\" the habeas court engaged in four pages of what it termed a \"Batson . . . analysis,\" in which it evalu- ated the original trial record and habeas record, including the newly uncovered prosecution fle. Id., at 192-196. Ul- timately, that court concluded that Foster's \"renewed Batson claim is without merit.\" Id., at 196 (emphasis added). In light of the foregoing, it is apparent that the state ha- beas court's application of res judicata to Foster's Batson claim was not independent of the merits of his federal consti-tutional challenge. 3 That court's invocation of res judicata 3 Contrary to the dissent's assertion, see post, at 529-531 (opinion of Thomas, J.), it is perfectly consistent with this Court's past practices to re- view a lower court decision\u2014in this case, that of the Georgia habeas court\u2014 in order to ascertain whether a federal question may be implicated in an unreasoned summary order from a higher court. See, e. g., R. J. Reyn- olds, 479 U. S., at 136-139 (exercising \u00a7 1257 jurisdiction over unreasoned judgment by the North Carolina Supreme Court after examining grounds of decision posited by North Carolina Court of Appeals); see also S. Sha-piro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E. Hartnett, & D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice 211 (10th ed. 2013) (\"[W]here the state court opinion fails to yield precise answers as to the grounds of decision, the Court may be forced to Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 499 Opinion of the Court therefore poses no impediment to our review of Foster's Batson claim. See Ake, 470 U. S., at 75.4 III A The \"Constitution forbids striking even a single prospec- tive juror for a discriminatory purpose.\" Snyder v. Louisi- ana, 552 U. S. 472, 478 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit-ted). Our decision in Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79, provides a three-step process for determining when a strike is discriminatory: \"First, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question; and third, in light of the parties' submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.\" Sny- turn to other parts of the record, such as pleadings, motions, and trial court rulings, to determine if a federal claim is so central to the contro-versy as to preclude resting the judgment on independent and adequate state grounds.\"). And even the dissent does not follow its own rule. It too goes beyond the unreasoned order of the Georgia Supreme Court in determining that the \"likely explanation for the court's denial of habeas relief is that Foster's claim is procedurally barred.\" Post, at 525. There would be no way to know this, of course, from the face of the Georgia Supreme Court's summary order. 4 The concurrence notes that the \"res judicata rule applied by the Supe- rior Court in this case is quite different\" from the state procedural bar at issue in Ake, which was \"entirely dependent on federal law.\" Post, at 521-522 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment). But whether a state law determination is characterized as \"entirely dependent on,\" ibid., \"resting primarily on,\" Stewart v. 860 (2002) (per curiam ), or \"infuenced by\" a question of federal law, Three Affliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P . C., 467 U. S. 138, 152 (1984), the result is the same: The state law determination is not independent of federal law and thus poses no bar to our jurisdiction. 500 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court der, 552 U. S., at 476-477 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Both parties agree that Foster has demonstrated a prima facie case, and that the prosecutors have offered race-neutral reasons for their strikes. We therefore address only Bat- son's third step. That step turns on factual determinations, and, \"in the absence of exceptional circumstances,\" we defer to state court factual fndings unless we conclude that they are clearly erroneous. Snyder , 552 U. S., at 477. Before reviewing the factual record in this case, a brief word is in order regarding the contents of the prosecution's fle that Foster obtained through his Georgia Open Records Act requests. Pursuant to those requests, Foster received a \"certif[ied] . . . true and correct copy of 103 pages of the State's case fle\" from his 1987 trial. App. 247. The State argues that \"because [Foster] did not call either of the prose-cutors to the stand\" to testify in his state habeas proceed-ings, \"he can only speculate as to the meaning of various markings and writings\" on those pages, \"the author of many of them, and whether the two prosecutors at trial (District Attorney Lanier and Assistant District Attorney Pullen) even saw many of them.\" Brief for Respondent 20. For these reasons, the State argues, \"none of the specifc pieces of new evidence [found in the fle] shows an intent to discrim-inate.\" Ibid. (capitalization omitted). For his part, Foster argues that \"[t]here is no question that the prosecutors used the lists and notes, which came from the prosecution's fle and were certifed as such,\" and therefore the \"source of the lists and notes, their timing, and their purpose is hardly `un-known' or based on `conjecture.' \" Reply Brief 4-5 (quoting Brief for Respondent 27-28). The State concedes that the prosecutors themselves au- thored some documents, see, e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (admit- ting that one of the two prosecutors must have written the list titled \"defnite NO's\"), and Lundy's testimony strongly suggests that the prosecutors viewed others, see, e. g., Tr. Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 501 Opinion of the Court 220 (noting that the highlighted jury venire lists were re- turned to Lanier prior to jury selection). There are, how-ever, genuine questions that remain about the provenance of other documents. Nothing in the record, for example, iden-tifes the author of the notes that listed three black prospec-tive jurors as \"B#1,\" \"B#2,\" and \"B#3.\" Such notes, then, are not necessarily attributable directly to the prosecutors themselves. The state habeas court was cognizant of those limitations, but nevertheless admitted the fle into evidence, reserving \"a determination as to what weight the Court is going to put on any of [them]\" in light of the objections urged by the State. 1 Record 20. We agree with that approach. Despite questions about the background of particular notes, we cannot accept the State's invitation to blind ourselves to their existence. We have \"made it clear that in considering a Batson objection, or in reviewing a ruling claimed to be Batson error, all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animos-ity must be consulted.\" Snyder, 552 U. S., at 478. As we have said in a related context, \"[d]etermining whether invidi-ous discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial . . . evidence of intent as may be available.\" Arlington Heights v. Metro- politan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266 (1977). At a minimum, we are comfortable that all docu-ments in the fle were authored by someone in the district attorney's offce. Any uncertainties concerning the docu-ments are pertinent only as potential limits on their proba-tive value. B Foster centers his Batson claim on the strikes of two black prospective jurors, Marilyn Garrett and Eddie Hood. We turn frst to Marilyn Garrett. According to Lanier, on the morning that the State was to use its strikes he had not yet made up his mind to remove Garrett. Rather, he decided to strike her only after learning that he would not need to use 502 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court a strike on another black prospective juror, Shirley Powell, who was excused for cause that morning. Ultimately, Lanier did strike Garrett. In justifying that strike to the trial court, he articulated a laundry list of rea-sons. Specifcally, Lanier objected to Garrett because she: (1) worked with disadvantaged youth in her job as a teach- er's aide; (2) kept looking at the ground during voir dire; (3) gave short and curt answers during voir dire; (4) appeared nervous; (5) was too young; (6) misrepresented her familiar-ity with the location of the crime; (7) failed to disclose that her cousin had been arrested on a drug charge; (8) was di-vorced; (9) had two children and two jobs; (10) was asked few questions by the defense; and (11) did not ask to be ex-cused from jury service. See App. 55-57 (pretrial hearing); id., at 93-98, 105, 108, 110-112 (new trial hearing); Record in No. 45609 (Ga. 1988), pp. 439-440 (hereinafter Trial Record) (brief in opposition to new trial). The trial court accepted Lanier's justifcations, concluding that \"[i]n the totality of circumstances,\" there was \"no dis-criminatory intent, and that there existed reasonably clear, specifc, and legitimate reasons\" for the strike. App. 143. On their face, Lanier's justifcations for the strike seem rea-sonable enough. Our independent examination of the rec-ord, however, reveals that much of the reasoning provided by Lanier has no grounding in fact. Lanier's misrepresentations to the trial court began with an elaborate explanation of how he ultimately came to strike Garrett: \"[T]he prosecution considered this juror [to have] the most potential to choose from out of the four remaining blacks in the 42 [member] panel venire. However, a sys-tem of events took place on the morning of jury selection that caused the excusal of this juror. The [S]tate had, in his jury notes, listed this juror as questionable . The four negative challenges were allocated for Hardge, Hood, Turner and Powell. . . . But on the morning of Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 503 Opinion of the Court jury selection, Juror Powell was excused for cause with no objections by [d]efense counsel. She was replaced by Juror Cadle [who] was acceptable to the State. This left the State with an additional strike it had not antici-pated or allocated. Consequently, the State had to choose between [white] Juror Blackmon or Juror Gar-rett, the only two questionable jurors the State had left on the list.\" Trial Record 438-439 (brief in opposition to new trial) (emphasis added and citations omitted). Lanier then offered an extensive list of reasons for striking Garrett and explained that \"[t]hese factors, with no reference to race, were considered by the prosecutor in this particular case to result in a juror less desirable from the prosecutor's viewpoint than Juror Blackmon.\" Id., at 441 (emphasis deleted). Lanier then compared Blackmon to Garrett. In contrast to Garrett, Juror Blackmon \"was 46 years old, married 13 years to her husband who works at GE, buying her own home and [was recom-mended by a third party to] this prosecutor. She was no longer employed at Northwest Georgia Regional Hospital and she attended Catholic church on an irregu-lar basis. She did not hesitate when answering the questions concerning the death penalty, had good eye contact with the prosecutor and gave good answers on the insanity issue. She was perceived by the prosecu-tor as having a stable home environment, of the right age and no association with any disadvantaged youth or-ganizations.\" Ibid. Lanier concluded that \"the chances of [Blackmon] returning a death sentence were greater when all these factors were considered than Juror Garrett. Consequently, Juror Garrett was excused.\" Ibid. The trial court accepted this explanation in denying Fos- ter's motion for a new trial. See App. 142-143. But the 504 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court predicate for the State's account\u2014that Garrett was \"listed\" by the prosecution as \"questionable,\" making that strike a last-minute race-neutral decision\u2014was false. During jury selection, the State went frst. As a conse- quence, the defense could accept any prospective juror not struck by the State without any further opportunity for the State to use a strike against that prospective juror. Accord-ingly, the State had to \"pretty well select the ten specifc people [it] intend[ed] to strike\" in advance. Id., at 83 (pre- trial hearing); accord, ibid. (Lanier testimony) (\"[T]he ten people that we felt very uncomfortable with, we have to know up front.\"). The record evidence shows that Garrett was one of those \"ten specifc people.\" That much is evident from the \"defnite NO's\" list in the prosecution's fle. Garrett's name appeared on that list, which the State concedes was written by one of the prosecu-tors. Tr. of Oral Arg. 45. That list belies Lanier's asser-tion that the State considered allowing Garrett to serve. The title of the list meant what it said: Garrett was a \"def-nite NO.\" App. 301 (emphasis added). The State from the outset was intent on ensuring that none of the jurors on that list would serve. The frst fve names on the \"defnite NO's\" list were Eddie Hood, Evelyn Hardge, Shirley Powell, Marilyn Garrett, and Mary Turner. All were black. The State struck each one except Powell (who, as discussed, was excused for cause at the last minute\u2014though the prosecution informed the trial court that the \"State was not, under any circumstances, going to take [Powell],\" Trial Record 439 (brief in opposition to new trial)). Only in the number six position did a white prospective juror appear, and she had informed the court during voir dire that she could not \"say positively\" that she could impose the death penalty even if the evidence war-ranted it. 6 Tr. in No. 86-2218-2 (Super. Ct. Floyd Cty., Ga., 1987), p. 1152 (hereinafter Trial Transcript); see also id., at 1153-1158. In short, contrary to the prosecution's submis-Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 505 Opinion of the Court sions, the State's resolve to strike Garrett was never in doubt. See also App. 290 (\"N\" appears next to Garrett's name on juror list); id., at 300 (same). The State attempts to explain away the contradiction be- tween the \"defnite NO's\" list and Lanier's statements to the trial court as an example of a prosecutor merely \"misspeak-[ing].\" Brief for Respondent 51. But this was not some off-the-cuff remark; it was an intricate story expounded by the prosecution in writing, laid out over three single-spaced pages in a brief fled with the trial court. Moreover, several of Lanier's reasons for why he chose Garrett over Blackmon are similarly contradicted by the rec- ord. Lanier told the court, for example, that he struck Gar-rett because \"the defense did not ask her questions about\" pertinent trial issues such as her thoughts on \"insanity\" or \"alcohol,\" or \"much questions on publicity.\" App. 56 (pre-trial hearing). But the trial transcripts reveal that the de-fense asked her several questions on all three topics. See 5 Trial Transcript 955-956 (two questions on insanity and one on mental illness); ibid. (four questions on alcohol); id., at 956-957 (fve questions on publicity). Still other explanations given by the prosecution, while not explicitly contradicted by the record, are diffcult to credit because the State willingly accepted white jurors with the same traits that supposedly rendered Garrett an unat-tractive juror. Lanier told the trial court that he struck Garrett because she was divorced. App. 56 (pretrial hear-ing). But he declined to strike three out of the four prospec-tive white jurors who were also divorced. See Juror Ques-tionnaire in No. 86-2218-2 (Super. Ct. Floyd Cty., Ga., 1987) (hereinafter Juror Questionnaire), for Juror No. 23, p. 2 (juror Coultas, divorced); id., No. 33, p. 2 (juror Cochran, divorced); id., No. 107, p. 2 (juror Hatch, divorced); App. 23- 24, 31 (State accepting jurors Coultas, Cochran, and Hatch). Additionally, Lanier claimed that he struck Garrett because she was too young, and the \"State was looking for older ju-506 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court rors that would not easily identify with the defendant.\" Trial Record 439 (brief in opposition to new trial); see App. 55 (pretrial hearing). Yet Garrett was 34, and the State declined to strike eight white prospective jurors under the age of 36. See Trial Record 439; Juror Questionnaire No. 4, p. 1; id., No. 10, p. 1; id., No. 23, p. 1; id., No. 48, p. 1; id., No. 70, p. 1; id., No. 71, p. 1; id., No. 92, p. 1; id., No. 106, p. 1; see App. 22-31. Two of those white jurors served on the jury; one of those two was only 21 years old. See id., at 35. Lanier also explained to the trial court that he struck Gar- rett because he \"felt that she was less than truthful\" in her answers in voir dire . Id., at 108 (new trial hearing). Spe- cifcally, the State pointed the trial court to the following exchange: \"[Court]: Are you familiar with the neighborhood where [the victim] lived, North Rome? \"[Garrett]: No.\" 5 Trial Transcript 950-951. Lanier, in explaining the strike, told the trial court that in apparent contradiction to that exchange (which represented the only time that Garrett was asked about the topic during voir dire), he had \"noted that [Garrett] attended Main High School, which is only two blocks from where [the victim] lived and certainly in the neighborhood. She denied any knowl-edge of the area.\" Trial Record 439 (brief in opposition to new trial). We have no quarrel with the State's general assertion that it \"could not trust someone who gave materially untruthful answers on voir dire.\" Foster , 258 Ga., at 739, 374 S. E. 2d, at 192. But even this otherwise legitimate reason is diffcult to credit in light of the State's acceptance of (white) juror Duncan. Duncan gave practically the same answer as Gar-rett did during voir dire: \"[Court]: Are you familiar with the neighborhood in which [the victim] live[d]? Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 507 Opinion of the Court \"[Duncan]: No. I live in Atteiram Heights, but it's not\u2014 I'm not familiar with up there, you know.\" 5 Trial Transcript 959. But, as Lanier was aware, Duncan's \"residence [was] less than a half a mile from the murder scene\" and her workplace was \"located less than 250 yards\" away. Trial Record 430 (brief in opposition to new trial). In sum, in evaluating the strike of Garrett, we are not faced with a single isolated misrepresentation. C We turn next to the strike of Hood. According to Lanier, Hood \"was exactly what [the State] was looking for in terms of age, between forty and ffty, good employment and mar-ried.\" App. 44 (pretrial hearing). The prosecution none-theless struck Hood, giving eight reasons for doing so. Hood: (1) had a son who was the same age as the defendant and who had previously been convicted of a crime; (2) had a wife who worked in food service at the local mental health institution; (3) had experienced food poisoning during voir dire; (4) was slow in responding to death penalty ques-tions; (5) was a member of the Church of Christ; (6) had a brother who counseled drug offenders; (7) was not asked enough questions by the defense during voir dire; and (8) asked to be excused from jury service. See id., at 44-47; id., at 86, 105, 110-111 (new trial hearing); Trial Record 433- 435 (brief in opposition to new trial). An examination of the record, however, convinces us that many of these justifca-tions cannot be credited. As an initial matter, the prosecution's principal reasons for the strike shifted over time, suggesting that those reasons may be pretextual. In response to Foster's pretrial Batson challenge, Lanier noted all eight reasons, but explained: \"The only thing I was concerned about, and I will state it for the record. He has an eighteen year old son which is about the same age as the defendant. 508 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court \"In my experience prosecuting over twenty-fve mur- der cases . . . individuals having the same son as [a] de- fendant who is charged with murder [have] serious res-ervations and are more sympathetic and lean toward that particular person. \"It is ironic that his son, . . . Darrell Hood[,] has been sentenced . . . by the Court here, to theft by taking on April 4th, 1982. . . . [T]heft by taking is basically the same thing that this defendant is charged with.\" App. 44-45 (pretrial hearing) (emphasis added). But by the time of Foster's subsequent motion for a new trial, Lanier's focus had shifted. He still noted the similari-ties between Hood's son and Foster, see id., at 105 (new trial hearing), but that was no longer the key reason behind the strike. Lanier instead told the court that his paramount concern was Hood's membership in the Church of Christ: \"The Church of Christ people, while they may not take a formal stand against the death penalty, they are very, very reluctant to vote for the death penalty.\" Id., at 84 (new trial hearing); accord, Trial Record 434-435 (brief in opposition to new trial) (\"It is the opinion of this prosecutor that in a death penalty case, Church of Christ affliates are reluctant to re-turn a verdict of death.\"). Hood's religion, Lanier now ex-plained, was the most important factor behind the strike: \"I evaluated the whole Eddie Hood. . . . And the bottom line on Eddie Hood is the Church of Christ affliation.\" App. 110- 111 (new trial hearing) (emphasis added). Of course it is possible that Lanier simply misspoke in one of the two proceedings. But even if that were so, we would ex-pect at least one of the two purportedly principal justifcations for the strike to withstand closer scrutiny. Neither does. Take Hood's son. If Darrell Hood's age was the issue, why did the State accept (white) juror Billy Graves, who had a 17-year-old son? Juror Questionnaire No. 31, p. 3; see App. 24. And why did the State accept (white) juror Martha Duncan, even though she had a 20-year-old son? Juror Questionnaire No. 88, p. 3; see App. 30. Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 509 Opinion of the Court The comparison between Hood and Graves is particularly salient. When the prosecution asked Hood if Foster's age would be a factor for him in sentencing, he answered \"None whatsoever.\" 2 Trial Transcript 280. Graves, on the other hand, answered the same question \"probably so.\" Id., at 446. Yet the State struck Hood and accepted Graves. The State responds that Duncan and Graves were not sim- ilar to Hood because Hood's son had been convicted of theft, while Graves's and Duncan's sons had not. See Brief for Respondent 34-35; see also App. 135-136 (trial court opinion denying new trial) (\"While the defense asserts that the state used different standards for white jurors, insofar as many of them had children near the age of the Defendant, the Court believes that [Darrell Hood's] conviction is a distinction that makes the difference.\"). Lanier had described Darrell Hood's conviction to the trial court as being for \"basically the same thing that this defendant is charged with.\" Id., at 45 (pretrial hearing). Nonsense. Hood's son had received a 12-month suspended sentence for stealing hubcaps from a car in a mall parking lot fve years earlier. Trial Record 446. Foster was charged with capital murder of a 79-year- old widow after a brutal sexual assault. The \"implausible\" and \"fantastic\" assertion that the two had been charged with \"basically the same thing\" supports our conclusion that the focus on Hood's son can only be regarded as pretextual. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 339 (2003); see also ibid. (\"Credibility can be measured by, among other factors, . . . how reasonable, or how improbable, the [State's] The prosecution's second principal justifcation for striking Hood\u2014his affliation with the Church of Christ, and that church's alleged teachings on the death penalty\u2014fares no better. Hood asserted no fewer than four times during voir dire that he could impose the death penalty. 5 A prose- 5 See 2 Trial Transcript 269 (\"[Court]: Are you opposed to or against the death penalty? A. I am not opposed to it. Q. If the facts and circum- stances warrant the death penalty, are you prepared to vote for the death 510 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court cutor is entitled to disbelieve a juror's voir dire answers, of course. But the record persuades us that Hood's race, and not his religious affliation, was Lanier's true motivation. The frst indication to that effect is Lanier's mischaracter- ization of the record. On multiple occasions, Lanier as-serted to the trial court that three white prospective jurors who were members of the Church of Christ had been struck for cause due to their opposition to the death penalty. See App. 46 (pretrial hearing) (\"[Hood's] religious preference is Church of Christ. There have been [three] other jurors that have been excused for cause by agreement that belong to the Church of Christ, Juror No. 35, 53 and 78.\"); id., at 114 (new trial hearing) (\"Three out of four jurors who professed to be members of the Church of Christ, went off for [cause related to opposition to the death penalty].\"); Trial Record 435 (brief in opposition to new trial) (\"Church of Christ jurors Terry (#35), Green (#53), and Waters (#78) [were] excused for cause due to feeling[s] against the death penalty.\"). That was not true. One of those prospective jurors was excused before even being questioned during voir dire be- cause she was fve-and-a-half months pregnant. 5 Trial Transcript 893. Another was excused by the agreement of both parties because her answers on the death penalty made it diffcult to ascertain her precise views on capital punish-ment. See Brief for Respondent 39 (\"[I]t was entirely un-clear if [this juror] understood any of the trial court's ques-tions and her answers are equivocal at best.\"). And the judge found cause to dismiss the third because she had al-ready formed an opinion about Foster's guilt. See 3 Trial penalty? A. Yes.\"); id., at 270 (\"[Court]: [A]re you prepared to vote for the death penalty? Now you said yes to that. A. All right. Q. Are you still saying yes? A. Uh-huh.\"); id., at 274 (\"[Court]: If the evidence war- rants the death penalty, could you vote for the death penalty? A. Yes. I could vote for the death penalty.\"); id., at 278 (\"[Pullen]: And if the facts and circumstances warranted, you could vote to impose the death pen-alty? Yes.\"). Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 511 Opinion of the Court Transcript 558 (\"[Court]: And you have made up your mind already as to the guilt of the accused? A: Yes, sir. [Court]: I think that's cause.\"). The prosecution's fle fortifes our conclusion that any reli- ance on Hood's religion was pretextual. The fle contains a handwritten document titled \"Church of Christ.\" The docu-ment notes that the church \"doesn't take a stand on [the] Death Penalty,\" and that the issue is \"left for each individual member.\" App. 302. The document then states: \"NO . NO Black Church.\" Ibid. The State tries to downplay the sig- nifcance of this document by emphasizing that the docu- ment's author is unknown. That uncertainty is pertinent. But we think the document is nonetheless entitled to sig-nifcant weight, especially given that it is consistent with our serious doubts about the prosecution's account of the strike. Many of the State's secondary justifcations similarly come undone when subjected to scrutiny. Lanier told the trial court that Hood \"appeared to be confused and slow in re-sponding to questions concerning his views on the death pen-alty.\" Trial Record 434 (brief in opposition to new trial). As previously noted, however, Hood unequivocally voiced his willingness to impose the death penalty, and a white juror who showed similar confusion served on the jury. Compare 5 Trial Transcript 1100-1101 (white juror Huff-man's answers) with 2 id., at 269-278 (Hood's answers); see App. 35. According to the record, such confusion was not uncommon. See id., at 138 (\"The Court notes that [Hood's] particular confusion about the death penalty questions was not unusual.\"); accord, 5 Trial Transcript 994 (\"[Court]: I think these questions should be reworded. I haven't had a juror yet that understood what that meant.\"); id., at 1101- 1102 (\"[Court]: I still say that these questions need changing overnight, because one out of a hundred jurors, I think is about all that's gone along with knowing what [you're asking].\"). 512 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court Lanier also stated that he struck Hood because Hood's wife worked at Northwest Regional Hospital as a food services supervisor. App. 45 (pretrial hearing). That hospital, La-nier explained, \"deals a lot with mentally disturbed, mentally ill people,\" and so people associated with it tend \"to be more sympathetic to the underdog.\" Ibid. But Lanier ex- pressed no such concerns about white juror Blackmon, who had worked at the same hospital. Blackmon, as noted, served on the jury. Lanier additionally stated that he struck Hood because the defense \"didn't ask [Hood] any question[s] about the age of the defendant,\" \"his feelings about criminal responsibility in-volved in insanity,\" or \"publicity.\" Id., at 47. Yet again, the trial transcripts clearly indicate the contrary. See 2 Trial Transcript 280 (\"Q: Is age a factor to you in trying to determine whether or not a defendant should receive a life sentence or a death sentence? A: None whatsoever.\"); ibid. (\"Q: Do you have any feeling about the insanity defense? A: Do I have any opinion about that? I have not formed any opinion about that.\"); id., at 281 (\"Q: Okay. The publicity that you have heard, has that publicity affected your ability to sit as a juror in this case and be fair and impartial to the defendant? A: No, it has no effect on me.\"). D As we explained in Miller-El v. Dretke , \"[i]f a prosecutor's proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack [panelist] who is per-mitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination.\" 545 U. S. 231, 241 (2005). With respect to both Garrett and Hood, such evidence is compelling. But that is not all. There are also the shifting explanations, the misrepresentations of the record, and the persistent focus on race in the prosecution's fle. Considering all of the circum-stantial evidence that \"bear[s] upon the issue of racial ani-mosity,\" we are left with the frm conviction that the strikes Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 513 Opinion of the Court of Garrett and Hood were \"motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\" Snyder , 552 U. S., at 478, 485.6 IV Throughout all stages of this litigation, the State has strenuously objected that \"race [was] not a factor\" in its jury selection strategy. App. 41 (pretrial hearing); but see id., at 120 (new trial hearing) (Lanier testifying that the strikes were \"based on many factors and not purely on race.\" (em- phasis added)). Indeed, at times the State has been down-right indignant. See Trial Record 444 (brief in opposition to new trial) (\"The Defenses's [sic] misapplication of the law and erroneous distortion of the facts are an attempt to dis-credit the prosecutor. . . . The State and this community de-mand an apology.\"). The contents of the prosecution's fle, however, plainly belie the State's claim that it exercised its strikes in a \"color-blind\" manner. App. 41, 60 (pretrial hearing). The sheer number of references to race in that fle is arresting. The State, however, claims that things are not quite as bad as they seem. The focus on black prospective jurors, it con-tends, does not indicate any attempt to exclude them from the jury. It instead refects an effort to ensure that the State was \"thoughtful and non-discriminatory in [its] consid-eration of black prospective jurors [and] to develop and main-tain detailed information on those prospective jurors in order to properly defend against any suggestion that decisions re-garding [its] selections were pretextual.\" Brief for Re-spondent 6. Batson, after all, had come down only months before Foster's trial. The prosecutors, according to the 6 In Snyder , we noted that we had not previously allowed the prosecu- tion to show that \"a discriminatory intent [that] was a substantial or moti- vating factor\" behind a strike was nevertheless not \"determinative\" to the prosecution's decision to exercise the strike. 552 U. S., at 485. The State does not raise such an argument here and so, as in Snyder , we need not decide the availability of such a defense. 514 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Opinion of the Court State, were uncertain what sort of showing might be de- manded of them and wanted to be prepared. This argument falls fat. To begin, it \"reeks of after- thought,\" Miller-El, 545 U. S., at 246, having never before been made in the nearly 30-year history of this litigation: not in the trial court, not in the state habeas court, and not even in the State's brief in opposition to Foster's petition for certiorari. In addition, the focus on race in the prosecution's fle plainly demonstrates a concerted effort to keep black pro-spective jurors off the jury. The State argues that it \"was actively seeking a black juror.\" Brief for Respondent 12; see also App. 99 (new trial hearing). But this claim is not credible. An \"N\" appeared next to each of the black pro-spective jurors' names on the jury venire list. See, e. g., id., at 253. An \"N\" was also noted next to the name of each black prospective juror on the list of the 42 qualifed prospec-tive jurors; each of those names also appeared on the \"def-nite NO's\" list. See id., at 299-301. And a draft affdavit from the prosecution's investigator stated his view that \"[i]f it comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors, [Marilyn] Garrett, might be okay.\" Id., at 345 (emphasis added); see also ibid. (recommending Garrett \"if we had to pick a black juror\" (emphasis added)). Such references are inconsistent with attempts to \"actively see[k]\" a black juror. The State's new argument today does not dissuade us from the conclusion that its prosecutors were motivated in sub-stantial part by race when they struck Garrett and Hood from the jury 30 years ago. Two peremptory strikes on the basis of race are two more than the Constitution allows. The order of the Georgia Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 515 Alito, J., concurring in judgment Justice Alito , concurring in the judgment.

I As the Court recounts, in August 1986, Queen Madge White, a 79-year-old retired schoolteacher, was sexually as-saulted and brutally murdered in her home in Rome, Geor-gia. Her home was ransacked, and various household items were stolen. Foster v. State , 258 Ga. 736, 374 S. E. 2d 188 (1988). About a month after the murder, police offcers were called to respond to a local disturbance. The complain-ant, Lisa Stubbs, told them that her boyfriend, petitioner Timothy Foster, had killed White and had distributed the goods stolen from White's home to Stubbs and family mem-bers. Tr. 1719-1723. Offcers arrested Foster, who con-fessed to the murder and robbery, 258 Ga., at 736, 374 S. E. 2d, at 190, and the police recovered some of the stolen goods. Foster was put on trial for White's murder, convicted, and sentenced to death. Before, during, and after his trial, Fos-ter argued that the prosecution violated his rights under this Court's then-recent decision in Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), by peremptorily challenging all the prospective jurors who were black. After the Georgia Supreme Court rejected Foster's Batson argument on direct appeal, he fled a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court, but his peti-tion did not raise a Batson claim, 1 and the petition was de- nied. Foster v. Georgia, 490 U. S. 1085 (1989). In July 1989, Foster fled a state habeas petition in the Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia. For the next 10 1 Nor did his petition for rehearing, which was also denied. Foster v. Georgia, 492 U. S. 928 (1989). 516 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Alito, J., concurring in judgment years, most of Foster's claims (including his Batson claim) were held in abeyance while the Georgia courts adjudicated Foster's claim that he is \"mentally retarded\" and thus cannot be executed under Georgia law. Zant v. Foster , 261 Ga. 450, 406 S. E. 2d 74 (1991). After extensive court proceedings, including two visits to the State Supreme Court, 2 additional petitions for certiorari to this Court,3 and a jury trial on the issue of intellectual disability, Foster was denied relief on that claim. He then amended his habeas petition, and the Superior Court considered the many other claims asserted in his petition, including his Batson claim. In support of that claim, Foster offered new evidence, namely, the prosecu-tion's jury selection notes, which he had obtained through a Georgia open-records request. These notes showed that someone had highlighted the names of black jurors and had written the letter \"B\" next to their names. The Superior Court issued a written decision in which it evaluated Foster's habeas claims. The opinion began by noting that many of his claims were barred by res judicata. The opinion stated: \"[T]his court notes that . . . the following claims are not reviewable based on the doctrine of res judi-cata, as the claims were raised and litigated adversely to the Petitioner on his direct appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.\" App. 175. Included in the list of barred claims was \"Petitioner['s] alleg[ation] that the State used peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of Batson.\" Id., at 175-176. Later in its opinion, the Superior Court again referred to the Batson claim and wrote as follows: \"The Respondent argues that this claim is not review-able due to the doctrine of res judicata. However, because the Petitioner claims that additional evidence 2 See Zant v. Foster , 261 Ga. 450, 406 S. E. 2d 74 (1991); Foster v. State , 272 Ga. 69, 525 S. E. 2d 78 (2000). 3 See Foster v. Georgia, 503 U. S. 921 (1992); Foster v. Georgia, 531 U. S. 890, reh'g denied, 531 U. S. 1045 (2000). Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 517 Alito, J., concurring in judgment allegedly supporting this ground was discovered subse- quent to the Georgia Supreme Court's ruling in Foster v. State , 258 Ga. 736 (1988) [the decision affrming Foster's conviction on direct appeal], this court will review the Batson claim as to whether Petitioner has shown any change in the facts suffcient to overcome the res judi-cata bar.\" Id., at 192. The court then reviewed the evidence and concluded that it \"[could not] fnd that the highlighting of the names of black jurors and the notation of their race can serve to override this previous consideration [on direct appeal].\" Id., at 193. Because \"all jurors in this case, regardless of race, were thor-oughly investigated and considered before the State exer-cised its peremptory challenges,\" the court found that \"Peti-tioner fail[ed] to demonstrate purposeful discrimination on the basis that the race of prospective jurors was either cir-cled, highlighted or otherwise noted on various lists.\" Id., at 195. Thus, the court held that the Batson claim was \"without merit.\" App. 196. Foster subsequently sought review of the Superior Court's decision in the Georgia Supreme Court, but that court re-fused to issue a certifcate of probable cause (CPC) to appeal. In its entirety, the State Supreme Court order states: \"Upon consideration of the Application for Certifcate of Probable Cause to appeal the denial of habeas corpus, it is ordered that it be hereby denied. All the Justices concur, except Benham, J., who dissents.\" Id., at 246. Foster sought review of this decision, and this Court granted certiorari to review the decision of the Georgia Su-preme Court. 575 U. S. 1025 (2015). II The decision of the Georgia Supreme Court was a decision on the merits of Foster's Batson claim, as presented in his state habeas petition. See Ga. Sup. Ct. Rule 36 (2016) (a 518 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Alito, J., concurring in judgment CPC to appeal a fnal judgment in a habeas corpus case in- volving a criminal conviction \"will be issued where there is 2014) (The Georgia Supreme Court's standard for denying a CPC \"clearly constitutes an adjudication on the merits\"). Thus, what the Georgia Supreme Court held was that Foster's Batson claim, as presented in his state habeas petition, lacked arguable merit. That holding was likely based at least in part on state law. As noted, the Superior Court quite clearly held that Foster's Batson claim was barred by res judicata. That conclusion, to be sure, was not entirely divorced from the merits of his federal constitutional claim, since the court went on to dis-cuss the evidence advanced by petitioner in support of his argument that the prosecution's strikes of black members of the venire were based on race. Rather, it appears that the Superior Court understood state law to permit Foster to ob-tain reconsideration of his previously rejected Batson claim only if he was able to show that a \"change in the facts\" was \"suffcient to overcome the res judicata bar.\" App. 192. In concluding that Foster's renewed Batson claim was re- quired to meet a heightened standard, the Superior Court appears to have been following established Georgia law. Some Georgia cases seem to stand for the proposition that the bar is absolute, at least in some circumstances. See, e. g., Roulain v. Martin, 266 Ga. 353, 466 S. E. 2d 837, 839 (1996) (\"Since this issue was raised and resolved in Martin's direct appeal, it should not have been readdressed by the habeas court\"); Davis v. Thomas, 261 Ga. 687, 689, 410 S. E. 2d 110, 112 (1991) (\"This issue was raised on direct appeal, and this court determined that it had no merit. Davis rec-ognizes the principle that one who had an issue decided ad-versely to him on direct appeal is precluded from relitigating that issue on habeas corpus\"); Gunter v. Hickman, 256 Ga. 315, 316, 348 S. E. 2d 644, 645 (1986) (\"This issue was actually litigated, i. e., raised and decided, in the appellant's direct Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 519 Alito, J., concurring in judgment appeal . . . . For this the reasserted in habeas-corpus proceedings\"); Elrod v. Ault, 231 Ga. 750, 204 S. E. 2d 176 (1974) (\"After an appellate review the same issues will not be reviewed on habeas corpus\"). Other deci-sions, however, allow a defendant to overcome res judicata if he can produce newly discovered evidence that was not \"reasonably available\" to him on direct review. Gibson v. Head, 282 Ga. 156, 159, 646 S. E. 2d 257, 260 (2007); see also Gibson v. Ricketts, 244 Ga. 482, 483, 260 S. E. 2d 877, 878 (1979). 4 In restricting the relitigation of previously rejected claims, Georgia is not alone. \"[W]e have long and consist-ently affrmed that a collateral challenge may not do service for an appeal.\" United States v. Frady , 456 U. S. 152, 165 (1982). Accordingly, at least as a general rule, federal pris-oners may not use a motion under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2255 to reliti-gate a claim that was previously rejected on direct appeal. See, e. g., Reed v. Farley , 512 U. S. 339, 358 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"[C]laims will ordinarily not be entertained under \u00a7 2255 that have al-ready been rejected on direct review\"); Withrow v. Wil- liams, 507 U. S. 680, 721 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"[A]bsent countervailing considera-tions, district courts may refuse to reach the merits of a con-stitutional claim previously raised and rejected on direct ap-peal\"); United States v. Lee, 715 F. 3d 215, 224 (CA8 2013); Rozier v. United States, 701 F. 3d 681, 684 (CA11 2012); 4 Georgia res judicata law may also include a \"miscarriage of justice\" exception, but that appears to capture only the exceptionally rare claim of actual innocence, and so is not at issue here. See Walker v. Penn, 271 Ga. 609, 611, 523 S. E. 2d 325, 327 (1999) (\"The term miscarriage of justice is by no means to be deemed synonymous with procedural irregularity, or even with reversible error. To the contrary, it demands a much greater substance, approaching perhaps the imprisonment of one who, not only is not guilty of the specifc offense for which he is convicted, but, further, is not even culpable in the circumstances under inquiry. (A plain example is a case of mistaken identity)\" (brackets omitted)). 520 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Alito, J., concurring in judgment United States v. Roane , 378 F. 3d 382, 396, n. 7 (CA4 2004); United States v. Webster , 392 F. 3d 787, 791 (CA5 2004); White v. United States, 371 F. 3d 900, 902 (CA7 2004); United States v. Jones, 918 F. 2d 9, 10-11 (CA2 1990); United States v. Prichard, 875 F. 2d 789, 790-791 (CA10 1989). Cf. Davis v. United States, 417 U. S. 333, 342 (1974). As we have said, \"[i]t has, of course, long been settled law that an error that may justify reversal on direct appeal will not necessarily support a collateral attack on a fnal judgment. The reasons for narrowly limiting the grounds for collateral attack on fnal judgments are well known and basic to our adversary system of justice.\" United States v. Addonizio , 442 U. S. 178, 184 (1979) (footnote omitted). In accordance with this principle, federal law provides that a state prisoner may not relitigate a claim that was rejected in a prior federal habeas petition. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(1)-(3). And even when a state prisoner's second or successive federal habeas petition asserts a new federal constitutional claim based on what is asserted to be new evi-dence, the claim must be dismissed unless a very demanding test is met. See \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B) (\"[T]he factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence\"; and the facts must \"be suff-cient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that . . . no reasonable factfnder would have found the applicant guilty\"). \"[T]he principle of fnality\" is \"essential to the operation of our criminal justice system.\" Teague v. Lane , 489 U. S. 288, 309 (1989) (plurality opinion). Thus, once a criminal conviction becomes fnal\u2014as Foster's did 30 years ago\u2014state courts need not remain open indefnitely to relitigate claims related to that conviction which were raised and decided on direct review. States are under no obligation to permit col-lateral attacks on convictions that have become fnal, and if they allow such attacks, they are free to limit the circum-stances in which claims may be relitigated. Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 521 Alito, J., concurring in judgment To the extent that the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court was based on a state rule restricting the relitigation of previously rejected claims, the decision has a state-law component, and we have no jurisdiction to review a state court's decision on a question of state law. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1257(a). This Court, no less than every other federal court, has \"an independent obligation to ensure that [we] do not exceed the scope of [our] jurisdiction, and therefore [we] must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the par-ties either overlook or elect not to press.\" Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. 428, 434 (2011). III \"This Court long has held that it will not consider an issue of federal law on direct review from a judgment of a state court if that judgment rests on a state-law ground that is both `independent' of the merits of the federal claim and an `adequate' basis for the court's decision,\" Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 260 (1989), and like the Court (and both petitioner and respondent) I agree that we cannot conclude from the brief order issued by the Supreme Court of Georgia that its decision was based wholly on state law. It is entirely possi-ble that the State Supreme Court reached a conclusion about the effect of the state res judicata bar based in part on an assessment of the strength of Foster's Batson claim or the extent to which the new evidence bolstered that claim. And if that is what the State Supreme Court held, the rule that the court applied was an amalgam of state and federal law. By the same token, however, the state-law res judicata rule applied by the Superior Court is clearly not like the rule in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), which appears to have been entirely dependent on federal law. In Ake, a pris- oner argued that due process entitled him to obtain the serv-ices of a psychiatrist in order to prove that he was insane at the time when he committed a murder. The Oklahoma courts concluded that Ake's claim was waived, but the Okla-522 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Alito, J., concurring in judgment homa waiver rule essentially made an exception for any case in which there was a violation of a fundamental federal con-stitutional right. See id., at 74-75 (\"The Oklahoma waiver rule does not apply to fundamental trial error,\" including \"federal constitutional errors [that] are `fundamental' \"). Thus, the state waiver rule was entirely dependent on fed-eral law, and this Court therefore held that it had jurisdiction to review the underlying constitutional question\u2014whether Ake was entitled to a psychiatrist. Then, having found a constitutional violation, the Court remanded for a new trial. Id., at 86-87. The res judicata rule applied by the Superior Court in this case is quite different. That court obviously did not think that Georgia law included an Ake-like exception that would permit a defendant to overcome res judicata simply by mak-ing the kind of showing of federal constitutional error that would have been suffcient when the claim was frst adjudi-cated. Accordingly, Ake does not mean that we can simply disregard the possibility that the decision under review may have a state-law component. Our cases chart the path that we must follow in a situation like the one present here. When \"a state court's interpreta-tion of state law has been infuenced by an accompanying interpretation of federal law,\" the proper course is for this Court to \"revie[w] the federal question on which the state-law determination appears to have been premised. If the state court has proceeded on an incorrect perception of fed-eral law, it has been this Court's practice to vacate the judg-ment of the state court and remand the case so that the court may reconsider the state-law question free of misapprehen-sions about the scope of federal law.\" Three Affliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P . C., 467 U. S. 138, 152 (1984). See also S. Shapiro, K. Gel- ler, T. Bishop, E. Hartnett, & D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice 212 (10th ed. 2013). In a situation like the one pre-sented here, the correct approach is for us to decide the ques-Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 523 Alito, J., concurring in judgment tion of federal law and then to remand the case to the state court so that it can reassess its decision on the state-law question in light of our decision on the underlying federal issue. 5 IV I agree with the Court that the totality of the evidence now adduced by Foster is suffcient to make out a Batson violation. On remand, the Georgia Supreme Court is bound to accept that evaluation of the federal question, but whether that conclusion justifes relief under state res judicata law is a matter for that court to decide. Compliance with Batson is essential to ensure that defend- ants receive a fair trial and to preserve the public confdence upon which our system of criminal justice depends. But it is also important that this Court respect the authority of state courts to structure their systems of postconviction re-view in a way that promotes the expeditious and defnitive disposition of claims of error. Until recently, this Court rarely granted review of state- court decisions in collateral review proceedings, preferring to allow the claims adjudicated in such proceedings to be decided frst in federal habeas proceedings. See Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327, 335 (2007) (\"[T]his Court rarely grants review at this stage of the litigation even when the application for state collateral relief is supported by arguably meritorious federal constitutional claims, choosing instead to wait for federal habeas proceedings\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Kyles v. Whitley , 498 U. S. 931, 932 (1990) (Stevens, J., concurring in denial of stay of execution); Huff- man v. Florida, 435 U. S. 1014, 1017-1018 (1978) (Stevens, J., 5 The Court relies on Ake solely for the proposition, with which I agree, that we have jurisdiction to review the federal question whether the total- ity of the circumstances (that is, all the facts brought to the attention of the state courts on direct appeal and collateral review) make out a Batson claim. Ante , at 499, n. 4. Thus, the Court does not preclude consider- ation of state-law issues on remand. See ante , at 514. 524 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Thomas, J., dissenting respecting denial of certiorari). When cases reach this Court after habeas review in the lower federal courts, the standards of review set out in the Antiterrorism and Effec-tive Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254, apply. Re-cently, this Court has evidenced a predilection for granting review of state-court decisions denying postconviction relief, see, e. g., Wearry v. Cain, 577 U. S. 385 (2016) (per curiam ). Particularly in light of that trend, it is important that we do not lightly brush aside the States' legitimate interest in structuring their systems of postconviction review in a way that militates against repetitive litigation and endless delay. Justice Thomas, dissenting. Thirty years ago, Timothy Foster confessed to murdering Queen Madge White after sexually assaulting her with a bot- tle of salad dressing. In the decades since, Foster has sought to vacate his conviction and death sentence on the ground that prosecutors violated Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), when they struck all black prospective jurors before his trial. Time and again, the state courts have re-jected that claim. The trial court twice rejected it, and the Supreme Court of Georgia unequivocally rejected it when Foster directly appealed his conviction and sentence. Fos- ter v. State , 258 Ga. 736, 736, n. 1, 738-739, 374 S. E. 2d 188, 190, n. 1, 192 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1085 (1989). A state habeas court rejected it in 2013. App. 175-176, 192- 196. And most recently, the Supreme Court of Georgia again rejected it as lacking \"arguable merit,\" Ga. Sup. Ct. Rule 36 (2001). See App. 246. Yet, today\u2014nearly three decades removed from voir dire \u2014the Court rules in Foster's favor. It does so without adequately grappling with the possibility that we lack jurisdiction. Moreover, the Court's ruling on the mer-its, based, in part, on new evidence that Foster procured dec-ades after his conviction, distorts the deferential Batson in- quiry. I respectfully dissent. Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 525 Thomas, J., dissenting I Federal law authorizes us to review the \"judgments or de- crees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had,\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1257(a), but only if such a judgment or decree raises a question of federal law, Michi- gan v. Long , 463 U. S. 1032, 1038 (1983). The Court today errs by assuming that the Supreme Court of Georgia's one-line order\u2014the \"judgmen[t] . . . rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had,\" \u00a7 1257\u2014 raises such a question. See ante, at 497-498. The far more likely explanation for the court's denial of habeas relief is that Foster's claim is procedurally barred. This disposition is ordinarily a question of state law that this Court is power-less to review. Before addressing the merits of Foster's Batson claim, the Court should have sought clarifcation that the resolution of a federal question was implicated in the Georgia high court's decision. A The Supreme Court of Georgia's order in this case states in full: \"Upon consideration of the Application for Certifcate of Probable Cause to appeal the denial of habeas corpus, it is ordered that it be hereby denied.\" App. 246. Neither that order nor Georgia law provides adequate assurance that this case raises a federal question. Under Georgia law, a state prisoner may fle a state habeas petition in a state superior court. Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 9-14- 41 to 9-14-43 (2015). If the state superior court denies the petition, then the prisoner may appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia, which has exclusive jurisdiction over habeas cor-pus cases, by timely fling a notice of appeal in the superior court and applying for a certifcate of probable cause in the supreme court. See Fullwood v. Sivley , 271 Ga. 248, 250- 251, 517 S. E. 2d 511, 513-515 (1999) (discussing require-ments of \u00a7 9-14-52). Much certifcates of appealability in federal court, Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 336 526 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Thomas, J., dissenting (2003), a Georgia prisoner must establish in his application that at least one of his claims has \"arguable merit.\" Ga. Sup. Ct. Rule 36. If he cannot, the Supreme Court of Geor-gia summarily denies relief by denying the certifcate of probable cause. Ibid.; see also (CA11 2014). If he can, then the court affords plenary review of the arguably meritorious claim. See, e. g., Sears v. Humphrey , 294 Ga. 117, 117-118, 751 S. E. 2d 365, 368 (2013); Hillman v. John- son, 297 Ga. 609, 611, 615, n. 5, 774 S. E. 2d 615, 617, 620, n. 5 (2015). The most we can glean, therefore, from the sum-mary denial of Foster's state habeas petition is that the Su-preme Court of Georgia concluded that Foster's claim lacked \"arguable merit.\" The most obvious ground for deciding that Foster's claim lacked \"arguable merit\" is that the Supreme Court of Geor-gia already considered that claim and rejected it decades ago. 1 Georgia law prohibits Foster from raising the same claim anew in his state habeas petition. See, e. g., Davis v. Thomas, 261 Ga. 687, 689, 410 S. E. 2d 110, 112 (1991). \"It is axiomatic\" in the Georgia courts \"that a habeas court is 1 That is obvious, in part, because the Superior Court rested on this procedural bar to deny Foster's Batson claim. See, e. g., App. 175-176. We need not blind ourselves to that lurking state-law ground merely be- cause the Supreme Court of Georgia denied relief in an unexplained order. As we would do in the federal habeas context, we may \"look through\" to the last reasoned state-court opinion to discern whether that opinion rested on state-law procedural grounds. Ylst v. Nunnemaker , 501 U. S. 797, 806 (1991). If \"the last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly im-poses a procedural default,\" then there is a rebuttable presumption \"that a later decision rejecting the claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.\" Id., at 803; see also, e. g., Kernan v. Hinojosa, ante , at 415 (per curiam ). We presume, in other words, that the decision rests on a question of state law. That presumption arguably plays an even more important role in a state-court case like this, where a state-law pro-cedural defect would oust this Court of its jurisdiction. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 730 (1991) (distinguishing a state-law procedural bar's effect on a state case from its effect in federal habeas). Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 527 Thomas, J., dissenting not to be used as a substitute for an appeal, or as a second appeal.\" Walker v. Penn, 271 Ga. 609, 612, 523 S. E. 2d 325, 327 (1999). Without such procedural bars, state prisoners could raise old claims again and again until they are declared victorious, and fnality would mean nothing. See Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judg-ments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142, 145 (1970) (\"The proverbial man from Mars would surely think we must consider our system of criminal justice terribly bad if we are willing to tolerate such efforts at undoing judgments of conviction\"). I would think that this state-law defect in Foster's state habeas petition would be the end of the matter: \"Because this Court has no power to review a state law determination that is suffcient to support the judgment, resolution of any independent federal ground for the decision could not affect the judgment and would therefore be advisory.\" Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991). It is fundamental that this Court's \"only power over state judgments is to cor-rect them to the extent that they incorrectly adjudge federal rights.\" Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125-126 (1945). If an adequate and independent state-law ground bars Foster's claim, then the Court today has done nothing more than issue an impermissible advisory opinion. B To assure itself of jurisdiction, the Court wrongly assumes that the one-line order before us implicates a federal ques-tion. See ante, at 497-498. The lurking state-law proce- dural bar, according to the Court, is not an independent state- law ground because it \"depends on a federal constitutional ruling.\" Ante, at 497 (internal quotation marks omitted). I would not so hastily assume that the State Supreme Court's unelaborated order depends on the resolution of a federal question without frst seeking clarifcation from the Supreme Court of Georgia. To be sure, we often presume that a \"state court decide[s] the case the way it did because 528 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Thomas, J., dissenting it believed that federal law required it to do so.\" Long , 463 U. S., at 1040-1041. But there still exist \"certain circum- stances in which [from the state court] is neces- sary or desirable\" before delving into the merits of a state court's decision. Id., at 1041, n. 6. This case presents such a circumstance. The Long pre- sumption assumes that the ambiguous state-court ruling will come in the form of a reasoned decision: It applies in cases in which \"it is not clear from the opinion itself that the state court relied upon an adequate and independent state ground and when it fairly appears that the state court rested its decision primarily on federal law.\" Id., at 1042 (emphasis added). But here, when the decision is a one-line judgment, it hardly makes sense to invoke the Long presumption. There is neither an \"opinion\" nor any resolution of federal law that \"fairly appears\" on the face of the unexplained order. Ibid. Confronted with cases like this in the past, this Court has vacated and remanded for clarifcation from the state court before proceeding to decide the merits of the underlying claim. I would follow that path instead of assuming that the one-line order implicates a federal question. We have \"decline[d] . . . to review the federal questions asserted to be present\" when \" `there is considerable uncertainty as to the precise grounds for the [state court's] decision.' \" Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Bd., 531 U. S. 70, 78 (2000) (per curiam ) (quoting Minnesota v. National Tea Co., 309 U. S. 551, 555 (1940)). A fortiori, when a State's highest court has denied relief without any explanation, the proper course is to vacate and remand for clarifcation before reach-ing the merits of a federal question that might have nothing to do with the state court's decision. See, e. g., Capital Cities Media, Inc. v. Toole , 466 U. S. 378 (1984) (per curiam ); see also, e. g., Johnson v. Risk, 137 U. S. 300, 306-307 (1890). This course respects weighty federalism concerns. \"It is fundamental that state courts be left free and unfettered by Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 529 Thomas, J., dissenting us\" in interpreting their own law, National Tea Co., supra, at 557, especially when a state prisoner's long-fnal conviction is at stake. Clarifcation is especially warranted here. Nothing in the reported decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia suggests that federal law fgures in how Georgia applies its res judi-cata procedural bar. Those decisions state that \"new law or new facts\" could \"justify the reconsideration of the claims . . . raised on direct appeal,\" Hall v. Lance , 286 Ga. 365, 376- 377, 687 S. E. 2d 809, 818 (2010), as might a showing that the prisoner is actually innocent, Walker , supra, at 611, 523 S. E. 2d, at 327. But it is for the Supreme Court of Geor- gia\u2014not this Court\u2014to decide what new facts suffce to re- open a claim already decided against a state habeas peti-tioner. It is up to the Georgia courts, for example, to decide whether a petitioner was diligent in discovering those new facts, see, e. g., Gibson v. Head, 282 Ga. 156, 159, 646 S. E. 2d 257, 260 (2007) (noting that whether a petitioner could over-come the procedural bar \"depend[ed] on factual fndings\" in-cluding \"the precise timing of [his] discovery of\" the new evidence), or whether the new facts are \"material,\" Rollf v. Carter , 298 Ga. 557, 558, 784 S. E. 2d 341, 342 (2016). Instead of leaving the application of Georgia law to the Georgia courts, the Court takes it upon itself to decide that the procedural bar implicates a federal question. Worse still, the Court surmises that Georgia's procedural bar de-pends on the resolution of a federal question by parsing the wrong court's decision, the opinion of the Superior Court of Butts County. Ante, at 497-498. Invoking Ake v. Okla- homa, 470 U. S. 68, 75 (1985), the Court reasons that \" the state habeas court's application of res judicata to Foster's Batson claim was not independent of the merits of his federal constitu-tional challenge.\" Ante, at 498 (emphasis added). Accord- ingly, whether Foster has alleged a suffcient \" `change in the facts' \" to overcome the Georgia procedural bar depends on whether Foster's Batson claim would succeed in light of 530 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Thomas, J., dissenting those changed facts. Ante, at 498. But the State Superior Court's opinion is not the \"judgmen[t] . . . by the highest court of [Georgia] in which a decision could be had\" subject to our certiorari jurisdiction. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1257. The unex-plained denial of relief by the Supreme Court of Georgia is. I cannot go along with the Court's decision to assure itself of its jurisdiction by attributing snippets of the State Supe-rior Court's reasoning to the Supreme Court of Georgia. The reported decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia do not resolve what \"type of new alleged facts . . . could ever warrant setting aside the procedural bar,\" Hall, supra, at 377, 687 S. E. 2d, at 818, let alone intimate that a prisoner may relitigate a claim already decided against him merely because he might win this second time around. Cf. Roulain v. Martin, 266 Ga. 353, 354, 466 S. E. 2d 837, 839 (1996) (opin- ing that a state habeas court \"would certainly be bound by the ruling [in the petitioner's direct appeal] regardless of whether that ruling may be erroneous\"). I therefore refuse to presume that the unexplained denial of relief by the Su-preme Court of Georgia presents a federal question. 2 2 The Court takes me to task for not \"follow[ing my] own rule,\" ante, at 499, n. 3, because I acknowledge that the State Superior Court's decision is strong evidence that Foster's claim was denied as procedurally de-faulted. See supra, at 526-527, and n. 1. It is one thing to look to the reasoning of a lower state court's decision to confrm that the Court lacks jurisdiction. It is quite another for the Court to probe that lower state court's decision to assure itself of jurisdiction. The Court reads the tea leaves of a single State Superior Court's decision to decide that the state-law procedural bar depends on the resolution of a federal question. That is a question of Georgia law that is best answered by the decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia. See Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U. S. 456, 465 (1967) (concluding that when \"the underlying substantive rule involved is based on state law,\" \"the State's highest court is the best authority on its own law\"); cf. King v. Order of United Commercial Trav- elers of America, 333 U. S. 153, 160-162 (1948) (rejecting an unreported state trial court decision as binding under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938)). Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 531 Thomas, J., dissenting The Court today imposes an opinion-writing requirement on the States' highest courts. Lest those high courts be subject to lengthy digressions on constitutional claims that might (or might not) be at issue, they must offer reasoned opinions why\u2014after rejecting the same claim decades ago\u2014 they refuse to grant habeas relief now. But \"[o]pinion-writing practices in state courts are infuenced by considera-tions other than avoiding scrutiny by collateral attack in federal court,\" including \"concentrat[ing their] resources on the cases where opinions are most needed.\" Harrington v. Richter , 562 U. S. 86, 99 (2011). Rather than demand de- tailed opinions of overburdened state courts, the Court should vacate and remand cases such as this one to assure itself of its jurisdiction. II The Court further errs by deciding that Foster's Batson claim has arguable merit. Because the adjudication of his Batson claim is, at bottom, a credibility determination, we owe \"great deference\" to the state court's initial fnding that the prosecution's race-neutral reasons for striking veniremen Eddie Hood and Marilyn Garrett were credible. Batson, 476 U. S., at 98, n. 21. On a record far less cold than today's, the Supreme Court of Georgia long ago (on direct appeal) re-jected that claim by giving great deference to the trial court's credibility determinations. Evaluating the strike of venireman Hood, the court highlighted that his son had been convicted of a misdemeanor and that both his demeanor and religious affliation indicated that he might be reluctant to impose the death penalty. Foster , 258 Ga., at 738, 374 S. E. 2d, at 192. And the prosecution reasonably struck ve- nireman Garrett, according to the court, because it feared that she would sympathize with Foster given her work with \"low-income, underprivileged children\" and because she was \"related to someone with a drug or alcohol problem.\" Id., at 739, 374 S. E. 2d, at 192. That should have been the last word on Foster's Batson claim. 532 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Thomas, J., dissenting But now, Foster has access to the prosecution's fle. By allowing Foster to relitigate his Batson claim by bringing this newly discovered evidence to the fore, the Court upends Batson's deferential framework. Foster's new evidence does not justify this Court's reassessment of who was telling the truth nearly three decades removed from voir dire . A The new evidence sets the tone for the Court's analysis, but a closer look reveals that it has limited probative value. For this reason, the Court's conclusion that the prosecution violated Batson rests mostly on arguments at Foster's dis- posal decades ago. See ante, at 503-506 (concluding that trial transcripts belie proffered reasons for striking Garrett); ante, at 507-512 (relying on transcripts and briefs as evi- dence of the prosecution's shifting explanations for striking Hood). The new evidence is no excuse for the Court's rever-sal of the state court's credibility determinations. As even the Court admits, ante, at 500-501, we do not know who wrote most of the notes that Foster now relies upon as proof of the prosecutors' race-based motivations. We do know, however, that both prosecutors averred that they \"did not make any of the highlighted marks on the jury venire list\" and \"did not instruct anyone to make the green highlighted marks.\" App. 168-169, 171. In particular, prosecutor Stephen Lanier reaffrmed his earlier testimony, given during Foster's hearing for a new trial, that he relied only on race-neutral factors in striking the jury. Id., at 169; see also id., at 80-125. And, prosecutor Douglas Pullen swore that he \"did not rely on the highlighted jury venire list.\" Id., at 171. The hazy recollections of the prosecution's investigator, Clayton Lundy, are not to the contrary. As part of the post-conviction proceedings, Lundy testifed that he \"[v]aguely\" remembered parts of jury selection, he \"kind of remem-ber[ed]\" some of the documents used during jury selection, and cautioned that he \"ain't done this in a long time.\" Tr. Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 533 Thomas, J., dissenting 181-182. (When Lundy testifed in 2006, nearly 20 years had passed since Foster's trial and he had changed careers. Id., at 174.) He thought others at the district attorney's of-fce \"probably\" passed venire lists around the offce and \"guess[ed]\" that everyone would make notations. Id., at 182, 190. As for the other documents in the prosecution's fle, Lundy could not identify who authored any of them, with two excep- tions. 3 First, Lundy said he prepared handwritten lists de- scribing seven veniremen, including Garrett, but her race is not mentioned. See id., at 205; App. 293-294. Second, Lundy \"guess[ed]\" that prosecutor Lanier suggested the handwritten edits to a draft of an affdavit that Lundy later submitted to the trial court. Tr. 203; see App. 343-347 (draft affdavit); id., at 127-129 (fnal affdavit). The that, \"solely [in Lundy's] opinion,\" prosecutors ought to pick Garrett \"[i]f it comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors.\" Id., at 345 (emphasis added). Perhaps this look inside the district attorney's offce reveals that the offce debated inter-nally who would be the best black juror. Or perhaps it re-veals only Lundy's personal thoughts about selecting black jurors, an \"opinion\" with which (we can \"guess\") Lanier disagreed. The notion that this \"newly discovered evidence\" could warrant relitigation of a Batson claim is fabbergasting. In Batson cases, the \"decisive question will be whether coun- sel's race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed.\" Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 3 At oral argument, counsel for Georgia also stipulated that \"one of the two prosecutors\" must have drafted another document comprising a \"defnite NO's\" list and a \"questionables\" list of veniremen. Tr. of Oral Arg. 45; App. 301. Both veniremen Hood and Garrett appeared on the \"defnite NO's\" list. Of course we cannot know when these lists were created, or whether Lanier himself relied upon them. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (calling into question whether Lanier's \"thought process\" was based on those lists). 534 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Thomas, J., dissenting 365 (1991) (plurality opinion). And because \"[t]here will sel- dom be much evidence bearing on that issue,\" \"the best evi-dence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exer-cises the challenge.\" Ibid. Time and again, we have said that the credibility of the attorney is best judged by the trial court and can be overturned only if it is clearly erroneous. See ibid.; see also Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472, 477 (2008); Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 339; Hernandez, supra, at 375 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). But the Court today invites state prisoners to go searching for new \"evidence\" by demanding the fles of the prosecutors who long ago convicted them. If those prisoners succeed, then apparently this Court's doors are open to conduct the credibility determination anew. Alas, \"every end is instead a new beginning\" for a majority of this Court. Welch v. United States, ante, at 149 (Thomas, J., dissenting). I can- not go along with that \"sort of sandbagging of state courts.\" Miller-El v. Dretke , 545 U. S. 231, 279 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting). New evidence should not justify the relitiga-tion of Batson claims. B Perhaps the Court's decision to reconsider a decades-old Batson claim based on newly discovered evidence would be less alarming if the new evidence revealed that the trial court had misjudged the prosecutors' reasons for striking Garrett and Hood. It does not. Not only is the probative value of the evidence severely limited, supra, at 531-533 and this page, but also pieces of the new evidence corroborate the trial court's conclusion that the race-neutral reasons were valid. The Court's substitution of its judgment for the trial court's credibility determinations is fawed both as a legal and factual matter. 1 The Court's analysis with respect to Hood is unavailing. The Court frst compares Hood with other jurors who had similarly aged children, ante, at 507-509, just as the trial court did decades ago, App. 135-136. The trial court was well Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 535 Thomas, J., dissenting aware that Hood's son's conviction was for theft, not murder. But in the words of the trial court, \"the conviction is a dis-tinction that makes the difference\" between Hood and the other jurors, and the prosecution's \"apprehension that this would tend to, perhaps only subconsciously, make the venire-man sympathetic to [Foster] was a rational one.\" Ibid. \"the believe[d] the prosecutor's nonracial justifcation, and that fnding is not clearly erroneous, that [should be] the end of the matter.\" Hernandez, supra, at 375 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The Court also second-guesses the prosecution's strike of Hood because of his questionable stance on the death penalty. The Court concludes that Hood's transcribed statements at voir dire \"unequivocally voiced [Hood's] willingness to im- pose the death penalty.\" Ante, at 511. There is nothing unequivocal about a decades-old record. Our case law re-quires the Court to defer to the trial court's fnding that the State's race-neutral concerns about Hood's \"soft-spoken[ness] and slow[ness] in responding to the death penalty questions\" were \"credible.\" App. 138; see Snyder , supra, at 477 (\"[R]ace-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges often in-voke a juror's demeanor (e. g., nervousness, inattention), making the trial court's frsthand observations of even greater importance\"). The \"evaluation of the prosecutor's state of mind based on demeanor and credibility lies pecu-liarly within a trial judge's province.\" Hernandez, supra, at 365 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). The new evidence, moreover, supports the prosecution's concern about Hood's views on capital punishment. A hand-written document in the prosecution's fle stated that the Church of Christ \"doesn't take a stand on [the] Death Pen-alty.\" App. 302. Perplexingly, the Court considers this proof that the prosecution misled the trial court about its reasons for striking Hood. Ante, at 509-511. Hardly. That document further states that capital punishment is an issue \"left for each individual member,\" App. 302, and thus in no way discredits the prosecutor's statement that, in his experi-536 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Thomas, J., dissenting ence, \"Church of Christ people, while they may not take a for- mal stand against the death penalty, . . . are very, very reluc- tant to vote for the death penalty,\" id., at 84. And other notes in the fle say that Hood gave \"slow D[eath] P[enalty] answers\" and about [the] D[eath] P[en-alty].\" Id., at 295, 303. This new evidence supports the prosecution's stated reason for striking Hood\u2014that he, as a member of the Church of Christ, had taken an uncertain stance on capital punishment. 2 Likewise, the Court's evaluation of the strike of Garrett is riddled with error. The Court is vexed by a single misrep-resentation about the prosecution's decision to strike Gar-rett\u2014the prosecution stated that Garrett was listed as \" `questionable' \" but the new evidence reveals that Garrett was on the \" `defnite NO's' \" list from the beginning. Ante, at 504. But whether the prosecution planned to strike Gar-rett all along or only at the last minute seems irrelevant to the more than 10 race-neutral reasons the prosecution sup-plied for striking Garrett. The prosecution feared that Garrett might sympathize with Foster at sentencing. She worked with disadvantaged children, she was young, and she failed to disclose that her cousin had been recently arrested. See App. 55-57, 105. And prosecutors were concerned that she gave short an-swers, appeared nervous, and did not ask to be off the jury even though she was a divorced mother of two children and worked more than 70 hours per week. See id., at 55-56, 93- 94. The prosecution also stated repeatedly that they were concerned about female jurors, who \"appear to be more sym-pathetic men.\" Id., at 42; see id., at 57. 4 4 This Court's decision in J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U. S. 127 (1994), which held that peremptory strikes on the basis of sex were unconstitutional, postdated Foster's direct appeal. Cite as: 578 U. S. 488 (2016) 537 Thomas, J., dissenting Pieces of the new evidence support some of these concerns. The notes in the prosecutors' fle reveal that someone on the prosecution team was aware that Garrett's cousin was An-gela Garrett (who had been arrested for drug-related charges and fred from her job on the eve of trial, id., at 105, 129), that Garrett \"would not look a[t] [the] C[our]t during V[oir] D[ire],\" that she \"[l]ooked @ foor during D[eath] P[enalty]\" questioning. Id., at 293, 308. Nevertheless, the Court frets that these indisputably race- neutral reasons were pretextual. The Court engages in its own comparison of the jurors to highlight the prosecution's refusal to strike white jurors with similar characteristics. Ante, at 503-506. But as with venireman Hood, the Georgia courts were faced with the same contentions regarding Gar-rett decades ago, and the Supreme Court of Georgia rightly decided that the trial court's fndings were worthy of defer-ence. After conducting a post-trial hearing in which one of the prosecutors testifed, App. 80-125, the trial court cred-ited the prosecution's concerns. The trial court, for exam-ple, agreed that Garrett's association with Head Start might be troubling and \"believe[d] that the state [was] honest in voicing its concern that the combination of holding down two jobs and being the divorced mother of two indicates a less stable home environment,\" which \"was the prime defense in [Foster's] case.\" Id., at 142; see id., at 141. Again, that should be \"the end of the matter.\" Hernandez, 500 U. S., at 375 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). * * * Today, without frst seeking clarifcation from Georgia's highest court that it decided a federal question, the Court affords a death-row inmate another opportunity to relitigate his long-fnal conviction. In few other circumstances could I imagine the Court spilling so much ink over a factbound claim arising from a state postconviction proceeding. It was 538 FOSTER v. CHATMAN Thomas, J., dissenting the trial court that observed the veniremen frsthand and heard them answer the prosecution's questions, and its eval-uation of the prosecution's credibility on this point is cer-tainly far better than this Court's nearly 30 years later. See id., at 365 (plurality opinion). I respectfully dissent. OCTOBER TERM, 2015 539 Syllabus WITTMAN et al. v. PERSONHUBALLAH et al. on appeal from the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia No. 14-1504. Argued March 21, 2016\u2014Decided May 23, 2016 Appellee voters from Virginia's Congressional District 3 fled suit chal- lenging the Commonwealth's 2013 congressional redistricting plan on the ground that the legislature's redrawing of their district was an un-constitutional racial gerrymander. Appellant Members of Congress from Virginia, including, as relevant here, Representatives Randy Forbes, Robert Wittman, and David Brat, intervened to help defend the Commonwealth's plan. The District Court struck down the plan, and the intervenors appealed to this Court, which vacated the judgment below and remanded the case in light of one of the Court's recent deci-sions. Again, the District Court held that the redistricting plan was unconstitutional, and again, the intervenors appealed. This time, the Court directed the parties to address whether appellants lack standing, since none reside in or represent Congressional District 3. Held: Appellants lack standing to pursue this appeal. Pp. 543-546. (a) A party invoking a federal court's jurisdiction can establish Arti- cle III standing only by showing that he has suffered an \"injury in fact,\" that the injury is \"fairly traceable\" to the challenged conduct, and that the injury is likely to be \"redressed\" by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555, 560-561. The need to satisfy these requirements persists throughout the life of the suit. Arizonans for Offcial English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67. P. 543. (b) In light of the District Court's decision striking down the redis- tricting plan, Representative Forbes, the Republican incumbent in Dis-trict 4, decided to run in District 2. Originally, Representative Forbes argued that he would abandon his campaign in District 2 and run in District 4 if this Court ruled in his favor. Now, however, he has in-formed the Court that he will continue to seek election in District 2 regardless of this appeal's outcome. Given this change, this Court does not see how any injury that Forbes might have suffered is \"likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\" Hollingsworth v. Perry , 570 U. S. 693, 704. Regardless of whether Forbes had standing at the time he frst intervened, he does not have standing now. Representatives Wittman and Brat, the incumbents in Congressional Districts 1 and 7, respectively, have not identifed any record evidence 540 WITTMAN v. PERSONHUBALLAH Syllabus to support their allegation that the redistricting plan has harmed their prospects of reelection. The allegation of an injury, without more, is not suffcient to satisfy Article III. See Lujan, supra, at 561. Given the complete lack of evidence of any injury in this case, the Court need not decide when, or whether, evidence of the kind of injury the Repre-sentatives allege would prove suffcient for Article III purposes. Pp. 543-546. Appeal dismissed. Breyer , J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Michael A. Carvin argued the cause for appellants. With him on the briefs was John M. Gore . Stuart A.

S. 539 (2016) 541 Opinion of the Court Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. Ten Members of Congress from Virginia, intervenors in the District Court below, have appealed a judgment from a three-judge panel striking down a congressional redistrict-ing plan applicable to the November 2016 election. We con-clude that the intervenors now lack standing to pursue the appeal. And we consequently order the appeal dismissed. I This lawsuit began in October 2013, after the then- Governor of Virginia signed into law a new congressional redistricting plan (which we shall call the \"Enacted Plan\") designed to refect the results of the 2010 census. Three voters from Congressional District 3 brought this lawsuit against the Commonwealth. They challenged the Enacted Plan on the ground that its redrawing of their district's lines was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The Members of Congress now before us intervened to help defend the Enacted Plan. After a bench trial, a divided three-judge District Court agreed with the voters. It concluded that the Common- wealth had used race as the predominant basis for modifying the boundaries of District 3. Page v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 58 F. Supp. 3d 533, 550 (ED Va. 2014). And it found that the Commonwealth's use of race, when scrutinized strictly, was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling gov-ernmental interest. Id., at 553. The Commonwealth of Virginia did not appeal. Instead, the intervenor Members of Congress appealed the District Court's judgment to this Court. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1253 (granting the right to directly appeal certain three-judge dis-trict court orders to the Supreme Court). Having just de-cided a racial-gerrymandering case, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U. S. 254 (2015), we vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded for reconsidera-542 WITTMAN v. PERSONHUBALLAH Opinion of the Court tion in light of that recent decision. Cantor v. Personhubal- lah, 575 U. S. 931 (2015). On remand the District Court again decided that District 3, as modifed by the Enacted Plan, was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Page v. Virginia State Bd. of Elec- tions, 2015 WL 3604029, *19 (ED Va., June 5, 2015). The court's order set forth a deadline of September 1, 2015, for the Virginia Legislature to adopt a new redistricting plan. Again, the Commonwealth of Virginia decided not to ap- peal. And again, the intervenor Members of Congress ap-pealed to this Court. On September 28, 2015, we asked the parties to fle supplemental briefs addressing whether the intervenors had standing to appeal the District Court's deci-sion. 576 U. S. 1093. As relevant here, the intervenors ar-gued in their supplemental brief that they had standing be-cause the District Court's order, if allowed to stand, would necessarily result in a redrawing of their districts that would harm some of the intervenors' reelection prospects. On No-vember 13, 2015, we issued an order explaining that the Court was \"postpon[ing]\" \"consideration of the question of jurisdiction\" until \"the hearing of the case on the merits.\" In addition, our order instructed the parties to dedicate a portion of their briefs and their oral argument time to the issue of standing\u2014specifcally, \"[w]hether [the intervenors] lack standing because none reside in or represent the only congressional district whose constitutionality is at issue in this case.\" 577 U. S. 982. In the meantime, the Virginia Legislature failed to meet the September 1 deadline imposed by the District Court. The District Court thus appointed a Special Master to de-velop a new districting plan. The Special Master did so, and on January 7, 2016, the District Court approved that plan (which we shall call the \"Remedial Plan\"). The intervenor Members of Congress asked this Court to stay implementa-tion of the Remedial Plan pending resolution of their direct appeal to this Court. We declined to do so. 577 U. S. 1125 Cite as: 578 U. S. 539 (2016) 543 Opinion of the Court (2016). On March 21, we heard oral argument. That argu- ment focused both on (1) the merits of intervenors' claims denying any racial gerrymander and (2) the question of standing. In respect to standing, the Court focused on whether the District Court's approval of the Remedial Plan on January 7 supported, or undermined, the inter-venors' standing argument that, in the absence of the origi-nal Enacted Plan, they would suffer harm. Tr. of Oral Arg. 9-23. II As our request for supplemental briefng, our order post- poning consideration of jurisdiction, and our questions at oral argument suggested, we cannot decide the merits of this case unless the intervenor Members of Congress challenging the District Court's racial-gerrymandering decision have stand-ing. We conclude that the intervenors now lack standing. We must therefore dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Article III of the Constitution grants the federal courts the power to decide legal questions only in the presence of an actual \"Cas[e]\" or \"Controvers[y].\" This restriction re-quires a party invoking a federal court's jurisdiction to dem-onstrate standing. Arizonans for Offcial English v. Ari- zona, 520 U. S. 43, 64 (1997). A party has standing only if he shows that he has suffered an \"injury in fact,\" that the injury is \"fairly traceable\" to the conduct being challenged, and that the injury will likely be \"redressed\" by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555, 560- 561 (1992) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). The need to satisfy these three requirements persists throughout the life of the lawsuit. Arizonans for Offcial English, 520 U. S., at 67. The relevant parties here are the intervenor Members of Congress. Since the Commonwealth of Virginia has not pursued an appeal, only the intervenors currently attack the District Court's decision striking down the Enacted Plan. And an \"intervenor cannot step into the shoes of the original 544 WITTMAN v. PERSONHUBALLAH Opinion of the Court party\" (here, the Commonwealth) \"unless the intervenor in- dependently `fulflls the requirements of Article III.' \" Id., at 65 (quoting Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 68 (1986)). Although 10 current and former Members of Congress are technically intervenors, only 3 of the 10 now claim before this Court that they have standing. Those three Members are Representative Randy Forbes, Representative Robert Wittman, and Representative David Brat. Representative Forbes, the Republican incumbent in Con- gressional District 4, told us in his brief that, unless the Enacted Plan is upheld, District 4 will be \"completely trans- form[ed] from a 48% Democratic district into a safe 60% Democratic district.\" Brief for Appellants 58. According to Forbes, the threat of that kind of transformation com-pelled him to run in a different district, namely, Congres-sional District 2. At oral argument, Forbes' counsel told the Court that, if the Enacted Plan were reinstated, Representative Forbes would abandon his election effort in Congressional District 2 and run in his old district, namely, Congressional District 4. Tr. of Oral Arg. 10. Soon after oral argument, however, the Court received a letter from counsel stating that Repre-sentative Forbes would \"continue to seek election in District 2 regardless of whether the Enacted Plan is reinstated.\" Letter from Counsel for Appellants to Scott S. Harris, Clerk of Court (Mar. 25, 2016), p. 2. Given this letter, we do not see how any injury that Forbes might have suffered \"is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\" Hollings- worth v. Perry , 570 U. S. 693, 704 (2013). Consequently, we need not decide whether, at the time he frst intervened, Representative Forbes possessed standing. Regardless, he does not possess standing now. See Arizonans for Offcial English, supra, at 65; Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 477-478 (1990). Representative Wittman and Representative Brat are Re- publicans representing Congressional District 1 and Con-Cite as: 578 U. S. 539 (2016) 545 Opinion of the Court gressional District 7, respectively. In their opening brief they argue that they have standing to challenge the District Court's order because, unless the Enacted Plan is reinstated, \"a portion of the[ir] `base electorate' \" will necessarily be re-placed with \"unfavorable Democratic voters,\" thereby reduc-ing the likelihood of the Representatives' reelection. Brief for Appellants 58; see also Application for Stay of Remedial Plan Pending Resolution of Direct Appeal of Liability Judg-ment 25. Even assuming, without deciding, that this kind of injury is legally cognizable, Representatives Wittman and Brat have not identifed record evidence establishing their alleged harm. We have made clear that the \"party invoking federal juris- diction bears the burden of establishing\" that he has suffered an injury by submitting \"affdavit[s] or other evidence.\" Lujan, 504 U. S., at 561. When challenged by a court (or by an opposing party) concerned about standing, the party invoking the court's jurisdiction cannot simply allege a non-obvious harm, without more. Ibid. Here, there is no \"more.\" Representatives Wittman and Brat claim that un-less the Enacted Plan is reinstated, their districts will be fooded with Democratic voters and their chances of reelec-tion will accordingly be reduced. But we have examined the briefs, looking for any evidence that an alternative to the Enacted Plan (including the Remedial Plan) will reduce the relevant intervenors' chances of reelection, and have found none. The briefs focus on Congressional District 3 and Con-gressional District 4, districts with which Representatives Wittman and Brat are not associated. We need go no further. Given the lack of evidence that any of the three Representatives has standing, we need not decide when, or whether, evidence of the kind of injury they allege would prove suffcient for purposes of Article III's re-quirements. In light of the letter we have received about Representative Forbes, and the absence of any evidence in the briefs supporting any harm to the other two Representa-546 WITTMAN v. PERSONHUBALLAH Opinion of the Court tives, we conclude that none of the intervenors has standing to bring an appeal in this case. We consequently lack juris-diction and therefore dismiss this appeal. It is so ordered. OCTOBER TERM, 2015 547 Syllabus GREEN v. BRENNAN, POSTMASTER GENERAL certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 14-613. Argued November 30, 2015\u2014Decided May 23, 2016 After petitioner Marvin Green complained to his employer, the United States Postal Service, that he was denied a promotion because he was black, his supervisors accused him of the crime of intentionally delaying the mail. In an agreement signed December 16, 2009, the Postal Serv-ice agreed not to pursue criminal charges, and Green agreed either to retire or to accept another position in a remote location for much less money. Green chose to retire and submitted his resignation paperwork on February 9, 2010, effective March 31. On March 22\u201441 days after resigning and 96 days after signing the agreement\u2014Green reported an unlawful constructive discharge to an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor, an administrative prerequi-site to fling a complaint alleging discrimination or retaliation in vio-lation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1). Green eventually fled suit in Federal District Court, which dismissed his complaint as untimely because he had not contacted the counselor within 45 days of the \"matter alleged to be discrimina-tory,\" ibid. The Tenth Circuit affrmed, holding that the 45-day limita- tions period began to run on December 16, the date Green signed the agreement. Held: 1. Because part of the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" in a constructive-discharge claim is an employee's resignation, the 45-day limitations period for such action begins running only after an employee resigns. Pp. 552-563. (a) Where, as here, the regulatory text itself is not unambiguously clear, the Court relies on the standard rule for limitations periods, which provides that a limitations period ordinarily begins to run \" `when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action,' \" Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U. S. 409, 418. Applied here, that rule offers three persuasive reasons to include the employee's resignation in the limitations period. Pp. 552-558. (i) First, resignation is part of the \"complete and present cause of action\" in a constructive-discharge claim, which comprises two basic elements: discriminatory conduct such that a reasonable employee 548 GREEN v. BRENNAN Syllabus would have felt compelled to resign and actual resignation, Pennsylva- nia State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 148. Until he resigns, an employee does not have a \"complete and present cause of action\" for constructive discharge. Under the standard rule, only after the em- ployee has a complete and present cause of action does that trigger the limitations period. In this respect, a constructive-discharge claim is no different from an ordinary wrongful-discharge claim, which accrues only after the employee is fred. Pp. 554-556. (ii) Second, although the standard rule may be subject to excep- tion where clearly indicated by the text creating the limitations period, nothing in Title VII or the regulation suggests such displacement. To the contrary, it is natural to read \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" as including the allegation forming the basis of the claim, which confrms the standard rule's applicability. Pp. 556-557. (iii) Third, practical considerations also confrm the merit of applying the standard rule. Starting the clock ticking before a plaintiff can actually fle suit does little to further the limitations period's goals and actively negates Title VII's remedial structure. A \"limitations pe-rio[d] should not commence to run so soon that it becomes diffcult for a layman to invoke the protection of the civil rights statutes.\" Dela- ware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 262, n. 16. Nothing in the regulation suggests a two-step process in which an employee would have to fle a complaint after an employer's discriminatory conduct, only to be forced to amend that complaint to allege constructive discharge after resigning. Requiring that a complaint be fled before resignation occurs would also, e. g., ignore that an employee may not be in a position to leave his job immediately. Pp. 557-558. (b) Arguments against applying the standard rule here are re- jected. Suders stands not for the proposition that a constructive dis- charge is tantamount to a formal discharge for remedial purposes only, but for the rule that constructive discharge is a claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act, 542 U. S., at 149. Nor was Green's resig-nation the mere inevitable consequence of the Postal Service's discrimi-natory conduct. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, distinguished. Finally, the im- portant goal of promoting conciliation through early, informal contact with a counselor does not warrant treating a constructive discharge dif-ferent from an actual discharge for purposes of the limitations period. Pp. 558-563. 2. A constructive-discharge claim accrues\u2014and the limitations period begins to run\u2014when the employee gives notice of his resignation, not on the effective date thereof. The Tenth Circuit is left to determine, in the frst instance, the date that Green in fact gave notice. Pp. 563-564. Cite as: 578 U.

BRENNAN Opinion of the Court Equal Employment Opportunity counselor at his agency \"within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be dis-criminatory.\" 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1) (2015). If an employee claims he has been fred for discriminatory reasons, the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" includes the discharge itself and the 45-day limitations period begins running only after the employee is fred. We address here when the limitations period begins to run for an employee who was not fred, but resigns in the face of intolerable discrimination\u2014a \"constructive\" discharge. We hold that, in such circumstances, the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" includes the employee's resignation, and that the 45-day clock for a constructive discharge begins running only after the employee resigns. I We recite the following facts in the light most favorable to petitioner Marvin Green, against whom the District Court entered summary judgment. Green is a black man who worked for the Postal Service for 35 years. In 2008, he was serving as the postmaster for Englewood, Colorado, when he applied for a promotion to the vacant postmaster position in nearby Boulder. He was passed over. Shortly thereafter, Green complained he was denied the promotion because of his race. Green's relations with his supervisors crumbled following his complaint. Tensions peaked on December 11, 2009, when two of Green's supervisors accused him of intentionally de-laying the mail\u2014a criminal offense. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1703. They informed Green that the Postal Service's Offce of the Inspector General (OIG) was investigating the charge and that OIG agents had arrived to interview him as part of their investigation. After Green met with the OIG agents, his supervisors gave him a letter reassigning him to off-duty status until the matter was resolved. Even though the OIG agents reported to Green's supervisors that no further inves-Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 551 Opinion of the Court tigation was warranted, the supervisors continued to repre- sent to Green that \"the OIG is all over this\" and that the \"criminal\" charge \"could be a life changer.\" App. 53. On December 16, 2009, Green and the Postal Service signed an agreement whose meaning remains disputed. Relevant here, the Postal Service promised not to pursue criminal charges in exchange for Green's promise to leave his post in Englewood. The agreement also apparently gave Green a choice: Effective March 31, 2010, he could either retire or report for duty in Wamsutter, Wyoming\u2014 population 451\u2014at a salary considerably lower than what he earned in his Denver suburb. Green chose to retire and sub-mitted his resignation to the Postal Service on February 9, 2010, effective March 31. On March 22\u201441 days after submitting his resignation pa- perwork to the Postal Service on February 9, but 96 days after signing the settlement agreement on December 16\u2014 Green contacted an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor to report an unlawful constructive discharge. He contended that his supervisors had threatened criminal charges and negotiated the resulting agreement in retalia-tion for his original complaint. 1 He alleged that the choice he had been given effectively forced his resignation in viola-tion of Title VII. Green eventually fled suit in the Federal District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging, inter alia, that the Postal Service constructively discharged him. The Postal Service moved for summary judgment, arguing that Green had failed to make timely contact with an EEO counselor within 45 days of the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory,\" as required by 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1). The District Court granted the Postal Service's motion for summary judgment. 1 We assume without deciding that it is unlawful for a federal agency to retaliate against a civil servant for complaining of discrimination. See G\u00f3mez-P\u00e9rez v. Potter , 553 U. S. 474, 488, n. 4 (2008); Brief for Respond- ent 2. 552 GREEN v. BRENNAN Opinion of the Court The Tenth Circuit affrmed, holding that the \"matter al- leged to be discriminatory\" encompassed only the Postal Service's discriminatory actions and not Green's independent decision to resign on February 9. Green v. Donahue , 760 F. 3d 1135 (2014). Therefore, the 45-day limitations period started running when both parties signed the settlement agreement on December 16, 2009. Accordingly, because 96 days passed between the agreement and when Green con-tacted an EEO counselor on March 22, 2010, his constructive-discharge claim was time barred. Two other Courts of Appeals agree with the Tenth Cir- cuit's view that the limitations period begins to run for a constructive-discharge claim after the employer's last dis-criminatory act. 2 As the Tenth Circuit recognized, however, other Courts of Appeals have held that the limitations period for a constructive-discharge claim does not begin to run until the employee resigns. 3 We granted certiorari to resolve this split. 575 U. S. 983 (2015). Because no party here supports the Tenth Circuit's holding that an employee's resignation is not part of the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory,\" we appointed Cather-ine M. A. Carroll to defend that aspect of the judgment below. 576 U. S. 1087 (2015). She has ably discharged her duties and the Court thanks her for her service. II Before a federal civil servant can sue his employer in court for discriminating against him in violation of Title VII, he must frst exhaust his administrative remedies. 42 U. S. C. 2 Mayers v. Laborers' Health & Safety Fund of North America, 478 F. 3d 364, 370 (CADC 2007) (per curiam ); Davidson v. Indiana-American Water Works, 953 F. 2d 1058, 1059 (CA7 1992). 3 Flaherty v. Metromail Corp., 235 F. 3d 133, 138 (CA2 2000); Draper v. Coeur Rochester, Inc., 147 F. 3d 1104, 1111 (CA9 1998); Hukkanen v. Oper- ating Engineers, 3 F. 3d 281, 285 (CA8 1993); Young v. National Center for Health Servs. Research, 828 F. 2d 235, 238 (CA4 1987). Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 553 Opinion of the Court \u00a7 2000e-16(c). To exhaust those remedies, the Equal Em- ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has promulgated regulations that require, among other things, that a federal employee consult with an EEO counselor prior to fling a discrimination lawsuit. Specifcally, he \"must initiate con-tact with a Counselor within 45 days of the date of the mat-ter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action.\" 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1). 4 The timeliness of Green's claim therefore turns on our interpretation of this EEOC regula-tion implementing Title VII. 5 Although we begin our interpretation of the regulation with its text, the text in this case is not particularly helpful. Nowhere does \u00a7 1614.105 indicate whether a \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" in a constructive-discharge claim in-cludes the employee's resignation, as Green contends, or only the employer's discriminatory conduct, as amica contends. The word \"matter\" simply means \"an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense,\" Black's Law Dictionary 1126 (10th ed. 2014)\u2014a term that could readily apply to a discrimination-precipitated resignation. So the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" could refer to all of the allega- tions underlying a claim of discrimination, including the em-ployee's resignation, or only to those allegations concerning 4 This regulation, applicable to federal employees only, has a statutory analog for private-sector Title VII plaintiffs, who are required to fle a charge with the EEOC within 180 or 300 days \"after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1). Although the language is different, the EEOC treats the federal and private-sector employee limitations periods as identical in operation. See EEOC Com-pliance Manual: Threshold Issues \u00a7 2-IV(C)(1), n. 179, online at http:// www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/threshold.html (as last visited May 20, 2016). 5 Green does not contend that his alleged constructive discharge is a \"personnel action.\" See Brief for Petitioner 17-18; Green v. 760 F. 3d 1135, 1144, n. 3 (CA10 2014). We therefore address the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" clause only. 554 GREEN v. BRENNAN Opinion of the Court the employer's discriminatory conduct. We therefore must turn to other canons of interpretation. The most helpful canon in this context is \"the `standard rule' \" for limitations periods. Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U. S. 409, 418 (2005). Ordinarily, a \" `limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.' \" Ibid. \"[A] cause of action does not be- come `complete and present' for limitations purposes until the plaintiff can fle suit and obtain relief.\" Bay Area Laun- dry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997). Although the standard rule can be displaced such that the limitations period begins to run before a plaintiff can fle a suit, we \"will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication\" in the text of the limitations period. Reiter v. Cooper , 507 U. S. 258, 267 (1993). Applying this default rule, we are persuaded that the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" in a constructive-discharge claim necessarily includes the employee's resig-nation for three reasons. First, in the context of a constructive-discharge claim, a resignation is part of the \"complete and present cause of action\" necessary before a limitations period ordinarily begins to run. Second, nothing in the regulation creating the limitations period here, \u00a7 1614.105, clearly indicates an intent to displace this stand-ard rule. Third, practical considerations confrm the merit of applying the standard rule here. We therefore interpret the term \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" for a constructive-discharge claim to include the date Green resigned. A The standard rule for limitations periods requires us frst to determine what is a \"complete and present cause of ac-tion\" for a constructive-discharge claim. We hold that such a claim accrues only after an employee resigns. Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 555 Opinion of the Court The constructive-discharge doctrine contemplates a situa- tion in which an employer discriminates against an employee to the point such that his \"working conditions become so in-tolerable that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign.\" Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 141 (2004). When the em- ployee resigns in the face of such circumstances, Title VII treats that resignation as tantamount to an actual discharge. Id., at 142-143. A claim of constructive discharge therefore has two basic elements. A plaintiff must prove frst that he was discrimi- nated against by his employer to the point where a reason-able person in his position would have felt compelled to re-sign. Id., at 148. But he must also show that he actually resigned. Ibid. (\"A constructive discharge involves both an employee's decision to leave and precipitating conduct . . . \" (emphasis added)). In other words, an employee cannot bring a constructive-discharge claim until he is construc-tively discharged. Only after both elements are satisfed can he fle suit to obtain relief. Under the standard rule for limitations periods, the limita- tions period should begin to run for a constructive-discharge claim only after a plaintiff resigns. At that point\u2014and not before\u2014he can fle a suit for constructive discharge. So only at that point\u2014and not before\u2014does he have a \"com-plete and present\" cause of action. And only after he has a complete and present cause of action does a limitations pe-riod ordinarily begin to run. Cf. Mac's Shell Service, Inc. v. Shell Oil Products Co., 559 U. S. 175, 189-190 (2010) (the limitations period for a constructive termination of a fran-chise agreement starts running when the agreement is con-structively terminated). In this respect, a claim that an employer constructively discharged an employee is no different from a claim that an employer actually discharged an employee. An ordinary wrongful-discharge claim also has two basic elements: dis-556 GREEN v. BRENNAN Opinion of the Court crimination and discharge. See St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 506 (1993); 1 B. Lindemann, P. Gross- man, & C. Weirich, Employment Discrimination Law 21-33 (5th ed. 2012) (Lindemann) (\"The sine qua non of a discharge case is, of course, a discharge\"). The claim accrues when the employee is fred. At that point\u2014and not before\u2014he has a \"complete and present cause of action.\" So at that point\u2014and not before\u2014the limitations period begins to run. With claims of either constructive discharge or actual dis- charge, the standard rule thus yields the same result: A limi-tations period should not begin to run until after the dis-charge itself. In light of this rule, we interpret the term \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" in \u00a7 1614.105 to refer to all of the elements that make up a constructive-discharge claim\u2014including an employee's resignation. B Although the standard rule dictates that a limitations pe- riod should commence only after a claim accrues, there is an exception to that rule when the text creating the limitations period clearly indicates otherwise. See, e. g., Dodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 360 (2005). Nothing in the text of Title VII or the regulation, however, suggests that the standard rule should be displaced here. To the contrary, the language of the regulation confrms our application of the default rule. As noted previously, the word \"matter\" generally refers to \"an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.\" Black's Law Dictionary, at 1126. The natural reading of \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" thus refers to the alle-gation forming the basis of the discrimination claim\u2014here, a claim of constructive discharge. And as discussed above, a constructive-discharge claim requires two basic allegations: discriminatory conduct by the employer that leads to resig-nation of the employee. So long as those acts are part of the same, single claim under consideration, they are part of Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 557 Opinion of the Court the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory,\" whatever the role of discrimination in each individual element of the claim. Cf. National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 115-121 (2002) (holding that a hostile-work-environment claim is a single \"unlawful employment prac-tice\" that includes every act composing that claim, whether those acts are independently actionable or not). C Finally, we are also persuaded that applying the standard rule for limitations periods to constructive discharge makes a good deal of practical sense. Starting the limitations clock ticking before a plaintiff can actually sue for constructive discharge serves little purpose in furthering the goals of a limitations period\u2014and it actively negates Title VII's reme-dial structure. Cf. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 398 (1982) (holding that the Title VII limitations period should be construed to \"honor the remedial purpose of the legislation as a whole without negating the particular purpose of the fling requirement\"). This Court has recognized \"that the limitations perio[d] should not commence to run so soon that it becomes diffcult for a layman to invoke the protection of the civil rights stat-utes.\" Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 262, n. 16 (1980). If the limitations period begins to run follow- ing the employer's precipitating discriminatory conduct, but before the employee's resignation, the employee will be forced to fle a discrimination complaint after the employer's conduct and later amend the complaint to allege constructive discharge after he resigns. Nothing in the regulation sug-gests it intended to require a layperson, while making this diffcult decision, to follow such a two-step process in order to preserve any remedy if he is constructively discharged. Moreover, forcing an employee to lodge a complaint before he can bring a claim for constructive discharge places that employee in a diffcult situation. An employee who suffered 558 GREEN v. BRENNAN Opinion of the Court discrimination severe enough that a reasonable person in his shoes would resign might nevertheless force himself to toler-ate that discrimination for a period of time. He might delay his resignation until he can afford to leave. Or he might delay in light of other circumstances, as in the case of a teacher waiting until the end of the school year to resign. Tr. 17. And, if he feels he must stay for a period of time, he may be reluctant to complain about discrimination while still employed. A complaint could risk termination\u2014an ad-ditional adverse consequence that he may have to disclose in future job applications. III Amica and the dissent read \"matter alleged to be discrimi- natory\" as having a clear enough meaning to displace our reliance on the standard rule for limitations periods. They argue that \"matter\" is not equivalent to \"claim\" or \"cause of action,\" and that the use of the phrase \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" is a suffciently clear statement that the standard claim accrual rule should not apply. According to amica and the dissent, \"matter\" refers only to the discrimi- natory acts of the Postal Service, not Green's resignation. We disagree. There is nothing inherent in the phrase \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" that clearly limits it to employer conduct. Rather, as discussed above, the term can reasonably be interpreted to include the factual basis for a claim. Green is not alleging just that the Postal Service discriminated against him. He claims that the discrimina-tion left him no choice but to resign. Amica and the dissent dispute that a constructive dis- charge is a separate claim. According to amica and the dis- sent, the constructive-discharge doctrine merely allows a plaintiff to expand any underlying discrimination claim to include the damages from leaving his job, thereby increasing his available remedies. See 1 Lindemann 21-49 (construc-tive discharge allows plaintiff to seek backpay, front pay, or reinstatement). In support of this argument, amica and the Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 559 Opinion of the Court dissent emphasize this Court's statement in Suders that \"[u]nder the constructive discharge doctrine, an employee's reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable work-ing conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge for re- medial purposes.\" 542 U. S., at 141 (emphasis added); see also id., at 148 (\"[A] constructive discharge is functionally the same as an actual termination in damages-enhancing respects\"). But the Court did not hold in Suders that a constructive discharge is tantamount to a formal discharge for remedial purposes exclusively. To the contrary, it expressly held that constructive discharge is a claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act. Id., at 149 (holding that a hostile-work- environment claim is a \"lesser included component\" of the \"graver claim of hostile-environment constructive dis- charge\"). This holding was no mere dictum. See id., at 142 (\"[A] claim for constructive discharge lies under Title VII\"). We see no reason to excise an employee's resignation from his constructive-discharge claim for purposes of the limita-tions period. The concurrence sets out a theory that there are two kinds of constructive discharge for purposes of the limitations pe-riod: constructive-discharge \"claims\" where the employer \"makes conditions intolerable with the specific discri - minatory intent of forcing the employee to resign,\" and constructive-discharge \"damages\" where the employer does not intend to force the employee to quit, but the discrimina-tory conditions of employment are so intolerable that the em-ployee quits anyway. Post, at 569-574 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment). According to the concurrence, the limitations period does not begin to run until an employee resigns under the \"claim\" theory of constructive discharge, but begins at the last discriminatory act before resignation under the \"damages\" theory. This sometimes-a-claim-sometimes-not theory of construc- tive discharge is novel and contrary to the constructive-560 GREEN v. BRENNAN Opinion of the Court discharge doctrine. The whole point of allowing an em- ployee to claim \"constructive\" discharge is that in circumstances of discrimination so intolerable that a reason-able person would resign, we treat the employee's resigna-tion as though the employer actually fred him. Suders, 542 U. S., at 141-143. 6 We do not also require an employee to come forward with proof\u2014proof that would often be diffcult to allege plausibly\u2014that not only was the discrimination so bad that he had to quit, but also that his quitting was his employer's plan all along. Amica and the dissent also argue that their interpretation is more consistent with this Court's prior precedent on when the limitations period begins to run for discrimination claims. Under their interpretation, Green's resignation was not part of the discriminatory \"matter,\" but was instead the mere inevitable consequence of the Postal Service's discrimi-natory conduct, and therefore cannot be used to extend the 6 The concurrence suggests that its theory is consistent with statements in the Suders opinion that constructive discharge is akin to an actual dis- charge \" `for remedial purposes' \" and in \" `damages-enhancing respects.' \" Post, at 573 (opinion of Alito, J.) (quoting Suders, 542 U. S., at 141, 148). This ignores the more obvious explanation for this qualifcation: The Court was distinguishing between the merits of a claim of constructive discharge generally, where resignation is imputed as a discriminatory act of the em-ployer, and the affrmative defense available to an employer in a hostile-work-environment claim specifcally, which allows an employer to defend against a hostile-work-environment claim in certain circumstances if it took no \" `offcial act' \" against the employee. Id., at 143-146. The Court in Suders recognized that it would be bizarre to always impute resignation as an \"offcial act\" of the employer in a constructive-discharge hostile-work-environment case and prohibit the employer from relying on the no-\"offcial-act\" defense, because it would make it easier to prove the \"graver\" claim of a constructive-discharge hostile work environment than to prove a hostile-work-environment claim. Id., at 148-149. Thus, the Court de- clined to hold that resignation in a constructive-discharge case was cate-gorically an \"offcial act\" in all instances. Ibid. In other words, the Court sought a measure of parity between constructive discharge and or-dinary discrimination\u2014parity that we extend to the limitations period here. Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 561 Opinion of the Court limitations period. See Brief for Court-Appointed Amica Curiae in Support of Judgment Below 21-27 (Brief for Amica Curiae) (citing Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618 (2007), overruled by statute, Lilly Ledbet- ter Fair Pay Act of 2009, 123 Stat. 5; Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250; United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553 (1977)); post, at 580-585 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, and Chardon v. Fernandez, 454 U. S. 6 (1981) (per curiam )). Similarly, the concurrence ar- gues these cases require that an act done with discrimina-tory intent must occur within the limitations period. Post, at 568 (opinion of Alito, J.). But these cases are consistent with the standard rule that a limitations period begins to run after a claim accrues, not after an inevitable consequence of that claim. In Ricks, for example, the Court considered the discrimination claim of a college faculty member who was denied tenure and given a 1-year \" `terminal' \" contract for his last year teaching. 449 U. S., at 258. The plaintiff's claim accrued\u2014and he could have sued\u2014when the college informed him he would be de-nied tenure and gave him \"explicit notice that his employ-ment would end\" when his 1-year contract expired. Ibid. The Court held that the limitations period began to run on that date, and not after his 1-year contract expired. That fnal year of teaching was merely an inevitable consequence of the tenure denial the plaintiff claimed was discriminatory. Green's resignation, by contrast, is not merely an inevita- ble consequence of the discrimination he suffered; it is an essential part of his constructive-discharge claim. That is, Green could not sue for constructive discharge until he actu-ally resigned. Of course, Green could not resign and then wait until the consequences of that resignation became most painful to complain. For example, he could not use the date of the expiration of his health insurance after his resignation to extend the limitations period. But the \"inevitable conse-quence\" principle of Ricks, Ledbetter , and Evans does not 562 GREEN v. BRENNAN Opinion of the Court change the focus of the limitations period, which remains on the claim of discrimination itself. See Lewis v. Chicago , 560 U. S. 205, 214 (2010) (holding Evans and its progeny \"estab- lish only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a present viola-tion within the limitations period\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Morgan, 536 U. S., at 115-121 (holding limitations period for hostile-work-environment claim runs from the last act composing the claim). 7 For a constructive discharge, the claim does not exist until the employee resigns. Finally, amica contends that her interpretation of the reg- ulation better advances the EEOC's goal of promoting concil-iation for federal employees through early, informal contact with an EEO counselor. See Exec. Order No. 11478, \u00a7 4, 34 Fed. Reg. 12986 (1969) (counseling for federal employees \"shall encourage the resolution of employee problems on an informal basis\"). The dissent suggests that our holding will make a discrimination victim the master of his complaint, permitting him to \" `exten[d] the limitation[s period] indef-nitely' \" by waiting to resign. Post, at 584 (opinion of Thomas, J.). The concurrence claims that an employee who relies on the limitations period in waiting to resign is \"dou-bly out of luck\" if his otherwise-meritorious discrimination claim is time barred and he cannot show the discrimination 7 The dissent relies on Morgan's other holding that, unlike a hostile- work-environment claim that may comprise many discriminatory acts, dis- crete claims of discrimination based on independent discriminatory acts cannot be aggregated to extend the limitations period. See post, at 581 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (citing 536 U. S., at 109-113). But this just proves the point: The analysis for the limitations period turns on the nature of the specifc legal claim at issue. In Morgan, the Court noted that even if a claim of discrimination based on a single discriminatory act is time barred, that same act could still be used as part of the basis for a hostile-work-environment claim, so long as one other act that was part of that same hostile-work-environment claim occurred within the limitations pe-riod. Id., at 117 (\"It is precisely because the entire hostile work environ- ment encompasses a single unlawful employment practice that we do not hold, as have some of the Circuits, that the plaintiff may not base a suit on individual acts that occurred outside the statute of limitations . . . \"). Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 563 Opinion of the Court was so intolerable that it amounted to a constructive dis- charge. Post, at 576 (opinion of Alito, J.). These concerns are overblown. Amica may be right that it is more diffcult to achieve conciliation after an employee resigns. But the same is true for a federal civil servant who is fred by his agency for what the employee believes to be a discriminatory purpose. And neither decision is necessarily permanent\u2014a resignation or a termination may be undone after an employee contacts a counselor. Conciliation, while important, does not warrant treating a constructive dis-charge different from an actual discharge for purposes of the limitations period. As for the dissent's fear, we doubt that a victim of employ- ment discrimination will continue to work in an intolerable environment merely because he can thereby extend the limi-tations period for a claim of constructive discharge. If any-thing, a plaintiff who wishes to prevail on the merits of his constructive-discharge claim has the opposite incentive. A claim of constructive discharge requires proof of a causal link between the allegedly intolerable conditions and the resigna-tion. See 1 Lindemann 21-45, and n. 106. And as for the concurrence's double-loser concern, no plaintiff would be well advised to delay pursuing what he believes to be a meritorious non-constructive-discharge-discrimination claim on the ground that a timely fled constructive-discharge claim could resuscitate other time-lapsed claims. The 45-day limitations period begins running on any separate underlying claim of discrimination when that claim accrues, regardless of whether the plaintiff even-tually claims constructive discharge. The limitations-period analysis is always conducted claim by claim. IV Our decision that a resignation triggers the limitations pe- riod for a constructive-discharge claim raises the question of when precisely an employee resigns. Here, Green and the 564 GREEN v. BRENNAN Opinion of the Court Government agree that an employee resigns when he gives his employer defnite notice of his intent to resign. If an employee gives \"two weeks' notice\"\u2014telling his employer he intends to leave after two more weeks of employment\u2014the limitations period begins to run on the day he tells his em-ployer, not his last day at work. (This issue was not ad-dressed by the Tenth Circuit and, accordingly, amica takes no position on it. See Brief for Amica Curiae 42.) We agree. A notice rule fows directly from this Court's precedent. In Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, and Chardon v. Fer- nandez, 454 U. S. 6, the Court explained that an ordinary wrongful-discharge claim accrues\u2014and the limitations pe-riod begins to run\u2014when the employer notifes the employee he is fred, not on the last day of his employment. Ricks, 449 U. S., at 258-259; Chardon, 454 U. S., at 8. Likewise, here, we hold that a constructive-discharge claim accrues\u2014 and the limitations period begins to run\u2014when the employee gives notice of his resignation, not on the effective date of that resignation. One factual issue remains: when exactly Green gave the Postal Service notice of his resignation. The Government argues that Green resigned on December 16, 2009\u2014when he signed the settlement agreement\u2014and that his claim is therefore still time barred. Green argues that he did not resign until February 9, 2010\u2014when he submitted his retire-ment paperwork\u2014and that his claim is therefore timely. We need not resolve this issue. Having concluded that the limitations period for Green's constructive-discharge claim runs from the date he gave notice of his resignation, we leave it to the Tenth Circuit to determine when this in fact occurred. * * * For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Tenth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consist-ent with this opinion. So ordered. Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 565 Alito, J., concurring in judgment Justice Alito , concurring in the judgment. In its pursuit of a bright-line limitations rule for construc- tive discharge claims, the Court loses sight of a bedrock prin- ciple of our Title VII cases: An act done with discriminatory intent must have occurred within the limitations period. We have repeatedly held that the time to pursue an employ-ment discrimination claim starts running when a discrimina-tory act occurs, and that a fresh limitations period does not start upon the occurrence of a later nondiscriminatory act\u2014 even if that later act carries forward the effects of the earlier discrimination. See, e. g., United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, 558 (1977); Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257-258 (1980); Chardon v. Fernandez, 454 U. S. 6, 8 (1981) (per curiam ); Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc., 490 U. S. 900, 907-908, 911 (1989); National Railroad Pas- senger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, 113 (2002); Led- better v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618, 628 (2007). Without mentioning this consistent line of prece-dent, the Court categorically declares that the limitations pe-riod for constructive discharge cases starts upon the employ-ee's resignation, no matter when the last discriminatory act occurred. This effectively disposes of the discriminatory-intent requirement. Rather than jettison our precedent, I would hold that the limitations period for constructive discharge claims\u2014like all other employment discrimination claims\u2014starts running upon a discriminatory act of the employer. But I would also hold that an employee's resignation can, in many cases, be considered a discriminatory act of the employer. This is so where an employer subjects an employee to intolerable working conditions with the discriminatory intent to force the employee to resign. In these circumstances, the employ-ee's consequent resignation is tantamount to an intentional termination by the employer, and so gives rise to a fresh limitations period just as a conventional termination would. Absent such intent, however, the resignation is not an inde-566 GREEN v. BRENNAN Alito, J., concurring in judgment pendent discriminatory act but merely a delayed conse- quence of earlier discrimination. The resignation may be a basis for enhancing damages in a claim brought on the under-lying discrimination, but it cannot restart the limitations clock. In this case, Green presented suffcient evidence that the Postal Service intended to force him to resign when it pre-sented him with a settlement agreement requiring that he either retire or transfer to a distant post offce for much less pay. Accordingly, the 45-day window for him to initiate counseling opened when he gave the Postal Service notice of his resignation. I A The regulation at issue here requires a federal employee who complains of unlawful discrimination to initiate contact with an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor \"within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be dis-criminatory.\" 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1) (2015). The Court observes that this language \"is not particularly helpful\" in resolving the question presented, and so it quickly moves on to other considerations. Ante, at 553. I think that more can be discerned from the regulation's text. The Court ob-serves that a \"matter\" in this context is \"an allegation form-ing the basis of a claim or defense.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1126 (10th ed. 2014); ante, at 553. But the Court fails to plug in the regulation's critical qualifer: The matter must be (alleged to be) discriminatory . The phrase \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" is thus most fairly read to refer to the allegation of discrimination that underlies an employee's claim, not just any fact that supports the claim. Even if the regulation's text were unclear on this point, the next place I would look is not to a \"standard rule\" governing limitations periods, as the majority does, ante , at 554, but to the specifc limitations rules we apply in other Title VII Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 567 Alito, J., concurring in judgment cases. Private-sector Title VII plaintiffs are required to fle a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-mission (EEOC) within 180 or 300 days \"after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1); see Morgan, supra (construing this statutory provision). 1 Although this language is not identical to the regulation at issue here, nothing in either text requires that they be read as setting different rules. Indeed, the EEOC's Compliance Manual treats them the same\u2014it describes the regulation as requiring federal employees to contact a coun-selor within 45 days of \"the alleged discriminatory employ-ment practice ,\" and it cites Morgan as providing the govern- ing standard. 2 We also granted review in this case on the premise that the same rule would apply to both federal-sector and private-sector Title VII cases: Green's petition and merits brief ask us to decide when the fling period for constructive discharge claims begins as a matter of \"federal employment discrimination law\" generally, Pet. for Cert. i; Brief for Petitioner i, and the Circuit split he alleges consists primarily of cases in which the limitations period ran from the date of an unlawful employment \"practice,\" see Pet. for Cert. 11-16. The majority, for its part, seems to agree that the same rules should apply in the federal and private sec-tors, and it too relies on private-sector cases in describing the Circuit split that today's decision is meant to \"resolve.\" Ante, at 552, and nn. 2-3, 553, n. 4. The majority's relega- tion of our Title VII timeliness cases to its rebuttal argu-ment, see ante, at 560-562, is thus surprising. 1This 180- or 300-day period is often referred to as the \"charging\" or \"fling\" period. See, e. g., Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618, 624 (2007); National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Mor- gan, 536 U. S. 101, 117 (2002). Because the 45-day period at issue in this case involves initiating counseling rather than fling a charge, for simplic-ity I refer to all of these periods as \"limitations\" periods. 2 EEOC Compliance Manual: Threshold Issues \u00a7 2-IV(C)(1), and n. 179 (emphasis added), online at http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/threshold.html (as last visited May 20, 2016). 568 GREEN v. BRENNAN Alito, J., concurring in judgment B Our Title VII precedents set somewhat different limitations rules for claims based on a discrete act of discrimination (such as termination, failure to hire, or demotion) and claims based on a hostile work environment. I will focus on the former set of rules because Green's resignation was a discrete act that was precipitated by another discrete act\u2014namely, the settle-ment agreement that required him to retire or transfer to a far-off, lower paying position. For private-sector claims based on discrete acts, the limitations period starts to run on the day the discriminatory act occurred and expires 180 or 300 days later. Morgan, 536 U. S., at 110. This means that an act done with discriminatory intent \u2014not merely some act bearing on the claim\u2014must have occurred within the limitations period. We therefore held in Morgan that \"discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely fled charges,\" and that \"a time-barred act [cannot] justify fling a charge concerning a termination that was not inde- pendently discriminatory .\" Id., at 113 (emphasis added). We spoke even more directly to the point in Ledbetter . There we described \"discriminatory intent\" as the \"defning element\" of a Title VII disparate-treatment claim, 550 U. S., at 624, and held that the plaintiff's claim of pay discrimina-tion was untimely because she did not allege that any \"inten-tionally discriminatory conduct occurred during the [limi-tations] period,\" id., at 628. Although the plaintiff had suffered lower pay within the limitations period because of earlier alleged discrimination, we explained that under our precedents a new limitations period \"does not commenc[e] upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimi-nation.\" Ibid. (discussing Evans, 431 U. S. 553, Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, Lorance , 490 U. S. 900, and Morgan, supra). Re- lying on nondiscriminatory acts to establish a timely claim, we reasoned, would impermissibly \"shift intent from one act Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 569 Alito, J., concurring in judgment (the act that consummates the discriminatory employment practice) to a later act that was not performed with bias or discriminatory motive. The effect of this shift would be to impose liability in the absence of the requisite intent.\" 550 U. S., at 629. At the same time, we recognized that when multiple acts that are each \"intentionally discriminatory\" occur, \"a fresh violation takes place\"\u2014and thus a new limita-tions period starts running\u2014\"when each act is committed.\" Id., at 628. 3 C These principles lead to the following rule for constructive discharge cases: An employee's resignation triggers a fresh limitations period if the resignation itself constitutes an \"in-tentionally discriminatory\" act of the employer. In my view, an employee's resignation in the face of intolerable working conditions can be considered a discriminatory act of the employer when the employer makes conditions intolera-ble with the specifc discriminatory intent of forcing the em- ployee to resign. If the employer lacks that intent, however, the limitations period runs from the discriminatory act that precipitated the resignation. This approach refects the fact that there are two kinds of constructive discharge. Much of the disagreement between the majority and dissent stems from their differing views of the nature of constructive discharge. To the majority, con-structive discharge is always a standalone \"claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act.\" Ante, at 559. To Justice Thomas and the friend of the Court we appointed to defend the judgment below, constructive discharge is never 3 Congress has since abrogated Ledbetter 's precise holding in the context of \"discrimination in compensation,\" Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, \u00a7 3, 123 Stat. 5, codifed at 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), but it did not disturb the reasoning of the precedents on which Ledbetter was based. Cf. Ledbetter , supra, at 627, n. 2 (discussing similar amendment abrogating the precise holding of Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989)). 570 GREEN v. BRENNAN Alito, J., concurring in judgment a separate claim, but merely \"a counterdefense to an employ- er's contention that a resignation was voluntary\" that allows the resigning employee to recover backpay and other relief unavailable to employees who quit voluntarily. Post, at 586. As I see it, each side is partly right. The label \"constructive discharge\" is best understood to refer to two different (though related) concepts, one a distinct claim and one not. This case requires us to distinguish between the two and to \"identify with care the specifc employment practice that is at issue.\" Ledbetter , supra, 624 (citing Morgan, supra, at 110-111). 1 The frst kind of constructive discharge occurs when an employer subjects an employee to intolerable conditions with the specifc discriminatory intent of forcing the employee to quit. In this situation, the employer has deliberately termi-nated the employee\u2014a discrete employment action. The discharge is termed \"constructive,\" however, because it is formally effected by the employee's resignation rather than the employer's pink slip. The termination can nevertheless be considered a discriminatory act of the employer because the employer intends to terminate the employee and\u2014 through the imposition of intolerable conditions\u2014forces the employee to \"rubberstamp\" that decision by resigning. Cf. Staub v. Proctor Hospital, 562 U. S. 411, 425 (2011) (Alito , J., concurring in judgment); id., at 419 (majority opinion) (\"Animus and responsibility for [an] adverse action can both be attributed to [an] earlier agent . . . if the adverse action is the intended consequence of that agent's discriminatory conduct\"). Because the resignation is the \"act that consum-mates the discriminatory employment practice\" of terminat-ing the employee, Ledbetter , 550 U. S., at 629, it triggers a fresh limitations period. In such cases, the constructive dis-charge should, like a formal discharge, be treated as a distinct cause of action\u2014what we might call a proper \"con-structive discharge claim.\" Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 571 Alito, J., concurring in judgment The employer's discriminatory intent sometimes will mani- fest itself only outside the limitations period. Consider, for example, an employer that demotes an employee (say, from executive to offce assistant) for discriminatory reasons and with the intent that the loss of prestige will force the em-ployee to quit. By the time the employee fnally cracks and resigns, the discriminatory demotion may be outside the lim- itations window and not independently actionable. But the employer's discriminatory intent to terminate the employee can carry forward to the eventual resignation. We recog-nized this possibility in Ledbetter . We explained that a plaintiff generally cannot create a timely Title VII claim by \"attach[ing]\" the discriminatory intent accompanying an act outside the limitations period to another act that occurred within the limitations period. 550 U. S., at 625, 629. At the same time, we acknowledged that \"there may be instances where the elements forming a cause of action\"\u2014discrimina-tory intent and an employment action\u2014\"span more than 180 days\" (that is , the applicable limitations period). Id., at 631, n. 3. In such a case, we said, the limitations period would start to run when \"the employment practice was executed,\" because that is when \"[t]he act and intent had . . . been joined.\" Ibid. Under my example, then, the employer \"forms an illegal discriminatory intent\" to terminate the em-ployee at the time of the demotion, but the termination is not \"executed\" or \"consummate[d]\" until the employee re- signs some time later. Ibid.; id., at 629. Only at that point have the discriminatory intent to terminate and the act of termination been \"joined,\" and therefore only at that point does the limitations period for the wrongful discharge start to run. 2 The second kind of constructive discharge occurs when an employer imposes intolerable conditions for discriminatory reasons but does not intend to force an employee to resign. 572 GREEN v. BRENNAN Alito, J., concurring in judgment This is quite different from an ordinary discharge because the critical element of intent is missing. The resignation cannot be considered an intentionally discriminatory act of the employer because it is not something the employer delib-erately brought about; it is simply a later-arising conse-quence of the earlier discrimination. The resignation thus does not trigger a fresh limitations period or give rise to a separate cause of action. See Evans, 431 U. S., at 558 (A nondiscriminatory act that \"gives present effect to a past act of discrimination\" is not actionable); Ricks, 449 U. S., at 258 (\"[T]he proper focus is upon the time of the discriminatory acts, not upon the time at which the consequences of the acts became most painful\" (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); Ledbetter , supra, at 628 (\"A new violation does not occur, and a new [limitations] period does not com-mence, upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination\"). This does not let the employer off the hook. It is still liable for the acts of discrimination that precipitated the res-ignation, provided that the employee properly and timely challenges them. And in a suit brought on those underlying acts, the resignation\u2014if reasonable\u2014\"is assimilated to a for-mal discharge for remedial purposes.\" Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 141 (2004) (emphasis added). The resigning employee can recover, as damages for the un-derlying discrimination, \"all damages [that would be] avail-able for formal discharge\" but which are normally unavail-able to employees who voluntarily quit. Id., at 147, n. 8; see post, at 586 (Thomas, J., dissenting). A resignation that is the reasonable but unintended result of the employer's dis-criminatory acts thus does not lead to a standalone \"con-structive discharge claim.\" Instead, it is a basis for increas-ing damages on the underlying discrimination claim\u2014what we might call a \"constructive discharge damages enhance-ment.\" See Suders, supra, at 148 (analogizing constructive Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 573 Alito, J., concurring in judgment discharge to \"an actual termination in damages-enhancing respects\").4 The majority asserts that in Suders the Court \"expressly held\" that constructive discharge is always its own distinct claim. Ante, at 559. I do not think that the Suders Court would have taken such pains to qualify its statements that a constructive discharge is akin to an actual termination \"for remedial purposes\" and \"in damages-enhancing respects,\" 542 U. S., at 141, 148, had that been its intention. Nor was it necessary for the Court to resolve whether constructive discharge is a separate cause of action or merely a basis for enhancing damages. The majority observes that Suders re- ferred to a \"claim\" for constructive discharge. See ante, at 559. But the use of that term does not indicate that con- structive discharge is (always) an independent cause of ac-tion any more than stray references to a \"claim for punitive damages,\" e. g., BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore , 517 U. S. 559, 564 (1996); Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hut- ton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 58 (1995), mean that punitive damages are actionable independent of an underlying tort claim. The majority also asserts that intent to cause a resignation is unnecessary for a constructive discharge cause of action because the \"whole point\" of constructive discharge is to treat the resignation like a fring. Ante, at 560. I had thought that the \"whole point\" of a Title VII disparate-treatment claim was to combat intentional discrimination. See, e. g., Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 1002 (1988) (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"[A] 4 These enhanced damages would also be available in a suit based on the underlying discrimination where the employer intended to make the employee resign. Intent to force the resignation is necessary to pursue constructive discharge as a separate claim from the underlying discrimina-tion, but it certainly does not prevent an employee from pursuing greater damages for the underlying discrimination on a constructive discharge theory. 574 GREEN v. BRENNAN Alito, J., concurring in judgment disparate-treatment challenge focuses exclusively on the in- tent of the employer\"). A resignation cannot be deemed the equivalent of an actionable intentional termination if the em-ployer lacks intent to terminate. See Staub , 562 U. S., at 417-418 (holding that a person who \"did not intend to cause [a] dismissal\" cannot be deemed \"responsible\" for the dis- missal, even if the dismissal was the \"result\" or \"foreseeable consequence\" of the person's actions); see also id., at 417 (\"Intentional torts such as this . . . generally require that the actor intend the consequences of an act, not simply the act itself\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). But as I have explained, a resignation in those circumstances may still be treated like a fring for damages purposes. Our cases de-mand nothing more. II A The framework I propose respects the fundamental rule that an act done with discriminatory intent must have oc-curred within the limitations period. It also comports with the default rule that limitations periods start to run when a cause of action accrues. When an employer intends to force an employee to resign, the resignation gives rise to a new cause of action for constructive discharge, with a limitations period that runs from the date of the resignation. But when an employer does not intend to force the employee to resign, the employee's only cause of action is based on the underly-ing discriminatory acts, and the limitations period runs from the time that claim accrued. 5 It is thus entirely unnecessary for the majority to abandon the discriminatory-intent re-quirement in service of the \"standard\" limitations rule. 5 For example, if an unintended resignation was prompted by a discrete act like a humiliating demotion or transfer, the limitations period would run from the date of demotion or transfer. See Morgan, 536 U. S., at 110-113. If the resignation was prompted by an intolerable hostile work environment, the limitations period would run from any act that contrib-uted to the hostile work environment. See id., at 117-118. Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 575 Alito, J., concurring in judgment These two rules ft together perfectly once one appreciates the dual nature of constructive discharge. It is abundantly clear that the majority has abandoned the discriminatory-intent requirement and would deem a con-structive discharge claim timely even if no discriminatory act occurred within the limitations period. The majority admits as much. It declares that the employer's discriminatory con-duct and the employee's resignation are both \"part of the `mat-ter alleged to be discriminatory,' \" and therefore (in its view) the resignation may trigger the limitations period \"whatever the role of discrimination in [the resignation] element.\" Ante, at 556-557 (emphasis added). To support this dubious propo-sition, the majority cites Morgan's holding that an individual act contributing to a hostile work environment need not be in-dependently actionable for the act to start a fresh limitations period. Ante , at 557. This analogy is particularly inapt be- cause Green's constructive discharge claim is based on a dis-crete act, not a hostile work environment. See supra, at 568. Even setting that aside, Morgan held only that an act contrib- uting to a hostile work environment need not be independently actionable by dint of its severity . That is because a hostile work environment claim is based on the \"cumulative effect of individual acts\" that may not \" `suffciently affect the condi-tions of employment to implicate Title VII' \" unless considered in the aggregate. 536 U. S., at 115 (emphasis added). Noth-ing in Morgan suggests that the limitations period for a hostile work environment claim can run from an act that is not dis- criminatory . To the contrary, the Court referred to \"act[s] of harassment\"\u2014such as acts, . . . negative comments regarding the capacity of blacks to be supervisors, and . . . various racial epithets\"\u2014 as triggering the limitations period. Id., at 115, 120 (empha- sis added). B The majority opines that its rule is better for employees because it prevents the limitations period from expiring be-576 GREEN v. BRENNAN Alito, J., concurring in judgment fore an employee resigns. Ante, at 557. Things are not that simple. The majority's rule benefts only those employ- ees who can meet the demanding standard for constructive discharge, while setting a springe for those who cannot. Constructive discharge is an \"aggravated\" form of discrimi-nation involving truly \"intolerable\" working conditions that leave an employee no choice but to resign. Suders, 542 U. S., at 146-147. This is an objective standard, id., at 141, and what is subjectively intolerable to a particular employee may strike a court or jury as merely unpleasant. So imagine an employee who is subjected to sexual harass- ment at her federal workplace but\u2014relying on the majority's rule\u2014does not pursue EEO counseling until 45 days after the harassment leads her to resign. Suppose too that the last act of harassment occurred the day before she resigned. If a court ultimately concludes that the harassment was ob-jectively intolerable and the employee was justifed in re-signing, she can recover for the constructive discharge. But if it turns out that she has proved only \"ordinary discrimina-tion\" without the \"something more\" needed to establish con-structive discharge, id., at 147 (internal quotation marks omitted), the employee is doubly out of luck: Not only does her constructive discharge fail on the merits, but any \"lesser included\" hostile work environment claim that she might have brought (and prevailed on), id., at 149, is time barred. Encouraging employees to wait until after resigning to pur-sue discrimination claims thus may needlessly deprive un-wary discrimination victims of relief. The better approach is to encourage employees to seek EEO counseling (or, in the private sector, fle an EEOC charge) at the earliest opportunity, based on the underlying discriminatory acts. 6 Every allegation of constructive dis- charge must be based on an actionable discriminatory prac- 6 The majority seems to agree that employees should promptly challenge the underlying discrimination, see ante , at 563, so why it disparages the idea elsewhere in its opinion, see ante, at 557, is beyond me. Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 577 Alito, J., concurring in judgment tice, see ibid.; 1 B. Lindemann, P. Grossman, & C. Weirich, Employment Discrimination Law 21-49 (5th ed. 2012), for which the employee can immediately seek counseling and pursue a discrimination claim. If the employee later re-signs, he or she can seek damages from the resignation as part of that timely claim. See supra, at 572-573, and n. 4. Under the framework I have set forth, an employee who fails to pursue the underlying discrimination claim can still pur-sue a standalone constructive discharge claim so long as there is suffcient evidence that the employer acted with in-tent to force the employee to resign. This will often be the case when working conditions are so intolerable that a rea-sonable employee would be compelled to quit. The em-ployer will usually be aware that conditions are terrible, and \"[p]roof that a defendant acted knowingly very often gives rise to a reasonable inference that the defendant also acted purposely.\" Loughrin v. United States, 573 U. S. 351, 371 (2014) (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-ment). 7 But the possibility of recovering damages for only the constructive discharge, and not for discrimination suf-fered before the resignation, will be an unsatisfactory alter-native for many employees who have suffered through unen-durable working conditions. III It remains to apply the foregoing principles to this case. The Tenth Circuit held that the Postal Service was entitled to summary judgment on its limitations defense. The ques-tion therefore is whether Green adduced suffcient evidence 7 Given this inference, it is hard to see why the majority thinks that it \"would often be diffcult to allege plausibly\" that such an employer in- tended to force the employee to resign. Ante, at 560. It is not inherently more diffcult (and it will often be easier) to allege and prove that an employer intended the foreseeable consequences of its actions than it is to allege and prove that an employer acted because of discriminatory animus against an employee's race, sex, religion, or other protected characteris-tic\u2014a burden every Title VII plaintiff must carry. 578 GREEN v. BRENNAN Thomas, J., dissenting from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the Postal Service intended to force his resignation when it presented him with the settlement agreement. If so, then the limita-tions period ran from the date of Green's resignation. I have little trouble concluding that Green has carried his burden. Indeed, the Postal Service virtually concedes the point. It observes that the agreement expressly stated that Green would retire, and provided for his reporting to duty in Wamsutter, Wyoming, only in the event that the retire-ment fell through. App. 60-61; Brief for Respondent 33. A jury could reasonably conclude that the Postal Service, by offering Green a choice between retiring and taking a lower paying job hundreds of miles away, intended to make him choose retirement. Accordingly, for summary judgment purposes, the 45-day window for contacting an EEO coun-selor ran from the date on which Green resigned\u2014or, more precisely, the date on which he gave the Postal Service notice of his retirement, see ante, at 564. I am inclined to agree with Green that\u2014viewing the evi- dence in the light most favorable to him\u2014he did not give notice of his retirement until he submitted his retirement papers, making his claim timely. Although the settlement agreement provided that he would retire, it alternatively al-lowed him to transfer to Wyoming. Unless Green would have been turned away from the Wamsutter Post Offce de-spite that language had he chosen to go there, it was not until Green submitted his retirement papers that one could say with certainty that his position would be terminated rather than transferred. That said, like the majority I am content to leave this question for the Tenth Circuit to tackle on remand. I accordingly concur in the judgment. Justice Thomas, dissenting. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employ- ers from engaging in discriminatory acts against their em- ployees. Under a 1992 Equal Employment Opportunity Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 579 Thomas, J., dissenting Commission (EEOC) regulation implementing Title VII, fed- eral employees \"who believe they have been discriminated against\" \"must consult a[n] [EEOC] Counselor prior to fling a complaint in order to try to informally resolve the matter.\" 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105(a) (2015). In particular, the aggrieved employee \"must initiate contact with a Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discrimina-tory.\" \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1). Today, the Court holds that a \"matter alleged to be dis- criminatory\" includes a matter that is not \"discriminatory\" at all: a federal employee's decision to quit his job. Ante, at 553-554. The majority reaches this conclusion by adopting an atextual reading of the regulation that expands the constructive-discharge doctrine. Consistent with the text of the regulation and history of the constructive-discharge doctrine, I would hold that only an employer's actions may constitute a \"matter alleged to be discriminatory.\" Because the only employer action alleged to be discriminatory here took place more than 45 days before petitioner Marvin Green contacted EEOC, his claims are untimely. I therefore re-spectfully dissent. I The meaning of a \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" refers to actions taken by the employer, not the employee. This follows from the ordinary meaning of \"matter\" and \"dis-criminatory,\" as well as this Court's precedents. A I begin with \" `the language [of the regulation] itself and the specifc context in which that language is used.' \" Mc- Neill v. United States, 563 U. S. 816, 819 (2011) (brackets omitted). When a word or phrase is left undefned\u2014as \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" is\u2014we Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer , 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995). A \"matter\" is \"a subject under consider-ation, esp. involving a dispute or litigation\" or \"[s]omething 580 GREEN v. BRENNAN Thomas, J., dissenting that is to be tried or proved; an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.\" Black's Law Dictionary 992 (7th ed. 1999); 9 Oxford English Dictionary 481 (2d ed. 1989) (\"mat-ter\" means \"[a]n event, circumstance, fact, question, state or course of things, etc., which may be an object of consider-ation or practical concern; a subject, affair, business\"); see ante , at 553 (embracing this view). The term \"discrimina- tory\" means characterized by differential treatment that lacks a sound justifcation. See Random House Dictionary of the English Language 564 (2d ed. 1987) (\"discriminatory\" means \"characterized by or showing prejudicial treatment, esp. as an indication of racial, religious, or sexual bias\"); B. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 191 (1987) (\"discriminatory\" means \"applying discrimination in treat-ment, esp. on ethnic grounds\"); Black's Law Dictionary, at 479 (\"discrimination\" means characterized by \"[d]ifferential treatment; esp., a failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored\"). Thus, a \"matter alleged to be dis-criminatory\" means an employee's allegation that he was treated in an unjustifably differential manner. In the context of employment discrimination, only an em- ployer can discriminate against\u2014or apply unjustifable dif-ferential treatment to\u2014an employee. 1 An employee cannot plausibly be said to discriminate against himself. It there-fore makes no sense to say that an employee's act of quitting constitutes an action in which he was treated in a differential manner that lacked a sound justifcation. And, it does not make any more sense to say that an em- ployee's decision to quit is itself \"discriminatory\" simply be-cause it may result from antecedent discriminatory conduct. As two of our precedents\u2014National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101 (2002), and Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250 (1980)\u2014illustrate, the 1 Title VII defnes the term \"employer\" to include \"agent[s]\" of the em- ployer. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e(b). Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 581 Thomas, J., dissenting \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" is the reason the employee quit, and not the quitting itself. In Morgan, we rejected the argument that a phrase simi- lar to \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\"\u2014namely, an \" `al- leged unlawful employment practice' \"\u2014\"connotes an ongo-ing violation that can endure or recur over a period of time.\" 536 U. S., at 109-111. We held that discrete discriminatory acts of the employer occurring outside a fling period were not actionable, even if connected to other acts within the period. Id., at 113. The word \"practice,\" we explained, did not \"conver[t] related discrete acts into a single unlawful practice for the purposes of timely fling.\" Id., at 111. The same is true of the word \"matter.\" See, e. g., EEOC Compli- ance Manual: Threshold Issues 2-IV(C)(1), to be discriminatory\" \"the alleged discriminatory employment practice\"), online at http:// www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/threshold.html (as last visited Mar. 29, 2016). Ricks complements Morgan by holding that discrimination occurs when an employer takes some adverse action against the employee, and not when the employee feels the conse-quences of that action. 449 U. S., at 257-258. In Ricks, we considered the timeliness of an EEOC complaint that a pro-fessor fled after he was allegedly denied tenure on account of his national origin. Id., at 252-254. The employer of- fered him a contract to teach one more year after it denied tenure. Id., at 255. The professor contended that his claim did not accrue until his 1-year contract expired, because the offer of the contract constituted a \" `continuing violation.' \" Id., at 257. We rejected that argument and explained that \"[m]ere continuity of employment, without more, is insuff-cient to prolong the life of a cause of action for employment discrimination.\" Ibid.; see also Chardon v. Fernandez, 454 U. S. 6, 8 (1981) (per curiam ) (holding that claims of adminis- trators of the Puerto Rican Department of Education were untimely because their claims accrued when they received 582 GREEN v. BRENNAN Thomas, J., dissenting notice that they would be fred and not on the effective date of their terminations). The alleged employer conduct that most immediately prompted Green's decision to quit was the Postal Service's request on or about December 15, 2009, that he sign a settle-ment agreement. See App. 17, \u00b672; id., at 19, \u00b683. It is irrelevant whether Green's decision to quit \"g[a]v[e] present effect to the past illegal act[s] and therefore perpetuate[d] the consequences of forbidden discrimination.\" Ricks , supra, at 258 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the Postal Service's December 15 request is the \"matter al-leged to be discriminatory,\" Green had 45 days from Decem-ber 15 to initiate contact with EEOC. 2 Because he was 52 days late in doing so, his claim was untimely. B The majority reaches the opposite conclusion for three rea- sons. None withstands scrutiny. First, the majority observes that the text of the regulation is \"not particularly helpful\" because the word \"matter\" sim-ply means \" `an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense,' \" which \"could readily apply to a discrimination-precipitated resignation.\" Ante , at 553. Thus, the major- ity contends, \"matter\" could \"reasonably be interpreted to include the factual basis for a claim,\" which, in its view, in-cludes Green's decision to resign. Ante , at 558. But, as ex- plained, that interpretation does not grapple with the entire phrase, \"matter alleged to be discriminatory ,\" which does 2 Title VII does not provide federal employees with a cause of action for retaliation. Ante, at 551, n. 1. Title VII's federal-sector provision incorporates certain private-sector provisions related to discrimination but does not incorporate the provision prohibiting retaliation in the pri-vate sector. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e-16(d) (incorporating \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5(f) to (k) but not \u00a7 2000e-3(a), which forbids private-sector retaliation). In light of this text, I have grave doubts that Green\u2014as a federal employee\u2014has a claim for retaliation. But because the parties do not raise this issue, and the majority leaves it open, I need not resolve it. Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 583 Thomas, J., dissenting not encompass the subsequent nondiscriminatory actions that the employee takes. Second, the majority contends that the \"standard rule for limitations periods\" informs its understanding of 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105. Ante , at 554 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this rule, the majority contends, a limitations period does not begin to run until there is a \"complete and present cause of action.\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The majority concludes that there is no \"complete and pres-ent cause of action\" for constructive discharge until \"an em-ployee resigns.\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Even assuming that an employee's resignation was an es- sential part of a constructive-discharge \"claim\" (but see Part II, infra) the \"standard rule\" is merely a \"default\" rule. Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U. S. 409, 418 (2005). That \"de-fault rule\" does not apply, however, where\u2014as here\u2014the text confrms that the limitations period begins to run before the cause of action accrues. Pillsbury v. United Engineering Co., 342 U. S. 197 (1952), confrms this point. In that case, the Court considered a statute that provided that \" `[t]he right to compensation for disability . . . shall be barred unless a claim therefor is fled within one year after the injury.' \" Id., at 197 (quoting 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 913(a) (1952 ed.)). The Court held that the 1-year period began at the time of injury, not when the employee later became disabled as a result of the injury, and concluded that \"Congress meant what it said when it limited recovery to one year from date of injury, and `injury' does not mean `disability.' \" 342 U. S., at 200. Although that reading meant that \"an employee [could] be barred from fling his claim before his right to fle it arises,\" the Court refused to \"rewrite the statute of limitations\" to avoid that result. Id., at 199-200; see also, e. g., Dodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 357-360 (2005) (giving effect to the clear text of a limita-tions provision even though that reading \"ma[de] it diffcult\" 584 GREEN v. BRENNAN Thomas, J., dissenting for certain movants \"to obtain relief\" and could lead to \"harsh results\"). Like the limitations provision in Pillsbury , 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105 makes clear that the limitations period could begin before any constructive-discharge claim accrues, lest \"what was intended to be a limitation [be] no limitation at all.\" 342 U. S., at 200. The regulation instructs that the limita-tions period begins to run when the \"matter alleged to be discriminatory\" occurs\u2014i. e., the discriminatory conduct of the employer. To say that this includes Green's resignation could \"have the effect of extending the limitation indef-nitely.\" Ibid.; see Part I-A, supra. Finally, the majority downplays Morgan and Ricks by claiming that Green's resignation was \"not merely an inevita-ble consequence of the discrimination he suffered; it is an essential part of his constructive-discharge claim.\" Ante , at 561. \"[A] claim that an employer constructively discharged an employee,\" the majority contends, \"is no different from a claim that an employer actually discharged an employee.\" Ante, at 555. This reasoning cannot be reconciled with the regulatory text and fails to grapple with our precedents . By isolating Green's late response to the settlement agree-ment rather than his employer's alleged coercion of Green to sign that agreement, the majority ignores the discriminatory act and bestows on Green an advantage that other employees subject to wrongful discrimination do not have. Had Green signed termination papers rather than settlement papers, there would be no question about the untimeliness of his claims. As in Ricks, the time for Green's claim would have begun to run when his employer discriminated against him, even if the termination was not effective until months later. 449 U. S., at 257; see also Chardon, 454 U. S., at 8 (same). But today, the majority decides that Green's claim is differ-ent. In doing so, the majority elevates constructive dis-charge to the status of a super termination capable of ex-Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 585 Thomas, J., dissenting tending a limitations period far beyond the time the em- ployer acted discriminatorily. II The majority's error is not merely one of regulatory misin- terpretation. By misreading the regulation, the majority expands the constructive-discharge doctrine beyond its orig-inal bounds. In particular, the majority cements the (mis-taken) notion that constructive discharge is an independent cause of action\u2014and not a mere counterdefense\u2014by unjusti-fably focusing on an employee's response to an employer's conduct. See, e. g., ante , at 555-562. In doing so, the ma- jority exacerbates the problems that Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129 (2004), frst created in adopt- ing a capacious defnition of \"constructive discharge.\" A In holding that a discrimination claim based on construc- tive discharge accrues when an employee resigns, the major-ity wrongly assumes that constructive discharge is a sepa-rate claim equivalent to an actual discharge under Title VII. Ante , at 558-559. But the constructive-discharge doctrine is best understood as \"a counter-defense to the employer[']s defense that the worker [voluntarily] quit,\" and not a sepa-rate claim. EEOC v. R. J. Gallagher Co., 959 F. Supp. 405, 408 (SD Tex. 1997), vacated in part on other grounds, 181 F. 3d 645 (CA5 1999). The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) developed the constructive-discharge doctrine in the 1930's \"to address situations in which employers coerced employees to resign, often by creating intolerable working conditions, in retali-ation for employees' engagement in collective activities.\" Suders, supra, at 141; see also Shuck, Comment, That's It, I Quit: Returning to First Principles in Constructive Dis-charge Doctrine, 23 Berkeley J. Empl. & Lab. L. 401, 406- 586 GREEN v. BRENNAN Thomas, J., dissenting 407 (2002). An employee who voluntarily quit usually lost the right to backpay and other remedies, whereas an em-ployee who was fred for discriminatory reasons did not. See id., at 403. The constructive-discharge doctrine enabled courts to provide a remedy to those employees who voluntar-ily quit based on the fction that their decision to quit was not actually voluntary. See ibid.; Suders, supra, at 147, n. 8. Thus, as it was originally conceived, constructive discharge was not an independent cause of action but instead a counter-defense to an employer's contention that a resignation was voluntary and, thus, should \"factor into the damages.\" Knabe v. Boury Corp., 114 F. 3d 407, 408, n. 1 (CA3 1997); see also Russ v. Van Scoyoc Assoc., Inc., 122 F. Supp. 2d 29, 35-36 (DC 2000) (collecting cases). So understood, an employee's resignation does not complete any cause of action, and thus does not trigger the limitations period. The majority contends that Suders marked a departure from this original conception of constructive discharge by \"expressly h[o]ld[ing] that constructive discharge is a claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act.\" Ante, at 559. But, that case does not resolve the issue one way or the other. To be sure, Suders contains a few statements suggesting that constructive discharge is a claim. As the majority points out, for example, Suders states that a hostile work environment claim is less \"grav[e]\" than a \"claim of hostile-environment constructive discharge,\" and \"a claim for constructive discharge lies under Title VII.\" Ante, at 559 (citing Suders, 542 U. S., at 142, 149; emphasis added); see also id., at 133 (referring to \"sexual harassment/constructive discharge claim\"); id., at 143 (referring to \"constructive dis- charge claims\"). At the same time, however, the question at issue in Suders was the availability of affrmative de- fenses. In that vein, Suders held only that employers could avail themselves of those defenses if an \"offcial act\" of the company \"d[id] not underlie the constructive discharge.\" Id., at 148. There are also statements throughout the Su-Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 587 Thomas, J., dissenting ders opinion that are fatly inconsistent with the reading that the majority suggests. For example, it points out that an employee's resignation is \"assimilated to a formal discharge\" for \"remedial purposes,\" without mentioning liability. Id., at 141 (emphasis added); see also id., at 147, n. 8 (noting that \"a prevailing constructive discharge plaintiff is entitled to all damages available for formal discharge,\" including \"back-pay\" and sometimes \"frontpay\"); id., at 148 (\"[A] constructive discharge is functionally the same as an actual termination in damages-enhancing respects\" (emphasis added)). In short, Suders does not resolve whether constructive discharge de- pends on the underlying discriminatory act. And, it does not hold that constructive discharge is a cause of action that is distinct from the underlying discrimination claim. B The majority today not only exploits Suders' imprecision about whether constructive discharge is an independent claim, but also takes advantage of that opinion's ambiguity as to what an employee must establish to invoke the doc-trine. In Suders, I objected to the Court's statement that the constructive-discharge doctrine encompasses those situa-tions in which \"working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign.\" Id., at 141. That descrip- tion does \"not in the least resemble actual discharge\" be-cause it permits an employee \"to allege a constructive dis-charge absent any adverse employment action\" and absent any employer intent to cause a resignation. Id., at 153-154 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Despite the Suders Court's overly broad description of the doctrine, the Court at least retained some focus on an em-ployer's conduct. The Court in Suders explained that whether to \"assimilat[e]\" a constructive discharge \"to a for-mal discharge for remedial purposes\" entailed an \"objective\" inquiry that focused on the \"working conditions\" themselves. 588 GREEN v. BRENNAN Thomas, J., dissenting Id., at 141. And, it held that an employer could raise certain affrmative defenses to stave off liability when no offcial action forced an employee to resign. Id., at 147. Today, the majority goes even further than Suders in evis- cerating the limitations on the constructive-discharge doc-trine. The majority's rule transforms constructive dis-charge into a claim focused on the employee's conduct, instead of the employer's. Green does not allege that, after he signed the settlement agreement, any other act\u2014by a su-pervisor or even a co-worker\u2014occurred or otherwise imme-diately precipitated his decision to quit. See App. 19, \u00b6\u00b683- 85. The majority's holding\u2014that Green's claim accrued when he resigned\u2014must rest then on Green's own subjective feelings about the forced settlement. By ignoring the date on which an employer's discriminatory act occurred and in-stead focusing only on an employee's subjective response to that discriminatory act (see ante, at 560-562), the majority dispenses with the function of an employer's conduct. The effect of the majority's analysis, then, is that constructive discharge no longer involves any sort of objective inquiry. I cannot agree. The concept of constructive discharge is already on tenuous footing. It is not based on the text of Title VII but instead on the fction that an employee's resig-nation can be attributed to his employer in limited circum-stances. As initially conceived by the NLRB, this fctitious attribution could be justifed an [thus] the employee to backpay.\" Shuck, 23 Berkeley J. Empl. & Lab. L., at 409 (emphasis added); see, e. g., In re Waples-Platter Co., 49 N. L. R. B. 1156, 1174-1175 (1943) (concluding that it was reasonable per se for the employees to quit in light of the nature of the employer's intentional, discriminatory transfers). Such attribution cannot be justifed, however, where\u2014as here\u2014the constructive discharge accrues based Cite as: 578 U. S. 547 (2016) 589 Thomas, J., dissenting solely on an employee's subjective response to alleged discrimination. * * * Because Green has not proffered any evidence that dis- crimination continued to occur after he signed the settlement agreement, his contact with EEOC was untimely under 29 CFR \u00a7 1614.105. Accordingly, I would affrm the judgment of the Court of the Appeals. 590 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 Syllabus UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS v. HAWKES CO., INC., et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit No. 15-290. Argued March 30, 2016\u2014Decided May 31, 2016 The Clean Water Act regulates \"the discharge of any pollutant\" into \"the waters of the United States.\" 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311(a), 1362(7), (12). When property contains such waters, landowners who discharge pollut-ants without a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers risk substan-tial criminal and civil penalties, \u00a7\u00a7 1319(c), (d), while those who do apply for a permit face a process that is often arduous, expensive, and long. It can be diffcult to determine in the frst place, however, whether \"wa-ters of the United States\" are present. During the time period relevant to this case, for example, the Corps defned that term to include all wetlands, the \"use, degradation or destruction of which could affect in-terstate or foreign commerce.\" 33 CFR \u00a7 328.3(a)(3). Because of that diffculty, the Corps allows property owners to obtain a standalone \"ju-risdictional determination\" (JD) specifying whether a particular prop-erty the United States.\" \u00a7 331.2. A JD may be either \"preliminary,\" advising a property owner that such waters \"may\" be present, or \"approved,\" defnitively \"stating the presence or absence\" of such for fve years on both the Corps and the Environmental Protection Agency, 33 CFR pt. 331, App. C; EPA, Memorandum of Agreement: Exemptions Under Section 404(F) of the Clean Water Act \u00a7 VI-A. Respondents, three companies engaged in mining peat, sought a per- mit from the Corps to discharge material onto wetlands located on prop- erty that respondents own and hope to mine. In connection with the permitting process, respondents obtained an approved JD from the Corps stating that the property contained \"waters of the United States\" because its wetlands had a \"signifcant nexus\" to the Red River of the North, located some 120 miles away. After exhausting administrative remedies, respondents sought review of the approved JD in Federal District Court under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), but the District Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction, holding that the re-vised JD was not a \"fnal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,\" 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 704. The Eighth Circuit reversed. Cite as: 578 U. S. 590 (2016) 591 Syllabus Held: The Corps' approved JD is a fnal agency action judicially reviewable under the APA. Pp. 597-602. (a) In general, two conditions must be satisfed for an agency action to be \"fnal\" under the APA: \"First, the action agency's decisionmaking process,\" and \"second, the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will fow.\" Bennett v. Spear , 520 U. S. 154, 597-600. (1) the Corps' decisionmaking on the ques-tion whether a particular property does or does not contain \"waters of the United States.\" It is issued after extensive factfnding by the Corps regarding the physical and hydrological characteristics of the property, see U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jurisdictional Determina-tion Form Instructional Guidebook 47-60, and typically remains valid for a period of fve years, see 33 CFR pt. 331, App. C. The Corps itself describes approved JDs as \"fnal agency action.\" Id. \u00a7 320.1(a)(6). Pp. 597-598. (2) The defnitive nature of approved JDs also gives rise to \"direct and appreciable legal consequences,\" thereby satisfying Bennett 's second condition as well. 520 U. S., at 178. A \"negative\" JD\u2014i. e., an approved JD stating that property does not contain jurisdictional waters\u2014creates a fve-year safe harbor from civil enforcement proceed-ings brought by the Government and limits the potential liability a prop-erty owner faces for violating the Clean Water Act. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1319, 1365(a). Each of those effects is a legal consequence. It fol-lows that an \"affrmative\" JD, like the one issued here, also has legal consequences: It deprives property owners of the fve-year safe harbor that \"negative\" JDs afford. This conclusion tracks the \"pragmatic\" ap-proach the Court has long taken to fnality. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner , 387 U. S. 136, 149. Pp. 598-600. (b) A \"fnal\" agency action is reviewable under the APA only if there are no adequate alternatives to APA review in court. The Corps con- tends that respondents have two such alternatives: They may proceed without a permit and argue in a Government enforcement action that a permit was not required, or they may complete the permit process and then seek judicial review, which, the Corps suggests, is what Congress envisioned. Neither alternative is adequate. Parties need not await enforcement proceedings before challenging fnal agency action where such proceedings carry the risk of \"serious criminal and civil penalties.\" Abbott, 387 U. S., at 153. And the permitting process is not only costly and lengthy, but also irrelevant to the fnality of the approved JD and its suitability for judicial review. Furthermore, because the Clean 592 ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS v. HAWKES CO. Syllabus Water Act makes no reference to standalone jurisdictional determina- tions, there is little basis for inferring anything from it concerning their reviewability. Given \"the APA's presumption of reviewability for all fnal agency action,\" Sackett v. EPA, 566 U. S. 120, 129, \"[t]he mere fact\" that permitting decisions are reviewable is insuffcient to imply \"exclu-sion as to other[ ]\" agency actions, such as approved JDs, Abbott, 387 U. S., at 141.

Opinion of the Court I A The Clean Water Act prohibits \"the discharge of any pol- lutant\" without a permit into \"navigable waters,\" which it defnes, in turn, as \"the waters of the United States.\" 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311(a), 1362(7), (12). During the time period rel- evant to this case, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers de-fned the waters of the United States to include land areas occasionally or regularly saturated with water\u2014such as \"mudfats, sandfats, playa lakes\"\u2014the \"use, degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce.\" 33 CFR \u00a7 328.3(a)(3) (2012). The Corps has applied that defnition to assert jurisdiction over \"270-to-300 million acres of swampy lands in the United States\u2014 including half of Alaska and an area the size of California in the lower 48 States.\" Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 722 (2006) (plurality opinion). 1 It is often diffcult to determine whether a particular piece of property contains waters of the United States, but there are important consequences if it does. The Clean Water Act imposes substantial criminal and civil penalties for discharg-ing any pollutant into waters covered by the Act without a permit from the Corps. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311(a), 1319(c), (d), 1344(a). The costs of obtaining such a permit are sig-nifcant. For a specialized \"individual\" permit of the sort at issue in this case, for example, one study found that the aver-age applicant \"spends 788 days and $271,596 in completing the process,\" without \"counting costs of mitigation or design 1 In 2015, the Corps adopted a new rule modifying the defnition of the scope of waters covered by the Clean Water Act in light of scientifc re- search and decisions of this Court interpreting the Act. See Clean Water Rule: Defnition of \"Waters of the United States,\" 80 Fed. Reg. 37054, 37055-37056. That rule is currently stayed nationwide, pending resolu-tion of claims that the rule is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. See In re EPA, 803 F. 3d 804, 807-809 (CA6 2015). Cite as: 578 U. S. 590 (2016) 595 Opinion of the Court changes.\" Rapanos, 547 U. S., at 721. Even more readily available \"general\" permits took applicants, on average, 313 days and $28,915 to complete. Ibid. See generally 33 CFR \u00a7 323.2(h) (limiting \"general\" permits to activities that \"cause only minimal individual and cumulative environmental impacts\"). The Corps specifes whether particular property contains \"waters of the United States\" by issuing \"jurisdictional de-terminations\" (JDs) on a case-by-case basis. in two varieties: \"preliminary\" and \"approved.\" Ibid. While preliminary JDs merely advise a property owner \"that there may be waters of the United States on a parcel,\" ap- proved JDs defnitively \"stat[e] the presence or absence\" of such waters. Ibid. (emphasis added). Unlike preliminary JDs, approved JDs can be administratively appealed and are defned by regulation to \"constitute a Corps fnal agency action.\" \u00a7\u00a7 320.1(a)(6), 331.2. They are binding for fve years on both the Corps and the Environmental Protection Agency, which share authority to enforce the Clean Water Act. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1319, 1344(s); 33 CFR pt. 331, App. C; EPA, Memorandum of Agreement: Exemptions Under Section 404(F) of the Clean Water Act \u00a7 VI-A (1989) (Memo-randum of Agreement). B Respondents are three companies engaged in mining peat in Marshall County, Minnesota. Peat is an organic material that forms in waterlogged grounds, such as wetlands and bogs. See Xuehui & Jinming, Peat and Peatlands, in 2 Coal, Oil Shale, Natural Bitumen, Heavy Oil and Peat 267-272 (G. Jinsheng ed. 2009) (Peat and Peatlands). It is widely used for soil improvement and burned as fuel. Id., at 277. It can also be used to provide structural support and mois-ture for smooth, stable greens that leave golfers with no one to blame but themselves for errant putts. See Monteith & Welton, Use of Peat and Other Organic Materials on Golf Courses, 13 Bulletin of the United States Golf Association 596 ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS v. HAWKES CO. Opinion of the Court Green Section 90, 95-100 (1933). At the same time, peat mining can have signifcant environmental and ecological im-pacts, see Peat and Peatlands 280-281, and therefore is regu-lated by both federal and state environmental protection agencies, see, e. g., Minn. Stat. \u00a7 103G.231 (2014). Respondents own a 530-acre tract near their existing min- ing operations. The tract includes wetlands, which respond-ents believe contain suffcient high quality peat, suitable for use in golf greens, to extend their mining operations for 10 to 15 years. App. 8, 14-15, 31. In December 2010, respondents applied to the Corps for a Section 404 permit for the property. Id., at 15. A Section 404 permit authorizes \"the discharge of dredged or fll mate- rial into the navigable waters at specifed disposal sites.\" 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1344(a). Over the course of several communica- tions with respondents, Corps offcials signaled that the per-mitting process would be very expensive and take years to complete. The Corps also advised respondents that, if they wished to pursue their application, they would have to submit numerous assessments of various features of the property, which respondents estimate would cost more than $100,000. App. 16-17, 31-35. In February 2012, in connection with the permitting proc- ess, the Corps issued an approved JD stating that the prop-erty contained \"water of the United States\" because its wet-lands had a \"signifcant nexus\" to the Red River of the North, located some 120 miles away. Id., at 13, 18, 20. Re- spondents appealed the JD to the Corps' Mississippi Valley Division Commander, who remanded for further factfnding. On remand, the Corps reaffrmed its original conclusion and issued a revised JD to that effect. Id., at 18-20; App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a-45a. Respondents then sought judicial review of the revised JD under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 500 et seq. The District Court dismissed for want of sub- ject matter jurisdiction, holding that the revised JD was not Cite as: 578 U. S. 590 (2016) 597 Opinion of the Court \"fnal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,\" as required by the APA prior to judicial review, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 704. 963 F. Supp. 2d 868, 872, 878 (Minn. 2013). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit re-versed, 782 F. 3d 994, 1002 (2015), and we granted certiorari, 577 U. S. 1046 (2015). II The Corps contends that the revised JD is not \"fnal agency action\" and that, even if it were, there are adequate alternatives for challenging it in court. We disagree at both turns. A In Bennett v. Spear , 520 U. S. 154 (1997), we distilled from our precedents two conditions that generally must be satis-fed for agency action to be \"fnal\" under the APA. \"First, the action must mark the consummation of the agency's deci-sionmaking process\u2014it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature. And second, the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will fow.\" Id., at 177-178 (inter- nal quotation marks and citation omitted). 2 The Corps does not dispute that an approved JD satisfes the first Bennett condition. Unlike preliminary JDs\u2014 which are \"advisory in nature\" and simply indicate that \"there may be waters of the United States\" on a parcel of property, 33 CFR \u00a7 331.2\u2014an JD clearly \"mark[s] the consummation\" of the Corps' decisionmaking process on that question, Bennett, 520 U. S., at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is issued after extensive factfnding by the Corps regarding the physical and hydrological character-istics of the property, see U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2 Because we determine that a JD satisfes both prongs of Bennett, we need not consider respondents' argument that an agency action that satis- fes only the frst may also constitute fnal agency action. See Brief for Respondents 19-20. 598 ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS v. HAWKES CO. Opinion of the Court Jurisdictional Determination Form Instructional Guidebook 47-60 (2007), and is typically not revisited if the permitting process moves forward. Indeed, the Corps itself describes approved JDs as \"final agency action,\" see 33 CFR \u00a7 320.1(a)(6), and specifes that an approved JD \"will remain valid for a period of fve years,\" Corps, Regulatory Guidance Letter No. 05-02, \u00a7 1(a), p. 1 (June 14, 2005) (2005 Guidance Letter); see also 33 CFR pt. 331, App. C. The Corps may revise an approved JD within the fve-year period based on \"new information.\" 2005 Guidance Letter \u00a7 1(a), at 1. That possibility, however, is a common charac- teristic of agency action, and does not make an otherwise defnitive decision nonfnal. See Sackett v. EPA, 566 U. S. 120, 127 (2012); see also National Cable & Telecommunica- tions Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 981 (2005). By issuing respondents an approved JD, the Corps for all practical purposes \"has ruled defnitively\" that re-spondents' property contains jurisdictional waters. Sackett, 566 U. S., at 131 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). The defnitive nature of approved JDs also gives rise to \"direct and appreciable legal consequences,\" thereby satisfy-ing the second prong of Bennett. 520 U. S., at 178. Con- sider the effect of an approved JD stating that a party's property does not contain jurisdictional waters\u2014a \"nega- tive\" JD, in Corps parlance. As noted, such a JD will gener-ally bind the Corps for fve years. See 33 CFR pt. 331, App. C; 2005 Guidance Letter \u00a7 1. Under a longstanding memo-randum of agreement between the Corps and EPA, it will also be \"binding on the Government and represent the Gov-ernment's position in any subsequent Federal action or litiga-tion concerning that fnal determination.\" Memorandum of Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 IV-C-2, VI-A. A negative JD thus binds the two agencies authorized to bring civil enforcement proceed-ings under the Clean Water Act, see 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1319, creat-ing a fve-year safe harbor from such proceedings for a prop-erty owner. Additionally, although the property owner may Cite as: 578 U. S. 590 (2016) 599 Opinion of the Court still face a citizen suit under the Act, such a suit\u2014unlike actions brought by the Government\u2014cannot impose civil lia-bility for wholly past violations. See \u00a7\u00a7 1319(d), 1365(a); Gwaltney of Smithfeld, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Founda- tion, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 58-59 (1987). In other words, a neg-ative JD both narrows the feld of potential plaintiffs and limits the potential liability a landowner faces for discharg-ing pollutants without a permit. Each of those effects is a \"legal consequence[ ]\" satisfying the second Bennett prong. 520 U. S., at 178; see also Sackett, 566 U. S., at 126. It follows that affrmative JDs have legal consequences as well: They represent the denial of the safe harbor that nega-tive JDs afford. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 551(13) (defning \"agency action\" to include an agency \"rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent,\" or the \"denial thereof \"). Because \"legal consequences . fow\" from approved JDs, they con-stitute fnal agency action. Bennett, 520 U. S., at 178 (inter- nal quotation marks omitted). 3 This conclusion tracks the \"pragmatic\" approach we have long taken to fnality. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner , 387 U. S. 136, 149 (1967). For example, in Frozen Food Express v. United States, 351 U. S. 40 (1956), we considered the fnal- ity of an order specifying which commodities the Interstate Commerce Commission believed were exempt by statute from regulation, and which it believed were not. Although the order \"had no authority except to give notice of how the Commission interpreted\" the relevant statute, and \"would have effect only if and when a particular action was brought 3 The Corps asserts that the memorandum of agreement addresses only \"special case\" JDs, rather than \"mine-run\" ones \"of the sort at issue here.\" Reply Brief 12, n. 3. But the memorandum plainly makes binding \"[a]ll final determinations,\" whether in \"[s]pecial\" or \"[n]on-special\" cases. Memorandum of Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 IV-C, VI-A; see also Corps, Memorandum of Understanding Geographical Jurisdiction of the Section 404 Program, 45 Fed. Reg. 45019, n. 1 (1980) (\"[U]nder this [memorandum], except in special cases previously agreed to, the [Corps] is authorized to make a fnal determination . . . and such determination shall be binding.\"). 600 ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS v. HAWKES CO. Opinion of the Court against a particular carrier,\" Abbott, 387 U. S., at 150, we held that the order was nonetheless immediately reviewable, Frozen Food, 351 U. S., at 44-45. The order, we explained, \"warns every carrier, who does not have authority from the Commission to transport those commodities, that it does so at the risk of incurring criminal penalties.\" Id., at 44. So too here, while no administrative or criminal proceeding can be brought for failure to conform to the approved JD itself, that fnal agency determination not only deprives respond-ents of a fve-year safe harbor from liability under the Act, but warns that if they discharge pollutants onto their prop-erty without obtaining a permit from the Corps, they do so at the risk of signifcant criminal and civil penalties. B Even if fnal, an agency action is reviewable under the APA only if there are no adequate alternatives to APA re-view in court. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 704. The Corps contends that respondents have two such alternatives: either discharge fll material without a permit, risking an EPA enforcement ac-tion during which they can argue that no permit was re-quired, or apply for a permit and seek judicial review if dis-satisfed with the results. Brief for Petitioner 45-51. Neither alternative is adequate. As we have long held, parties need not await enforcement proceedings before chal-lenging fnal agency action where such proceedings carry the risk of \"serious criminal and civil penalties.\" Abbott, 387 U. S., at 153. If respondents discharged fll material without a permit, in the mistaken belief that their property did not contain jurisdictional waters, they would expose themselves to civil penalties of up to $37,500 for each day they violated the Act, to say nothing of potential criminal liability. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1319(c), (d); Sackett, 566 U. S., at 123, n. 1 (citing 74 Fed. Reg. 626, 627 (2009)). Respondents need not assume such risks while waiting for EPA to \"drop the hammer\" in order to have their day in court. Sackett, 566 U. S., at 127. Cite as: 578 U. S. 590 (2016) 601 Opinion of the Court Nor is it an adequate alternative to APA review for a land- owner to apply for a permit and then seek judicial review in the event of an unfavorable decision. As Corps offcials indicated in their discussions with respondents, the permit-ting process can be arduous, expensive, and long. See Ra- panos, 547 U. S., at 721 (plurality opinion). On top of the standard permit application that respondents were required to submit, see 33 CFR \u00a7 325.1(d) (detailing contents of permit application), the Corps demanded that they undertake, among other things, a \"hydrogeologic assessment of the rich fen system including the mineral/nutrient composition and pH of the groundwater; groundwater fow spatially and ver-tically; discharge and recharge areas\"; a \"functional/resource assessment of the site including a vegetation survey and identifcation of native fen plan communities across the site\"; an \"inventory of similar wetlands in the general area (water-shed), including some analysis of their quality\"; and an \"in-ventory of rich fen plant communities that are within sites of High and Outstanding Biodiversity Signifcance in the area.\" App. 33-34. Respondents estimate that undertaking these analyses alone would cost more than $100,000. Id., at 17. And whatever pertinence all this might have to the issuance of a permit, none of it will alter the fnality of the approved JD, or affect its suitability for judicial review. The permit-ting process adds nothing to the JD. The Corps nevertheless argues that Congress made the \"evident[ ]\" decision in the Clean Water Act that a coverage determination would be made \"as part of the permitting process, and that the property owner would obtain any nec-essary judicial review of that determination at the conclusion of that process.\" Brief for Petitioner 46. But as the Corps acknowledges, the Clean Water Act makes no reference to standalone jurisdictional determinations, ibid., so there is lit- tle basis for inferring anything from it concerning the re-viewability of such distinct fnal agency action. And given \"the APA's presumption of reviewability for all fnal agency 602 ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS v. HAWKES CO. Kennedy, J., concurring action,\" Sackett, 566 U. S., at 129, \"[t]he mere that per- mitting decisions are \"reviewable should not suffce to sup- port an implication of exclusion as to other[ ]\" agency actions, such as approved JDs, Abbott, 387 U. S., at 141 (internal quo- tation marks omitted); see also Sackett, 566 U. S., at 129 (\"[I]f the express provision of judicial review in one section of a long and complicated statute were alone enough to over-come the APA's presumption of reviewability . . . , it would not be much of a presumption at all\"). Finally, the Corps emphasizes that seeking review in an en- forcement action or at the end of the permitting process would be the only available avenues for obtaining review \"[i]f the Corps had never adopted its practice of issuing standalone jurisdictional determinations upon request.\" Reply Brief 3; see also id., at 4, 23. True enough. But such a \"count your blessings\" argument is not an adequate rejoinder to the as-sertion of a right to judicial review under the APA. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Cir- cuit is affrmed. It is so ordered. Justice Kennedy , with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Alito join, concurring. My join extends to the Court's opinion in full. The follow- ing observation seems appropriate not to qualify what the Court says but to point out that, based on the Government's representations in this case, the reach and systemic conse-quences of the Clean Water Act remain a cause for concern. As Justice Alito has noted in an earlier case, the Act's reach is \"notoriously unclear\" and the consequences to land-owners even for inadvertent violations can be crushing. See Sackett v. EPA, 566 U. S. 120, 132 (2012) (concurring opinion). An approved jurisdictional determination (JD) gives a landowner at least some measure of predictability, so long as the agency's declaration can be relied upon. Yet, the Gov-ernment has represented in this litigation that a JD has Cite as: 578 U. S. 590 (2016) 603 Kagan, J., concurring no legally binding effect on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) enforcement decisions. It has stated that the memorandum of agreement between the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, which today's opinion relies on, does not have binding effect and can be revoked or amended at the EPA's unfettered discretion. Reply Brief 12; Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. If that were correct, the Act's ominous reach would again be unchecked by the limited relief the Court allows today. Even if, in an ordinary case, an agency's inter-nal agreement with another agency cannot establish that its action is fnal, the Court is right to construe a JD as binding in light of the fact that in many instances it will have a sig-nifcant bearing on whether the Clean Water Act comports with due process. The Act, especially without the JD procedure were the Government permitted to foreclose it, continues to raise troubling questions regarding the Government's power to cast doubt on the full use and enjoyment of private property throughout the Nation. Justice Kagan, concurring. I join the Court's opinion in full. I write separately to note that for me, unlike for Justice Ginsburg , see post, at 604 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), the memorandum of agreement between the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency is cen-tral to the disposition of this case. For an agency action to be fnal, \"the action must be one by which rights or obliga-tions have been determined, or from which legal conse-quences will fow.\" Bennett v. Spear , 520 U. S. 154, 178 (1997). As the Court states, the memorandum of agreement establishes that jurisdictional determinations (JDs) are \"binding on the Government and represent the Govern-ment's position in any subsequent Federal action or litigation concerning that fnal determination.\" Memorandum of Agreement \u00a7\u00a7 IV-C-2, VI-A; ante , at 598 (majority opinion). 604 ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS v. HAWKES CO. Opinion of Ginsburg, J. A negative JD thus prevents the Corps and EPA\u2014the two agencies with authority to enforce the Clean Water Act\u2014 from bringing a civil action against a property owner for the JD's entire 5-year lifetime. Ante , at 598-599, and n. 3. The creation of that safe harbor, which binds the agencies in any subsequent litigation, is a \"direct and appreciable legal con-sequence[ ]\" satisfying the second prong of Bennett. 520 U. S., at 178. Justice Ginsburg , concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join the Court's opinion, save for its reliance upon the memorandum of agreement between the Army Corps of En-gineers and the Environmental Protection Agency. Ante , at 598-599, and n. 3 (construing the memorandum to establish that Corps jurisdictional determinations (JDs) are binding on the Federal Government in litigation for fve years). The Court received scant briefng about this memorandum, and the United States does not share the Court's reading of it. See Reply Brief 12, n. 3 (memorandum \"does not address mine-run Corps jurisdictional determinations of the sort at issue here\"); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 (same); id., at 9 (reading of the memorandum to establish that JDs have binding effect in litigation does not \"refec[t] current government policy\"). But the JD at issue is \"defnitive,\" not \"informal\" or \"tenta-tive,\" Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner , 387 U. S. 136, 151 (1967), and has \"an immediate and practical impact,\" Frozen Food Express v. United States, 351 U. S. 40, 44 (1956). See also ante , at 599-600.* Accordingly, I agree with the Court that the JD is fnal. *Bennett v. Spear , 520 U. S. 154, 178 (1997), contrary to Justice Ka- gan's suggestion, ante, at 603 and this page (concurring opinion), does not displace or alter the approach to fnality established by Abbott Labora- tories v. Gardner , 387 U. S. 136, 149-151 (1967), and Frozen Food Express v. United States, 351 U. S. 40, 44 (1956). Bennett dealt with fnality quickly, and did not cite those pathmarking decisions. OCTOBER TERM, 2015 605 Syllabus JOHNSON, WARDEN v. LEE on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 15-789. Decided May 31, 2016 Under California's \"Dixon bar,\" a defendant procedurally defaults a claim raised for the frst time on state collateral review if he could have raised it earlier on direct appeal. Respondent Lee was convicted of frst-degree murder. She sought federal habeas review, raising mostly new claims that she had not raised on direct appeal in state court. The District Court stayed the proceedings to allow Lee to pursue the new claims in a state habeas petition. The California Supreme Court denied her petition in a summary order citing Dixon. Lee returned to the District Court, which dismissed her new claims as procedurally de-faulted. Lee then challenged the Dixon bar's adequacy, citing 9 cases out of 210 summary denials on a single day in which the California Su-preme Court failed to cite Dixon where it should have been applied. The Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded to permit the warden to sub-mit contrary evidence. The warden submitted a study analyzing more than 4,700 summary habeas denials showing that the California Su-preme Court cited Dixon in nearly 12% of all denials. Based on this evidence, the District Court found the Dixon bar adequate. The Ninth Circuit again reversed, holding that the Dixon bar was irregularly applied. Held: Because California's Dixon bar is both and regu- larly followed,\" Beard v. Kindler , 558 U. S. 53, 60, it is an \" `adequate' procedural ground\" capable of barring federal habeas review, Walker v. Martin, 562 U. S. 307, 316. It is \"frmly established\" because it was decided decades before Lee's procedural default and reaffrmed in two other cases. And the State Supreme Court's repeated Dixon citations prove that the bar is \"regularly followed.\" Nine purportedly missing Dixon citations in a 1-day sample of summary orders hardly support an inference of inconsistency. California's rule is not unique. Federal and state habeas courts across the country follow the same rule. And noth-ing suggests that California courts apply the rule in a way that disfavors federal claims. The Ninth Circuit's contrary reasoning is unpersuasive and inconsist- ent with this Court's precedents. The bar's simplicity of application does not imply that missing citations refect state-court inconsistency. Since the bar has several exceptions, the State Supreme Court can 606 JOHNSON v. LEE Per Curiam hardly be faulted for failing to cite Dixon whenever a petitioner raises a claim that he could have raised on direct appeal. And California courts need not address procedural default before reaching the merits, so the purportedly missing citations show nothing. The Ninth Circuit's attempt to distinguish Martin and Kindler on the ground that Califor- nia's Dixon bar is \"mandatory\" rather than discretionary also fails. Certiorari granted; 788 F. 3d 1124, reversed and remanded. Per Curiam. Federal habeas courts generally refuse to hear claims \"de- faulted . . . in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule.\" Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750 (1991). State rules count as \"adequate\" if they are \"frmly established and regularly followed.\" Walker v. Martin, 562 U. S. 307, 316 (2011) (internal quota- tion marks omitted). Like all States, California requires criminal defendants to raise available claims on direct ap-peal. Under the so-called \"Dixon bar,\" a defendant proce- durally defaults a claim raised for the frst time on state col-lateral review if he could have raised it earlier on direct appeal. See In re Dixon, 41 Cal. 2d 756, 759, 264 P. 2d 513, 514 (1953). Yet, in this case, the Ninth Circuit held that the Dixon bar is inadequate to bar federal habeas review. Because California's procedural bar is longstanding, oft-cited, and shared by habeas courts across the Nation, this Court now summarily reverses the Ninth Circuit's judgment. I Respondent Donna Kay Lee and her boyfriend Paul Carasi stabbed to death Carasi's mother and his ex-girlfriend. A California jury convicted the pair of two counts each of frst-degree murder. Carasi received a death sentence, and Lee received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. In June 1999, Lee unsuccessfully raised four claims on direct appeal. After the California appellate courts affrmed, Lee skipped state postconviction review and fled the federal ha-beas petition at issue. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(a). The peti-Cite as: 578 U. S. 605 (2016) 607 Per Curiam tion raised mostly new claims that Lee failed to raise on direct appeal. Because Lee had not exhausted available state-court remedies, however, the District Court temporar-ily stayed federal proceedings to allow Lee to pursue her new claims in a state habeas petition. The California Su-preme Court denied Lee's petition in a summary order cit-ing Dixon. Having exhausted state remedies, Lee returned to federal court to litigate her federal habeas petition. The District Court dismissed her new claims as procedurally defaulted. Then, for the frst time on appeal, Lee challenged the Dixon bar's adequacy. In her brief, Lee presented a small sample of the California Supreme Court's state habeas denials on a single day about six months after her default. Lee claimed that out of the 210 summary denials on December 21, 1999, the court failed to cite Dixon in 9 cases where it should have been applied. The court instead denied the nine petitions without any citation at all. In Lee's view, these missing ci-tations proved that the California courts inconsistently ap-plied the Dixon bar. Without evaluating this evidence, the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded \"to permit the Warden to submit evidence to the contrary, and for consideration by the district court in the frst instance.\" Lee v. Jacquez, 406 Fed. Appx. 148, 150 (2010). On remand, the warden submitted a study analyzing more than 4,700 summary habeas denials during a nearly 2-year period around the time of Lee's procedural default. From August 1998 to June 2000, the study showed, the California Supreme Court cited Dixon in approximately 12% of all denials\u2014more than 500 times. In light of this evidence, the District Court held that the Dixon bar is adequate. The Ninth Circuit again reversed. Lee v. Jacquez, 788 F. 3d 1124 (2015). Lee's 1-day sample proved the Dixon bar's inadequacy, the court held, because the \"failure to cite Dixon where Dixon applies . . . [its] irregular at 1130. The general 12% citation rate 608 JOHNSON v. LEE Per Curiam proved nothing, the court reasoned, because the warden \"d[id] not purport to show to how many cases the Dixon bar should have been applied.\" Id., at 1133. In the Ninth Circuit's view, without \"baseline number\" ade- 788 F. 3d, at 1133. II The Ninth Circuit's decision profoundly misapprehends what makes a state procedural bar \"adequate.\" That ques-tion is a matter of federal law. Lee v. Kemna, 534 U. S. 362, 375 (2002). \"To qualify as an `adequate' procedural ground,\" capable of barring federal habeas review, \"a state rule must be `frmly established and regularly followed.' \" Martin, supra, at 316 (quoting Beard v. Kindler , 558 U. S. 53, 60 (2009)). California's Dixon bar satisfes both adequacy criteria. It is \"frmly established\" because, decades before Lee's June 1999 procedural default, the California Supreme Court warned defendants in plain terms that, absent \"special cir-cumstances,\" habeas \"will not lie where the claimed errors could have been, but were not, raised upon a timely appeal from a judgment of conviction.\" Dixon, supra, at 759, 264 P. 2d, at 514. And the California Supreme Court eliminated any arguable ambiguity surrounding this bar by reaffrming Dixon in two cases decided before Lee's default. See In re Harris, 5 Cal. 4th 813, 825, n. 3, 829-841, 855 P. 2d 391, 395, n. 3, 398-407 (1993); In re Robbins, 18 Cal. 4th 770, 814-815, and n. 34, 959 P. 2d 311, 340-341, and n. 34 (1998). The California Supreme Court's repeated Dixon citations also prove that the bar is \"regularly followed.\" Martin re- cently held that another California procedural bar\u2014a rule requiring prisoners to fle state habeas petitions promptly\u2014 met that requirement because \"[e]ach year, the California Supreme Court summarily denies hundreds of habeas peti-tions by citing\" the timeliness rule. 562 U. S., at 318. The same goes for Dixon. Nine purportedly missing Dixon Cite as: 578 U. S. 605 (2016) 609 Per Curiam citations from Lee's 1-day sample of summary orders hardly support an inference of inconsistency. See Dugger v. Adams, 489 U. S. 401, 410, n. 6 (1989) (holding that the Flor-ida Supreme Court applied its similar procedural bar \"con-sistently and regularly\" despite \"address[ing] the merits in several cases raising [new] claims on postconviction review\"). Indeed, all nine orders in that sample were denials. None ignored the Dixon bar to grant relief, so there is no sign of inconsistency. Nor is California's rule unique. Federal and state habeas courts across the country follow the same rule as Dixon. \"The general rule in federal habeas cases is that a defendant who fails to raise a claim on direct appeal is barred from raising the claim on collateral review.\" Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U. S. 331, 350-351 (2006). Likewise, state post-conviction remedies generally \"may not be used to litigate claims which were or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal.\" 1 D. Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook \u00a7 1:2, p. 3 (2015-2016 ed.). It appears that every State shares this procedural bar in some form. See Brief for State of Alabama et al. as Amici Curiae 1, n. 2 (collecting citations). For such well-established and ubiqui-tous rules, it takes more than a few outliers to show inade-quacy. Federal habeas courts must not lightly \"disregard state procedural rules that are substantially similar to those to which we give full force in our own courts.\" Kindler , 558 U. S., at 62. And it would be \"[e]ven stranger to do so with respect to rules in place in nearly every State.\" Ibid. Nothing suggests, moreover, that California courts apply the Dixon bar in a way that disfavors federal claims. The Court therefore holds that it qualifes as adequate to bar fed-eral habeas review. III The Ninth Circuit's contrary reasoning is unpersuasive and inconsistent with this Court's precedents. Applying the Dixon bar may be a \"straightforward\" or \"mechanica[l]\" 610 JOHNSON v. LEE Per Curiam task for state courts. 788 F. 3d, at 1130. But simplicity does not imply that missing citations refect state-court in-consistency. To begin with, since the Dixon bar has several exceptions, see Robbins, supra, at 814-815, and n. 34, 959 P. 2d, at 340-341, and n. 34, the California Supreme Court can hardly be faulted for failing to cite Dixon whenever a petitioner raises a claim that he could have raised on direct appeal. More importantly, California courts need not address pro- cedural default before reaching the merits, so the purport-edly missing citations show nothing. Cf. Bell v. Cone , 543 U. S. 447, 451, n. 3 (2005) (per ) gletary (explaining that \"[j]udicial economy might counsel\" bypassing a procedural-default question if the merits \"were easily the habeas petitioner\"). Ordinarily, \"procedural . . is not a jurisdictional matter.\" Trest v. Cain, 522 U. S. 87, 89 (1997). As a result, the appropriate order of analysis for each case remains within the state courts' discretion. Such discretion will often lead to \"seeming inconsistencies.\" Martin, 562 U. S., at 320, and n. 7. But that superfcial ten-sion does not make a procedural bar inadequate. \"[A] state procedural bar may count as an adequate and independent ground for denying a federal habeas petition even if the state court had discretion to reach the merits despite the default.\" Id., at 311; see Kindler , supra, at 60-61. The Ninth Circuit's attempt to get around Martin and Kindler fails. The Court of Appeals distinguished those cases on the ground that California's Dixon bar is \"man- datory\" rather than discretionary because it involves a discretion-free general rule, notwithstanding exceptions that might involve discretion. 788 F. 3d, at 1130. The Court as-sumes, without deciding, that this description is accurate and the Dixon bar's exceptions leave some room for discretion. Even so, there is little difference between discretion exer-Cite as: 578 U. S. 605 (2016) 611 Per Curiam cised through an otherwise adequate procedural bar's excep- tions and discretion that is a part of the bar itself. In any event, the Ninth Circuit's reasoning ignores the state courts' discretion to assume, without deciding, that a claim is not procedurally defaulted and instead hold that the claim lacks merit. The Ninth Circuit was accordingly wrong to dismiss the 500-plus summary denials citing Dixon simply because they do not reveal which cases potentially implicate the bar. 788 F. 3d, at 1133. Martin already rejected this precise reason- ing. There, the habeas petitioner unsuccessfully argued that \"[u]se of summary denials makes it impossible to tell why the California Supreme Court decides some delayed pe-titions on the merits and rejects others as untimely.\" 562 U. S., at 319 (internal quotation marks omitted). So too here, \"[w]e see no reason to reject California's [procedural] bar simply because a court may opt to bypass the [Dixon ] assessment and summarily dismiss a petition on the merits, if that is the easier path.\" Ibid. By treating every missing citation as a sign of incon- sistency, the Court of Appeals \"pose[d] an unnecessary dilemma\" for California. Kindler , 558 U. S., at 61. The court forced the State to choose between the \"fnality of [its] judgments\" and a burdensome opinion-writing require-ment. Ibid.; see Martin, supra, at 312-313 (noting that the California Supreme Court \"rules on a staggering number of habeas petitions each year\"); Harrington v. Richter , 562 U. S. 86, 99 (2011) (discussing the advantages of summary dispositions). \"[F]ederal courts have no authority,\" how-ever, \"to impose mandatory opinion-writing standards on state courts\" as the price of federal respect for their proce-dural rules. Johnson v. Williams, 568 U. S. 289, 300 (2013). The Ninth Circuit's decision is thus fundamentally at odds with the \"federalism and comity concerns that motivate the adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas context.\" Kindler , supra, at 62. 612 JOHNSON v. LEE Per Curiam * * * \"A State's procedural rules are of vital importance to the orderly administration of its criminal courts; when a federal court permits them to be readily evaded, it undermines the criminal justice system.\" Lambrix, supra, at 525. Here, the Ninth Circuit permitted California prisoners to evade a well-established procedural bar that is adequate to bar fed-eral habeas review. The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for fur-ther proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. OCTOBER TERM, 2015 613 Per Curiam L YNCH v. ARIZONA on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of arizona No. 15-8366. Decided May 31, 2016 Petitioner Lynch was convicted of frst-degree murder and other crimes. In seeking the death penalty, Arizona moved to prevent Lynch from informing the jury that the only alternative sentence to death was life without the possibility of parole. The court granted the motion, and Lynch was eventually sentenced to death. On appeal, Lynch argued that the trial court had violated Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154, in which this Court held that where a capital defendant's future dangerousness is at issue and state law prohibits his release on parole, due process entitles him to inform the sentencing jury that he is parole ineligible. The Arizona Supreme Court found that the State had put Lynch's future dangerousness at issue during the penalty phase and had acknowledged that Lynch's only alternative sentence was life imprison-ment without parole. Nonetheless, the court affrmed, holding that the failure to give the Simmons instruction was not error. Held: Lynch was entitled to inform the jury that he was parole ineligible. The Arizona Supreme Court's contrary conclusion conficts with Sim- mons and its progeny. Under Arizona law, the only kind of release for which Lynch would have been eligible is executive clemency, and Sim- mons expressly rejected the argument that the possibility of clemency diminishes a capital defendant's right to inform a jury of his parole ineli-gibility. See 512 U. S., at 166. Simmons also forecloses the argument that the potential for the state legislature to create a parole system in the future, thus rendering Lynch parole eligible, justifes refusing a pa-role-ineligibility instruction. Ibid. Certiorari granted; 238 Ariz. 84, 357 P. 3d 119, reversed and remanded. Per Curiam. Under Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994), and its progeny, \"where a capital defendant's future danger- ousness is at issue, and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without pos-sibility of parole,\" the Due Process Clause \"entitles the de-fendant `to inform the jury of [his] parole ineligibility, either 614 LYNCH v. ARIZONA Per Curiam by a jury instruction or in arguments by counsel.' \" Shafer v. South Carolina, 532 U. S. 36, 39 (2001) (quoting Ramdass v. Angelone , 530 U. S. 156, 165 (2000) (plurality opinion)). In the decision below, the Arizona Supreme Court found that the State had put petitioner Shawn Patrick Lynch's future dangerousness at issue during his capital sentencing pro-ceeding and acknowledged that Lynch's only alternative sentence to death was life imprisonment without parole. 238 Ariz. 84, 103, 357 P. 3d 119, 138 (2015). But the court nonetheless concluded that Lynch had no right to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility. Ibid. The judgment is reversed. A jury convicted Lynch of frst-degree murder, kidnaping, armed robbery, and burglary for the 2001 killing of James Panzarella. The State sought the death penalty. Before Lynch's penalty phase trial began, Arizona moved to prevent his counsel from informing the jury that the only alternative sentence to death was life without the possibility of parole. App. K to Pet. for Cert. The court granted the motion. Lynch's frst penalty phase jury failed to reach a unani- mous verdict. A second jury was convened and sentenced Lynch to death. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court va-cated the sentence because the jury instructions improperly described Arizona law. The court did not address Lynch's alternative argument that the trial court had violated Sim- mons. On remand, a third penalty phase jury sentenced Lynch to death. The Arizona Supreme Court affrmed, this time consider- ing and re jecting Lynch's Simmons claim. The court agreed that, during the third penalty phase, \"[t]he State sug- gested . . . that Lynch could be dangerous.\" 238 Ariz., at 103, 357 P. 3d, at 138. The court also recognized that Lynch was parole ineligible: Under Arizona law, \"parole is available only to individuals who committed a felony before January 1, 1994,\" and Lynch committed his crimes in 2001. Ibid. (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41-1604.09(I) (1999)). Nevertheless, Cite as: 578 U. S. 613 (2016) 615 Per Curiam while \"[a]n instruction that parole is not currently available would be correct,\" the court held that \"the failure to give the Simmons instruction was not error.\" 238 Ariz., at 103, 357 P. 3d, at 138. That conclusion conficts with this Court's precedents. In Simmons, as here, a capital defendant was ineligible for parole under state law. 512 U. S., at 156 (plurality opinion). During the penalty phase, the State argued that the jurors should consider the defendant's future danger-ousness when determining the proper punishment. Id., at 157. But the trial court refused to permit defense counsel to tell the jury that the only alternative sentence to death was life without parole. Id., at 157, 160. The Court re- versed, reasoning that due process entitled the defendant to rebut the prosecution's argument that he posed a future danger by informing his sentencing jury that he is parole ineligible. Id., at 161-162; id., at 178 (O'Connor, J., concur- ring in judgment). The Court's opinions reiterated that holding in Ramdass, Shafer , and Kelly v. South Carolina, 534 U. S. 246 (2002). The Arizona Supreme Court thought Arizona's sentencing law suffciently different from the others this Court had con-sidered that Simmons did not apply. It relied on the fact that, under state law, Lynch could have received a life sen-tence that would have made him eligible for \"release\" after 25 years. 238 Ariz., at 103-104, 357 P. 3d, at 138-139; \u00a7 13- 751(A). But under state law, the only kind of release for which Lynch would have been eligible\u2014as the State does not contest\u2014is executive clemency. See Pet. for Cert. 22; 238 Ariz., at 103-104, 357 P. 3d, at 138-139. And Simmons ex- pressly rejected the argument that the possibility of clem-ency diminishes a capital defendant's right to inform a jury of his parole ineligibility. There, South Carolina had argued that the defendant need not be allowed to present this infor-mation to the jury \"because future exigencies,\" including \"commutation [and] clemency,\" could one day \"allow [him] to 616 LYNCH v. ARIZONA Per Curiam be released into society.\" 512 U. S., at 166 (plurality opin- ion). The Court disagreed: \"To the extent that the State opposes even a simple parole-ineligibility instruction because of hypothetical future developments, the argument has little force.\" Ibid.; id., at 177 (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (explaining that the defendant had a right \"to bring his parole ineligibil-ity to the jury's attention\" and that the State could respond with \"truthful information regarding the availability of com-mutation, pardon, and the like\"). The State responds that Simmons \" `applies only to in- stances where, as a legal matter, there is no possibility of parole.' \" Brief in Opposition 11 (quoting Ramdass, supra, at 169 (plurality opinion)). Notwithstanding the fact that Arizona law currently prevents all felons who committed their offenses after 1993 from obtaining parole, 238 Ariz., at 103, 357 P. 3d, at 138, Arizona reasons that \"nothing prevents the legislature from creating a parole system in the future for which [Lynch] would have been eligible had the court sentenced him to life with the possibility of release after 25 years.\" Brief in Opposition 12. This Court's precedents also foreclose that argument. Simmons said that the potential for future \"legislative re- form\" could not justify refusing a parole-ineligibility instruc-tion. 512 U. S., at 166 (plurality opinion). If it were other-wise, a State could always argue that its legislature might pass a law rendering the defendant parole eligible. Accord-ingly, as this Court later explained, \"the dispositive fact in Simmons was that the defendant conclusively established his parole ineligibility under state law at the time of his trial.\" Ramdass, 530 U. S., at 171 (plurality opinion). In this case, the Arizona Supreme Court confrmed that parole was unavailable to Lynch under its law. Simmons and its progeny establish Lynch's right to inform his jury of that fact. The petition for writ of certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment Cite as: 578 U. S. 613 (2016) 617 Thomas, J., dissenting of the Arizona Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Thomas , with whom Justice Alito joins, dissenting. Petitioner Shawn Patrick Lynch and his co-conspirator, Michael Sehwani, met their victim, James Panzarella, at a Scottsdale bar on March 24, 2001. The three went back to Panzarella's house early the next morning. Around 5 a.m., Sehwani called an escort service. The escort and her body-guard arrived soon after. Sehwani paid her $300 with two checks from Panzarella's checkbook after spending an hour with her in the bedroom. Lynch and Sehwani then left the house with Panzarella's credit and debit cards and embarked on a spending spree. The afternoon of March 25, someone found Panzarella's body bound to a metal chair in his kitchen. His throat was slit. Blood surrounded him on the tile foor. The house was in disarray. Police discovered a hunting knife in the bed-room. A knife was also missing from the kitchen's knife-block. And there were some receipts from Lynch and Seh-wani's spending spree. Police found Lynch and Sehwani at a motel two days after the killing. They had spent the days with Panzarel-la's credit and debit cards buying cigarettes, matches, gas, clothing, and Everlast shoes, renting movies at one of the motels where they spent an afternoon, and making cash withdrawals. When police found the pair, Sehwani wore the Everlast shoes, and Lynch's shoes were stained with Panzarella's blood. A sweater, also stained with his blood, was in the back seat of their truck, as were Panzarella's car keys. A jury convicted Lynch of frst-degree murder, kidnaping, armed robbery, and burglary, and ultimately sentenced him 618 LYNCH v. ARIZONA Thomas, J., dissenting to death.* But today, the Court decides that sentence is no good because the state trial court prohibited the parties from telling the jury that Arizona had abolished parole. Ante, at 613-614; see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41-1604.09(I) (1999). The Court holds that this limitation on Lynch's sentencing proceeding violated Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U. S. 154 (1994). Under Simmons, \"[w]here the State puts the defendant's future dangerousness in issue, and the only avail-able alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment with-out possibility of parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the capital sentencing jury\u2014by either argument or instruction\u2014that he is parole ineligible.\" Id., at 178 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Today's summary reversal perpetuates the Court's error in Simmons. See Kelly v. South Carolina, 534 U. S. 246, 262 (2002) (Thomas, J., dissenting); Shafer v. South Caro- lina, 532 U. S. 36, 58 (2001) (Thomas, J., dissenting). As in Simmons, it is the \"sheer depravity of [the defendant's] crimes, rather than any specifc fear for the future, which induced the . . . jury to conclude that the death penalty was justice.\" 512 U. S., at 181 (Scalia, J., dissenting). In Sim- mons, for example, the defendant beat and raped three elderly women\u2014one of them his own grandmother\u2014before brutally killing a fourth. See ibid. The notion that a jury's decision to impose a death sentence \"would have been altered by information on the current state of the law con- cerning parole (which could of course be amended) is . . . farfetched,\" to say the least. Id., at 184. Worse, today's decision imposes a magic-words require- ment. Unlike Simmons, in which there was \"no instruction at all\" about the meaning of life imprisonment except that the term should be construed according to its \" `[plain] and ordinary meaning,' \" id., at 160, 166 (plurality opinion), here *Sehwani ultimately pleaded guilty to frst-degree murder and theft and received a sentence of natural life without the possibility of early release plus one year. See 225 Ariz. 27, 33, n. 4, 234 P. 3d 595, 601, n. 4 (2010). Cite as: 578 U. S. 613 (2016) 619 Thomas, J., dissenting there was an instruction about the nature of the alternative life sentences that the trial court could impose: \"If your verdict is that the Defendant should be sen-tenced to death, he will be sentenced to death. If your verdict is that the Defendant should be sentenced to life, he will not be sentenced to death, and the court will sentence him to either life without the possibility of re-lease until at least 25 calendar years in prison are served, or `natural life,' which means the Defendant would never be released from prison.\" App. S to Pet. for Cert. 18. That instruction parallels the Arizona statute governing Lynch's sentencing proceedings. That statute prescribed that defendants not sentenced to death could receive either a life sentence with the possibility of early release or a \"natural life\" sentence: \"If the court does not sentence the defendant to natural life, the defendant shall not be released on any basis until the completion of the service of twenty-fve calendar years,\" but a defendant sentenced to \"natural life\" will \"not be released on any basis for the remainder of the defendant's natural life.\" Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-703(A) (2001). Even though the trial court's instruction was a correct rec- itation of Arizona law, the Court holds that Simmons re- quires more. The Court laments that (at least for now) Ari-zona's only form of early release in Arizona is executive clemency. Ante, at 615. So the Court demands that the Arizona instruction specify that \"the possibility of release\" does not (at least for now) include parole. Due process, the Court holds, requires the court to tell the jury that if a de- fendant sentenced to life with the possibility of early release in 25 years were to seek early release today , he would be ineligible for parole under Arizona law. Ante, at 616. Non- sense. The Due Process Clause does not compel such \"mi-cromanage[ment of] state sentencing proceedings.\" Shafer , supra, at 58 (Thomas, J., dissenting). 620 LYNCH v. ARIZONA Thomas, J., dissenting Today's decision\u2014issued without full briefng and argu- ment and based on Simmons, a fractured decision of this Court that did not produce a majority opinion\u2014is a remark- ably aggressive use of our power to review the States' high-est courts. The trial court accurately told the jury that Lynch could receive a life sentence with or without the possi-bility of early release, and that should suffce. I respectfully dissent. OCTOBER TERM, 2015 621 Syllabus SIMMONS et al. v. HIMMELREICH certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit No. 15-109. Argued March 22, 2016\u2014Decided June 6, 2016 This case began with two suits fled by respondent Walter Himmelreich, a federal prisoner. He frst fled suit against the United States, alleging that a severe beating he received from a fellow inmate was the result of negligence by prison offcials. The Government treated the suit as a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which allows plaintiffs to seek damages from the United States for certain torts committed by federal employees, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1346(b), \"[s]ubject to the provisions of chapter 171\" of Title 28. But an \"Exceptions\" section of the FTCA dictates that \"[t]he provisions of [Chapter 171] and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply\" to certain categories of claims. The Govern-ment moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the claim fell into the exception for \"[a]ny claim based upon . function,\" namely, deciding where to house inmates, \u00a7 2680(a). While the motion was pending, Himmelreich fled a second suit: a constitutional tort suit against individual Bureau of Prison employees, again alleging that his beating was the result of prison off-cials' negligence. Ordinarily, the FTCA would have no bearing on that claim. But after the dismissal of Himmelreich's frst suit, the individual employee defendants argued that Himmelreich's second suit was fore-closed by the FTCA's judgment bar provision, according to which a judgment in an FTCA suit forecloses any future suit against individual employees. Agreeing, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the individual prison employees. The Sixth Circuit re-versed, however, holding that the judgment bar provision did not apply to Himmelreich's suit. Held: The judgment bar provision does not apply to the claims dismissed for falling within the \"Exceptions\" section of the FTCA. Pp. 625-631. (a) The FTCA explicitly excepts from its coverage certain categories of claims, including the one into which Himmelreich's frst suit fell. If, as the Government maintains, Chapter 171's judgment bar provision applies to claims in that \"Exceptions\" category, it applied to Himmel-reich's frst suit and would preclude any future actions, including his second suit. On Himmelreich's reading, however, the provision does not apply and he may proceed with his second suit. Pp. 625-627. (b) Himmelreich is correct. The . . 622 Syllabus [a]ny claim 2680(a). The judgment bar is a provision of Chapter 171. The \"Exceptions\" section's plain text thus dictates that the judgment bar does \"not apply\" to cases that, like Himmelreich's frst suit, are based on the performance of a discretionary function. Because the judgment bar provision does not apply to Himmelreich's frst suit, his second suit\u2014against individual prison employees\u2014should be permit-ted to go forward. Nothing about the \"Exceptions\" section or the judg-ment bar provision gives this Court any reason to disregard the plain text of the statute. P. 627. (c) United States v. Smith, 499 U. S. 160, does not require a different result. There, the Court found that the exclusive remedies provision of Chapter 171\u2014which prevents a plaintiff from suing an employee where the FTCA would allow him to sue the United States instead, see \u00a7 2679(b)(1)\u2014applied to a claim for injuries sustained at a hospital in Italy, even though that claim fell within the category of \"[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\" one of the \"Exceptions\" to which \"[t]he 171] shall not \u00a7 2680(k). Smith's out- come, the Government argues, forecloses a literal reading of the \"Excep-tions\" provision, but Smith does not control here. First, Smith does not even mention the \"Exceptions\" section's \"shall not apply\" language. Second, the exclusive remedies provision at issue there was enacted as part of the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, which also contained a mechanism to convert tort suits against Government employees into FTCA suits \"subject to the limita- tions and exceptions applicable to those actions.\" 499 U. S., at 166 (quoting \u00a7 2679(d)(4); emphasis in Smith ). By taking note of those \"lim- itations and exceptions,\" the Smith Court reasoned, the Liability Re- form Act was intended to apply to the \"Exceptions\" categories of claims. Nothing in the text of the judgment bar provision compels the same result here. Pp. 627-629. (d) The Government's remaining counterargument is a parade of hor- ribles that it believes will come to pass if every provision of Chapter 171 \"shall not apply\" to the \"Exceptions\" categories of claims, but it raises few concerns about the judgment bar provision itself. If the Government is right about Chapter 171's other provisions, the Court may hold so in the appropriate case, see Smith, 499 U. S., at 175, but the reading adopted here yields utterly sensible results. Had the Dis-trict Court in this case issued a judgment dismissing Himmelreich's frst suit because, e. g., the prison employees were not negligent, it would make sense that the judgment bar provision would prevent a second suit against the employees. But where an FTCA claim is dismissed because it falls within one of the \"Exceptions,\" the dismissal signals merely that the United States cannot be held liable for a particular Cite as: 578 U. S. 621 (2016) 623 Opinion of the Court claim; it has no logical bearing on whether an employee can be liable instead. Pp. 629-631. 766 F. 3d 576, affrmed and remanded. Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. Roman Martinez argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Verrilli, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mizer , Deputy Solicitor General Gershengorn, Mark B. Stern, Edward Himmelfarb, and Imran R. Zaidi. Christian G. Vergonis argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was David T. Raimer .* Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows plaintiffs to seek damages from the United States for certain torts com-mitted by federal employees. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2674. Many of the FTCA's procedural provisions are contained in a single chapter of the United States Code, Chapter 171. See \u00a7\u00a7 2671-2680. But an \"Exceptions\" section of the FTCA \"[t]he provisions of [Chapter 171] shall not apply\" to certain categories of claims. At issue in this case is whether one of the \"provisions of [Chapter 171]\"\u2014the so-called judgment bar provision, \u00a7 2676\u2014might nonetheless apply to one of the excepted claims. We conclude it does not. I A This case began with two suits fled by Walter Himmelreich. In each, Himmelreich alleged that he had been severely beaten by a fellow inmate in federal prison and that the beating was the result of prison offcials' negligence. At the time of the beating, Himmelreich was incarcerated for producing child pornography. His assailant had warned prison offcials that *Briefs of amici curiae urging affrmance were fled for Public Citizen, Inc., et al. by Allison M. Zieve, Scott L. Nelson, and Steven R. Shapiro; and for Gregory Sisk et al. by Mr. Sisk, pro se . 624 SIMMONS v. HIMMELREICH Opinion of the Court he would \" `smash' \" a pedophile if given the opportunity but was nonetheless released into the general prison population, where he assaulted Himmelreich. App. 46. Himmelreich fled a frst suit against the United States. The Government treated this frst suit as a claim under the FTCA and moved to dismiss the action, arguing that the claim fell into one of the \"Exceptions\" to the FTCA for \"[a]ny claim based upon . . . [of] a discretionary function,\" namely, deciding where to house inmates. \u00a7 2680(a). The District Court granted the Gov-ernment's motion to dismiss. (Neither party here chal-lenges the outcome of that frst suit.) But before the District Court dismissed that frst suit, Himmelreich fled a second suit, this one a constitutional tort suit against individual Bureau of Prison employees rather than against the United States. Ordinarily, the FTCA would have nothing to say about such claims. But after the dismissal of Himmelreich's frst suit, the individual employee defendants argued that Himmelreich's second suit was fore-closed by the FTCA's judgment bar provision, according to which a judgment in an FTCA suit forecloses any future suit against individual employees. See \u00a7 2676. As relevant here, the District Court agreed and granted summary judg-ment in favor of the individual prison employees. Himmelreich appealed that ruling. The Sixth Circuit re- versed, holding that the judgment bar provision did not apply to Himmelreich's suit. Himmelreich v. Federal Bu- reau of Prisons, 766 F. 3d 576 (2014) (per curiam ). We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit split on whether the judgment bar provision applies to suits that, like Himmel- reich's, are dismissed as falling within an \"Exceptio[n]\" to the FTCA. 1 577 U. S. 971 (2015). 1 See Hallock v. Bonner , 387 F. 3d 147 (CA2 2004), vacated on other grounds sub nom. Will v. Hallock, 546 U. S. 345 (2006); Pesnell v. Arse- nault, F. 3d 1038 (CA9 Williams v. Fleming , 597 F. 3d 820, 823- 824 (CA7 2010). Cite as: 578 U. S. 621 (2016) 625 Opinion of the Court B The FTCA's provisions are contained in two areas of the United States Code. One, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1346(b), gives federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over tort claims against the United States for the acts of its employees \"[s]ubject to the provisions of chapter 171\" of Title 28. 2 Chapter 171, in turn, is labeled \"Tort Claims Procedure\" and comprises the remaining provisions of the FTCA. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-2680. Chapter 171 contains an array of provisions. Some provi- sions govern how FTCA claims are to be adjudicated. See, e. g., \u00a7 2674 (specifying out-side the FTCA. See, e. g., \u00a7 2679(a) (cannot sue agency for claims within scope of FTCA); \u00a7 2679(d)(1) (suit against federal employee acting within scope of employment auto-matically converted to FTCA action). The District Court in this case relied on one such remedies-limiting provision of Chapter 171, the judgment bar provision. 3 See \u00a7 2676. Under the judgment bar provi- sion, once a plaintiff receives a judgment (favorable or not) in an FTCA suit, he generally cannot proceed with a suit against an individual employee based on the same underlying facts. The District Court below held that Himmelreich had received a judgment in the frst suit (the FTCA suit against 2 The precise claims at issue are \"claims against the United States, for money damages, accruing on and after January 1, 1945, for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrong-ful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his offce or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in ac-cordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1346(b). 3 It reads in full: \"The judgment in an action under section 1346(b) of this title shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the employee of the govern-ment whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.\" \u00a7 2676. 626 SIMMONS v. HIMMELREICH Opinion of the Court the United States) and so could not proceed with the second suit (the individual employee suit based on the same underly-ing facts). The FTCA explicitly excepts from its coverage certain cat- egories of claims, including the one into which Himmelreich's frst suit fell: \"Exceptions \"The provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014 \"(a) Any claim based upon . . . the exercise or perform- ance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty . . . whether or not the discretion \"The provisions of this chapter\" referenced in the frst line are the provisions of Chapter 171. \"[S]ection 1346(b) of this title\" is the provision giving district courts FTCA jurisdic-tion. And the \"Exceptions\" to which those portions of the FTCA \"shall not apply\" are 13 categories of claims, such as any claim that\u2014like Himmelreich's frst suit\u2014arises \u00a7 2680(k); and \"[a]ny claim arising from the activities of the Tennessee Val-ley Authority,\" \u00a7 2680( l). Both parties agree that district courts do not have juris- diction over claims that fall into one of the 13 categories of \"Exceptions\" because \"section 1346(b) of this title\"\u2014the provision conferring jurisdiction on district courts\u2014does \"not apply\" to such claims. Both parties also agree that at least one of \"[t]he provisions of [Chapter to claims in the \"Exceptions\" categories because no court will have jurisdiction to hold the United States liable on such claims in any event. The parties disagree, however, about whether the judg- ment bar provision of Chapter 171 \"shall not apply\" to claims Cite as: 578 U. S. 621 (2016) 627 Opinion of the Court in one of the \"Exceptions\" categories. The Government maintains that the judgment bar provision does apply to such claims. In that case, it applied to Himmelreich's frst suit and would preclude any future actions, including his second suit. Himmelreich urges that it does not apply. On that reading, there is no reason he cannot proceed with his sec-ond suit. II Himmelreich is correct. The \"Exceptions\" section of the FTCA reads: \"The provisions discretionary function or duty.\" \u00a7 The judgment bar is a provision of Chap-ter 171; the plain text of the \"Exceptions\" section therefore dictates that it does \"not apply\" to cases that, like Himmel-reich's frst suit, are based on the performance of a discre-tionary function. Because the judgment bar provision does not apply to Himmelreich's frst suit, Himmelreich's second suit\u2014the one against individual prison employees\u2014should be permitted to go forward. Absent persuasive indications to the contrary, we presume Congress says what it means and means what it says. Noth-ing about the \"Exceptions\" section or the judgment bar pro-vision gives us any reason to doubt the plain-text result in this case. III A Given the clarity of the \"Exceptions\" section's command, a reader might be forgiven for wondering how there could be any confusion about the statute's operation. The main source of uncertainty on this score, the Government submits, is United States v. Smith, 499 U. S. 160 (1991). In Smith, we considered another provision of Chapter 171, the exclusive remedies provision. Id., at 162. Under the exclusive reme- dies provision, a plaintiff generally cannot sue an employee 628 SIMMONS v. HIMMELREICH Opinion of the Court where the FTCA would allow him to sue the United States instead. See \u00a7 2679(b)(1).4 The Smith Court held that this exclusive remedies provi- sion applied to a claim for injuries sustained at an Army hospital in Italy, even though that claim fell within the cate-gory of \"[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\" one of the \"Exceptions\" to which \"[t]he provisions of [Chapter 171] shall not apply.\" \u00a7 2680(k). The Government argues that our lit-eral reading of the \"Exceptions\" provision would foreclose Smith's outcome because the Smith Court applied a provi- sion of Chapter 171 (the exclusive remedies provision) to a claim falling within one of the \"Exceptions\" categories (a claim arising in a foreign country). Smith, the Government argues, thus establishes that we cannot read the command of the \"Exceptions\" section literally and that the judgment bar provision therefore should apply to Himmelreich's dis-cretionary function claim. The Government's position has some force. Nonetheless, Smith does not control this case. First, Smith does not even cite, let alone discuss, the \"shall not apply\" language \"Excep-tions\" provision. Second, the exclusive remedies provision at issue in Smith was enacted as part of the Federal Employ- ees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, which contained a mechanism to reduce the number of tort suits against Government employees. As the Smith Court explained, if \"the Attorney General . . . certif[ies] that a Gov-ernment employee named as defendant was acting within the scope of his employment when he committed the alleged tort,\" the Liability Reform Act dictates that the United States be substituted as the sole defendant, and that the ac-tion \" `shall proceed in the same manner' \" as an FTCA action \" `and shall be subject to the limitations and exceptions 4 There is an exception to this provision for suits alleging constitutional violations. See \u00a7 2679(b)(2)(A). Himmelreich's second suit\u2014the one against individual prison employees\u2014alleged a violation of the Constitu-tion and so was not foreclosed by the exclusive remedies provision. Cite as: 578 U. S. 621 (2016) 629 Opinion of the Court applicable to those actions.' \" 499 U. S., at 166 (quoting \u00a7 2679(d)(4); emphasis in Smith ). The Smith Court held that the Liability Reform Act's reference to \"limitations and ex-ceptions\" was most naturally read to refer to the \"Excep-tions\" section of the FTCA. And by taking note of the \"Ex-ceptions\" section, the Smith court reasoned, the Liability Reform Act was intended to apply to those \"Exceptions.\" In light of the unique language of the Liability Reform Act, Smith is distinguishable from this case. Nothing in the text of the judgment bar provision compels the same result. B The Government's remaining counterargument amounts to a parade of horribles that it believes will come to pass if every provision of Chapter 171 \"shall not apply\" to the \"Ex- ceptions\" categories of claims. See Brief for Petitioners 52. If the Government is right about the other provisions of Chapter 171, the Court may hold so in the appropriate case. See Smith, 499 U. S., at 175. But this case deals only with the judgment bar provision, and, aside from a passing con-cern about duplicative litigation, the Government does not argue that any such cavalcade would follow if that provision does not apply to the excepted claims. It is enough for our purposes that the statute's clear directive would not lead to hard-to-explain results when applied to the judgment bar provision in particular. To the contrary, our holding that the judgment bar provi- sion \"shall not apply\" to the categories of claims in the \"Ex-ceptions\" section in fact allows the statute to operate in an utterly sensible manner. Ordinarily, the judgment bar pro-vision prevents unnecessarily duplicative litigation. If the District Court in this case had issued a judgment dismissing Himmelreich's frst suit because the prison employees were not negligent, because Himmelreich was not harmed, or be-cause Himmelreich simply failed to prove his claim, it would make little sense to give Himmelreich a second bite at the 630 SIMMONS v. HIMMELREICH Opinion of the Court money-damages apple by allowing suit against the employ- ees: Himmelreich's frst suit would have given him a fair chance to recover damages for his beating. Where an FTCA claim is dismissed because it falls within one of the \"Exceptions,\" by contrast, the judgment bar pro- vision makes much less sense. The dismissal of a claim in the \"Exceptions\" section signals merely that the United States cannot be held liable for a particular claim; it has no logical bearing on whether an employee can be held liable instead. 5 To apply the judgment bar so as to foreclose a future suit against an employee thus would be passing strange. The Government's reading would yield another strange re- sult. According to the Government, the viability of a plain- 5 This conclusion is buttressed by analogy to the common-law doctrine of claim preclusion, which prevents duplicative litigation by barring one party from again suing the other over the same underlying facts. This Court has said that the judgment bar provision \"functions in much the same way\" as that doctrine. Will, 546 U. S., at 354. (The judgment bar provision supplements common-law claim preclusion by closing a narrow gap: At the time that the FTCA was passed, common-law claim preclusion would have barred a plaintiff from suing the United States after having sued an employee but not vice versa. See Restatement of Judgments \u00a7\u00a7 99, 96(1)(a), Comments b and d (1942). The judgment bar provision applies where a plaintiff frst sues the United States and then sues an employee.) But claim preclusion principles would not foreclose a second suit where the frst suit was dismissed under the \"Exceptions\" section. Dismissals for \"personal immunity\"\u2014defenses that can be asserted by one party but not others\u2014do not have claim-preclusive effect. See Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 96, Comment g; Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 51(1)(b), and Comment c (1980). The \"Exceptions\" section refects the United States' decision not to accept liability for certain types of claims; like other \"personal immunities,\" the \"Exceptions\" section is only de-fense for\u2014and can only be \"taken advantage of\" by\u2014the United States. See Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 96, Comment g. A dismissal under the \"Exceptions\" section would not be entitled to claim-preclusive effect; just so, the roughly analogous judgment bar should not foreclose a second suit against individual employees. Cite as: 578 U. S. 621 (2016) 631 Opinion of the Court tiff's meritorious suit against an individual employee should turn on the order in which the suits are fled (or the order in which the district court chooses to address motions). For example, had the District Court in this case addressed the individual employee suit frst, there would be no FTCA judg-ment in the picture, and so the judgment bar provision would not affect the outcome of the suit. The Government's read-ing would thus encourage litigants to fle suit against individ-ual employees before suing the United States to avoid being foreclosed from recovery altogether. Yet this result is at odds with one of the FTCA's purposes, channeling liability away from individual employees and toward the United States. See Dalehite v. United States, 346 U. S. 15, 25 (1953). We decline to ignore the text of the statute to achieve these imprudently restrictive results. Accordingly, we read \"[t]he provisions of this chapter . . . shall not apply\" as it was written. The judgment bar provision\u2014one of the \"provi-sions of this chapter\"\u2014does not apply to the categories of claims in the \"Exceptions\" sections of the FTCA. We there-fore affrm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. 632 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 Syllabus ROSS v.

Argued March 29, 2016\u2014Decided June 6, 2016 Two guards\u2014James Madigan and petitioner Michael Ross\u2014undertook to move respondent Shaidon Blake, a Maryland inmate, to the prison's seg- regation unit. During the transfer, Madigan assaulted Blake, punching him several times in the face. Blake reported the incident to a correc-tions offcer, who referred the matter to the Maryland prison system's Internal Investigative Unit (IIU). The IIU, which has authority under state law to investigate employee misconduct, issued a report condemn-ing Madigan's actions. Blake subsequently sued both guards under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, alleging excessive force and failure to take protective action. A jury found Madigan liable. But Ross raised (as an affrma-tive defense) the exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Re-form Act of 1995 (PLRA), which demands that an inmate exhaust \"such administrative remedies as are available\" before bringing suit to chal-lenge prison conditions. \u00a7 1997e(a). Ross argued that Blake had fled suit without frst following the prison's prescribed procedures for ob-taining an administrative remedy, while Blake argued that the IIU in-vestigation was a substitute for those procedures. The District Court sided with Ross and dismissed the suit. The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that \"special circumstances\" can excuse a failure to comply with administrative procedural requirements\u2014particularly where the inmate reasonably, even though mistakenly, believed he had suffciently ex-hausted his remedies. Held: 1. The Fourth Circuit's unwritten \"special circumstances\" exception is inconsistent with the text and history of the PLRA. Pp. 638-642. (a) The PLRA speaks in unambiguous terms, providing that \"[n]o action shall be brought\" absent exhaustion of available administrative remedies. \u00a7 1997e(a). Aside from one signifcant qualifer\u2014that ad-ministrative remedies must indeed be \"available\"\u2014the text suggests no limits on an inmate's obligation to exhaust. That mandatory language means a court may not excuse a failure to exhaust, even to take \"special circumstances\" into account. When it comes to statutory exhaustion provisions, courts have a role in creating exceptions only if Congress wants them to. So mandatory exhaustion statutes like the PLRA es-tablish mandatory exhaustion regimes, foreclosing judicial discretion. Cite as: 578 U. S. 632 (2016) 633 Syllabus See, e. g., McNeil v. United States, 508 U. S. 106. Time and again, this Court has rejected every attempt to deviate from the PLRA's textual mandate. See Booth v. Churner , 532 U. S. 731; Porter v. Nussle , 534 U. S. 516; Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81. All those precedents rebut the Fourth Circuit's \"special circumstances\" excuse for non-exhaustion. Pp. 638-640. (b) The PLRA's history further underscores the mandatory nature of its exhaustion regime. The PLRA replaced a largely discretionary exhaustion scheme, see Nussle, 534 U. S., at 523, removing the condi- tions that administrative remedies be \"plain, speedy, and effective,\" that they satisfy federal minimum standards, and that exhaustion be \"appro-priate and in the interests of justice.\" The Court of Appeals' exception, if applied broadly, would resurrect that discretionary regime, in which a court could look to all the particulars of a case to decide whether to excuse a failure to exhaust. And if the exception were confned to cases in which a prisoner makes a reasonable mistake about the meaning of a prison's grievance procedures, it would reintroduce the requirement that the remedial process be \"plain.\" When Congress amends legisla-tion, courts must \"presume it intends [the change] to have real and sub-stantial effect.\" Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 397. But the Court of Appeals acted as though no amendment had taken place. Pp. 640-642. 2. Blake's contention that the prison's grievance process was not in fact available to him warrants further consideration below. Pp. 642-649. (a) Blake's suit may yet be viable. The PLRA contains its own, textual exception to mandatory exhaustion. Under \u00a7 1997e(a), an in-mate's obligation to exhaust hinges on the \"availab[ility]\" of administra-tive remedies. A prisoner is thus required to exhaust only those griev-ance procedures that are \"capable of use\" to obtain \"some relief for the action complained of.\" Booth, 532 U. S., at 738. As relevant here, there are three kinds of circumstances in which an administrative remedy, although offcially on the books, is not capable of use to obtain relief. First, an administrative procedure is unavailable when it operates as a simple dead end\u2014with offcers unable or consist- ently unwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmates. Next, an administrative scheme might be so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use\u2014i. e., some mechanism exists to provide re-lief, but no ordinary prisoner can navigate it. And fnally, a grievance process is rendered unavailable when prison administrators thwart in-mates from taking advantage of it through machination, misrepresenta-tion, or intimidation. Pp. 642-644. (b) The facts of this case raise questions about whether, given these principles, Blake had an \"available\" administrative remedy to exhaust. Ross's exhaustion defense rests on Blake's failure to seek relief through 634 ROSS v. BLAKE Syllabus Maryland's Administrative Remedy Procedure (ARP) process, which be- gins with a grievance to the warden. That process is the standard method for addressing inmate complaints in the State's prisons. But Maryland separately maintains the IIU to look into charges of prison staff misconduct, and the IIU did just that here. Blake urged in the courts below that once the IIU commences such an inquiry, a prisoner cannot obtain relief through the ARP process. And in this Court, the parties have lodged additional materials relating to the interaction between the IIU and the ARP. Both sides' submissions, although scat-tershot and in need of further review, lend some support to Blake's account. Blake's flings include many administrative dispositions indicating that Maryland wardens routinely dismiss ARP grievances as procedur-ally improper when parallel IIU investigations are pending. In addi-tion, Blake has submitted briefs of the Maryland attorney general spe-cifcally recognizing that administrative practice. And Ross's own submissions offer some confrmation of Blake's view: Ross does not iden-tify a single case in which a warden considered the merits of an ARP grievance while an IIU inquiry was underway. On remand, the Fourth Circuit should perform a thorough review of such materials, and then address whether the remedies Blake did not exhaust were \"available\" under the legal principles set out here.

BLAKE Opinion of the Court requirement: A prisoner need not exhaust remedies if they are not \"available.\" The briefs and other submissions fled in this case suggest the possibility that the aggrieved inmate lacked an available administrative remedy. That issue re-mains open for consideration on remand, in light of the prin-ciples stated below. I Respondent Shaidon Blake is an inmate in a Maryland prison. On June 21, 2007, two guards\u2014James Madigan and petitioner Michael Ross\u2014undertook to move him from his regular cell to the facility's segregation unit. According to Blake's version of the facts, Ross handcuffed him and held him by the arm as they left the cell; Madigan followed close behind. Near the top of a fight of stairs, Madigan shoved Blake in the back. Ross told Madigan he had Blake under control, and the three continued walking. At the bottom of the stairs, Madigan pushed Blake again and then punched him four times in the face, driving his head into the wall. After a brief pause, Madigan hit Blake one last time. Ross kept hold of Blake throughout the assault. And when the blows subsided, Ross helped Madigan pin Blake to the ground until additional offcers arrived. Later that day, Blake reported the assault to a senior cor- rections offcer. That offcer thought Madigan at fault, and so referred the incident to the Maryland prison system's In-ternal Investigative Unit (IIU). Under state law, the IIU has authority to investigate allegations of employee miscon-duct, including the use of \"excessive force.\" Code of Md. Regs., tit. 12, \u00a7 11.01.05(A)(3) (2006). After conducting a year-long inquiry into the beating, the IIU issued a fnal re-port condemning Madigan's actions, while making no fndings with respect to Ross. See App. 191-195. Madigan re-signed to avoid being fred. Blake subsequently sued both guards under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that Madigan had used unjustifable force and that Ross had failed to take protective action. The claim Cite as: 578 U. S. 632 (2016) 637 Opinion of the Court against Madigan went to a jury, which awarded Blake a judg- ment of $50,000. But unlike Madigan, Ross raised the PLRA's exhaustion requirement as an affrmative defense, contending that Blake had brought suit without frst follow-ing the prison's prescribed procedures for obtaining an ad-ministrative remedy. As set out in Maryland's Inmate Handbook, that process\u2014called, not very fancifully, the Ad-ministrative Remedy Procedure (ARP)\u2014begins with a for-mal grievance to the prison's warden; it may also involve appeals to the Commissioner of Correction and then the In-mate Grievance Offce (IGO). See Maryland Div. of Correc- tion, Inmate Handbook 30-31 (2007). Blake acknowledged that he had not sought a remedy through the ARP\u2014because, he thought, the IIU investigation served as a substitute for that otherwise standard process. The District Court re-jected that explanation and dismissed the suit, holding that \"the commencement of an internal investigation does not re-lieve prisoners from the [PLRA's] exhaustion requirement.\" Blake v. Maynard, No. 8:09-cv-2367 (D Md., Nov. 14, 2012), App. to Pet. for Cert. 38, 2012 WL 5568940, *5. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed in a divided decision. Stating that the PLRA's \"exhaustion requirement is not absolute,\" the court adopted an extra-textual exception originally formulated by the Second Cir-cuit. 787 F. 3d 693, 698 (2015). Repeated the Court of Ap-peals: \"[T]here are certain `special circumstances' in which, though administrative remedies may have been available[,] the prisoner's failure to comply with administrative proce-dural requirements may nevertheless have been justifed.\" Ibid. (quoting Giano v. Goord, 380 F. 3d 670, 676 (CA2 2004)). In particular, that was true when a prisoner \"reasonably\"\u2014 even though mistakenly\u2014\"believed that he had suffciently exhausted his remedies.\" 787 F. 3d, at 695. And Blake, the court concluded, ft within that exception because he reason-ably thought that \"the IIU's investigation removed his com-plaint from the typical ARP process.\" Id., at 700. Judge 638 ROSS v. BLAKE Opinion of the Court Agee dissented, stating that the PLRA's mandatory exhaus- tion requirement is not \"amenable\" to \"[j]udge-made excep-tions.\" Id., at 703. This Court granted certiorari. 577 U. S. 1045 (2015). II The dispute here concerns whether the PLRA's exhaustion requirement, \u00a7 1997e(a), bars Blake's suit. Statutory text and history alike foreclose the Fourth Circuit's adoption of a \"special circumstances\" exception to that mandate. But Blake's suit may yet be viable. Under the PLRA, a prisoner need exhaust only \"available\" administrative remedies. And Blake's contention that the prison's grievance process was not in fact available to him warrants further consider-ation below. A Statutory interpretation, as we always say, begins with the text, see, e. g., Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U. S. 242, 251 (2010)\u2014but here following that approach at once distances us from the Court of Appeals. As Blake acknowledges, that court made no attempt to ground its anal-ysis in the PLRA's language. See 787 F. 3d, at 697-698; Brief for Respondent 47-48, n. 20 (labeling the Court of Ap-peals' rule an \"extra-textual exception to the PLRA's ex-haustion requirement\"). And that failure makes a differ-ence, because the statute speaks in unambiguous terms opposite to what the Fourth Circuit said. Section 1997e(a) provides: \"No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confned in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such adminis-trative remedies as are available are exhausted.\" As we have often observed, that language is \"mandatory\": An in-mate \"shall\" bring \"no action\" (or said more conversationally, may not bring any action) absent exhaustion of available ad-ministrative remedies. Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81, 85 Cite as: 578 U. S. 632 (2016) 639 Opinion of the Court (2006); accord, Jones v. Bock, 549 U. S. 199, 211 (2007) (\"There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA\"). As later discussed, that edict contains one sig-nifcant qualifer: The remedies must indeed be \"available\" to the prisoner. See infra, at 642-644. But aside from that exception, the PLRA's text suggests no limits on an in-mate's obligation to exhaust\u2014irrespective of any \"special circumstances.\" And that mandatory language means a court may not ex- cuse a failure to exhaust, even to take such circumstances into account. See Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 337 (2000) (explaining that \"[t]he mandatory `shall' . . . normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion\"). No doubt, judge-made exhaustion doctrines, even if fatly stated at frst, remain amenable to judge-made exceptions. See McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185, 193 (1969) (\"The doc- trine of exhaustion of administrative remedies . . . is, like most judicial doctrines, subject to numerous exceptions\"). But a statutory exhaustion provision stands on a different footing. There, Congress sets the rules\u2014and courts have a role in creating exceptions only if Congress wants them to. For that reason, mandatory exhaustion statutes like the PLRA establish mandatory exhaustion regimes, foreclosing judicial discretion. See, e. g., McNeil v. United States, 508 U. S. 106, 111, 113 (1993) (\"We are not free to rewrite the statutory text\" when Congress has strictly \"bar[red] claim-ants from bringing suit in federal court until they have ex-hausted their administrative remedies\"). Time and again, this Court has taken such statutes at face value\u2014refusing to add unwritten limits onto their rigorous textual require-ments. See, e. g., id., at 111; Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care , Inc., 529 U. S. 1, 12-14 (2000); see also 2 R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 15.3, p. 1241 (5th ed. 2010) (collecting cases). We have taken just that approach in construing the PLRA's exhaustion provision\u2014rejecting every attempt to 640 ROSS v. BLAKE Opinion of the Court deviate (as the Fourth Circuit did here) from its textual man- date. In Booth v. Churner , 532 U. S. 731 (2001), for example, the prisoner argued that exhaustion was not necessary be-cause he wanted a type of relief that the administrative proc-ess did not provide. But \u00a7 1997e(a), we replied, made no dis-tinctions based on the particular \"forms of relief sought and offered,\" and that legislative judgment must control: We would not read \"exceptions into statutory exhaustion re-quirements where Congress has provided otherwise.\" Id., at 741, n. 6. The next year, in Porter v. Nussle , 534 U. S. 516, 520 (2002), the Court rejected a proposal to carve out excessive-force claims (like Blake's) from the PLRA's ex-haustion regime, viewing that approach too as inconsistent with the uncompromising statutory text. And most re-cently, in Woodford, we turned aside a requested exception for constitutional claims. 548 U. S., at 91, n. 2. Our expla-nation was familiar: \"We are interpreting and applying\" not a judge-made doctrine but a \"statutory requirement,\" and therefore must honor Congress's choice. Ibid. 1 All those precedents rebut the Court of Appeals' adoption of a \"special circumstances\" excuse for non-exhaustion. So too, the history of the PLRA underscores the manda- tory nature of its exhaustion regime. Section 1997e(a)'s pre-cursor, enacted in the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Per-sons Act (CRIPA), \u00a7 7, 94 Stat. 352 (1980), was a \"weak exhaustion provision.\" Woodford, 548 U. S., at 84. Under CRIPA, a court would require exhaustion only if a State pro- 1 We note that our adherence to the PLRA's text runs both ways: The same principle applies regardless of whether it benefts the inmate or the prison. We have thus overturned judicial rulings that imposed extra-statutory limitations on a prisoner's capacity to sue\u2014reversing, for exam-ple, decisions that required an inmate to demonstrate exhaustion in his complaint, permitted suit against only defendants named in the adminis-trative grievance, and dismissed an entire action because of a single unex-hausted claim. See Jones v. Bock, 549 U. S. 199, 203 (2007). \"[T]hese rules,\" we explained, \"are not required by the PLRA,\" and \"crafting and imposing them exceeds the proper limits on the judicial role.\" Ibid. Cite as: 578 U. S. 632 (2016) 641 Opinion of the Court vided \"plain, speedy, and effective\" remedies meeting federal minimum standards\u2014and even then, only if the court be-lieved exhaustion \"appropriate and in the interests of jus-tice.\" \u00a7 7(a), 94 Stat. 352. That statutory scheme made ex-haustion \"in large part discretionary.\" Nussle , 534 U. S., at 523. And for that reason (among others), CRIPA proved inadequate to stem the then-rising tide of prisoner litigation. In enacting the PLRA, Congress thus substituted an \"invig-orated\" exhaustion provision. Woodford, 548 U. S., at 84. \"[D]iffer[ing] markedly from its predecessor,\" the new \u00a7 1997e(a) removed the conditions that administrative reme- dies be \"plain, speedy, and effective\" and that they satisfy minimum standards. Nussle , 534 U. S., at 524. Still more, the PLRA prevented a court from deciding that exhaustion would be unjust or inappropriate in a given case. As de-scribed earlier, see supra, at 638-639, all inmates must now exhaust all available remedies: \"Exhaustion is no longer left to the discretion of the district court.\" Woodford, 548 U. S., at 85. The PLRA's history (just like its text) thus refutes a \"spe- cial circumstances\" exception to its rule of exhaustion. That approach, if applied broadly, would resurrect CRIPA's scheme, in which a court could look to all the particulars of a case to decide whether to excuse a failure to exhaust avail-able remedies. But as we have observed, such wide-ranging discretion \"is now a thing of the past.\" Booth, 532 U. S., at 739. And the confict with the PLRA's history (as again with its text) becomes scarcely less stark if the Fourth Cir-cuit's exception is confned, as the court may have intended, to cases in which a prisoner makes a reasonable mistake about the meaning of a prison's grievance procedures. Un-derstood that way, the exception reintroduces CRIPA's requirement that the remedial process be \"plain\"\u2014that is, not subject to any reasonable misunderstanding or disagree-ment. \u00a7 7(a), 94 Stat. 352. When Congress amends legisla-tion, courts must \"presume it intends [the change] to have 642 ROSS v. BLAKE Opinion of the Court real and substantial effect.\" Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 397 (1995). The Court of Appeals instead acted as though the amendment\u2014from a largely permissive to a mandatory ex-haustion regime\u2014had not taken place. 2 B Yet our rejection of the Fourth Circuit's \"special circum- stances\" exception does not end this case\u2014because the PLRA contains its own, textual exception to mandatory exhaustion. Under \u00a7 1997e(a), the exhaustion requirement hinges on the \"availab[ility]\" of administrative remedies: An inmate, that is, must exhaust available remedies, but need not exhaust unavailable ones. And that limitation on an in-mate's duty to exhaust\u2014although signifcantly different from the \"special circumstances\" test or the old CRIPA stand-ard\u2014has real content. As we explained in Booth, the ordi- nary meaning of the word \"available\" is \" `capable of use for the accomplishment of a purpose,' and that which `is accessi-ble or may be obtained.' \" 532 U. S., at 737-738 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 150 (1993)); see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 142 (2d ed. 1987) (\"suitable or ready for use\"); 1 Oxford Eng-lish Dictionary 812 (2d ed. 1989) (\"capable of being made use of, at one's disposal, within one's reach\"); Black's Law Dic-tionary 135 (6th ed. 1990) (\"useable\"; \"present or ready for immediate use\"). Accordingly, an inmate is required to ex-haust those, but only those, grievance procedures that are \"capable of use\" to obtain \"some relief for the action com-plained of.\" Booth, 532 U. S., at 738. 2 Of course, an exhaustion provision with a different text and history from \u00a7 1997e(a) might be best read to give judges the leeway to create exceptions or to itself incorporate standard administrative-law exceptions. See 2 R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 15.3, p. 1245 (5th ed. 2010). The question in all cases is one of statutory construction, which must be resolved using ordinary interpretive techniques. Cite as: 578 U. S. 632 (2016) 643 Opinion of the Court To state that standard, of course, is just to begin; courts in this and other cases must apply it to the real-world work- ings of prison grievance systems. Building on our own and lower courts' decisions, we note as relevant here three kinds of circumstances in which an administrative remedy, al-though offcially on the books, is not capable of use to obtain relief. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-29 (Solicitor General as ami- cus curiae acknowledging these three kinds of unavailabil- ity). Given prisons' own incentives to maintain functioning remedial processes, we expect that these circumstances will not often arise. See Woodford, 548 U. S., at 102. But when one (or more) does, an inmate's duty to exhaust \"available\" remedies does not come into play. First, as Booth made clear, an administrative procedure is unavailable when (despite what regulations or guidance materials may promise) it operates as a simple dead end\u2014 with offcers unable or consistently unwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmates. See 532 U. S., at 736, 738. Suppose, for example, that a prison handbook directs inmates to submit their grievances to a particular administrative of-fce\u2014but in practice that offce disclaims the capacity to con-sider those petitions. The procedure is not then \"capable of use\" for the pertinent purpose. In Booth's words: \"[S]ome redress for a wrong is require-ment\" of an \"available\" remedy; \"where the relevant admin-istrative procedure lacks authority to provide any relief,\" the inmate has \"nothing to exhaust.\" Id., at 736, and n. 4. So too if administrative offcials have apparent authority, but decline ever to exercise it. Once again: \"[T]he modifer `available' requires the possibility of some relief.\" Id., at 738. When the facts on the ground demonstrate that no such potential exists, the inmate has no obligation to exhaust the remedy. Next, an administrative scheme might be so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use. In this 644 ROSS v. BLAKE Opinion of the Court situation, some mechanism exists to provide relief, but no ordinary prisoner can discern or navigate it. As the Solici-tor General put the point: When rules are \"so confusing that . . . no reasonable prisoner can use them,\" then \"they're no longer available.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. That is a signif-cantly higher bar than CRIPA established or the Fourth Cir-cuit suggested: The procedures need not be suffciently \"plain\" as to preclude any reasonable mistake or debate with respect to their meaning. See \u00a7 7(a), 94 Stat. 352; 787 F. 3d, at 698-699; supra, at 637, 640-642. When an administrative process is susceptible of multiple reasonable interpretations, Congress has determined that the inmate should err on the side of exhaustion. But when a remedy is, in Judge Carnes's phrasing, essentially \"unknowable\"\u2014so that no ordinary prisoner can make sense of what it demands\u2014then it is also unavailable. See Goebert v. Lee County , 510 F. 3d 1312, 1323 1084 (CA11 2008) (\"Remedies that rational inmates cannot be expected to use are not capable of accomplishing their purposes and so are not available\"). Accordingly, exhaustion is not required. And fnally, the same is true when prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance proc-ess through machination, misrepresentation, or intimida-tion. In Woodford, we recognized that offcials might de- vise procedural systems (including the blind alleys and quagmires just discussed) in order to \"trip[ ] up all but the most skillful prisoners.\" 548 U. S., at 102. And appellate courts have addressed a variety of instances in which off-cials misled or threatened individual inmates so as to prevent their use of otherwise proper procedures. As all those courts have recognized, such interference with an inmate's pursuit of relief renders the administrative process unavail-able. 3 And then, once again, \u00a7 1997e(a) poses no bar. 3 See, e. g., Davis v. Hernandez, 798 F. 3d 290, 295 (CA5 2015) (\"Griev- ance procedures are unavailable . . . if the correctional facility's staff misled the inmate as to the existence or rules of the grievance process so as to Cite as: 578 U. S. 632 (2016) 645 Opinion of the Court The facts of this case raise questions about whether, given these principles, Blake had an \"available\" administrative remedy to exhaust. As explained earlier, Ross's exhaustion defense rests on Blake's failure to seek relief through Mary-land's ARP process, which begins with a grievance to the warden and may continue with appeals to the Commissioner of Correction and the IGO. See supra, at 637; Inmate Hand- book, at 30-31. That process is the standard method for addressing inmate complaints in the State's prisons: The In-mate Handbook provides that prisoners may use the ARP for \"all types\" of grievances (subject to four exceptions not relevant here), including those relating to the use of force. Id., at 30; see App. 312. But recall that Maryland separately maintains the IIU to look into charges of staff misconduct in prisons, and the IIU did just that here. See supra, at 636. Blake urged in the courts below that once the IIU com-mences such an inquiry, a prisoner cannot obtain relief through the standard ARP process\u2014whatever the Handbook may say to the contrary. See 787 F. 3d, at 697; App. to Pet. for Cert. 38, 2012 WL 5568940, *5. And in this Court, that issue has taken on new life. Both Blake and Ross (as repre-sented by the Maryland attorney general) have lodged addi-tional materials relating to the interaction between the IIU and the ARP. And both sides' submissions, although scat- cause the inmate to fail to exhaust such process\" (emphasis deleted)); Schultz v. Pugh, 728 F. 3d 619, 620 (CA7 2013) (\"A remedy is not available, therefore, to a prisoner prevented by threats or other intimidation by prison personnel from seeking an administrative remedy\"); Pavey v. Con- ley, 663 F. 3d 899, 906 (CA7 2011) (\"[I]f prison [a prisoner] into thinking that . . . he had done all he needed to initiate the grievance process,\" then \"[a]n administrative remedy is not `available' \"); 660 (CA10 2011) (\"[W]hen a prison offcial inhibits an inmate from utilizing an administrative process through threats or intimidation, that process can no longer be said to be `available' \"); Goebert v. Lee County , 510 F. 1323 (CA11 2007) (If a prison \"play[s] hide-and-seek with administrative remedies,\" then they are not \"available\"). 646 ROSS v. BLAKE Opinion of the Court tershot and in need of further review, lend some support to Blake's account\u2014while also revealing Maryland's grievance process to have, at least at frst blush, some bewildering features. Blake's flings include many administrative dispositions (gleaned from the records of other prisoner suits) indicating that Maryland wardens routinely dismiss ARP grievances as procedurally improper when parallel IIU investigations are pending. One warden, for example, wrote in response to a prisoner's complaint: \"Your Request for Administrative Remedy has been received and is hereby dismissed. This issue has been assigned to the Division of Correction's Inter-nal Investigative Unit (Case #07-35-010621I/C), and will no longer be addressed through this process.\" Lodging of Re-spondent 1; see also, e. g., id., at 18 (\"Admin. Dismiss Final: This is being investigated outside of the ARP process by I. I. U.\"). In addition, Blake has submitted briefs of the Maryland attorney general (again, drawn from former pris-oner suits) specifcally recognizing that administrative prac-tice. As the attorney general stated in one case: \"Wilkerson fled an ARP request,\" but \"his complaint already was being investigated by the [IIU], superceding an ARP investiga-tion.\" Id., at 23-24; see also, e. g., id., at 5 (Bacon's griev- ance \"was dismissed because the issue had been assigned to [the] IIU and would no longer be addressed through the ARP process\"). 4 4 Blake further notes that in 2008, a year after his beating, Maryland amended one of its prison directives to state expressly that when the IIU investigates an incident, an ARP grievance may not proceed. See App. 367, Md. Div. of Correction, Directive 185-003, \u00a7 VI(N)(4) (Aug. 27, 2008) warden \"shall fnal dismissal of [an ARP] request for proce-dural reasons when it has been determined that the basis of the complaint is the same basis of an investigation under the authority of the [IIU]\"); Brief for Respondent 17-18. According to Blake, that amendment merely codifed what his submissions show had long been the practice in Maryland prisons. See ibid. Cite as: 578 U. S. 632 (2016) 647 Opinion of the Court And Ross's own submissions offer some confrmation of Blake's view. Ross does not identify a single case in which a warden considered the merits of an ARP grievance while an IIU inquiry was underway. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6 (Mary-land attorney general's offce conceding that it had found none). To the contrary, his lodging contains still further evi-dence that wardens consistently dismiss such complaints as misdirected. See, e. g., Lodging of Petitioner 15 (District Court noting that \"Gladhill was advised that no further ac-tion would be taken through the ARP process because the matter had been referred to the [IIU]\"). Indeed, Ross' ma- terials suggest that some wardens use a rubber stamp spe-cially devised for that purpose; the inmate, that is, receives a reply stamped with the legend: \"Dismissed for procedural reasons . . . . This issue is being investigated by IIU case number: ---. No further action shall be taken within the ARP process.\" Id., at 25, 32, 38; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 8- 9 (Maryland attorney general's offce conceding the stamp's existence and use). Complicating the picture, however, are several cases in which an inmate refused to take a warden's jurisdictional \"no\" for an answer, resubmitted his grievance up the chain to the IGO, and there received a ruling on the merits, with-out any discussion of the ARP/IIU issue. We confess to fnding these few cases perplexing in relation to normal ap-pellate procedure. See id., at 3-10, 13-15, 18-20 (multiple Justices expressing confusion about Maryland's procedures). If the IGO thinks the wardens wrong to dismiss complaints because of pending IIU investigations, why does it not say so and stop the practice? Conversely, if the IGO thinks the wardens right, how can it then issue merits decisions? And if that really is Maryland's procedure\u2014that when an IIU in-vestigation is underway, the warden (and Commissioner of Correction) cannot consider a prisoner's complaint, but the IGO can\u2014why does the Inmate Handbook not spell this out? Are there, instead, other materials provided to prisoners 648 ROSS v. BLAKE Opinion of the Court that communicate how this seemingly unusual process works and how to navigate it so as to get a claim heard? In light of all these lodgings and the questions they raise about Maryland's grievance process, we remand this case for further consideration of whether Blake had \"available\" reme-dies to exhaust. The materials we have seen are not conclu-sive; they may not represent the complete universe of rele-vant documents, and few have been analyzed in the courts below. On remand, in addition to considering any other ar-guments still alive in this case, the court must perform a thorough review of such materials, and then address the legal issues we have highlighted concerning the availability of administrative remedies. First, did Maryland's standard grievance procedures potentially offer relief to Blake or, al-ternatively, did the IIU investigation into his assault fore-close that possibility? Second, even if the former, were those procedures knowable by an ordinary prisoner in Blake's situation, or was the system so confusing that no such inmate could make use of it? And fnally, is there persua-sive evidence that Maryland offcials thwarted the effective invocation of the administrative process through threats, game-playing, or misrepresentations, either on a system-wide basis or in the individual case? If the court accepts Blake's probable arguments on one or more of these scores, then it should fnd (consistent this time with the PLRA) that his suit may proceed even though he did not fle an ARP complaint. III Courts may not engraft an unwritten \"special circum- stances\" exception onto the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. The only limit to \u00a7 1997e(a)'s mandate is the one baked into its text: An inmate need exhaust only such administrative remedies as are \"available.\" On remand, the court below must consider how that modifying term affects Blake's case\u2014that is, whether the remedies he failed to exhaust were \"available\" under the principles set out here. We Cite as: 578 U. S. 632 (2016) 649 Breyer, J., concurring in part therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join the Court's opinion except for the discussion of Maryland's prison-grievance procedures, ante , at 645-648, which needlessly wades into respondent Shaidon Blake's questionable lodgings of new documents in this Court. Those documents are not part of the appellate record. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 10(a). We have \"consistently con-demned\" attempts to infuence our decisions by submitting \"additional or different evidence that is not part of the certi-fed record.\" S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E. Hartnett, & D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice \u00a7 13.11(k), p. 743 (10th ed. 2013). Perhaps Blake's newfound documents are subject to judicial notice as public records. See Fed. Rule Evid. 201. But I would not take such notice for the frst time in this Court. It appears that Blake had a chance to submit many of his documents to the lower courts and failed to do so. Taking notice of the documents encourages games-manship and frustrates our review. I would let the Court of Appeals decide on remand whether to supplement the record, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 10(e), or take notice of Blake's lodgings. Justice Breyer , concurring in part. I join the opinion of the Court, with the exception that I described in Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. 81 (2006). There, I agreed that \"Congress intended the term `exhausted' to `mean what the term means in administrative law, where ex-haustion means proper exhaustion.' \" Id., at 103 (opinion concurring in judgment). Though that statutory term does not encompass \"freewheeling\" exceptions for any \" `special 650 ROSS v. BLAKE Breyer, J., concurring in part circumstanc[e],' \" ante , at 635, it does include administrative law's \"well-established exceptions to exhaustion,\" Woodford, supra, at 103 (opinion of Breyer, J .). I believe that such exceptions, though not necessary to the Court's disposition of this case, may nevertheless apply where appropriate.

This petition asks the Court to overrule Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997), and Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410 (1945). For the reasons set forth in my opinion concur- ring in the judgment in Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U. S. 92, 112 (2015), that question is worthy of review. The doctrine of Seminole Rock deference (or, as it is sometimes called, Auer deference) permits courts to defer to an agency's interpretation of its own regulation \"unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center , 568 U. S. 597, 613 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts will defer even when the agency's interpretation is not \"the only possible reading of a regulation\u2014or even the best one.\" Ibid. Any reader of this Court's opinions should think that the doc- trine is on its last gasp. Members of this Court have repeatedly called for its reconsideration in an appropriate case. See Mort- gage Bankers, 575 U. S., at 107 (Alito , J., concurring); id., at 108 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 112 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); Decker, 568 U. S., at 615-616 (Roberts, C. J., concurring); id., at 617-621 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Talk America, Inc. v. Michigan Bell Tele- phone Co., 564 U. S. 50, 68-69 (2011) (Scalia, J., concurring); see also Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp. , 567 U. S. 142, 155-159 (2012) (refusing to defer under Auer). And rightly so. The doctrine has metastasized, see Knudsen & Wildermuth, Unearthing the Lost History of Seminole Rock, 65 Emory L. J. 47, 54-68 (2015) (discussing Seminole Rock 's humble origins), and 990 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 May 16, 2016 578 U. S. today \"amounts to a transfer of the judge's exercise of interpre- tive judgment to the agency,\" Mortgage Bankers, supra, at 124 (opinion of Thomas, J.). \"Enough is enough.\" Decker , supra, at 616 (opinion of Scalia, J.). This case is emblematic of the failings of Seminole Rock defer- ence. Here, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit de-ferred to the Department of Education's interpretation of the reg-ulatory scheme it enforces\u2014an interpretation set forth in an amicus brief that the Department fled at the invitation of the Seventh Circuit. For the reasons stated in Judge Manion's par-tial dissent, 799 F. 3d 633, 663-676 (2015), the Department's inter-pretation is not only at odds with the regulatory scheme but also defes ordinary English. More broadly, by deferring to an agency's litigating position under the guise of Seminole Rock, courts force regulated entities like petitioner here to \"divine the agency's interpretations in advance,\" lest they \"be held liable when the agency announces its interpretations for the frst time\" in litigation. Christopher, supra, at 159. By enabling an agency to enact \"vague rules\" and then to invoke Seminole Rock to \"do what it pleases\" in later litigation, the agency (with the judicial branch as its co-conspirator) \"frustrates the notice and predictabil-ity purposes of rulemaking, and promotes arbitrary government.\" Talk America, Inc., supra, at 69 (Scalia, J., concurring). This is the appropriate case in which to reevaluate Seminole Rock and Auer . But the Court chooses to sit idly by, content to let \"[h]e who writes a law\" also \"adjudge its violation.\" Decker , supra, at 621 (opinion of Scalia, J.).

Justice Alito , with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring.* The Court grants the petition for a writ of certiorari in this case, vacates the decision below, and remands for reconsideration in light of Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. 190 (2016), which holds that Miller v. Alabama, 567 U. S. 460 (2012), applies retroac- tively to cases on state collateral review. As a result of Mont- gomery and Miller , States must now ensure that prisoners serv- ing sentences of life without parole for offenses committed before the age of 18 have the beneft of an individualized sentencing procedure that considers their youth and immaturity at the time of the offense. The present case differs from most of those in which the Court grants, vacates, and remands for reconsideration in light of Mont- gomery . The petitioner in this case\u2014as with a few others now before the Court\u2014was sentenced to death prior to our decision in Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), which held that the *This opinion also applies to the other petitions held for Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U.

Alabama, supra, p. 994; No. 15-6904, Barnes v. Alabama, supra, p. 994; and No. 15-6905, Barnes v. Alabama, supra, p. 994. 996 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 Alito, J., concurring 578 U. S. Eighth Amendment prohibits a death sentence for a minor. Dur- ing that pre-Roper period, juries in capital cases were required at the penalty phase to consider \"all relevant mitigating evidence,\" including \"the chronological age of a minor\" and a de-fendant's \"mental and emotional development.\" Okla- homa, 455 U. S. 104, 116-117 (1982); see also Roper v. Simmons, supra, at 603 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (\"A defendant's youth or immaturity is, of course, a paradigmatic example\" of the type of mitigating evidence to which a \"sentencer in a capital case must be permitted to give full effect\"). After Roper , death sentences imposed on prisoners convicted of murders committed as minors were reduced to lesser sentences. In the present case, petitioner committed a heinous murder in 1997 when he was 17 years old. See 955 So. 2d 1037, 1047-1049 (Ala. Crim. App. 2003). Wielding a knife and wearing a stocking mask to conceal his face, petitioner climbed through a window into the home of Melissa and Andrew Mills. Petitioner demanded money, but the Mills family had only $9 on hand. While peti-tioner remained in the Mills home with Melissa Mills and her three young children, Andrew Mills raced to an ATM and with-drew $375, the maximum amount available. Petitioner then de-manded more money, so Andrew went to a nearby grocery store to cash a check. While holding her at knife point, petitioner raped Melissa Mills, who was four months pregnant, before stab-bing her repeatedly in the neck, upper and lower chest, and back. The stab wounds pierced her liver and lungs, and she eventually succumbed. When police arrived at the Mills' home, summoned by the gro- cery store clerk, Melissa Mills was gasping for breath and bleed-ing profusely. Petitioner fed but was captured nearby 20 min-utes later. His clothes were covered in Melissa Mills' blood, and he had in his possession the knife used to kill her, which was also covered in her blood. Nine blood-smeared dollar bills were lo-cated nearby. Petitioner's DNA matched the semen recovered from the rape kit performed as part of Melissa Mills' autopsy. A jury found petitioner guilty of murder and then proceeded to decide whether he should be sentenced to death or life impris-onment without parole. Id., at 1048; see Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-5-45 (1982). Under the Alabama law then in force, \"[t]he age of the defendant at the time of the crime\" was one of the statutory \"[m]itigating circumstances\" that the jury was required to con-ORDERS 997 994 Alito, J., concurring sider. \u00a7 13A-5-51(7). The jury nevertheless concluded that peti- tioner's age did not warrant a sentence of less than death. After Roper , however, petitioner's sentence was commuted to life with- out parole. See Ex parte Adams, 955 So. 2d 1106 (Ala. 2005). In cases like this, it can be argued that the original sentencing jury fulflled the individualized sentencing requirement that Miller subsequently imposed. In these cases, the sentencer nec- essarily rejected the argument that the defendant's youth and immaturity called for the lesser sentence of life imprisonment without parole. It can therefore be argued that such a sentencer would surely have felt that the defendant's youth and immaturity did not warrant an even lighter sentence that would have allowed the petitioner to be loosed on society at some time in the future. In short, it can be argued that the jury that sentenced petitioner to death already engaged in the very process mandated by Miller and concluded that petitioner was not a mere \" `child' \" whose crimes refected \" `unfortunate yet transient immaturity,' \" post, at 999 (Sotomayor, J., concurring), but was instead one of the rare minors who deserves life without parole. A similar argument can be made in other cases in which the jury origi- nally sentenced a minor to death. Here are some examples of other cases in which it might be inferred that the original sentencing juries concluded that the evidence established \"irreparable corruption,\" despite the fact that the defendant had not yet reached the age of 18 at the time of the crime. Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. 190, 209 (2016). Petitioner William Knotts, No. 15-6284, was 17 years old when he escaped from a juvenile facility, broke into two houses, and stole multiple weapons, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, food, and other supplies. He then hid in the woods to plan an attack on a woman who had called him a \" `cracker' \" and a \" `honky.' \" Knotts broke into the woman's home, lay in wait for her, and shot her to death in front of her 2-year-old son. The victim's husband discovered her body\u2014and their son, sitting next to her, crying, covered in blood\u2014four hours later. Knotts v. Nathan Slaton, No. 15-6300, was 17 years old when he decided to spend a morning shooting birds with his BB gun. He then got into a fght with his next-door neighbor over the gun, so he entered her house, unplugged her phone, raped her, beat her over the head, strangled her, and shot her. Slaton confessed to the rape-murder. Slaton v. State , 2d 879, App. 1995). Petitioner Michael Barnes, Nos. 15-6904, 15-6905, was 17 years old when he committed capital murder in the course of a burglary and rape. Neigh-bors of the victim saw smoke in her house. When frefghters responded, 998 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 Sotomayor, J., concurring 578 U. S. In cases in which a juvenile offender was originally sentenced to death after the sentencer considered but rejected youth as a mitigating factor, courts are free on remand to evaluate whether any further individualized consideration is required. Justice Sotomayor , with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.* The petitioners in these cases were sentenced to death for crimes they committed before they turned 18. In most of these cases, petitioners' sentences were automatically converted to life without the possibility of parole following our decisions outlawing the death penalty for juveniles. 1 See Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005); Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815 (1988). Today, we grant, vacate, and remand these cases in light of Mont- gomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. 190 (2016), for the lower courts to consider whether petitioners' sentences comport with the exacting limits the Eighth Amendment imposes on sentencing a juvenile offender to life without parole. Justice Alito suggests otherwise, noting that the juries that originally sentenced petitioners to death were statutorily obli-gated to consider the mitigating effects of petitioners' youth. \"In they discovered Barnes' victim. Her severely burned body was tied to her bed, an electrical appliance cord wrapped around her neck, and charred paper scattered about her. An autopsy revealed that the victim had been sexually assaulted and was alive when the fre was set. She died from strangulation, smoke inhalation, and her burns. Barnes v. State , 704 So. 2d 487, 489-490 (Ala. Crim. App. 1997). Petitioner Shermaine Johnson, No. 15-1, was a serial rapist (he had com- mitted four rapes, including the rape of a 13-year-old girl) before, at the age of 16, he committed the rape and brutal murder for which he was sentenced to death. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 259 Va. 654, 662-667, 529 S. E. 2d 769, 773-776 (2000). *This to v. Manis, supra, p. 992; v. Alabama, supra, 994; No. 15-6904, Barnes v. Alabama, supra, p. 994; and No. 15-6905, Barnes v. Alabama, supra, p. 994. 1The only exception is that of Michael Shawn Barnes, who was sentenced to life without parole after all three of the juries to consider the question recommended life without parole over the death penalty. See Reporter's Tr. 1, Alabama v. Barnes, Nos. CC 94-1401 and CC 94-2913 (C. C. Mobile Cty., Ala., June 12, 1998), 5 Record 202 (sentencing judge states only, \"I've overruled two juries in this case, but I'm not going to overrule this one\"). ORDERS 999 994 Sotoma yor, J., concurring cases like this,\" he writes, it can \"be argued that the original sentencing jury fulflled the individualized sentencing requirement that Miller subsequently imposed.\" Ante, at 997 (concurring opinion). But Miller v. Alabama, 567 U. S. 460 (2012), did not merely impose an \"individualized sentencing requirement\"; it imposed a substantive rule that life without parole is only an appropriate punishment for \"the rare juvenile offender whose crime refects irreparable corruption.\" Montgomery , 577 U. S., at 208 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Even if a court considers a child's age before sentencing him or her to a lifetime in prison, that sentence still violates the Eighth Amendment for a child whose crime refects unfortunate yet transient immaturity.\" Ibid. (same). There is no indication that, when the factfnders in these cases considered petitioners' youth, they even asked the question Miller required them not only to answer, but to answer correctly: whether petitioners' crimes refected \"transient immaturity\" or \"irreparable corruption.\" 577 U. S., at 208. The last factfnders to consider petitioners' youth did so more than 10\u2014and in most cases more than 20\u2014years ago. (Petition-ers' post-Roper resentencings were generally automatic.) Those factfnders did not have the beneft of this Court's guidance re-garding the \"diminished culpability of juveniles\" and the ways that \"penological justifcations\" apply to juveniles with \"lesser force than to adults.\" Roper , 543 U. S., at 571. As importantly, they did not have the beneft of this Court's repeated exhortation that the gruesomeness of a crime is not suffcient to demonstrate that a juvenile offender is beyond redemption: \"The reality that juveniles still struggle to defne their identity means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved character.\" Id., at 570; see also id., at 573; Miller , 567 U. S., at 479-480. When petitioners were sentenced, their youth was just one con- sideration among many; after Miller , we know that youth is the dispositive consideration for \"all but the rarest of children.\" Montgomery , 577 U. S., at 195. The sentencing proceedings in these cases are a product of that pre-Miller era. In one typical case, a judge's sentencing order\u2014overruling a unanimous jury verdict recommending life without parole instead of death\u2014refers to youth only once, noting \"the court fnds that the age of the defendant at the time of the crime is a mitigating circumstance\" 1000 OCTOBER TERM, 2015 Sotomayor, J., concurring 578 U. S. and then that \"[t]he [c]ourt rejects the advisory verdict of the jury, and fnds that the aggravating circumstances in this case outweigh the mitigating circumstances and that the punishment should be death.\" Sentencing Order, Alabama v. Barnes, No. CC 94-1401 (C. C. Mobile Cty., Ala., Dec. 12, 1995), 2 Record 225. Other sentencing orders are similarly terse. 2 In at least two cases, there is no indication that youth was considered as a stand- alone mitigating factor.3 In two others, factfnders did not put \" `great weight' \" 4 on considerations that we have described as particularly important in evaluating the culpability of juveniles, such as intellectual disability, an abusive upbringing, and evidence of impulsivity and immaturity. Miller , 567 U. S., at 476. Standards of decency have evolved since the time petitioners were sentenced to death. See Roper , 543 U. S., at 561. That petitioners were once given a death sentence we now know to be constitutionally unacceptable tells us nothing about whether their current life-without-parole sentences are constitutionally accept-able. I see no shortcut: On remand, the lower courts must in- 2See, e. g., Sentencing Order, Alabama v. Adams, No. CC 97-2403 (C. C. Montgomery Cty., Ala., Dec. 10, 1998), 1 Record 309-311 (\"This Court fnds that the age of Adams at the time of the crime as a mitigating circumstance, does exist and is considered by this Court. This Court notes that Adams's age alone is not determinative of whether the death penalty should be im-posed in this case, nor is imposition of such a sentence unconstitutional . . . . These choices made by Adams diminish the impact of his age as a mitigating circumstance . . . \"); Sentencing Order, Alabama v. Knotts, No. CC 91-2537 (C. C. Montgomery Cty., Ala., Oct. 2, 1992), 2 Record 595, 606 (\"The defend- ant was seventeen (17) years and eleven (11) months old at the time of the crime. The Court fnds this to be a mitigating circumstance, but also fnds that the aforestated aggravating circumstances outweigh this mitigating evi-dence\") (overruling 9-to-3 jury recommendation for life without parole); Ap-pendix, Alabama v. Slaton, No. CC 87-200210 (C. C. Marshall Cty., Ala., May 22, 1990), 13 Record 242 (considering only \"[t]hat the defendant was seventeen years old at the time of the crime\"). 3See Sentencing Order, Alabama v. Bonds, No. CC 00-1289 (C. C. Houston Cty., Ala., Nov. 14, 2002), 1 Record 257; Jury Instructions, Johnson v. Vir- ginia, No. 992525 (Va., Jan. 11, 2000), I App. 225-250. 4See Sentencing Order, Alabama v. Knotts, No. CC 91-2537 (C. C.

Certiorari denied. Reported below: 2013-1631 (La. 9/1/15), 181 So. 3d 590. Justice Breyer , with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting. Lamondre Tucker shot and killed his pregnant girlfriend in 2008. At the time of the murder, Tucker was 18 years, 5 months, and 6 days old, cf. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 578 (2005) (\"The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments forbid imposition of the death penalty on offenders who were under the age of 18 when their crimes were committed\"), and he had an IQ of 74, cf. Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 321 (2002) (execution of the intellectually disabled violates the Eighth Amendment). Tucker was sentenced to death in a Louisiana county (Caddo Parish) that imposes almost half the death sentences in Louisiana, even though it accounts for only 5% of that State's population and 5% of its homicides. See Pet. for Cert. 18. Given these facts, Tucker may well have received the death penalty not because of the comparative egregiousness of his crime, but because of an arbitrary feature of his case, namely, geography. See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. 863, 919-921 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting). One could reasonably believe that if Tucker had committed the same crime but been tried and sen-tenced just across the Red River in, say, Bossier Parish, he would not now be on death row. See, e. g., Smith, The Geography of the Death Penalty and Its Ramifcations, 92 B. U. L. Rev. 227, 233-235, 278, 281 (2012); Robertson, The Man Who Says Louisiana Should \"Kill More,\" N. Y . Times, July 8, 2015, p. A1 (\"From 2010 to 2014, more people were sentenced to death per capita [in Caddo Parish] than in any other county in the United States, among counties with four or more death sentences in that time period\"); see also Glossip, supra, at 919 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\"[I]n ORDERS 1019 578 U. S. May 31, June 6, 2016 2012, just 59 counties (fewer than 2% of counties in the country) accounted for all death sentences imposed nationwide\"). For this reason, and for the additional reasons set out in my opinion in Glossip, I would grant certiorari in this case to confront the frst question presented, i. e., whether imposition of the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.
