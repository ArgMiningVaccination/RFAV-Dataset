The theory is that taking chondroitin supplements may help to improve and repair damaged cartilage. In general, research on chondroitin has not shown it to be helpful for pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis. More than 20 studies have looked at the effect of chondroitin on pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis. The quality of the studies varied and so did the results. However, the largest and best studies showed that chondroitin doesn't lessen osteoarthritis pain.1 - There is no established dose of chondroitin for osteoarthritis, but manufacturers tend to recommend 400-1200mg daily.3 - The effect of chondroitin is not immediate. You may need to take the supplement for 4-6 weeks before you notice any improvement. - If there is no change in your symptoms by then, it's likely the supplement will not be of benefit to you and it's best to talk to your doctor about other ways of managing your arthritis.
