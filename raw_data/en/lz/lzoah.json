This virus was first detected as a cause of human illness in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and triggered a global pandemic that began in 2020. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets and small particles produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus spreads easily in crowded or poorly ventilated indoor settings. Some people who are infected have no symptoms of illness, while the severity of symptomatic illness ranges from mild to life-threatening. Older adults and people of any age with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness. | | | |The incubation period after exposure ranges from 214 days, with an average of about 5 days. People with COVID-19 are generally considered potentially infectious up to 48 hours before symptom onset through 10 days after onset, though people with severe illness may be infectious longer. Symptoms may include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. | | | |Where can I find answers to more clinical questions about COVID-19 disease, diagnosis, treatment and care of patients? | | | |The CDC has assembled clinical information about COVID-19 at this site: |[www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html). | | | | | | | | | | |Where can I find current COVID-19 vaccine recommendations? | | | |The CDCs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the CDC update COVID-19 vaccination recommendations frequently. All ACIP COVID-19 vaccine recommendations that have been published by CDC in MMWR can be accessed here: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/covid-19.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/covid-19.html). | | |CDC maintains a website with critical interim clinical considerations for vaccination of eligible recipients: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html). This CDC webpage covers important clinical details about COVID-19 vaccination. It is the first content to be updated soon after any announced change to CDC recommendations. | | |The current recommended COVID-19 vaccination schedules for each age group are available here: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | | |Who is recommended to receive COVID-19 vaccines? | | |All people age 6 months and older in the United States are recommended to receive an age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccination. Schedules vary by age and immunocompromised status. CDC's recommended schedule for each age group is available here: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | |What is the current recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination? | | | |In April 2023, CDC simplified its COVID-19 vaccination recommendations to state that all individuals age 6 months and older should receive at least one age-appropriate bivalent mRNA vaccine dose. The available COVID-19 vaccine options have also been reduced. The original monovalent mRNA vaccines are no longer recommended or available in the United States. The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is no longer available in the United States. Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine (the protein subunit vaccine) is monovalent and remains available: recommendations for its use in people age 12 years or older are unchanged. | | | |Because almost all people have had COVID-19 vaccination, infection, or both, their immune systems have already been primed to recognize the virus that causes COVID-19. Therefore, CDC now defines receipt of a single bivalent dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as being up to date on COVID-19 vaccination for all people ages 6 years and older who are not moderately or severely immunocompromised, even if they were previously unvaccinated. | | | |There remain certain groups that need, or have the option to receive, more than one bivalent mRNA vaccine dose: | | | | | | || ||All adults age 65 and older have the option to receive a second bivalent mRNA vaccine at least 4 months after receiving their first. | | || || | | || ||Children younger than age 6 years are recommended to receive a vaccination series including at least one bivalent mRNA vaccine dose: specifics vary by age, brand, and by history of previous vaccination with monovalent or bivalent products. | | || || | | || ||Individuals who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should receive a vaccination series including at least one bivalent mRNA dose, with the option to receive an additional bivalent dose at least two months after the final recommended dose. Additional doses may be given, as determined by these individuals with their clinical teams. | | | |See CDCs current recommended COVID-19 vaccination schedule for all people age 6 months and older here: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | | |Why is there an option for older adults and immunocompromised people to receive additional bivalent mRNA vaccine doses? | | |In April 2023, CDC updated its recommendation to state that adults age 65 and older who received a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at least 4 months previously have the option to receive a second bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. | | | |For individuals with moderate to severe immunocompromise, CDC now states that they have the option to receive an additional bivalent mRNA vaccine at least 2 months after the last recommended bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. CDC further states that additional bivalent doses may be administered (with a minimum two-month interval) based on the clinical judgment of the individuals healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. | | | |The option to receive these additional bivalent doses was offered because vaccine effectiveness declines most rapidly in older adults and in people with moderate to severe immunocompromise. These groups also have the highest risk of hospitalization with COVID-19 if infected. Although protection against severe disease is more durable than protection against mild infection, individuals in these groups may benefit from shorter intervals between doses. | | | |See CDCs interim immunization schedule for details: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | |What is the recommended vaccination schedule for a person who received only the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine? | | | |Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine is no longer available for use in the United States. The last remaining doses expired May 7, 2023. People age 18 years or older who received 1 or 2 Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine doses are recommended to receive 1 bivalent mRNA dose (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech) at least 2 months after completion of the previous dose. | | | |Should people who have had COVID-19 illness be vaccinated? | | | |Yes. Vaccination should be offered to individuals regardless of history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. CDC has summarized the available data on vaccine-induced immunity and disease-induced immunity here: |[www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html). | | |Viral testing to assess for current SARS-CoV-2 infection or serologic testing to assess for prior infection for the purposes of vaccine decision-making is not recommended. However, as with all vaccines, vaccination should be deferred until after recovery from moderate to severe illness. In addition, to minimize the risk of exposing others to SARS-CoV-2 virus, vaccination of a person diagnosed with COVID-19 generally should be deferred until the person does not pose a risk of infection to others. | | | |Although not required, people who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying a primary series dose or the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster dose by 3 months from symptom onset or positive test (if infection was asymptomatic). According to CDC, increasing the time between infection and vaccination may result in an improved immune response to vaccination. Among vaccine recipients at increased risk of post-vaccination myocarditis (e.g., adolescent and adult males younger than age 40), an increased interval also may reduce the rare risk of myocarditis after vaccination. A recipient's individual risks for severe disease and current COVID-19 conditions in the community should be taken into account when deciding whether to delay vaccination up to 3 months after infection. | | | |What is the difference between an \"additional primary dose\" of COVID-19 vaccine recommended for an immunocompromised person and a \"booster dose\"? | | | |CDC defines an \"additional primary dose\" as a subsequent dose of vaccine administered to people who are less likely to develop a protective immune response after initial vaccination because of moderate or severe immunocompromise. | | | |CDC defines a \"booster dose\" as a subsequent dose of vaccine administered to enhance or restore protection which might have declined over time after primary series vaccination. | | | | | | | | | | | |What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)? | | | |Under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. Vaccines that receive an EUA may later be fully licensed by the FDA. | | | |Are the original monovalent formulations of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Novavax COVID-19 vaccines recommended for use in any situation? | | | |As of April 2023, the original monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are no longer authorized or recommended in any situation or for any age group. Only the bivalent mRNA vaccines are currently authorized and recommended in the United States. | | | |The original monovalent Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine remains authorized to provide a 2-dose primary series (separated by at least 38 weeks) to people ages 12 years and older. A booster dose is authorized in limited situations to people ages 18 years and older who completed the primary series using any COVID-19 vaccine, have not received any previous booster dose, and are unable (i.e., vaccine contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a dose. This dose is administered at least 6 months after completion of any primary series. | | | |We dont have a VIS for COVID-19 vaccines. What information am I supposed to give patients in writing? | | | |For each COVID-19 vaccine authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that vaccine recipients or their caregivers are provided with certain vaccine-specific EUA information to help make an informed decision about vaccination. This is accomplished by providing an EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers. The Fact Sheet is similar in purpose and content to vaccine information statements (VISs) for licensed vaccines but differs in that the EUA Fact Sheet is specific to each authorized COVID-19 vaccine, is developed by the manufacturer of the vaccine, and is authorized by the FDA. Each formulation of a vaccine has a separate EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers; however, some EUA fact sheets for recipients and caregivers may be designed for use with more than one product. | | | |Immunize.org regularly updates its Checklist of Current Versions of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Guidance and Clinic Support Tools at |[www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3130.pdf](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3130.pdf). The checklist includes links to relevant fact sheets by age group and product type. | | |Where can I find information about the differences between the presentations of bivalent Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and when to use them? | | | |Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine has two bivalent presentations. CDC has summarized basic information about the different presentations and their storage, preparation, and administration in its Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at-a-glance document available here: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/downloads/vaccine-at-a-glance.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/downloads/vaccine-at-a-glance.pdf). | | |Vaccinators who stock multiple presentations should check three times to confirm that they are administering the proper product with the proper dose and dose volume for each patient. | | | |What are mRNA vaccines? | | | |Both the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine are lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines encoding the prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019. The fall 2022 bivalent mRNA vaccine formulations target the original SARS-CoV-2 and the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike protein. Both mRNA vaccine brands have been associated with a rare occurrence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis; cases have occurred predominantly among males ages 12 through 39. Visit this CDC website for more details about how mRNA vaccines work: |[www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). | | |How well did the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines work in the clinical trials? | | | |The FDA EUA was issued based upon the short-term effectiveness of these vaccines at preventing symptomatic illness with COVID-19. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (Comirnaty) was licensed by FDA with a reported vaccine efficacy of 91.1% against symptomatic disease among recipients age 16 years or older up to 6 months after dose 2. Both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccines maintained approximately 90% protection against severe disease for at least 6 months after vaccination. Early observational studies of short-term effectiveness in a variety of populations were consistent with the clinical trial results. Vaccine effectiveness wanes over time and can be improved by the administration of booster doses as recommended by CDC. Vaccine effectiveness may be different for new variants of COVID-19. | | | |The bivalent mRNA vaccines introduced in September 2022 target the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as well as the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 spike protein; they have been proven to stimulate higher levels of antibodies against the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to the original monovalent vaccine. Data from CDC show that the bivalent booster dose increases protection of recipients from severe disease and hospitalization compared to vaccinated people who have not received a bivalent booster. | | | |What is the difference between the original mRNA vaccines and the bivalent mRNA vaccines introduced in September 2022? | | | |The original mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna contain only mRNA encoding for the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, meaning they were monovalent. The bivalent vaccines in the United States are made exactly like the original monovalent vaccines, except that half the mRNA in the vaccine encodes for the original strain and half encodes for the spike protein found on the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants circulating in the summer of 2022. The addition of the updated mRNA is intended to boost the production of antibodies that protect more effectively against disease caused by Omicron subvariants. | | | |The process of updating the strain without changing anything else is similar to the seasonal strain changes made for influenza vaccinations each year; FDA does not require manufacturers to repeat the large-scale clinical trials necessary for the original products before authorizing the updated vaccines. Vaccine safety, side effects, and risk of allergic reactions are expected to be unchanged in the bivalent vaccines compared to the monovalent vaccines of the same brand and dose. As with seasonal influenza vaccines, future COVID-19 vaccines may be updated periodically as the circulating viruses evolve. | | | | |Is the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) still available in the United States? | | |No. The last U.S. doses of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine expired May 7, 2023. | | | |What is the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine? | | | |Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted contains the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Matrix-M adjuvant. The saponin-based adjuvant is made from extracts of the bark of the Soapbark tree native to Chile. It is added to enhance the immune response of the vaccine recipient. The spike protein is produced in insect cells. It is authorized for emergency use in people age 12 years or older as a two-dose primary series, with the doses given at least 3 to 8 weeks apart. It is a monovalent vaccine and is not authorized for use as a booster dose except in one circumstance: adults age 18 years or older who have received only a primary series of any COVID-19 vaccine may receive a Novavax monovalent vaccine as a first booster dose if the recommended bivalent mRNA vaccine dose is contraindicated, refused, or unavailable to the recipient. See the current CDC COVID-19 vaccine interim immunization schedule for the most up to date recommendations: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | |How well does the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine work? | | | |The effectiveness of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine against currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 is not precisely known. Clinical trials of this vaccine were conducted against earlier variants no longer in circulation; however, the vaccine showed very good effectiveness against moderate to severe disease during clinical trials. Testing conducted on antibodies in the serum of Novavax vaccine recipients suggests that vaccination provides substantial protection against severe disease and death caused by currently circulating variants, consistent with other available COVID-19 vaccines. | | | |Where can I obtain detailed information about the COVID-19 vaccines? | | | |CDC has developed a \"one-stop\" product-specific webpage for each COVID-19 vaccine with all of the important details that immunization providers need to know. | | | | | | | |In addition to CDC, each company has a detailed EUA Fact Sheet for healthcare providers administering vaccine. The Immunize.org Checklist of Current Versions of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Guidance and Clinic Support Tools, available at |[www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3130.pdf](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3130.pdf), includes links to all fact sheets by age group and product type. | | | | |COVID-19 Vaccines for Children under 12 Years || |[Back to top](#top) | | | | | | |What are the recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination of children younger than 12 years? | | | | All children age 6 months and older should be vaccinated against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination of children in this age group has been demonstrated to be safe and to prevent hospitalization and severe complications of COVID-19 illness. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna bivalent products are authorized for use in children down to 6 months of age. Dosing schedules are complex for children younger than age 6 years: there are differences in dosing schedules by product, age, and past COVID-19 vaccination history. Refer to CDCs interim schedule for details: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | |CDC has also prepared infographics to make it easier to determine exactly what vaccination is due for each patient, based upon the patients age, vaccination history, and immunocompromised status. For most children younger than age 12 years, see the first 3 pages of this CDC infographic: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-most-people.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-most-people.pdf). | | |For children younger than 12 years who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, see the first 3 pages of this CDC infographic: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-immunocompromised.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-immunocompromised.pdf). | | | |My patient turns 12 years old later this month and has never had a COVID-19 vaccination. Should he get the lower-dose bivalent Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech formulation approved for age 11 years now or wait and get the higher dose bivalent products authorized at age 12? | | |Do not wait. This child should receive the dose recommended for his age at the time of the vaccination visit. | | | |For children younger than age 6 who transition from one age group to another during their primary vaccination series, CDC states ( |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#timing-spacing-interchangeability](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#timing-spacing-interchangeability)) that a child who moves to an older age group between vaccine doses should receive the vaccine product and dosage for the older age group for all subsequent doses with two exceptions: | | | | | || ||Children who initiate the Pfizer-BioNTech 3-dose vaccination series at age 4 years and transition to age 5 years during the series must complete the series they start and receive all 3 doses with bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (0.2 mL/3 mcg; maroon cap and label with a maroon border). Children who previously received 1 or 2 doses of monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at age 4 years and transition to age 5 years should receive the remaining dose(s) needed to complete the 3-dose series with bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for ages 6 months4 years (0.2 mL/3 mcg; maroon cap and label). | | || || | | || ||Children who initiate the Moderna vaccination series at age 5 years and transition to age 6 years during the series should receive 2 doses of bivalent Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (0.25 mL/25 mcg; dark blue cap and label with a gray border). Children who previously received 1 dose of monovalent Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine at age 5 years and transition to age 6 years should receive 1 dose of bivalent Moderna vaccine (0.25 mL/25 mcg; dark blue cap and gray border). | | | | |My patient had the first dose of the 3-dose primary series of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at age 4 years and turned 5 before dose two. What should she get now? | | |According to the CDC, children who initiate the Pfizer-BioNTech 3-dose vaccination series at age 4 years and transition to age 5 years during the series must complete the series they start and receive all 3 doses with bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (0.2 mL/3 mcg; maroon cap and label with a maroon border). Children who previously received 1 or 2 doses of monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at age 4 years and transition to age 5 years should receive the remaining dose(s) needed to complete the 3-dose series with bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for ages 6 months4 years (0.2 mL/3 mcg; maroon cap and label). See |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#timing-spacing-interchangeability](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#timing-spacing-interchangeability). | | |My patient had the first dose of the primary series of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at age 5 years and turned 6 before dose two. What should she get now? | | | |Children who initiate the Moderna vaccination series at age 5 years and transition to age 6 years during the series should receive 2 doses of bivalent Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (0.25 mL/25 mcg; dark blue cap and label with a gray border). Children who previously received 1 dose of monovalent Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine at age 5 years and transition to age 6 years should receive 1 dose of bivalent Moderna vaccine (0.25 mL/25 mcg; dark blue cap and gray border). See |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#timing-spacing-interchangeability](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#timing-spacing-interchangeability). | | |What do we know about the safety of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in the youngest children? | | | |Both vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe, with side effects typical of those in older age groups. The most common local reaction in this age group is pain at the injection site; the most common systemic symptom in older children was fatigue and in younger children (6 through 23 months) irritability/crying and sleepiness were most common. Fever may occur after either vaccination. Febrile seizures can occur in infants and young children ages 6 months through 5 years as a result of any condition that causes a fever (most common with high fevers). Febrile seizures are uncommon after vaccination. Febrile seizures were rare after mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in this age group, and CDC continues to monitor for this adverse event following vaccination in infants and young children. | | | |No cases of myocarditis were reported during the clinical trials for either vaccine. To date, post-authorization surveillance has not detected an increased risk for myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in children ages 6 months4 years (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ages 6 months5 years (Moderna). | | | | | |COVID-19 Vaccines for Adolescents and Adults || |[Back to top](#top) | | | | | | |What COVID-19 vaccine options are available for adolescents and adults ages 12 years and older? | | | |The gray cap Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) is authorized for emergency use for recipients age 12 years and older. | | | |Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5, blue cap vial with gray bordered label) is authorized for emergency use for recipients age 6 years and older. | | | |Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine (protein subunit, adjuvanted) is authorized for emergency use as a 2-dose primary series in people 12 years and older and as a first booster dose in people for whom a recommended bivalent mRNA vaccine is contraindicated, refused, or unavailable. | | | |What do we know about the safety and side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in children and young teens in the 12- to 15-year-old age group? | | | |Clinical trial results for the original monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (administered as a two-dose primary series) demonstrated that among vaccine recipients age 1215 years, side effects during the 7 days after vaccination were commonly reported (90.9% of vaccine recipients reported a local reaction and 90.7% reported a systemic reaction). Most reactions were mild to moderate. Pain at the injection site was the most common local reaction. One in 10 reported a side effect that interfered with daily activities. Side effects usually resolved after 12 days. Systemic side effects (e.g., fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain) were more commonly reported after the second dose than after the first dose. No specific safety concerns were identified among adolescent vaccine recipients. | | | |The safety and side effects of the bivalent mRNA vaccine introduced in September 2022 are consistent with the monovalent product. | | | | |May I use Novavax COVID-19 protein subunit vaccine as a booster dose? | | |Yes, but only in limited circumstances. CDC recommends that patients age 18 years or older who have completed any monovalent COVID-19 vaccine primary series, but who have never received a booster dose, may be offered a single Novavax monovalent COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose under one of the following conditions: (1) the recommended bivalent mRNA vaccine is contraindicated, or (2) the patient refuses the recommended bivalent mRNA vaccine dose (or it is unavailable) and would not otherwise be vaccinated. The Novavax monovalent vaccine is not authorized for use as a booster dose in a person who has received one or more monovalent or bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster doses in the past. | | | | | | | | | | | |Are COVID-19 vaccines safe during pregnancy? | | | |Evidence continues to demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination is safe and effective during any stage of pregnancy; the benefits of vaccination clearly outweigh any known or potential risks of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. The currently authorized bivalent COVID-19 vaccines are non-replicating vaccines and cannot cause infection in either the mother or the fetus. No evidence exists of risk to the fetus from vaccinating pregnant people with non-replicating vaccines in general. | | | |Data from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), the v-safe surveillance system, and the v-safe pregnancy registry have not signaled any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or their infants. The vaccine manufacturers are following the pregnancy outcomes of people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. Additional studies in pregnant people are ongoing in order to fully evaluate pregnancy and birth outcomes. | | | |All people who are pregnant are recommended to receive a single bivalent mRNA dose if they have not already received one. | | | | |Are COVID-19 vaccines recommended during pregnancy? | | |Yes. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people who are not up to date, including those who are pregnant or lactating. Pregnant people are at increased risk of severe complications and death from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people of the same age. Those who contract COVID-19 during pregnancy also have almost twice the risk of stillbirth compared to those who do not contract COVID-19 during pregnancy. Studies have shown that antibodies produced after COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy are transferred to the newborn, and COVID-19 vaccination of people who are pregnant reduces the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization in infants younger than 6 months. Pregnant people should receive a bivalent mRNA dose during pregnancy, if one is recommended. | | | |There is no recommendation from CDC for COVID-19 vaccination during every pregnancy; therefore, at this time, a person who is up to date on COVID-19 vaccination and becomes pregnant is not recommended to get an additional dose. | | | |CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) all recommend vaccination, when indicated, of pregnant people at any stage of pregnancy. | | | |For more details about COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, visit CDC's webpage, \"COVID-19 Vaccines while Pregnant or Breastfeeding\": |[www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html). | | |Are COVID-19 vaccines recommended if the recipient is breastfeeding? | | | |Yes. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people who are lactating. | | | |What is the COVID-19 vaccination schedule for moderately or severely immunocompromised people? | | | |Please see pages 4 through 6 of the CDC interim COVID-19 vaccination schedules (pdf) for each vaccine for immunocompromised people in each eligible age group: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | |People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have the option to receive 1 additional dose of a bivalent mRNA vaccine at least 2 months following the last recommended bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. Further additional bivalent dose(s) may be administered, based upon the clinical judgement of the individuals healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose. See CDCs Interim Clinical Considerations for the Use of COVID-19 Vaccines for dosage guidance: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised). | | |Immunocompromised people should be counseled that they may have a reduced immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. They should be advised to continue other recommended infection prevention measures, such as wearing a face mask and avoiding crowds, to limit their risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. | | | |What conditions or treatments are considered to qualify a person as moderately or severely immunocompromised for the purposes of COVID-19 vaccination? | | | |The conditions and treatments that CDC specifies may result in moderate or severe immunocompromise include but are not limited to: | | | | | | || ||Active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies || || | | || ||Receipt transplant and therapy || | | || ||Receipt of CAR-T-cell or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppression therapy) | | || || | | || ||Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) | | || || | | || ||Advanced or untreated HIV infection | | || || | | || ||Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (in other words, 20 mg or more of prednisone or equivalent per day), alkylating agents, antimetabolites, transplant-related immunosuppressive drugs, cancer tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, and other biologic agents that are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory | | | |Additional factors to consider in assessing the general level of immune competence in a patient include disease severity, duration, clinical stability, complications, comorbidities, and any potentially immune-suppressing treatment. A patients clinical care team is in the best position to evaluate the degree of immunocompromise and timing of vaccination. | | | |See CDC's interim clinical considerations for this population: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised). | | |I have an oncology patient, age 27, who was up to date on COVID-19 vaccination but is now in need of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Will she require revaccination after HCT? | | | |Yes. See all information about vaccination of immunocompromised people, including revaccination considerations after HCT and for those on B-cell depleting therapies, at |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised). This is the most current statement from CDC on COVID-19 vaccination after HCT: | | |Recipients of HCT or CAR-T-cell therapy who received 1 or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine prior to or during treatment should be revaccinated. Revaccination should start at least 3 months (12 weeks) after transplant or CAR-T-cell therapy and should follow the currently recommended schedule for immunocompromised people who are unvaccinated. | | | |A patients clinical team is best positioned to determine the degree of immune compromise, need for revaccination, and appropriate timing of revaccination. | | | |My patient receives periodic infusions of rituximab for immunosuppressive treatment of an immune system disorder. Should we try to coordinate the timing of his COVID-19 vaccinations around his infusion schedule? | | | |According to CDCs interim clinical considerations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines, whenever possible, COVID-19 vaccines should be administered at least 2 weeks before initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapies. For patients who receive B-cell-depleting therapies on a continuing basis, COVID-19 vaccines should be administered approximately 4 weeks before the next scheduled therapy. | | | |CDC also notes that timing of COVID-19 vaccination should take into consideration current or planned immunosuppressive therapies, optimization of both the patients medical condition and response to vaccination, and individual benefits and risks. Review the CDCs considerations for COVID-19 vaccination of those on immunosuppressive therapies here: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#considerations-timing-COVID-19-vaccination-immunosuppressive-therapies](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#considerations-timing-COVID-19-vaccination-immunosuppressive-therapies). | | | |What proof do I need for a patient who says he is moderately or severely immunocompromised? | | |CDC states that no additional medical documentation is required before vaccination. People may simply affirm that they are moderately or severely immunocompromised and receive COVID-19 vaccine doses wherever vaccines are offered. Vaccinators should not deny COVID-19 vaccination to a person due to lack of documentation. | | | |Are bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine brands for immunocompromised people who require multiple doses interchangeable? | | | |For immunocompromised people age 6 years and older, the brands are interchangeable. However, the brands are not interchangeable in younger children under certain conditions. CDC provides the specific conditions when vaccines are or are not interchangeable in children younger than age 6 years at this site: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#Interchangeability](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#Interchangeability). | | |You can also find the current schedule for people who are immunocompromised, including interchangeability options, at |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#table-02](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#table-02). | | |My patient takes high dose steroids and received a single dose of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) in 2021. He has had no doses since. He fits the definition for moderate or severe immunocompromise. What do I do now? | | | |The following guidance from CDC is for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised ages 18 years and older who previously received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine primary dose: | | | |People who have not received a bivalent mRNA vaccine dose should receive 1 bivalent mRNA vaccine dose at least 4 weeks after their last monovalent dose. People have the option to receive 1 additional bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose at least 2 months after the recommended bivalent COVID-19 vaccine dose. Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose. | | | |People who have received 1 bivalent mRNA vaccine dose have the option to receive 1 additional bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose at least 2 months after the previously received bivalent COVID-19 vaccine dose. Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose. | | | |For all vaccination schedule options, refer to the printable interim COVID-19 vaccination schedules document from CDC: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | |My patient, age 45, is immunocompromised and is recommended to receive a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, but he has only ever received two monovalent mRNA doses more than a year ago. What do I do now? | | | |The patient should receive a bivalent mRNA dose now. Advise the patient that he has an option to receive an additional bivalent mRNA dose at least 2 months following the first bivalent dose. | | | |To evaluate an immunocompromised individuals COVID-19 vaccine needs based upon the persons age and COVID-19 vaccination history, use this infographic from CDC: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-immunocompromised.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-immunocompromised.pdf). | | |For all vaccination schedule options, refer to the printable interim COVID-19 vaccination schedules document from CDC: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | |My patient is medically complex and severely immunocompromised and our clinical team has concerns that the recommended schedule of COVID-19 vaccination for immunocompromised patients may not be adequate. Does CDC permit any latitude in the COVID-19 vaccination schedule for such patients? | | | |Yes. CDC states that people ages 6 months and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have the option to receive 1 additional dose of COVID-19 Vaccine at least 2 months following the last recommended bivalent COVID-19 vaccine dose. Further additional dose(s) may be administered, informed by the clinical judgement of the healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose. For children age 6 months through 4 years, all doses should be of the same brand. | | | |To evaluate an immunocompromised individuals COVID-19 vaccine needs based upon the persons age and COVID-19 vaccination history, use this infographic from CDC: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-immunocompromised.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-immunocompromised.pdf). | | |For additional details about schedule and dosing, see CDCs COVID-19 vaccination guidance for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised). | | | | | | | | | | |How are COVID-19 vaccines administered? | | | |All COVID-19 vaccines are administered intramuscularly. Preparation details and dose volume vary by product. | | | |Has CDC provided clinical guidance on what to do if an error occurs while administering COVID-19 vaccinations? | | | |Yes. CDC has published an appendix to its interim clinical considerations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines to address a wide range of errors in vaccine administration. It includes a detailed table outlining actions to take after an error has occurred: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-c](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-c). | | |Categories of errors covered in the CDC table include: | | | | | | || ||Site/route | | || || | || || | | | | intervals | | || || | | || ||Interchanging product types when not | | || || | | || ||Incorrect diluent | || ||Use of diluent when not indicated | | | |Ask the Experts refers our readers to this CDC table for the most current and comprehensive guidance on COVID-19 vaccine administration errors and how to manage them. For all vaccine administration errors, take the following steps: inform the patient of the error, report the error to VAERS ( |[https://vaers.hhs.gov](https://vaers.hhs.gov)) unless CDCs guidance states that the error does not need to be reported, evaluate why the error occurred, and implement strategies to prevent future errors. | | |A dose of COVID-19 vaccine was administered subcutaneously instead of by the intramuscular route. Does the dose need to be repeated? | | | |No. CDC does not recommend repeating the dose of any COVID-19 vaccine in circumstances where the dose is administered in an incorrect route or an incorrect site (i.e., not in the deltoid or anterolateral thigh). In the case of a subcutaneous injection, the patient should be advised of the possibility of self-limited local or systemic side effects. | | | | | | | | | | | |Where can I find the latest information on schedules of COVID-19 vaccines? | | | |The recommended schedules for COVID-19 vaccines, beginning at age 6 months, vary by brand, age group, and by the presence of moderate or severe immunocompromise. Please refer to CDC's Interim COVID-19 Immunization Schedule for Persons 6 Months of Age and Older |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | |Always check the date at the bottom of the document to be sure you are using the most current version; there may be a short delay between the public announcement of a change in recommendations and the release of updated CDC guidance documents. You may also verify whether you are using current documents by checking Immunize.orgs regularly updated Checklist of Current Versions of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Guidance and Clinic Support Tools: |[www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3130.pdf](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3130.pdf). | | |If a person has fallen far behind with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, do we ever need to re-start the vaccine series? | | | |No. Simply administer the next dose that is currently recommended. To determine what is needed now based upon a persons vaccination history, age, and immunocompromised status, refer to the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Infographic (for most people): |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-most-people.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-most-people.pdf), or the CDC COVID-19 (for immunocompromised people): [www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-immunocompromised.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-immunocompromised.pdf). | | |My immunocompromised patient is unvaccinated against COVID-19 and has agreed to receive a primary series. Since a dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be given up to 4 days before the recommended interval because of the 4-day grace period, should we offer appointments up to 4 days before the recommended interval to get him vaccinated faster? | | | |No. People should not be routinely scheduled to receive a dose earlier than recommended. Schedulers should offer appointments beginning on the date of the recommended interval or later. CDC guidance allows for doses to be given up to 4 days before the recommended interval in order to avoid missed vaccination opportunities when a recipient unexpectedly arrives early and might not return on schedule. | | | |If a 3-year-old patient inadvertently received a different brand of bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as a second dose, does it need to be repeated? | | | |In this specific situation, CDC states that recipients ages 6 months4 years who received 1 Moderna and 1 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose for the first 2 doses of a 3-dose series should receive a third dose of either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least 8 weeks after the second dose. | | | |If Moderna is used, administer 0.25 mL/25 mcg (dark blue cap and gray label border). | | | |If Pfizer-BioNTech is used, administer 0.2 mL/3 mcg (maroon cap and label border). | | | |For all questions of brand interchangeability, please review CDCs interim recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine administration errors and deviations: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-c](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-c). | | |If a patient received a dose of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, but cannot locate a second dose of Novavax vaccine, what should we do? The patient is not immunocompromised. | | | |CDC recommends that the patient receive a single dose of bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. See page 3 of CDCs interim COVID-19 vaccination schedule: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | |We have a patient who was vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine in another country. What do we do? | | | |CDC has published detailed recommendations based upon the individuals vaccination history and whether products received in another country are listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO-EUL) or authorized for use by the FDA. | | | |CDC has outlined each vaccination option on its website: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-a](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-a). | | |A list of the vaccines that have already received WHO-EUL status is available here: |[https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/vaccinescovid-19-vaccine-eul-issued](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/vaccinescovid-19-vaccine-eul-issued). | | |My 42-year-old patient was vaccinated in a clinical trial with a vaccine that is not authorized for use by the FDA. How should we evaluate his need for vaccination now? | | | |This patient, like other people age 6 years and older, is considered up to date after receiving a single dose of bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. | | | |For further details, see CDCs guidance: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-b](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-b). | | |What should be done if a patient scheduled for vaccination is exposed to COVID-19 or is isolated for suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection? | | | |An asymptomatic person who is scheduled for COVID-19 vaccination and is exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus may be vaccinated but should wear a high-quality mask or respirator (e.g., N95) to prevent exposure of others at the vaccination site. If symptoms develop before the vaccination appointment, the person should isolate immediately, get tested, and stay home until results are known. If the results are positive, vaccination should be deferred until at least the end of the isolation period to avoid exposing vaccinators to the virus. | | | |People who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying a primary series dose or their bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster dose by 3 months from symptom onset or positive test (if infection was asymptomatic). According to CDC, increasing the time between infection and vaccination may result in an improved immune response to vaccination. At this time, there is evidence of a low risk of reinfection in the weeks following infection. A recipient's individual risks for severe disease and current COVID-19 conditions in the community should be taken into account when deciding whether to delay vaccination up to 3 months after infection. | | | |Can COVID-19 vaccine recipients be given other vaccines at the same visit? | | | |Yes, COVID-19 vaccines and other routine vaccines may be administered without regard to timing. Extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that the immune response and side effects following vaccination are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously and when vaccines are administered alone. | | | |There are additional considerations for coadministration of mpox and COVID-19 vaccinations. There is no required minimum interval between receiving a dose of any COVID-19 vaccine and an orthopoxvirus vaccine, either Jynneos or ACAM2000 vaccine (such as for mpox prevention), regardless of which vaccine is administered first. Because of the risk of myocarditis following both ACAM2000 orthopoxvirus vaccine and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, Jynneos should be prioritized over ACAM2000 when vaccinations against mpox and COVID-19 are coadministered. In fact, a person recommended to receive both COVID-19 and mpox vaccines might consider waiting 4 weeks between them, but only if the person not at increased risk of either mpox or severe COVID-19 illness. | | | |My patient is age 70 and due for a second dose of recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix, GSK). However, the patient also is eligible for, and wants to receive, an optional second bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. What should we advise our patient about scheduling the second Shingrix dose? | | | |Your patient may choose to receive the vaccines at the same visit or separately, without regard to the timing interval. In general, when deciding whether to coadminister other vaccines with COVID-19 vaccine, you should consider whether the patient is behind or at risk of becoming behind on recommended vaccines, their risk of vaccine-preventable disease (e.g., during an outbreak or occupational exposures), and the reactogenicity profile of the vaccines. | | | |When multiple vaccines are administered at a single visit, administer each injection in a different injection site. For adolescents and adults, the deltoid muscle may be used for more than one injection, though injection sites should be at least one inch apart. It is generally preferable to administer reactogenic vaccines such as Shingrix and COVID-19 vaccine in different arms, if possible. If the patient prefers both injections in the same deltoid, that is also acceptable. | | | |Immunize.org has developed a one-page guide to administering multiple intramuscular vaccinations to an adult at one visit: |[www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2030.pdf](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2030.pdf). | | |How does the use of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma to treat or prevent COVID-19 affect the scheduling of COVID-19 vaccination? | | | |The timing of CDC-recommended vaccination is unaffected by the receipt of COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma. | | | | | | | | | | | |Please describe the contraindications for COVID-19 vaccination. | | | |We refer our readers to CDCs updated set of contraindications and precautions to vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines, located in table 3 of its interim clinical considerations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#contraindications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#contraindications). | | |What are the precautions to COVID-19 vaccination? | | | |We refer our readers to CDCs updated set of contraindications and precautions to COVID-19 vaccination, located in table 3 of its interim clinical considerations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#contraindications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#contraindications). | | |Can people who are immunocompromised or who have autoimmune disease be vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines? | | | |Yes, they should be vaccinated as long as they do not have a contraindication to vaccination. Antibody testing is not recommended to assess for immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following COVID-19 vaccination. | | | |Recipients should be counseled about the unknown and variable effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised populations and the potential for reduced immune responses. They should maintain other practices, such as wearing a mask in public and avoiding crowds, to reduce their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. | | | |The current immunization schedules for each available vaccine product for people age 6 months or older with moderate or severe immunocompromise are listed on pages 4 through 6 of CDCs Interim COVID-19 Immunization Schedule for Persons 6 Months of Age and Older: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID-19-immunization-schedule-ages-6months-older.pdf). | | |CDC has also developed an infographic for use with patients who have moderate to severe immunocompromise when determining what COVID-19 vaccine is due based on the individuals age and past COVID-19 vaccination history: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-immunocompromised.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/COVID19-vaccination-recommendations-immunocompromised.pdf). | | |CDC provides detailed considerations for vaccination of people with moderate or severe immunocompromise here: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#immunocompromised). | | |Are there any common types of allergies that are neither contraindications nor precautions to vaccination? | | | |Allergic reactions (including severe allergic reactions) not related to vaccines (COVID-19 or other vaccines) or injectable therapies, such as allergic reactions related to food, pet, venom, or environmental allergies, or allergies to oral medications (including the oral equivalents of injectable medications), are not a contraindication or precaution to COVID-19 vaccination. The vial stoppers of COVID-19 vaccines are not made with natural rubber latex, and there is no contraindication or precaution to vaccination for people with a latex allergy. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain eggs, gelatin, or metals. | | | |A self-limited, delayed-onset local reaction around the injection site (\"COVID arm\") has been reported by some mRNA vaccine recipients several days after vaccination. This type of reaction is not a precaution or contraindication to future doses of the same vaccine. | | | | |A vaccine recipient reported experiencing a red, itchy, swollen patch of skin that developed several days after vaccination around the injection site of her first COVID-19 vaccine dose. It resolved after a few days. Is this a contraindication? Should this alter our plans for dose two? | | |This condition is not rare and is also known as \"COVID arm\". She should receive dose two as recommended. Individuals with only a delayed-onset local reaction (e.g., redness, induration, itching) around the injection site area after the first vaccine dose do not have a contraindication or precaution to the second dose. | | | |These delayed-onset local reactions are sometimes quite large but are self-limited. It is not known whether individuals who experienced a delayed-onset injection site reaction after the first dose will experience a similar reaction after the second dose. However, these reactions are not believed to represent an increased risk for anaphylaxis after a subsequent dose. Thus, individuals with such delayed injection site reactions after the first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose should receive the second dose using the same vaccine product as the first dose and at the recommended interval, preferably in the opposite arm. | | | |Patients who experience \"COVID arm\" may take an antihistamine if it is itchy or a pain medication such as acetaminophen or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) if it is painful. | | | |Patients concerned about the risk of allergic reaction or side effects following COVID-19 vaccination are asking if they should take acetaminophen, aspirin, and/or antihistamines before receiving COVID-19 vaccination. What does CDC advise? | | | |Medications to reduce fever and pain (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken to treat post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine administration of such medications before vaccination is not recommended because information on the potential impact of such use on COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time. | | | |Administration of antihistamines before COVID-19 vaccination to prevent allergic reactions is not recommended. Antihistamines do not prevent anaphylaxis, and their use might mask cutaneous symptoms, which could delay diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis. | | | |Is COVID-19 vaccination contraindicated in a patient who has had immune-mediated thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)? | | | |The COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States (mRNA vaccines and the Novavax protein subunit vaccine) are not contraindicated in patients with a history of TTS. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine associated with immune-mediated TTS in the United States is no longer available. | | | |Is there a precaution or contraindication against vaccination of children or adults who have recovered from COVID-19 Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C or MIS-A)? | | | |According to CDC, MIS-C and MIS-A both include a dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in people who have had MIS-C or MIS-A. The risk of recurrence of a dysregulated immune response following reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 or an MIS-like illness following COVID-19 vaccination is unknown. CDC continues to update its clinical considerations for vaccination of children or adults who have experienced MIS-C or MIS-A. Visit this link for the most current clinical considerations for vaccination of children and adults who have experienced this syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection: |[ www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa). | | |My patient had an episode of myocarditis 10 years ago. Is a history of myocarditis a contraindication or precaution to vaccination with an mRNA or Novavax vaccine? | | | |CDC guidance is that people who have a history of completely resolved myocarditis or pericarditis unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination (e.g., due to SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses) may receive any age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine that is FDA-approved or FDA-authorized. Complete resolution includes resolution of symptoms attributed to myocarditis or pericarditis, as well as no evidence of ongoing heart inflammation or sequelae as determined by the persons clinical team. | | | |History of myocarditis or pericarditis after a dose of an mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine or Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine is a precaution to vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine, and subsequent doses should generally be avoided. For people who have a history of myocarditis associated with MIS-C or MIS-A, see CDCs interim clinical considerations concerning COVID-19 vaccination and MIS-C and MIS-A: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#covid19-vaccination-misc-misa). | | |Complete and current clinical considerations for COVID-19 vaccination of patients with a history of myocarditis are available from CDC here: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#myocarditis-pericarditis](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#myocarditis-pericarditis). | | |For additional information about myocarditis and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, visit |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html). | | |My patient has a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Is that a contraindication or precaution to vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine? | | | |People with a history of GBS can receive any currently recommended COVID-19 vaccine. No increased risk of GBS has been associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. A small increased risk of GBS was associated with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, but that product is no longer available in the United States. | | | | | | | | | | | |What common side effects are expected after vaccination with mRNA vaccines? | | | |Recipients of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines often experience local (e.g., pain, swelling, redness at the injection site, localized swollen lymph nodes in the armpit of the vaccinated arm) or systemic (e.g., fever, fatigue, headache, chills, body and joint aches) post-vaccination symptoms. Depending on vaccine product (Pfizer-BioNTech vs. Moderna), age group, and vaccine dose, approximately 8091% of vaccinated people develop at least one local symptom and 5591% develop at least one systemic symptom following vaccination. | | | |Most systemic post-vaccination symptoms are mild to moderate in severity, occur within the first three days of vaccination, and resolve within 13 days of onset. | | | |Among children ages 6 months through 4 years (Pfizer-BioNTech) or 6 months through 5 years (Moderna), pain or tenderness at the injection site was the most frequent local reaction. The most common systemic symptom in older children was fatigue; in younger children (ages 6 through 23 months), irritability/crying and drowsiness/sleepiness were most common. Most systemic symptoms were mild to moderate in severity, typically began 1 to 2 days after vaccination, and resolved after 1 to 2 days. | | | |What common side effects are expected after vaccination with Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine? | | | |In clinical trials of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, pain or tenderness at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction among vaccine recipients; redness and swelling were reported less frequently. Fatigue, headache, and muscle pain were the most commonly reported systemic reactions. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within 1 to 3 days. Overall, symptoms were more frequent in people ages 18 through 64 years compared to people ages 65 years and older and more frequent after dose 2 than dose 1. || | |Have any COVID-19 vaccines been associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)? | | | |Vaccine safety monitoring in the United States indicated an increased risk of GBS within 42 days of vaccination with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, with the highest risk among people ages 40 through 64. Most reports were in males. Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is no longer available in the United States. | | | |Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccines or Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine may be given to individuals with a history of GBS. | | | | |Can COVID-19 vaccination lead to fertility problems? | | |There is no evidence that any of the COVID-19 vaccines affect current or future fertility. | | | |Tell me about mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. | | | |A rare risk for myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and/or pericarditis (inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart) has been observed following receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine. Despite this observation, the benefits of vaccination clearly outweigh the risks in all age groups. | | | |Among mRNA vaccine recipients, these rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have occurred most frequently in adolescent and young adult males within the first week after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine primary series. Myocarditis is even more rare in children younger than age 12 years after COVID-19 vaccination. This risk appears related to age, biological sex, and the short (3- to 4-week) interval between primary series doses. Extending the interval to 8 weeks for children younger than age 6 years who are routinely recommended to receive a primary series may reduce the risk of myocarditis following the second dose. | | | |Most patients with myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination have been hospitalized for short periods, with most completely recovering from their acute symptoms. CDC is assessing long-term outcomes in people with myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. | | | |People receiving mRNA vaccines, especially males age 12 through 39, should be counseled about the risk of myocarditis or pericarditis and advised to seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of a fast, fluttering, or pounding heartbeat. | | | |Cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were identified in clinical trials of Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine and have also been reported during post-authorization use outside the United States. These findings suggest that an increased risk for these conditions may be present after receiving Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. | | | |Current COVID-19 vaccination recommendations are for a single dose of bivalent mRNA vaccine for most people age 6 years and older, even if the individual is previously unvaccinated. Elimination of the second dose in the primary series for most unvaccinated people age 6 years and older is expected to reduce the incidence of post-vaccination myocarditis. | | | |CDC's complete interim clinical considerations for COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis or pericarditis are available here: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#myocarditis-pericarditis](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#myocarditis-pericarditis). | | |CDC also has published additional clinical considerations for the evaluation and care of patients with myocarditis or pericarditis following mRNA vaccination: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html). | | |How should patients with allergies presenting for COVID-19 vaccination be evaluated? | | | |Serious allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, in the minutes following vaccination are rare but are possible with any vaccine. Every vaccination site should have staff available who are trained and equipped to recognize and respond to signs of anaphylaxis in a vaccine recipient. See this CDC website for additional information about preparing for the management of anaphylaxis: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html?anaphylaxis-management.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html?anaphylaxis-management.html). | | |Anaphylaxis following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is reported at a rate of approximately 2 to 5 cases per million doses administered. | | | |An immediate severe allergic reaction to any component or previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a contraindication to vaccination with both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines (all formulations); however, use of the Novavax vaccine may not be contraindicated; see the CDCs COVID-19 interim clinical considerations section on contraindications and precautions for details: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#contraindications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#contraindications). | | |This CDC chart of vaccine components is designed to assist the triage of patients with various health conditions or allergies: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-d](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-d). | | |How long should patients be observed for signs of an immediate allergic reaction following vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine? | | | |In accordance with general best practices for vaccination, all people should be observed for at least 15 minutes after vaccination for signs of an immediate allergic reaction. | | | | If you vaccinate a person who has a precaution to COVID-19 vaccination, you should consider a 30-minute observation period following vaccination. For complete CDC guidance on the triage and management of individuals with a history of allergies or allergic reactions, please consult this CDC table: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-d](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-d). | | |Where can I find the latest information on allergic reactions and COVID-19 vaccines? | | | |Visit this CDC website for the latest information: |[www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html). | | |For information about how to triage and manage people with a history of allergy who present for COVID-19 vaccination, see CDC's triage guidance: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-d](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-d). | | |I have heard that the FDA has specific reporting requirements for healthcare providers who administer COVID-19 vaccines under EUA. What are they? | | | |Adverse events that occur in a recipient following COVID-19 vaccination should be reported to VAERS. Vaccination providers are required by FDA and the provider agreement for the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program to report the following that occur after COVID-19 vaccination: | | | | | | || ||Vaccine administration errors whether or not associated with an adverse event | | || || | | || ||Serious adverse events, irrespective of attribution to vaccination | | || || | | || ||Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults and children | | || || | | || ||Cases of myocarditis after or a | || || | | || ||Cases of pericarditis after or a | | || || | | || ||Cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death | | | |Reporting is encouraged for any other clinically significant adverse event, even if it is uncertain whether the vaccine caused the event. Information on how to submit a report to VAERS is available at |[https://vaers.hhs.gov](https://vaers.hhs.gov) or by calling 1-800-822-7967. | | |How is the safety of COVID-19 vaccines being monitored? | | | |Multiple national surveillance systems are being used to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in different ways. Please see this CDC website for additional information on each system: |[www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html). | | |What is v-safe? | | | |CDCs v-safe program for COVID-19 vaccination was a smartphone-based tool that used text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after a COVID-19 vaccination. Participation was voluntary. It provided timely information about COVID-19 vaccine safety. The program closed enrollment on May 19, 2023. | | | |Is compensation for an injury resulting from an EUA COVID-19 vaccine available through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)? | | | |No. The COVID-19 vaccines are not currently part of the VICP, although a transition to the VICP is anticipated in the future. The COVID-19 vaccines are currently part of a similar program called the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). For more information, visit this web page: |[www.hrsa.gov/cicp](https://www.hrsa.gov/cicp). | | | | | | | | | | |Where can I find details about the storage and handling of COVID-19 vaccines? | | | |You may find guidance on the storage and handling of each COVID-19 vaccine in the CDCs Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit addendum on COVID-19 and mpox vaccines: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf). | | |CDC has produced a printable quick reference guide summarizing the storage and handling requirements for each authorized COVID-19 vaccine. The storage and handling requirements of bivalent products are the same as monovalent products of the same brand and formulation. Storage and handling requirements are unchanged by the addition of a new strain. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Immunize.org has assembled links to key COVID-19 vaccine storage and handling resources in the Checklist of Current Versions of U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Guidance and Clinic Support Tools: |[www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3130.pdf](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3130.pdf). | | |Under what conditions may we transport COVID-19 vaccines? Is transport of a partial vial or predrawn syringe ever permissible? | | | |Although routine transportation of vaccines to different facilities is not generally recommended, there are times when this is necessary. CDC recommends transporting COVID-19 vaccine in vials and always with a continuous temperature monitoring device to ensure adherence to authorized storage times and temperatures. | | | |Details are provided in the CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit addendum on COVID-19 and mpox vaccines: |[www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf). | | |There may be instances when the only option is to transport vaccine in a predrawn syringe. CDC refers to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) guidance for transporting predrawn vaccine in syringes in the USP COVID-19 Vaccine Toolkit: Operational Considerations for Healthcare Practitioners. The complete document provides detailed guidance on COVID-19 vaccine transport and is available for download at no charge from this site: |[www.usp.org/covid-19/vaccine-handling-toolkit](https://www.usp.org/covid-19/vaccine-handling-toolkit). | "}
