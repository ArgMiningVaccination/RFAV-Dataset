What Do Cancer Patients Care About Most? 1To attract patients in this fiercely competitive landscape, you must invest your limited resources in the right services\u2014ones that will attract patients and improve their experience. To help you make the right decisions, we asked more than 600 cancer patients diagnosed within the last five years about their preferences and priorities.2 Oncology RoundtableSurvey Methodology Most patient surveys allow respondents to rate all aspects of their care as \"important,\" making it impossible to tell which aspects patients really value the most. For our Cancer Patient Experience Survey, we took a very different approach. We asked patients to make trade-offs among different attributes of care\u2014a technique called \"MaxDiff\" that provides insight into the relative importance of each attribute. We analyzed two key questions: When deciding where to go for cancer care, which factor is most important to you and which is least important to you? Respondents were shown a list of 5 features and asked to indicate the most important and least important. They answered this question 12 times, but each time they chose from a slightly different list of features. Thinking about your most recent experience, which service provided by a cancer center would have been the most valuable to you and which service would have been the least valuable to you? Respondents were shown a list of 5 services and asked to select the most valuable and least valuable. They answered this question 14 times, but each time they chose from a slightly different list of services. By comparing patients' preferences among different attributes of care, we generated \"utility scores\" that reflect the relative importance of each attribute. For example, our survey revealed that patients care three times more about whether a cancer center is in-network for their insurance (a 12.0 utility score) than about the convenience of its location (a 4.2 utility score).1 2What Do Cancer Patients Care About Most? 310 Insights from the Cancer Patient Experience Survey 01 Clinical excellence truly does matter most. 02 Convenience is king. 03 Cancer patients aren't so deferential anymore. 04 Cost matters more than you think. 05 \"Patient researchers\" are a growing opportunity. 06 Age isn't just a number: younger patients really are different. 07 Breast cancer patients have higher expectations. 08 Newly diagnosed patients have unique preferences. 09 Priorities shift as patients move across the continuum of care. 10 Everything matters to someone.4 Oncology RoundtableClinical excellence truly does matter most. 01 Above all else, cancer patients demand world-class clinical care. Forty-three percent of patients say that \"a physician who specializes in my particular cancer\" is the most important factor guiding their decision about where to seek treatment. Other clinical factors\u2014technology and treatment options, as well as clinical quality\u2014are also among patients' top concerns. But that doesn't mean patients ignore other attributes of care. Less than 5% of respondents ranked \"customer service\" within their top five most important features\u2014but only because excellent customer service has become a baseline expectation. It is necessary but not sufficient to attract patients. When Deciding Where to Go for Care, Which Feature Is Most and Least Important? Mean Utility Score for Cancer Program Features n=503 Doctor who specializes in my particular cancer 16.6 Technology and treatment options 14.2 Clinical quality 12.8 In-network for my insurance 12.0 Recommendation from my doctor 9.4 Accreditation 6.1 Patient support services 5.2 Cost 4.6 Location 4.2 Availability of appointments 3.4 Ranking 3.1 Facility and amenities 2.8 Customer service 2.3 Availability of clinical trials 2.1 Recommendation from my family and friends 1.1What Do Cancer Patients Care About Most? 5Convenience is king. 02 When Deciding Where to Go for Care, Which Services Are Most and Least Important? Mean Utility Score for Cancer Program Services n=577Cancer patients are under enough strain managing the physical and emotional toll of their disease. They don't want to deal with traveling between far-flung facilities or coordinating complex details of their care. In fact, the four services that cancer patients care about most are all related to convenience and coordination , and 37% of respondents ranked \"all of my care takes place in one building\" as the most valuable feature overall. These factors have a tremendous impact on patients' experience and satisfaction\u2014and many map directly to questions on CAHPS for Cancer Care, a survey that will likely impact providers' payment in the future. All of my care takes place in one building 11.3 Specialized symptom management 10.1 One point of contact to help me understand my care 9.3 Multidisciplinary care clinics 8.8 Nurse phone line for help with symptoms 6.6 Online portal to view test results, contact care team 6.5 Financial counseling 5.6 Survivor support services after finishing treatment 5.1 Patient education services 5.0 Help scheduling and coordinating my appointments 4.9 Extended hours of operation 4.2 Social and mental health services during treatment 3.9 Complementary and alternative medicine 3.9 Support services for my family 3.6 Parking that is convenient and affordable 2.2 Free or discounted transportation 2.1 Religious and spiritual services 2.0 Help with nutrition 1.9Access to genetic testing and counseling 3.06 Oncology RoundtableThese results confirm what many health care executives have long-suspected: co-location of services can help cancer programs stand out in the marketplace. Of course, not every program can afford to build a new facility that houses all cancer-related services. But every program should try to lessen the burden of traveling between its service locations (such as laboratories, imaging facilities, and clinics) through better wayfinding, wheelchair, and parking services. What Do Cancer Patients Care About Most? 7Although most cancer patients defer to their referring physicians when choosing a provider or treatment, a new type of cancer care consumer is emerging\u2014one who is more active in researching providers, more likely to challenge their recommendations, and more interested in having a seat at the decision-making table. Although cancer patients are largely considered the most deferential patient population, we found evidence of a changing mind-set: 1. These days, patients don't rely solely on their physician's recommendation. In fact, \"recommendation from my doctor\" was the fifth-ranked factor influencing patients' decisions about where to go for care. Almost five times as many respondents selected \"cancer center is in-network for my insurance\" as their most important factor. 2. Patients now research cancer providers online. Thirty-eight percent of survey respondents indicated that they had read provider reviews online, and 28% looked at quality performance websites. 3. Younger patients are more willing to change cancer providers during treatment. Almost 8% of respondents switched cancer programs because they were dissatisfied with their care. Of those \"switchers,\" 72% were under 55 years old. 4. Patients want to play an active role in their health care decisions. Many \"switchers\" cited dissatisfaction with a \"doctor knows best\" mind-set as a reason for changing providers. As one patient told us, \"I was treated well, but I was only offered one option for treatment, and I wanted more options .\" 5. The next generation of cancer patients has higher expectations for care. Patients aged 18-54 score non-clinical features\u2014such as customer service, patient support services, and facility and amenities\u2014higher than older patients do. Throughout their care, younger patients tend to especially value non-treatment-related services, such as survivorship financial counseling, and complementary and alternative medicine.Cancer patients aren't so deferential anymore.038 Oncology RoundtableEven as the public has grown increasingly concerned about the cost of health care, many hospital administrators remain skeptical that patients really worry about money when they're battling a life-threatening disease such as cancer. But our research reveals that, in fact, many cancer patients consider cost a decisive factor in their treatment decisions. Patients cited \"cancer center is in-network for my insurance\" as the fourth-most-important feature in selecting a provider. In fact, more than 24% of respondents chose this as the single most important factor in their decision. And for respondents ages 55-64, in-network coverage was just as important as clinical quality. Patients also want help managing their costs during treatment. Nearly 30% of respondents ranked \"financial counseling\" as one of the five services they value most in a cancer program.

But what are patients in each age group seeking in a cancer care provider? And which services do they value most? Our survey reveals that younger patients (ages 18-54) have very different priorities and preferences than patients 55 and over.

And because breast tends to be the highest volume tumor site, you must find ways to appeal to these patients\u2014both as they choose their cancer providers and as they undergo treatment. In our survey, breast cancer patients placed importance on a wider range of features than other patients when deciding where to seek care. In other words, breast cancer patients are more likely to indicate that every feature is important to them.

They are far more likely to change cancer centers if dissatisfied with their care. Patients Who Switched Cancer Centers Percentage of Respondents by Tumor Type diagnosed with cancer, they feel scared and overwhelmed\u2014and also driven to find a top-notch provider. This powerful mix of fear and fervor leads newly diagnosed patients to express unique preferences.

So it's no surprise that the type of treatment patients receive greatly affects their priorities\u2014both when they're choosing a provider and during their care.

The truth is that every service matters to at least some of your patients. The key is to determine what matters most to your specific patient population. For example, even though \"help with nutrition\" scored last in the survey, many cancer programs have discovered high demand among their patients for nutrition counseling. It's critical to gather feedback directly from your patient population so you don't miss any opportunity to improve care. Of course, you probably can't provide every service that patients value. Rather, you should seek opportunities to partner with other providers, community groups, or national organizations to expand your portfolio of offerings. In this way, you can connect your patients to comprehensive services\u2014including support groups, education resources, and nutrition programs\u2014in a cost- and resource-effective manner.Mean and Maximum Utility Scores for Cancer Program Services n=577 All of my care takes place in one building 11.3 20.3 Specialized symptom management 18.5 10.1 One point of contact to help me understand my care 17.8 9.3 Multidisciplinary care clinics 18.3 8.8 Nurse phone line for help with symptoms 15.9 6.6 Online portal to view test results, contact care team 17.4 6.5 Financial counseling 18.5 5.6 Survivor support services after finishing treatment 18.2 5.1 Patient education services 15.2 5.0 Extended hours of operation 16.9 4.2 Social and mental health services during treatment 14.4 3.9 Complementary and alternative medicine 18.1 3.9 Support services for my family 15.9 3.6 Access to genetic testing and counseling 16.7 3.0 Parking that is convenient and affordable 18.5 2.2 Free or discounted transportation 17.7 2.1 Religious and spiritual services 17.3 2.0Help scheduling and coordinating my appointments 16.8 4.9 Help with nutrition 15.3 1.9Everything matters to someone.1018 Oncology RoundtableWhat Do Cancer Patients Care About Most? 19Related Resources Oncology Roundtable members have access to additional resources to better understand the priorities and preferences of their patients: Gathering Actionable Feedback from Cancer Patients and Families: Use our recent study to uncover how your cancer program cancer program can better meet the needs of your patient population by gathering actionable patient data and broadening your understanding of the patient experience.
