Naturopathic doctors identify the underlying cause of a condition and combine the best of conventional medicine and alternative therapies to help achieve optimal health. By focusing the patient toward positive lifestyle changes, naturopathic doctors are the foremost experts in preventative medicine. Naturopathic medicine is also on the forefront of treating chronic diseases including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as well as non-narcotic pain management. When you become a naturopathic doctor, you will be joining a respected and financially rewarding profession helping to solve significant medical challenges and improve the lives of your patients. If you choose to stay in Arizona after graduation, the state offers one of the largest scopes of practice for licensed naturopathic physicians.

The Institute's mission is to understand how traditional plant medicines operate on a cellular level in order to create novel botanical solutions that support people, planet, and plants. For the past 18 years, the SCNM Research Department has explored the molecular biology of medicinal plants. This work includes a 5-year study on Echinacea species that elucidated its immunological and anti-inflammatory effects and discovered the responsible constituents. In recent years the Department, headed by Dr. Jeffrey Langland and supported by SCNM students, has conducted, presented, and published research on the anti-viral properties of carnivorous and non-carnivorous plants, immune cell and cytokine regulation by Astragalus and Echinacea species, compared and contrasted the anti- bacterial activity of honey varieties, essential oils, and colloidal silver, and identified and evaluated anti-bacterial and anti-fungal herbs, including those against antibiotic resistant micro-organisms. The Department is developing a tissue-culture model to study the epigenetic effects of botanicals to evaluate and compare the cellular responses to a variety of Cannabis /hemp cultivars and botanicals involved in improved skin care and health. The Institute will build upon the molecular biology research with the addition of analytical and isolation laboratories. These laboratories, combined with the clinical expertise and knowledge of herbalists and naturopathic physicians, will transform the understanding of botanicals. Institute research faculty and naturopathic medical students will have a world-class facility to collaborate on ground-breaking discoveries using medicinal plants.

Also, I was impressed that SCNM's research department focused on viruses that impact oral health. In particular, their work on botanical treatments for the Herpes Simplex Virus relates to my profession as a component of oral medicine, and I look forward to other advancements of botanicals in oral medicine research.\" - Dr. Jeffrey Langland, PhD Professor of Research Chair, Department of Research\"The Ric Scalzo Institute for Botanical Research will advance 21st century botanical medicine through innovative scientific exploration grounded in clinical herbalism's rich tradition. Our mission is inspired by nature to create novel botanical solutions that support people, planet, and plants. Unlike any other naturopathic institution, the Research Institute's analytical and bioassay laboratories will elucidate the mechanism of action of botanicals, optimize botanical extraction methodology, identify active constituents, and add quality control for botanical therapies. By deciphering the specific mechanism of action of herbs, novel botanical blends will be designed and traditional formulas optimized to target different aspects of diseases. Our research team, which includes SCNM students, will broaden our understanding and discovery of new botanical therapies for a multitude of global health concerns, as well as provide students with opportunities to sharpen their critical thinking skills, offering unique insights in the realm of botanical therapies and exposure to career opportunities.\" Recent Publications Identification of botanicals with potential therapeutic use against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen. Over and improper use of pharmaceuticals against S. aureus has led to the development of antibiotic resistance, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Our research has examined the efficacy of botanical extracts as an alternative form of treatment to S. aureus and MRSA, including penicillin/methicillin resistant S. aureus (PenR), and multi-drug resistant S. aureus (MDR). Initial screening of botanicals was done via a minimum inhibitory concentration procedure. In addition, a temporal growth curve was performed in order to quantify the growth of the bacteria in the presence of the extracts. Results demonstrated 13 botanicals that had varying activities against S. aureus, PenR, and MDR. These results propose botanical- derived antimicrobial extracts that may be utilized against S. aureus and different antibiotic resistant strains of MRSA. Non-enzymatic anti-bacterial activity of honey based on floral origin. Honey has been revered for its' medicinal properties for thousands of years, with ancient medical texts claiming a wide range of clinical applications. Modern research has demonstrated a range of effects including anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, and antioxidant action, as well as anti-microbial and wound-healing properties. This has led to the proliferation of honey-based medical products and clinical applications in cases of infected wounds, burns, and diabetic ulcers with highly successful results. Our research evaluated the non-enzymatic anti-bacterial activity of honey from a variety of floral origins, mostly within North America. These results demonstrate a varying range of anti- bacterial action from several honey types based on floral origin against a variety of pathogenic bacteria, independent of pH, osmosis, and enzyme activity. Characterization of the activity of the Pitcher plant against human papilloma virus and associated cancers. Our research has demonstrated that the botanical, Sarracenia purpurea (Pitcher plant), has antiviral activity against human papilloma viruses. An ongoing project is to decipher the mechanism and target of this herb toward the replication cycle of these viruses. Current results suggest that S. purpurea inhibits viral transcription resulting in a lack of mRNA synthesis. Notably, the precise target of action appears to be a cellular cyclin-dependent kinase required by the virus during the replication process. Based on this research, we have created a botanical formulation based which has been effective in the treatment of various HPV-associated cancers including actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma, as well as common warts. 20 - - 21 Leading the Industry in Research A Groundbreaking AdditionEmbracing Diversity SCNM understands that providing culturally-competent care starts in medical school.

She is the owner of Desert Wellness Center, as well as ND Catalyst, her proven, practice-building coaching program. But how did this all start for Dr. Lussier? While pursuing a career in allopathic medicine, she observed a typical HMO office and felt there must be something more to medicine than just spending ten minutes with a patient and writing a prescription. In 2002 she attended Discovery Day at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine where she learned about the naturopathic philosophy and approach to disease and immediately knew this was her path. Having practiced now for the past twelve years, Dr. Lussier still enjoys the challenge and reward of providing naturopathic care to her community.
