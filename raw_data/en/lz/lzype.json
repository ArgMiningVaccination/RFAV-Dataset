Section numbers PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION Guide to OMB Circular No. A -11 OF BUDGET ESTIMATES Page xxiv OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) are not repeated between parts. We reserved certain section numbers for future use, so there are gaps in the numbering scheme. Page numbers identify the section number and page within that section. At the beginning of the Circular, there is a table of contents that identifies all the parts, chapters, sections and associated page numbers. There is also a table of contents at the beginning of each section that identifies the subsections and exhibits contained in that section. We summarize major changes in policies and requirements at the beginning of the Circular. In addition, we describe the changes that affect each section at the beginning of that section and use vertical revision bars in the margins to highlight new requirements and significant changes. At the end of the Circular, there is an index.

I n this Circular, the term budget means the President's Budget \u2014The Budget of the United States Government . The budget consists of several volumes that set forth the President's financial proposal with recommended priorities for allocating resources. The main Budget volume contains the President's Budget message and other broad statements of policy. The Appendix contains detailed information by a gency, bureau or program group, budget accounts, programs, and activities. Other volumes, such as Analytical Perspectives and Historical Tables , provide complementary views of the budget. Most of the information contained in the budget is, or is based on, information you submit for your agency and programs in response to this Circular. T he term \"budget\" can mean other things in other contexts. It often refers to the full receipt and outlay proposals rather than the volumes in which these amounts are published. Some people refer collectively to the budget resolution and revenue and spending bills that the Congre ss passes, which we describe below, as the \"congressional budget.\" Ultimately, the Congress and the President enact many laws that control the Government's receipts and spending, which we sometimes refer to collectively as the budget, as in \"enacting the budget.\" T his section provides a broad overview of the budget process. You can read more about the budget process in the section of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the most recent budget, \" Technical Budget Analyses. \" To view or download budget doc uments , go to the budget website : ht tps://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/ 10.2 Wh at is the legal requirement to prepare the budget ? T he Budget and Accounting Act requires the President to submit a budget (see section 15.2). The President formally transmits proposals for allocating resources to the Congress through the budget. The Congress considers the recommendations and uses the information included in the bud get as it drafts and passes laws SECTION 10 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PR OCESS Page 2 of Section 10 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) that affect spending and receipts. Through this process the Government decides how much money to spend, what to spend it on, and how to raise the money it has decided to spend. 10.3 What kinds of information does the budget provide? The budget focuses primarily on the budget year \u2014the upcoming fiscal year for which the Congress needs to make appropriations. However, it includes data for the most recently completed year, the cur rent year, and nine years following the budget year (outyears) in order to reflect the effect of budget decisions over the longer term. In addition to proposed appropriations for the budget year, the budget may include proposed changes to appropriations f or the current year (supplementals and rescissions) and legislative proposals that would affect the current year, the budget year, or the outyears. The budget provides actual or estimated data (stated in millions or billions of dollars, depending on the context) for the following: The amount by account that each agency may obligate the Government to pay (budget authority) and estimates of payments (outlays) by agency and account; The amount of receipts each agency collects from various sources; Budget a uthority, outlays, and receipts by major function of the Government, such as national defense; (This is why we assign each budget account a functional classification code(s).) Total budget authority, outlays, and receipts for the Government; and The actual or estimated surplus (when receipts exceed outlays) or deficit (when outlays exceed receipts). The budget divides the Government totals for budget authority, outlays, and receipts into \"on-budget\" amounts and \"off -budget\" amounts. The off -budget a mounts include the transactions of the Social Security trust funds and the Postal Service, which are excluded by law from the on-budget totals. The budget arrays data in many different ways. For example, one section of the budget focuses solely on Federal investment spending. Also, while the budget focuses primarily on dollars, it also includes data on other resources, such as Federal employment levels. 10.4 Which agencies does the budget cover? The budget covers the agencies of all three branches of Government \u2014Executive, Legislative, and Judicial \u2014and provides information on Government -sponsored enterprises. In accordance with law or established practice, OM B includes information on agencies of the Legislative Branch, the Judicial Branch, and certain Executive Branch agencies as submitted by those agencies without change. By longstanding practice, the budget presents information about the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System but does not include amounts for the Board in the budget totals, even though it is a Government agency, because of the independent status of the System. The budget includes information about the Government -sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), but does not include them in the budget totals because they are privately owned. (Section 25 discusses the applicability of Part 2 of this Circular to various agencies.) The budget also includes the estimated budgetary effects of certain entities that may not report to the Department of the Treasury. These can be found in the Budget Appendix under the heading Federally Created Non -Federal Entities . In such cases, the included activities are considered budgetary and occur SECTION 10 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 10 because of authorities conferred or control exerted by the Government. For more information on capturing the full effect of g overnmental activity in the Budget, see Chapter 16, Coverage of the Budget, in the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget. 10.5 What happens during the Federal budget process and when? The budget process occurs in three main phases: Formulation . During this phase, the Executive Branch prepares the President's Budget . OMB and the Federal agencies begin preparing the next budget almost as soon as the President has sent the last one to the Congress. OMB officially starts the process by sending planning guidance to Executive Branch agencies in the spring. The President completes this phase by sending the budget to the Congress on the first Monda y in February, as specified in law, although occasionally Presidents have sent it later for various reasons. For example, in a year with a transition between outgoing and incoming Administrations, the timing of the President's Budget transmittal changes. Congressional . This phase starts in late January or February, when the Congress receives the President's Budget . The Congress does not vote on the President's Budget itself, and it does not enact a budget of its own, as such. It considers the President's Budget proposals, passes an overall revenue and spending plan called a \"budget resolution,\" and enacts the regular appropriations acts and other laws that control spending and receipts. Execution. This phase lasts for at least five fiscal years and includes two parts. The apportionment part pertains to funds appropriated for that fiscal year and to balances of appropriations made in prior years that remain available for obligation. At the beginning of the fiscal year, and at such other times as necessary, OMB apportions funds\u2014that is, specifies the amount of funds that an agency may use by time period, program, project, or activity \u2014to Executive Branch agencies. Throughout the year, agencies hire people, enter into contracts, and enter into grant agreements, etc. , in order to carry out their programs, projects, and activities. These act ions use up the available f unds by obligating the Federal G overnment to make outlays, immediately or in the future. The reporting and outlay part lasts until funds are canceled (one- year and multiple -year funds are canceled at the end of the fifth year af ter the funds expire for new obligations) or until funds are totall y disbursed (for no- year funds). Note: the canceled phase of annual and multi -year authority (see section 20.4(c) ) or cancellations of budgetary resources in no- year accounts pursuant to 3 1 U.S.C. 1555 should not be confused with cancellations as a type of reduction (see section 20.4(i) ). The following tables highlight the major events in each of the phases of the budget process. These tables show the planned timing or, when applicable, t he timing specified in law. The actual timing may vary from the plan. For example, the Congress frequently does not enact all appropriations acts by the start of the fiscal year, and on several occasions the President has submitted the budget later than specified for various reasons, including late enactment of appropriations for the previous fiscal year or a change in Administrations. Since budget cycles overlap, we must begin the next cycle before completing the last one. SECTION 10 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PR OCESS Page 4 of Section 10 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) MAJOR STEPS IN THE FORMULATION PHASE What happens? When? OMB issues spring planning guidance to Executive Branch agencies for the upcoming budget. The OMB Director issues a letter to the head of each agency providing policy guidance for the agency's budget request. Absent more specific guidance, the outyear estimates included in the previous budget serve as a starting point for the next budget. This begins the process of formulating the budget the President will submit the following February. Spring OMB and the Executive Branch agencies discuss budget issues and options. OMB works with the agencies to: Identify major issues for the upcoming budget; Develop and ana lyze options for the upcoming fall review; and Plan for the analysis of issues that will need de cisions in the future. Spring and Summer OMB issues Circular No. A -11 to all Federal agencies. This Circular provides detailed instructions for submitting budget data and materials. June Executive Branch agencies (except those not subject to Executive Branch review) make budget submissions. See section 25. September * Fiscal year begins. The just completed budget cycle focused on this fiscal year. It was the \"budget year\" in that cycle and is the \"current year\" in this cycle. October 1 OMB conducts its fall review. OMB staff analyzes agency budget proposals in light of Presidential priorities, program performance, and budget constraints. They raise issues and present options to the Director and other OMB policy officials for their decisions. October -November OMB opens the MAX A -11 DE application for all agencies to submit their past year budget data. Late October OMB briefs the President and senior advisors on proposed budget policies. The OMB Director recommends a complete set of budget proposals to the President after OMB has reviewed all agency requests and considered overall budget policies. Late November Passback. OMB usually informs all Executive Branch agencies at the same time about the decisions on their budget requests. Late November All agencies, including Legislative and Judicial Branch agencies, enter schedule data and text materials in MAX A -11 DE . This process continues until OMB must \"lock\" agencies out of MAX A -11 DE in order to meet the printing deadline. Late November to early January * Executive Branch agencies may appeal to OMB. An agency head may ask OMB to reverse or modify certain decisions. In most cases, OMB and the agency head resolve such issues and, if not, work together to present them t o the President for a decision. December * Agencies prepare and OMB reviews congressional budget justification materials. Agencies prepare the budget justification materials they need to explain their budget requests to the responsible congressional subcommittees. January The President transmits the budget to the Congress. First Monday in February *OMB provides specific deadlines for this activity. SECTION 10 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Section 10 MAJOR STEPS IN THE CONGRESSIONAL PHASE What happens? When? Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports to Budget Committees on the economic and budget outlook. January CBO reestimates the President's Budget based on their economic and technical assumptions. February Other committees submit \"views and estimates\" to House and Senate Budget Committees. Committees indicate their preferences regarding budgetary matters for which they are responsible. Within 6 weeks of budget transmittal The Congress completes action on the concurrent resolution on the budget. The Congress commits itself to broad spending and revenue levels by passing a budget resolution. April 15 The Congress needs to complete action on appropriations bill s for the upcoming fiscal year or provide a \"continuing resolution\" (a stop -gap appropriation law). September 30 MAJOR STEPS IN THE EXECUTION PHASE What happens? When? Fiscal year begins. October 1 OMB apportions funds made available in the annual appropriations process and other available funds. Agencies submit apportionment requests to OMB for each budget account by August 21 or within 10 calendar days after the approval of the appropriation, whichever is later. OMB approves or modifies the apportionment specifying the amount of funds agencies may use by time period, program, project, or activity. September 10 (or within 30 days after approval of a spending bill) Agencies incur obligations and make outlays to carry out the funded programs, projects, and activities. Agencies hire people, enter into contracts, and enter into grant agreements, etc. , in order to carry out their programs, projects, and activities. Agencies record obligations and outlays pursuant to administrative control of funds procedures (see Appendix H), report to Treasury (see the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual and section 130), and prepare financial statements. Throughout the fiscal year Fiscal year ends. September 30 Expired phase (no -year funds do not have an expired phase). Agencies disburse against obligated balances and adjust obligated balances to reflect actual obligations during the period of availability. Agencies c ontinue to record obligations and outlays pursuant to administrative control of funds procedures, report to Treasury , and prepare financial statements. Until September 30, fifth year after funds expire. 10.6 What is the Mid-Session Review? The law requires the President to send a report to the Congress updating budget estimates on or before July 15th. This report contains revised budget estimates resulting from changes in economic assumptions, technical reestimates, P residential initiatives, and completed congressional actions that have occurred since transmittal of the budget. Your OMB representative will provide guidance on the development of these estimates at the appropriate time. SECTION 10 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PR OCESS Page 6 of Section 10 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) 10.7 What are the central financial agencies? The central financial agencies are: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) , in the Executive Office of the President; The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service ); The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in the Legislative Branch; and The Government Accountability Office (GAO), in the Legislative Branch. 10.8 What are the responsibilities an d functions of OMB ? OMB's predominant mission is to assist the President in overseeing the preparation of the President 's Budget and to supervise its administration by the Executive Branch agencies. OMB evaluates the effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures, assesses competing funding demands among agencies, and sets funding priorities. OMB ensures that age ncy reports, rules, testimony, and proposed legislation are consistent with the President's Budget and with Administration policies. In addition, OMB oversees and coordinates the Administration's procurement, financial management, and information and regulatory policies. In each of these areas, OMB's primary role is to improve administrative management, develop better performance measures and coordinating mechanisms, and reduce any unnecessary burdens on the public. For further information, refer to the OMB website. 10.9 What are the responsibilities and functions of the Treasury ? Treasury, acting through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, gathers and publishes G overnment -wide financial information that is used by the public and private sectors to monitor the Government's financial status and establish fiscal and monetary policies. These publications include: the Daily Treasury Statement; the Monthly Treasury Statement; the Treasury Bulletin; the Combined Statement; and the Financial Report of the U.S. Go vernment . The Financial Report of the U.S. Government is the Federal Government 's set of audited financial statements, a requirement of the Government Management and Reform Act of 1994. For further information, refer to the Fiscal Service website. 10.10 What are the responsibilities an d functions of CBO ? CBO was created by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Ac t of 1974. CBO's mission is to provide the Congress with the objective, timely, non -partisan analyses needed for economic and budget decisions and with the information and estimates required for the congressional budget process. CBO prepares analyses and estimates relating to the budget and the economy and presents options and alternatives for the Congress to consider but does not make recommendations on policy. CBO 's services can be grouped into four categories: helping the Congress formulate a budget plan ; helping it stay within that plan ; helping it assess the impact of F ederal mandates; and helping it consider issues related to the budget and economic policy. For further information, refer to the CBO website. SECTION 10 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 7 of Section 10 10.11 What are the responsibilities and functions of GAO? GAO is the investigative arm of the Congress. GAO helps the Congress meet its Constitutional responsibilities and helps improve the performance and accountability of the Federal Government for the American people. GAO examines the use of public funds, evaluates Federal programs and activities, and provides analyses, options, recommendations, and other assistance to help the Congress make effective oversight, policy, and funding decisions. In this context, GAO works to continuously improve the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Federal Government through financial audits, program reviews and evaluations, analyses, legal opinions, investigations, and other services. GAO's activities are designed to ensure the Executive Branch's accountability to the Congress under the Constitution and the Government 's accountability to the American people. GAO is dedicated to good government through its commitment to the core values of accountability, in tegrity, and reliability. For further information, refer to the GAO website. 10.12 How do OMB, CBO, the Fiscal Service , and GAO responsibilities overlap ? Here are a few examples: After OMB submits the President's Bud get, CBO is responsible for re-estimating the budget . Both OMB and CBO score the costs of legislation (both appropriations and direct spending included in authorization bills). While Budget Committees have the ultimate responsibility for determining the scoring effects of legislation for Congressional enforcement, t hey typically rely on CBO estimates during congressional consideration of individual bills to ensure that they are consistent with the budget resolution totals. The President uses OMB estimates to determine the costs of budget -related legislation. OMB reconciles or explains differences between the two sets of discretionary estimates. OMB and Fiscal Service work together to establish any new Treasury accounts, both during the preparation of the Budget and after bills become laws. OMB and Fiscal Service work together to estim ate actual outlays during the course of a year. Fiscal Service gathers financial information through the Government -wide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trail Balance System (GTAS), that allows agencies to submit one set of accounting data (mostly budgetary, some proprietary) that fulfills the needs of the SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, the Fiscal Service 2108 Year -End Closing Statement, and the prior -year column of the Program and Financing schedule in the President's Budget. OMB and Fiscal Service worked together to develop the GTAS systems. Fiscal Service develops U.S. Standard General Ledger guidance to comply with OMB definitions. Both Fiscal Service and GAO provide guidelines used by financial managers as they account for Federal finances. OMB uses GAO audits and evaluations, as well as those of agency inspectors general, as part of its review of agency programs. SECTION 15 \u2014BASIC BUDGET LAWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Section 15 SECTION 15 \u2014BASIC BUDGET LAWS Table of Contents 15.1 What laws govern the budget cycle? 15.2 Why is the Budget and Accounting Act important? 15.3 How does the Congress enact the budget and how is the budget enforced? 15.4 What laws govern the budget execution process when funds are actually spent? 15.5 What does the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 require? 15.6 What do I need to know about the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990? 15.1 What laws govern the budget cycle? Th e Federal budget cycle can be divided into three distinct phases that are generally sequential and yet intertwined. The first phase, which culminates in the transmittal of the President's Budget proposals to the Congress, is called the budget formulation phase. In the next phase, the Congress acts upon laws that together constitute the enacted budget. Once the laws have been enacted, executive agencies carry out the laws in the budget execution phase. The Federal budget cycle is governed mainly by the following laws, which we describe below: Budget and Accounting Act. Congressional Budget Act. Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as amended (BBEDCA). Statutory Pay -As-You-Go Act. Antideficiency Act. Impoundment Control Act. GPRA Modernization Act (formerly Government Performance and Results Act). Federal Credit Reform Act. 15.2 Why is the Budget and Accounting Act important? Be fore enactment of this law in 1921, there was no annual centralized budgeting in the Executive Branch. Federal Government agencies usually sent b udget requests independently to congressional committees with no coordination of the various requests in formulating the Federal Government's budget. The Budget and Accounting Act required the President to coordinate the budget requests for all Government agencies and to send a comprehensive budget to the Congress. It created the Bureau of the Budget, now the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to help the President implement these requirements. It also required the President to include certain inform ation in the budget. The Congress has amended the requirements many times and has codified them as Chapter 11, Title 31, U.S. Code . These are some o f the requirements: \"On or after the first Monday in January but not later than the first Monday in February of each year, the President shall submit a budget of the United States Government for the following fiscal year.\" \"Each budget shall include a budget message and summary and supporting information. ThePresident shall include in each budget the following....\" The provision goes on to list about thirtyitems, such as expenditures and receipts for the past year through the fourth year following t he budget year, information on debt, financial information, and information on employment levels.SECTION 15 \u2014BASIC BUDGET LAWS Page 2 of Section 15 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) \"Under regulations prescribed by the President, each agency shall provide information required by the President in carrying out this chapter. The President has access to, and may inspect, records of an agency to obtain information.\" \"Estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations for the legislative branch and the judicial branch...shall be submitted to the President before October 16 of each year and included in the budget by the President without change.\" 15.3 How does the Congress enact the budget and how is the budget enforced? The Congress does not enact a budget, as such. The Congress reviews the President's Budget and develops its budget by approving three distinct kinds of measures: The Congress adopts a concurrent resolution in the spring that specifies total receipts and outlays and major categories of spending. Next, legislation authorizing changes in mandatory spending programs and in taxes are enacted consistent with the budget resolution. Finally, the Congress enacts discretionary appropriations in the regular appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year. The current congressional budget process was established by the enactment of the Congressional Budget Act (CBA). Before the CBA, which was enacted in 1974, there was no annual centralized budgeting in the legislative branch. Each of the regular annual appropriations bills was acted on separately by the Congress and changes in taxes were authorized in another process. In addit ion, there was no established process to add up the total receipts and total spending in all the bills to reach the Federal Government's bottom line, whether it was a surplus or a deficit. The CBA established the concurrent resolution on the budget, als o known as the budget resolution, the House and Senate Budget Committees, the Congressional Budget Office, and procedures for relating individual appropriation actions to the budget totals. Also, the CBA defines some key budget terms, such as budget authority, that are used in all phases of the President's Budget formulation process and the congressional budget process. The CBA was amended extensively by a series of laws. BBEDCA, one of these amendments, had as its central feature a series of declining deficit targets. BBEDCA was amended by the Budget Enforcement Act, which applied a statutory pay -as-you-go (PAYGO) proc ess to mandatory spending and revenue legislation and discretionary spending limits to annual appropriations acts. The statutory PAYGO process and discretionary spending limits expired in 2002. More r ecently enacted laws, however, have reinstated the stat utory budget enforcement mechanisms for mandatory spending and revenues and discretionary spending. The Statutory Pay -As-You-Go Act of 2010 established a statutory procedure to enforce a rule of deficit neutrality on new revenue and mandatory spending legislation. The law requires that new legislation changing revenues or mandatory expenditures, taken cumulatively, must not increase projected deficits. If such legislation does increase projected deficits, the law requires automatic across- the-board cut s, known as sequestration, in non- exempt mandatory programs. BBEDCA dictates the statutory spending limits (\"caps\") on the maximum amount of discretionary budget authority that can be provided through the annual SECTION 15 \u2014BASIC BUDGET LAWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 15 appropriations process. When BBEDCA caps a re in place, i f the amount of appropriations provided in appropriations acts for a given year exceeds the caps, the law requires the President to cancel discretionary budgetary resources in non -exempt accounts by the excess amount. When no statutory caps a re in place, budget enforcement occurs through the congressional budget process described above. Section 21 provides more information on the Statutory Pay- As-Yo u-Go Act , BBEDCA, and congressional enforcement mechanisms. 15.4 W hat laws govern the budget execution process when funds are actually spent? Chapter 17B of Title 2, and Chapters 13, 15, and 33 of Title 31, United States Code, govern the process of budget execution. Among these, the major laws are the Antideficiency Act, the Impoundment Control Act, the provisions known as the Economy Act which are found in section 1535, the provisions that govern the closing of accounts which are found in sections 1551 through 1555, and the \"Miscellaneous Receipts Act,\" which is found in section 3302. T he Antideficiency Act require s OMB to apportion appropriations and monitor spending; prohibits agencies from spending more than the amounts appropriated or apportioned, whichever is lower; requires that agencies control their spending; and provides penalties for overspending. Specifically, agencies may not: Purchase services and merchandise before appropriations are enacted and accounts are apportioned; Enter into contracts that exceed the relevant available appropriation or the amount apportioned by OMB for the year , whichever is lower; or Pay bills when there is no cash in the appropriation or fund account. The head of each agency is required to establish, by regulation, a system of administrative control of funds that: Restricts obligations and expenditure s (outlays or disburs ements) from each account to the lower of the amount apportioned by OMB or the amount available for obligation and/or expenditure. Enables the head of the agency to identify the person(s) responsible for violating the Act. There are administrative and cr im inal penalties for violating the Antideficiency Act. Also, the agency head is required to report any violations to the President, through the OMB Director; to the Congress; and to the Comptroller General. See section 145 for instructions on reporting v iolations. The Impoundment Control Act, which was enacted in 1974, requires that the President notify the C ongress whenever the President or any other official of the Executive Branch proposes to defer budget authority or determines that all or part of any budget authority will not be required to carry out the full objectives or scope of programs for which it is provided or that such budget authority should be rescinded for fiscal policy or other reasons (including the termination of authorized projects or activities for which budget authority has been provided). There are two types of impoundments: the temporary deferral of funds and rescission propos als to permanently reduce spending. The Act also prescribes the rules that must be followed whenever the executive branch impounds funds. See section 112 for instructions on reporting deferrals and rescission proposals and the rules that must be followed . SECTION 15 \u2014BASIC BUDGET LAWS Page 4 of Section 15 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) 15.5 What does the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 require? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 updates the Federal Gove rnment's performance management framework, retaining and amplifying some aspects of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) while also addressing some of its weaknesses. The GPRA in 1993 had established strategic planning, performance pla nning, and reporting as a framework for agencies to communicate progress in achieving their missions. The GPRA Modernization Act establishes some important changes to existing requirements that move toward a more useful approach to performance planning and reporting on a central website. The GPRA Modernization Act serves as a foundation for helping agencies to focus on their highest priorities and creating a culture where data and empirical evidence play a greater role in policy, budget, and management deci sions. A central program inventory, also required by the Act, has the potential to facilitate coordination across programs by making it easier to find programs that can contribute to a shared goal, as well as improve public understanding about what Federal programs do. 15.6 What do I need to know about the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990? This law gover ns Federal credit programs\u2014ones that make direct loans and loan guarantees. The Act (FCRA) prescribes a special budget treatment for direct loans and loan guarantees that measures the net present value of cash flows to and from the Government, i.e., subsidy cost, rather than budgeting for credit programs on a cash basis. For most credit programs, the Congress must provide budget authority equal to the subsidy cost in annual appropriations acts before the program can make direct loans or loan guarantees. Section 185 of this Circular addresses the requirements of this law, which was enacted as an amendment to Title V of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

Advance appropriation means appropriations of new budget authority that become available one or more fiscal years beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation act was passed. (See section 20.4(c) .) Advance funding means appropriations of budget authority provided in an appropriations act to be used, if necessary, to cover obligations incurred late in the fiscal year for benefit payments in excess of the amount specifically appropriated in the act for that year, where the budget authority is charged to the appropriation SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 20 for the program for the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the appropriations act is passed. (See section 20.4(c) .) Agency means a department or establishment of the Government for the purposes of this Circular. (Compare to \"Bureau .\") Allowance means a lump sum included in the Budget to represent certain transactions that are expected to increase or decrease budget authority, outlays, or receipts but that are not, for various reasons, reflected in the program details. For example, the Budget might include an allowance to show the effect on the budget totals of a proposal that would affect many accounts by relatively small amounts, in order to avoid unnecessary detail in the presentations for the individual accounts. The President doesn 't propose that the Congress enact an allowance as such, but rather that it modify specific legislative measures as necessary to produce the increases or decreases represented by the allowance. Amendment means a proposed action that revises the President' s Budget request and is transmitted prior to completion of action on the budget request by the Appropriations Committees of both Houses of Congress. (See section 110.2.) Apportionment is a plan, approved by OMB, to spend resources provided by one of the annual appropriations acts, a supplemental appropriations act, a continuing resolution, or a permanent law (mandatory appropriations). Resources are apportioned by Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol (TAFS). The apportionment identifies amounts available for obligation and expenditure. It specifies and limits the obligations that may be incurred and expenditures made (or makes other limitations, as appropriate) f or specified time periods, programs, activities, projects, objects, or any combination thereof. An apportioned amount may be further subdivided by an agency into allotments, suballotments, and allocations. (See Appendix H .) Appropriated entitlement \u2014See \"Entitlement.\" Appropriation means a provision of law (not necessarily in an appropriations act) authorizing the expenditure of funds for a given purpose. Usually, but not always, an appropriation provides budget authority. (See section 20.4.) Appropriation account is the basic unit of an appropriation. Generally, an appropriation account reflects each unnumbered paragraph in an appropriation act. An appropriation account typically encompasses a number of activities or projects and may be subject to restrictions or conditions applicable to only the account, the appropriation act, titles within an appropriation act, other appropriation acts, or the government as a whole. Each appropriation account is assigned at least one Treasury Appropriation F und Symbol . (See \"Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol. \") Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) refers to legislation that shaped the budget process, first by setting fixed targets for annual deficits and then by replacing those with a Pay -as-y ou-go (PAYGO; see \" Pay-As-You-Go\") requirement for new tax or mandatory spending legislation and with caps on annual discretionary funding. The Statutory Pay -As-You -Go Act of 2010, which did not amend BBEDCA, reinstated a statutory PAYGO rule for revenues and mandatory spending legislation. The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118 -5), which amended BBEDCA, reinstated discretionary caps on budget authority through 2025. (See section 21.3.) Balances of budget authority means the amounts of budget authority provided in previous years that have not been outlayed. SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS P age 4 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Baseline means a projection of the estimated receipts, outlays, and deficit or surplus that would result from continuing current law or current policies through the period covered by the Budget . (See section 80 .) Borrowing authority is a type of budget authority that permits obligations and outlays to be financed by borrowing. (See section 20.4(b) .) Budget means the Budget of the United States Government, which sets forth the President 's comprehensive financial plan and indicates the President' s priorities for the Federal Government. (See section 10.1.) Budget authority (BA) means the authority provided by law to incur financial obligations that will result in outlays. The specific forms of budget authority are appropriations, borrowing authority, contract authority, and spending authority from offsetting collections. (See section 20.4 .) Budget Control Act of 2011 refers to legislation that, among other things, amended BBEDCA to reinstate discretionary spending limits on budget authority through 2021 and restored the process for enforcing those spending limits; increased the statutory debt ceiling; and established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction that was instructed to develop a bill to reduce the Federal deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over a 10-year period. It also provided a process to implement alternative spending reductions in the event that legislation achieving at least $1.2 trillion of deficit reduction was not enacted. (See section 21.3 .) Bu dget totals means the totals included in t he Budget for budget authority, outlays, receipts, and the surplus or the deficit. Some presentations in the Budget distinguish on- budget totals from off -budget totals. On - budget totals reflect the transactions of all Federal Government entities, except those excluded from the Budget totals by law. Off -budget totals reflect the transactions of Government entities that are excluded from the on-budget totals by law. Under current law, the off -budget totals include the Social Security trust funds and the Postal Service. The Budget combines the on- and off -budget totals to derive unified (i.e. consolidated) totals for Federal activity. B udget year (BY) refers to the fiscal year for which the Budget is being considered, that is, with respect to a session of Congress, the fiscal year of the Government that starts on October 1 of the calendar year in which that session of Congress begins. B udgetary resources mean amounts available to incur obligations in a given year. Budgetary resources consist of new budget authority and unobligated balances of budget authority provided in previous years. B ureau means the principal subordinate organizational units of an agency. Cancellation means a proposal by the President to reduce budget resources (new budget authority or unobligated balances of budget authority) that is not subject to the requirements of Title X of the Congressi onal Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Resources that are proposed by the President for cancellation cannot be withheld from obligation pending Congressional action on the proposal. The term is sometimes used more broadly to refer to any legislative action taken by the Congress to reduce budgetary resources, including rescissions proposed by the President. Cancellations can either be temporary or permanent. (See section 20.4(i) .) Cancellations as a type of reduction should not be confused with the canceled phase of annual and multi - year authority (see section 20.4(c) ) or cancellations of budgetary resources in no -year accoun ts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1555 (see Appendix F ). Ca p means the legal limits for each fiscal year under BBEDCA on the budg et authority and outlays (only if applicable) provided by discretionary appropriations. SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 20 Cap adjustment means either an increase or a decrease that is permitted to the statutory cap limits under BBEDCA , when such caps are set in law, on the budget authority and outlays (only if applicable) provided by discretionary appropriations only if certain conditions are met. These conditions may include providing for a base level of funding, a designation of funds by the Congress (and in some circumstances, the President), or a change in concepts and definitions of funding under the cap. Changes in concepts and definitions require consultation with the Congressional Appropriations and Budget Committees. Cash equivalent transaction means a transaction in which the Government makes outlays or receives collections in a form other than cash or in which the outlays or receipts recorded in the Budget differ from the cash because the cash does not accurately measure the value of the transaction. (See section 20.8.) CHIMP is an acronym for a \" CHange (either a cost or a savings) I n a Mandatory Program\" that is proposed or enacted in an appropriations bill rather than in authorizing legislation. The term applies only to provisions in appropriations acts that change mandatory budget authority, outlays, offsetting collections, or offsetting receipts relative to the baseline. For the purposes of scoring those appropriations acts, such changes are scored as discretionary. After enactment, these changes are rebased (see \"Rebase\"). In OMB 's budget database, proposed CHIMPs are separately identified with a specific budget enforcement subcategory classification known as a \"discretionary change in a mandatory program \" until they are enacted in full- year appropriations bills (see section 81.2 ). This classification only applies to policy estimates\u2014not baseline estimates. Under the Statutory Pay -As-You -Go Act of 2010, the outlay effects of CHIMPs that alter mandatory budget authority in an outyear are classified as PAYGO (mandatory) impacts except when their net outlay effect is zero over a six-year period beginning with the current year. All changes in revenues in any year are classified as PAYGO, and are not scored as discretionary, even if they are included in an appropriations bill. Collections mean money collected by the Government that the Budget record s as a governmental receipt, an offsetting collection, or an offsetting receipt (see section 20.7). Contract authority is a type of budget authority that permits you to incur obligations in advance of an appropriation, offsetting collections, or receipts to make outlays to liquidate the obligations. Typically, the Congress provides contract authority in an authorizing statute to allow you to incur obligations in anticipation of the collection of receipts or offsetting collections that will be used to liqu idate the obligations . (See section 20.4(b) .) Cost means the price or cash value of the resources used to produce a program, project, or activity. This term is used in many different contexts. When used in connection with Federal credit programs, the term means the estimated long-term cost to the Government of a direct loan or loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays (see section 185 ). For spe cific instructions on estimating costs, refer to the pertinent OMB instructions: for cost principles for educational institutions, see OMB Circular A-21; for estimating costs for user charges, see OMB Circular A- 25; for rental and construction costs of Government quarters, see OMB Circular A- 45; for allowable costs for audits, see OMB Circular A- 50; for cost estimates in performing com mercial activities, see OMB Circular A- 76; and for cost principles for State, local, and Indian Tribal Governments, see OMB Circular A- 97. The term also refers to legislation or administrative actions that increase outlays or decrease savings. Credit program account means a budget account that receives and obligates appropriations to cover the subsidy cost of a direct loan or loan guarantee and disburses the subsidy amount to a financing account. (See section 185.) SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 6 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Current services estimates\u2014See \"Baseline. \" Deferral means any executive branch action or inaction that temporarily withholds, delays, or effectively precludes the obligation or expenditure of budgetary resources. The President reports deferrals to the Congress by special message. Deferrals are not identified separately in the Budget. (See section 112 .) Deficit means the amount by which outlays exceed receipts in a fiscal year. It may refer to the on -budget, off-budget, or unified budget deficit. (See \"Budget totals .\") Deposit fund means an account established to record amounts held temporarily by the Governm ent until ownership is determined (for example, earnest money paid by bidders for mineral leases) or held by the Government as an agent for others (for example, State and local income taxes withheld from Federal employees' salaries and not yet paid to the State or local government). (See section 20.11 .) Direct loan means a disbursement of funds by the Government to a non-Federal borrower under a contract that requires the repayment of such funds with or without interest. The term also includes certain equivalent transactions that extend credit. (See section 185 ) (Compare to \"Loan guarantee .\") Direct spending \u2014See \"Mandatory spending. \" Disaster funding means a discretionary appropriation that is enacted that the Congress designates as being for disaster relief. Such an appropriation results in a cap adjustment to the limits on discretionary spending under BBEDCA , when such caps are set in law. The total adjustment for this purpose cannot exceed a ceiling for a particular year that is defined as the tot al of the average funding provided for disaster relief over the previous 10 years (excluding the highest and lowest years) and the unused amount of the prior year's ceiling (excluding the portion of the prior year 's ceiling that was itself due to any unused amount from the year before). Disaster relief is defined as activities carried out pursuant to a determination under section 102(2) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Discretionary spending means budgetary resources (except those provided to fund mandatory spending programs) provided in appropriations acts. (See section 21.3 .) (Compare to \"M andatory spending.\") Where obligation limitations set in appropriations acts limit permanent budget authority, except trust fund accounts in the Department of Transportation, we define the budget authority for the account as discretionary in an amount equal to the limit. For the Transportation trust funds subject to an annual obligation limitation , the budget authority remains mandatory, although the funds ' outlays are discretionary. Emergency requirement means an amount that the Congress has designated as an emergency requirement in statute and, for discretionary appropriations, designated on an account by account basis. Such amounts are not included in the estimated budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation under the requirements of the Statutory Pay -As-You -Go Act of 2010, if they are mandatory or receipts. Such a discretionary appropriation that is subsequently de signated by the President as an emergency requirement results in a cap adjustment to the limits on discretionary spending under BBEDCA , when such caps are set in law. Entitlement refers to a program in which the Federal Government is legally obligated to make payments or provide aid to any person who, or State or local government that, meets the legal criteria for eligibility. Entitlements are generally provided by an authorizing statute, and can include loan and grant programs. Examples include benefit payments for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and unemployment insurance, as well as grants to States for the Children 's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ). Some programs, such as veteran 's compensation , Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Child Nutrition, are entitlements even though they are funded by appropriations SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 20 acts because the authorizing statutes for the programs unconditionally obligate the United States to make payments. These are referred to as appropriated entitlements. (See \"M andatory spending;\" section 21.3.) Expenditure transfer \u2014See \"T ransfers. \" Federal funds group refers to the moneys collected and spent by the Government through accounts other than those designated as trust funds. Federal funds include general, special, public enterprise, and intragovernmental funds. (See section 20.11. ) (Compare to \"T rust funds group.\") Financing account means a non -budgetary account (an account whose transactions are excluded from the budget totals) that records all of the cash flows resulting from post -1991 direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments. At least one financing account is associated with each credit program account. For programs that make both direct loans and loan guarantees, separate financing accounts are required for direct loan cash flows and for loan guarantee cash flows. (See section 185 .) (Compare to \"L iquidating account .\") Fiscal year (FY) means the Government' s accounting period. It begins on October 1 and ends on September 30, and is designated by the calendar year in which it ends. Forward funding means appropriations of budget authority that become available for obligation in the last quarter of the fiscal year for the financing of ongoing grant programs during the next fiscal year. (See section 20.4(c) .) Full-time eq uivalent (FTE) employment is the basic measure of the levels of employment used in the Budget . It is the total number of hours worked (or to be worked) divided by the number of compensable hours applicable to each fiscal year. (See section 85.) Functional classification means the array of budget authority, outlays, and other budget data according to the major purpose served \u2014for example, agriculture, national defense, and transportation. (See section 79.3.) General fund means the accounts for collections not earmarked by law for a specific purpose, the proceeds of general borrowing, and the expenditure of these moneys. It is part of the Federal funds group. Government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) mean private enterprises that were established and char tered by the Federal Government for public policy purposes. GSEs are classified as non -budgetary and not included in the Federal budget because they are private companies, and their securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the Federal Government. However, the Budget presents statements of financial condition for certain Government sponsored enterprises such as the Federal National Mortgage Association. (Compare to \"Off-budget .\") Governmental receipts mean collections that result from the Government 's exercise of its sovereign power to tax or otherwise compel payment. They are compared to outlays in calculating a surplus or deficit. Receipts and revenues are common terms used in place of governmental receipts. (See section 20.7.) (Comp are to \"O ffsetting collections \" and \"O ffsetting receipts.\") GTAS means the Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System. Agency staff uses this system to electronically submit the accounting data that: (a) support the SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, and (b) are used for much of the initial set of past year data in schedule P (see sections 82.15 and 130.2 ). This system replaced the Treasury Federal Agencies' Centralized Trial Balance System II (FACTS II). SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 8 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Impoundment means any Executive Branch action or inaction that temporarily or permanently withholds, delays, or precludes the obligation or expenditure of budgetary resources. Intragovernmental fund\u2014See \"Revolving fund. \" Liquidating account means a budget account that records all cash flows to and from the Government resulting from pre -1992 direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments. Unlike financing accounts, these accounts are included in the Budget totals. (See section 185.) (Compare to \"F inancing account .\") Loan guarantee means any guarantee, insurance, or other pledge with respect to the payment of all or a part of the principal or interest on any debt obligation of a non-Federal borrower to a non -Federal lender. The ter m does not include the insurance of deposits, shares, or other withdrawable accounts in financial institutions. (See section 185 .) (Compare to \"D irect loan .\") Mandatory spending means spending controlled by laws other than appropriations acts (includi ng spending for entitlement programs) and spending for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program . Although the Statutory Pay-As-You -Go Act of 2010 uses the term \" direct spending\" instead of \"mandatory spending\" to describe this concept, \"mandatory spending \" is the term to describe the concept that is commonly used. (See section 21.3 .) (Compare to \"D iscretionary spending .\") Means of financing refers to borrowing, the change in cash balances, and certain other transactions that are involved in fina ncing a deficit. The term is also used to refer to the debt repayment, the change in cash balances, and certain other transactions involved in using a surplus. By definition, the means of financing are not treated as receipts or outlays and so are non -budgetary. (See section 20.7(h) .) Nonbudgetary transactions means transactions of the Government that do not belong in the Budget because they do not represent net budget authority or outlays, but rather are a means of financing (such as deposit funds, direct loan and loan guarantee financing accounts, and seigniorage). (Compare to \"Off- budget \" and \"Means of financing .\") Nonexpenditure transfer \u2014See \"Transfer.\" Obligated balance means the cumulative amount of budget authority that has been obligated but not yet outlayed. As prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 1551, it is the amount of unliquidated obligations in an account less the amounts collectible as repayments to the account. In other words, it is unpaid obligations net of uncollected customer payments from Federal sources. (See section 20.4(g) .) Obligation means a binding agreement that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future. Budgetary resources must be available before obligations can be incurred legally. (See section 20.5 .) Obligation limitation means a type of budgetary resource appropriated to accounts in a manner similar to budget authority that limits the amount of contract authority already made available for obligation by another law. The obligation limitation is effectively the amount of new budget authority available for obligation for that period. Obligation limitations are used in certain Transportation programs . Off-budget refers to transactions of the Federal Government that would be treated as budgetary had Congress not designated them by statute as \"off-budget. \" Currently, transactions of the Social Security trust funds and the Postal Service are the only sets of transactions that are so designated. The term is sometimes used more broadly to refer to the transactions of private enterprises that were established and sponsored by the Government, most especially \" Government sponsored enterprises\" such as the Federal Home Loan Banks. (Compare to \"On-budget .\") SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 20 Offsetting collections mean payments to the Government that, by law, are credited directly to expenditure accounts and deducted from gross budget authority and outlays of the expenditure account, rather than added to receipts. Usually, offsetting collections are authorized to be spent for the purposes of the account without further action by Congress. They usually result from business -like transactions with the public, including payments from the public in exchange for goods and services, reimbursements for damages, and gifts or donations of money to the Government and from intragovernmental transactions with other Government accounts. The authority to spend offsetting collections is a form of budget authority. (See sections 20.4(b) and 20.7 .) (Compare to \"Governmental receipts\" and \"Offsetting receipts.\") Offsetting receipts mean payments to the Government that are credited to offsetting receipt accounts and deducted from gross budget authority and outlays, rather than added to receipts. Usually they are deducted at the level of the agency and subfunction, but in some cases they are deducted at the level of the Government as a whole. They are not authorized to be credited to expenditure accounts. The legislation that authorizes the offsetting receipts may earmark them for a specific purpose and either appropriate t hem for expenditure for that purpose or require them to be appropriated in annual appropriations acts before they can be spent. Like offsetting collections, they usually result from business-like transactions with the public, including payments from the public in exchange for goods and services, reimbursements for damages, and gifts or donations of money to the Government, and from intragovernmental transactions with other Government accounts. (See section 20.7.) (Compare to \"G overnmental receipts\" and \"Offsetting collections .\") On-budget refers to all budgetary transactions other than those designated as off -budget. (Compare to \"Off-budget .\") Outlay means a payment to liquidate an obligation (other than the repayment of debt principal or other disbursements that are \"means of financing \" transactions). Outlays generally are equal to cash disbursements but also are recorded for cash -equivalent transactions, such as the issuance of debentures to pay insurance claims, and in a few cases are recorded on an accrual basis such as interest on public issues of the public debt. Outlays are the measure of Government spending. (See section 20.6 .) Outyear estimates mean estimates presented in the Budget for the years beyond the budget year of budget authority, outlays, receipts, and other items (such as debt). Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) means a discretionary appropri ation that is enacted that the Congress and, subsequently, the President , has so designated on an account by account basis. Such a discretionary appropriation that is designated as OCO/GWOT results in a cap adjustment to the limits on discretionary spendi ng under BBEDCA , when such caps are set in law. Funding for these purposes has been associated with , for example, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Pay-As-You -Go (PAYGO) refers to the requirements of the Statutory Pay -As-You -Go Act of 2010 that result in a sequestration if the estimated combined result of new legislation affecting direct spending or revenue increases the on -budget deficit relative to the baseline, as of the end of a congressional session. Administrative PAYGO, enacted in the Fiscal Resp onsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5), is separate from statutory PAYGO enforcement and does not apply to scoring legislation. (See section 21.3.) Public enterprise fund\u2014 See \"Revolving fund. \" Reappropriation means an extension of the availability of unobligated balances of budget authority that have expired or would otherwise expire as a result of legislation enacted subsequent to the law that provided the budget authority. (See section s 20.4(h) and 120.66.) SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 10 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Rebase means to change the classification of funds from how they were scored for budget enforcement in a particular piece of legislation. Items can be \" rebased \" in either direction\u2014from mandatory to discretionary or discretionary to mandatory \u2014depending on the original jurisdiction of the scored bill, the directed scoring provided in a bill, and the underlying program characteristics . This happens most often with changes in mandatory programs enacted in appropriations acts (see \" CHIMP \"), which are scored as discretionary but executed as mandatory. It is also possible, however, for an authorizing bill to change a discretionary program, which would be scored as mandatory but executed as discretionary. See section 21.3 for a more detailed explanation on determining the budget enforcement category of funding. Receipts\u2014See \"Governmental receipts \" or \"O ffsetting receipts. \" Reduction in budgetary resources means a rescission (see section 20.4(i) ); cancellation (see secti on 20.4(i) ); across-the -board reduction; or sequestration (see section 100). Refund means the return of excess payments to or by the Government. (See section 20.9 .) Reimbursable obligation means an obligation financed by offsetting collections credited to an expenditure account in payment for goods and services provided by that account. (See section 83.5 .) Rescission means a proposal by the President to reduce budgetary resources (new budget authority or unobligated balances of budget authority) pursuant to the requirements of Title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Resources that are proposed by the President for rescission may be withheld from obligation for 45 calendar days of continuous session of the Congress (excluding an adjournment of more than three days on which either House is not in session) pending congressional action on the proposal. The term is often used more broadly to refer to any legislative action taken by the Congress to reduce budgetary resources, including reductions that were not proposed pursuant to the Impoundment Control Act. Rescissions can either be temporary or permanent. (See section 20.4(i) .) Revolving fund means a fund that conducts continuing cycles of business -like activity, in whic h the fund charges for the sale of products or services and uses the proceeds to finance its spending, usually without requirement for annual appropriations. There are three types of revolving funds: Public enterprise funds, which conduct business -like o perations mainly with the public, intragovernmental revolving funds, which conduct business -like operations mainly within and between Government agencies, and trust revolving funds, which conduct business -like operations mainly with the public and are designated by law as a trust fund. (See section 20.11.) Scorekeeping means measuring the budget effects of legislation in terms of budget authority, governmental receipts, and outlays, for purposes of measuring adherence to the President 's Budget, other budget targets, or budget enforcement laws. (See section 21.) Sequestration means the cancellation of budgetary resources. The Statutory Pay -As-You -Go Act of 2010 requires such cancellations if revenue or direct spending legislation is enacted that, in total, increases projected deficits or reduces projected surpluses relative to the baseline. BBEDCA requires annual across-the-board cancellations to selected mandatory programs through 2030. When discretionary caps are in place under BBEDCA, it requires cancellations of discretionary appropriations if such appropriations exceed the statutory limits on discretionary spending. (See section 100.) Special fund means a Federal fund account for receipts earmarked for specific purposes and the expenditure of these receipts. (See section 20.11 .) SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 20 Spending authority from offsetting collections is a type of budget authority that permits obligations and outlays to be financed by off setting collections . (See section 20.4(b) ). (Compare to \"O ffsetting collections .\") Statutory Pay-As-You -Go Act of 2010 refers to legislation that reinstated a statutory pay -as-you-go requirement for new tax or mandatory spending legislation. The law is a stand -alone piece of legislation that cross-references BBEDCA but does not directly amend that legislation. (See \" Pay-As-You -Go (PAYGO). \") Subsidy means the estimated long -term cost to the Government of a direct loan or loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays. (See section 185.) Supplemental appropriation means an appropriation enacted subsequent to a regular annual appropriations act, when the need for funds is too urgent to be postponed until the next regular annual appropriations act. (See section 110.2.) Surplus means the amount by which receipts exceed outlays in a fiscal year. It may refer to the on -budget, off-budget, or unified budget surplus. (See \"Budget totals.\") Third scorecard is sometimes used to refer to the effects of a mandatory or revenue proposal that are not subject to PAYGO. (S ee sections 79.2 and 81.2 for more information on reporting these effects in MAX A-11 DE .) These non -PAYGO effects may include: The PAYGO-exempt portions of mandatory or revenue proposals that require authorizing legislation, such as off -budget or emergenc y legislation; The indirect effect of mandatory or revenue proposals, including proposals that require authorizing legislation, which are not subject to PAYGO. Indirect effects include the effects on interest; The mandatory or revenue savings or costs tha t result from discretionary policies, such as the savings associated with an increased level of anti-fraud or enhanced compliance effort achieved by additional administrative or program management funding. Transfer means to move budgetary resources from one budget account to another. Depending on the circumstances, the budget may record a transfer as an expenditure transfer, which means a transfer that involves an outlay, or as a nonexpenditure transfer, which means a transfer that doesn 't involve an outla y. (See section 20.4(j) .) Transfer in the estimates means a proposal to stop funding an activity through one budget account and begin funding it through another account. A transfer in the estimates doesn' t involve a transfer of budgetary resources between the accounts. (See section 20.4(k) .) Treasury Account Symbol (TAS ) refers to the account identification codes assigned by the Department of the Treasury to individual appropriation, receipt, or other fund accounts. All financial transactions of the Federal Government are classified by TAS for reporting to the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget. TAS includes all the component pieces of Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol plus any sub -accounts established by Treasury. Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol (TAFS) refers to the separate Treasury accounts for each appropriation account based on the availability of the resources in the account. The TAFS is a combination SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 12 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) of Federal agency; allocation agency, when applicable; account symbol; and availability code (e.g., annual, multi-year, or no -year). (See section 20.4(c) .) Trust fund refers to a type of account, designated by law as a trust fund, for receipts or offsetting receipts dedicated to specific purposes and the expenditure of these receipts. Some revolving funds are designated as trust funds, and these are called trust revolving funds. Trust revolving funds have no receipt account and the collections are credited directly to the expenditure account. (See section 20.11.) (Compare to \"S pecial funds \" and \"Revolving funds .\") Trust funds group refers to the moneys collected and spent by the Government through trust fund accounts. (See section 20.11.) (Compare to \" Federal funds group.\") Unexpended balance means the sum of the unobligated and obligated balances. Unobligated balance means the cumulative amount of budget authority that remains available for obligation under law in unexpired accounts. The term \" expired balances available for adjustment only \" refers to unobligated amounts in expired accounts. (See section 20.4(f) .) User charges are charges assessed for the provision of Government services and for the sale or use of Government goods or resources. The payers of the user charge must be limited in the authorizing legislation to those receiving special benefits from, or subject to regulation by, the program or activity beyond the benefits received by the general public or broad segments o f the public (such as those who pay income taxes or customs duties). User charges are defined and the policy regarding user charges is established in OMB Circular A- 25 , \"User Charges\" (July 8, 1993). The term encompasses proceeds from the sale or use of Government goods and services, including the sale of natural resources (such as timber, oil, and minerals) and proceeds from asset sales (such as property, plant, and equipment). (See section 20.7(g) .) Warrant means an official document issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to law, that establishes the amount of appropriations approved by the Congress to be withdrawn from the United States Treasury. (See section 20.4(c) for more information on the availability of budget authority for obligation and disbursement) . 20.4 What do I need to know about budget authority? (a) Definition of budget authority Budget authority (BA) means the authority provided by law to incur financial obligations that will result in outlays. This definition is the same as the one contained in section 3(2) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which the Congress uses in the congressional budget process. You violate the law if you enter into contracts, issue purchase orders, hire employees, or otherwise obligate the Government to make a payment before a law has provided budget authority for that purpose (see section 145.1 ). (b) Forms of budget authorit y Most laws provide budget authority in the form of appropriations, but some laws provide budget authority in the form of contract authority, borrowing authority, or spending authority from offsetting collections. The following table summarizes the characteristics of each form of budget authority, and the text following the table discusses them in more depth. SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 20 FORMS OF BUDGET AUTHORITY Form of budget authority Summary of Characteristics Appropriation Authorizes obligations and outlays using general funds, special funds, or trust funds. Provided in appropriations acts and other laws. May authorize the use of cash -equivalent payments. Not all appropriations provide budget authority. Contract authority Authorizes obligations but not outlays. Typically provided in authorizing laws with variations in the way obligations are liquidated. Borrowing authority Authorizes obligations with outlays to be financed by borrowing, usually from Treasury. Typically provided in laws that authorize business -like operations and require the borrowing to be repaid, with interest, out of the business proceeds. Spending authority from offsetting collections Authorizes obligations and outlays using offsetting collections. Typically provided in authorizing laws. Appropr iations acts limit obligations in some cases. Budget authority may be recorded and obligations incurred against orders from other Federal accounts only if an obligation is recorded by the paying account; obligations normally cannot be incurred against orde rs from the public without an advance. (1) Appropriations , as a type of budget authority, permit you to incur obligations and make outlays (payments). (Not all appropriations provide budget authority, as explained below.) The Congress enacts appropriations in annual appropriations acts and other laws. An appropriation may make funds available from the general fund, special funds, or trust funds. An appropriations act may also authorize the spending of offsetting collections, which are credited to expenditure accounts (including revolving funds) (see \"Spending authority from offsetting collections \" below). A law that authorizes you to incur obligations and liquidate them through cash-equivalent payments (see section 20.8) constitutes an appropriation of budget authority. Some appropriations are not recorded as new budget authority because they relate to obligations that have already been legally incurred and do not provide the authority to incur new obligations. Amounts appropriated to liquidate contract authority provide the cash needed to liquidate obligations incurred against contract authority in advance of collections or an appropriation to liquidate; amounts appropriated to SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 14 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) liquidate debt provide the cash needed to repay money borrowed from Treasury to liquidate obligations incurred against borrowing authority. In contrast, deficiency appropriations, which allow agencies to liquidate obligations that were incurred in a prior fiscal year without sufficient budget authority to legally cover such obligations, are recorded as new budget authority but deduct ed from the total budgetary resources available for obligation. Deficiency appropriations reduce or eliminate the negative balance that results from obligating amounts in excess of an account' s budgetary resources (see section 82.18 and Appendix F). This treatment helps ensure that any obligations that were incurred without sufficient budget authority, particularly in cases where the obligation has yet to be liquidated, are still recognized in the budget authority totals as a current cost. If these costs are not recognized as new budget authority, then the total budget authority available to enter into new obligations in a given fiscal year will have effectively been allowed to increase without scoring the impact of that increase. See section 145.10 for guidance on when to request a deficiency appropriation. For purposes of the Antideficiency Act, the definition of the term \" appropriations \" is broader. As defined by the Act, it means all new budget authority and balances of budget authority as described here. (2) Contract authority permits you to incur obligations in advance of an appropriation, offsetting collections, or receipts that enable you to make outlays to liquidate the obligations. Typically, the Congress provides contract authority in an authorizing statute to allow you to incur obligations in anticipation of the collection of receipts or offsetting collections that will be used to liquidate the obligations. When you receive the appropriated receipts or the collections, you replace the contract authority with the appropriation or the spending authority from the offsetting collections to cover the obligations and subsequently liquidate the obligations. For some programs, the law authorizes you to use offsetting collections to liquidate the obligations incurred against the contract authority without further appropriation action. In a few cases, such as the foreign military sales program, the law that provides the contract authority also appropriates the receipts without further appropriation action. For other programs, such as certain highway and airport and airway programs, the Congress as a matter of custom requires you to seek an appropriation of receipts to liquidate the obligations. In some instances, if the program does not have sufficient collections to liquidate the obligations incurred against contract authority, the Congress may enact a general fund appropriation. (3) Borrowing authority permits you to incur obligations and authorizes you to borrow funds to liquidate the obligations. Usually, the law authorizing the borrowing specifies that you must borrow from the Treasury, but in a few cases it authorizes borrowing directly from the public. Laws usually authorize borrowing for business -like operations, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, which generates and sells electrical power. Such laws require the program to repay the borrowing, with interest, out of business proceeds. (4) Spending authority from offsetting collections , usually provided in permanent law, permi ts you to credit offsetting collections to an expenditure account (see section 20.7(d) ), to incur obligations, and to make payments using the offsetting collections. You record spending authority from offsetting collections and the offsetting collections in the program and financing schedule of an account (see section 82.18). In the simplest case, you record gross budget authority equal to the cash collections for the year (lines 1700 and 1800) and record the cash collections as an offset to the budget authority (lines 4030-4034 and 4120-4124). Net budget authority equals zero in such cases. In other cases, you must adjust spending authority from cash collections to yield the amount available as budget authority. We describe these adjustments in sectio n 82.18 (lines 1701-1728 and 1801 -1827). We discuss some of these adjustments (offsetting collections credited to expired accounts, changes in SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 15 of Section 20 uncollected customer payments from Federal sources, and amounts precluded from obligation) \u2014in more detail below. Offsetting collections credited to expired accounts . For annual and multi-year accounts that perform reimbursable work, the spending authority from the offsetting collections belongs to the Treasury account that filled the order. (See section 20.11 for the distinction between Treasury accounts (TAFS) and budget accounts.) The availability of the spending authority is generally the same as the Treasury account to which it belongs. If the annual or multi -year Treasury account has expired, then you should NOT record the collection as new spending authority (schedule P lines 1700 and 1800) because it is not available to incur new obligations. It is not new budget authority. However, collections that belong to expired Treasury accounts are available t o pay old bills, until the authority is canceled. You record collections in expired accounts as offsetting collections along with the collections in unexpired accounts (schedule P lines 4030- 4034 and 4120-4124). You report the portion credited to expired accounts only on schedule P lines 4052 or 4142. For more information on determining the period of availability of budget authority, see section 20.4(c) . As discussed in section 20.11, each budget account covers all the Treasury accounts with the same appropriation title. The program and financing schedule covers: Unexpired accounts (annual, multi -year and no -year); and Expired accounts. You subtract all offsetting collections (unexpired and expired) from gross outlays to yield net outlays so that the c ontribution of the budget account to the Federal Government 's bottom line (the surplus or deficit) can be determined. For no-year accounts, you record gross new budget authority (spending authority from offsetting collections) equal to the collections for the year and record the collections as an offset to the budget authority. Because offsetting collections and offsetting receipts are deducted from gross budget authority, they are referred to as negative budget authority for some purposes, such as Congressional Budget Act provisions that pertain to budget authority. Amounts precluded from obligation . A law may preclude you from using some of the offsetting collections to incur obligations. In these cases, the precluded amounts are not counted as bu dget authority. However, you always deduct the full amount of offsetting collections (cash) from gross budget authority and gross outlays in the year you collect them, even where a law precludes you from obligating all or a portion of the collections in t hat year. For this reason, an account can have negative net budget authority or outlays. As a general rule, you record obligations first against new offsetting collections. To the extent that the new offsetting collections are not adequate to cover obligations, you record new budget authority from previously unavailable balances of offsetting collections, but you may not exceed the new obligation limitation, if any. Changes in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources. You need to adjust the spending authority from cash collections if the account is authorized to perform reimbursable work for another Federal account and you incur obligations against receivables from Federal sources and unfilled customer orders from Fe deral sources without an advance\u2014that is, before receiving the cash. The law allows you to incur such obligations as long as the paying account is a Federal account and an obligation is recorded against resources available to the paying account. For example, a financing account can obligate against a subsidy accounts receivable from the program account before the cash is received from the program account if the program account has recorded an obligation in the form of a subsidy accounts payable to the financing SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 16 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) account. (You cannot incur obligations against customer orders received from non-Federal sources without an advance, unless a law specifically allows it.) In these cases, you must add any net increase in such amounts for the year to the spending authority from cash collections, or subtract any net decrease in such amounts for the year from the spending authority from cash collections, to yield the gross budget authority available to the account from offsetting collections. You also add (or subtract) the same amount to offsetting collections (cash) to yield the amount of the offset applied to gross budget authority when calculating net budget authority (see section 82.18). When program levels remain relatively stable, the amount of reimbursements from other Federal Government accounts that is earned but not collected should remain relatively stable and any changes in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources should net to zero. Therefore, unless an account is projecting significant inc reases or decreases in program level, there should be no outyear estimates of changes in uncollected customer payments. (c) Period of availability of budget authority When a law appropriates budget authority, it sets the period during which you can use it to incur new obligations. We call this the period of availability for new obligations of the budget authority, and the period normally is specified in the law providing the budget authority. The period of availability for incurring new obligations is shorter than the period of availability for making disbursements, which is covered by a general law. Each is described below. Period of availability for incurring new obligations: Annual budget authority . This term refers to budget authority that is av ailable for obligation during only one fiscal year or less. One year is the default period of availability for annual appropriations acts (including an appropriation that provides indefinite authority such as \" such sums as may be necessary... \"), because a general provision in each of the acts specifies that the amounts provided in the act are available for one year, unless the act expressly provides otherwise. Even if there were not such a provision, the preamble of an appropriations act says that it is for a specific fiscal year. For example, the following language in an appropriation act would provide one -year budget authority: \" For expenses of the Office of the Secretary, $1,500,000. \" Multi-year budget authority . The language for a specific appropriation of budget authority in an appropriations act or the authorization of the appropriation may make all or some portion of the amount available for obligation for a specified period of time in excess of one fiscal year. Usually, the period covers two or more whole fiscal years, but it may cover a period that includes part of the second fiscal year. We refer to such budget authority as multi -year budget authority or, specifically, as two -year budget authority, three -year budget authority, etc. For example, if the following language appeared in an appropriations act for 2011, it would provide two- year budget authority: \"For research and development, $1,500,000, to remain available until September 30, 2012. \" No-year budget authority . The language for a specific appropriation of budget authority or the authorization of the appropriation may make all or some portion of the amount available until expended. That means you can incur obligations against it indefinitely. We refer to this as no- year budget authority. For example, the following language provides no- year budget authority: \"For construction, improvements, repair or replacement of physical facilities, $1,500,000, to remain available until expended. \" Authorizing laws that make appropriations seldom limit the period of availability, so most budget authority provided in authorizing laws is no-year budget authority. 31 U.S.C. 1555 provi des for the closing of appropriation accounts that are available for indefinite periods if the agency head or the President determines that the purposes of the appropriation have been carried out and no disbursement has been made for two consecutive fiscal years. See Appendix F for a description of line 1029, other balances withdrawn. SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 17 of Section 20 Usually an appropriations act makes budget authority available beginning on October 1 of the fiscal year for which the appropriation act is passed. However, there are three types of appropriations where that is not the case. Advance appropriation, as defined by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (31 U.S.C. 1105(a)(17)), means appropriations of new budget authority provided in an appropriations act that become available one or more fiscal years beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation act was passed. For example, if the following language appeared in an appropriations act for fiscal year 2013, it would provide an advance appropriation for fiscal year 2014: \" For operating expenses, $1,500,000, to become available on October 1, 2013. \" The term \" advan ce appropriation\" applies only to discretionary funding in appropriations acts or to mandatory funding provided in appropriations acts and classified as \" appropriated entitlements \" or \" appropriated mandatories \" by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (see section 21.3(c) ). Under current scoring guidelines, new discretionary budget authority for advance appropriations is scored in the fiscal year in which the funds become available for obligation (see section 21.3 (g)). In this example, you would record the budget authority in fiscal year 2014. Advance funding means appropriations of budget authority provided in an appropriations act to be used, if necessary, to cover obligations incurred late in the fiscal year for benefit payments in excess of the amount specifically appropriated in the act for that year, where the budget authority is charged to the appropriation for the program for the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the appropriations act is passed . When such budget authority is used, the budget records an increase in the budget authority for the fiscal year in which it is used and a reduction in the budget authority for the following fiscal year. The following language, when added to regular appr opriation language, provides advance funding: \"...together with such sums as may be necessary to be charged to the subsequent year appropriation for the payment of compensation and other benefits for any period subsequent to August 15 of the current year. \" Forward funding means appropriations of budget authority that are made available for obligation in the last quarter of the fiscal year for the financing of ongoing grant program during the next fiscal year. The budget records the budget authority in the fiscal year in which it is appropriated. The following language, if it appeared in an appropriation act for 2014, would provide forward funding, which would be recorded in fiscal year 2014: \" ... of which $2,000,000,000 shall become available on July 1, 2014 and shall remain available through September 30, 2015 for academic year 2014-2015. \" Period of availability for making disbursements: Under a general law, annual budget authority and multi -year budget authority may be disbursed during the first two ph ases of the following three phases that make up the life cycle of the budget authority. Unexpired phase. During this time period the budget authority is available for incurring \"new\" obligations. You may make \"new\" grants or sign \"new\" contracts during this phase and you may make disbursements to liquidate the obligations. This phase lasts for a set number of years. Annual budget authority lasts for up to one fiscal year. Multi- year authority lasts for longer periods, currently from over one fiscal year up to 15 fiscal years, and no -year authority lasts indefinitely. Expired phase . During this time period, the budget authority is no longer available for new obligations but is still available for disbursement. This phase lasts five years after the last unexpired year unless the expiration period has been lengthened by legislation. Specifically, you may not incur new obligations against expired budget authority, but you may liquidate existing obligations by making disbursements. SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 18 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) However, you may use the expired budget authority to make certain adjustments to obligations that were incurred before the budget authority expired. For example, you could make an upward adjustment in previously recorded obligations for transportation charges, under an agreement to pay actual transportation charges, if they turned out to be greater than originally estimated. Unless there is an exception in law, you may use expired authority to make adjustments to obligations or disbursements only during a period of five years after the last unexpired year. The expired period can be lengthened by legislation. If you have a program with a legitimate need to disburse funds for more than five years after the authority expires for obligation\u2014for example, to make disbursements ove r many years under direct loan contracts, to pay termination costs under a contract, or to make payments under a lease\u2014and your OMB representative approves, you may propose special language to disburse over a period longer than five years (see section 95.8). You may disburse during the longer period only if the special language is enacted in law. Canceled phase. After the last expired year, the account is closed, and the balances are canceled. The authority to disburse is canceled and is no longer available for any purpose. Any offsetting collections credited to the account at the time the account is canceled or subsequently must be transferred to miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury. Any old bills with valid obligations that show up after the accou nt is closed must be obligated against and disbursed from budget authority that is available for the same general purpose but still in the unexpired phase. For example, an old bill from obligations incurred against an FY 2006 annual salaries and expense (S&E) account that arrives after the authority is canceled must be obligated and disbursed against the corresponding FY 2012 annual S&E account. No-year authority usually stays in the unexpired phase until fully obligated and disbursed. When the purposes for which the authority was made available have been achieved, the account may be closed and the authority canceled. (d) Determining the amount of budget authority If a law provides budget authority in a specific amount, we refer to it as definite budget authority. We consider the budget authority definite when the language provides a ceiling, for example \" not to exceed \" a specified amount. You record the specified amount as budget authority. For example, this language would provide definite budget authority of $100 million: \" For salaries and expenses, not to exceed $100,000,000. \" If a law doesn 't specify an amount of budget authority, but, instead, specifies a variable factor that determines the amount, or a floor, for example \" not less than \" a specified amount, we refer to the budget authority as indefinite. If the law provides \"such sums as may be necessary \" to cover the obligations resulting from an entitlement (such as unemployment insurance), record budget authority in the past year equa l to the amount obligated and in other years equal to your estimate of obligations. If a law authorizes you to obligate all of the receipts from a specified source, record budget authority equal to the amount of receipts you collected in the past year and equal to amounts you estimate you will collect in other years. If a law appropriates a specific amount to be derived from receipts, it limits the amount of budget authority actually provided to the lower of the actual receipts or the amount specified. F or example, if the language read, \"... and, in addition, $75,000,000 of the amounts collected under section 101 of the Authorization Act of 2005, \" you could obligate only the amount actually collected, up to $75,000,000. Similarly, if a law appropriates an amount to be derived from a special or trust fund, it limits the amount of budget authority actually provided to the lower of the amount of the balances in the fund or the specified amount. For example, language that reads, \"For necessary expenses, $1,5 00,000, to be derived from the Land Restoration Trust Fund,\" allows you to obligate only the amount actually in the fund and no more than $1,500,000. If a law authorizes you to obligate all of the receipts credited to a fund, record budget authority SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 19 of Section 20 equal to the amount of receipts collected by the fund in the past year and equal to the amounts you estimate you will collect in other years. Some laws that provide borrowing authority limit the amount of debt that may be outstanding at any one time. This may limit your ability to incur obligations indirectly, because you must consider your ability to borrow the cash needed to liquidate the obligations that will become due, but it doesn' t determine the level of obligations directly. Instead, these laws act mu ch like a revolving line of credit where you may repeatedly borrow up to a limit, make repayments, and borrow again up to the limit, so that over time your total borrowing exceeds the limit on credit outstanding at any point in time. In such cases, treat the budget authority as indefinite and record the amount that you obligated in the past year or estimate you will obligate in other years. Balances of indefinite borrowing authority may not be carried forward in excess of amounts needed to cover obligations. Under the scorekeeping guidelines used by OMB and congressional scorekeepers, OMB will score legislation that imposes or changes a limit of this type only to the extent that we estimate that it will alter the amount of obligations that will be incurre d (see Appendix A, scorekeeping guideline no. 16). Most budget authority provided in appropriations acts is definite, and most budget authority provided in other laws is indefinite. The Congress may enact laws that preclude agencies from using all of th eir potential budget authority. For example, in some cases the Congress enacts limitations on obligations or program levels in appropriations acts that limit the authority to use offsetting collections or receipts provided in authorizing legislation. In other cases, the authorizing law may itself limit the amount of obligations you may incur, such as through a benefit formula that determines the amount of benefits that may be obligated. For special and trust funds with indefinite budget authority whose obligations are constrained by a limitation on obligations or benefit formula, the collections in excess of such limitations or benefit formulas are not counted as budget authority. Similarly, offsetting collections that are precluded from obligation are not counted as budget authority. In these cases, you reduce the spending authority by the precluded amount. The precluded amounts are considered to be unavailable and are not included in the account 's unobligated balances. You record new budget authority in the year the amounts become available for obligation under the law. (e) Discretionary or mandatory and current or permanent budget authority BBEDCA requires us to classify budget authority (and outlays) as either discretionary spending or mandato ry spending, and applies a different set of rules to each type of spending. We explain this further in section 21.3. Sometimes, budget authority is characterized as current or permanent. Current authority requires congressional appropriations action on the request for new budget authority for the year involved. Permanent authority becomes available pursuant to standing provisions of law without further appropriations action by the Congress after transmittal of the budget for the year involved. Genera lly, budget authority is current if an annual appropriations act provided it and permanent if authorizing legislation provides it. By and large, the current/permanent distinction has been replaced by the discretionary/mandatory distinction, which is similar but not identical. A budget account can hold both mandatory and discretionary budget authority, or one or the other, regardless of its historical classification . SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 20 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (f) Unobligated balance An unobligated balance consists of the cumulative amount of budget authority that remains available for obligation under law in unexpired accounts. This means that, unless the law expressly provides otherwise, rescissions and cancellations of unobligated balances apply only to unexpired amounts. In cases where rescissions or cancellations are determined to apply to expired amounts, such amounts would not count as discretionary offsets for appropriations. In budget execution, both the unexpired, unobligated balances of budget authority at the start of the year, (which is available for new obligations) and the expired amounts (which are only available to cover upward adjustments to prior year obligations) are reported as budgetary resources. In budget formulation, only the unexpired, unobligated balances brought forward are reported; expired balances available for adjustment only are not included. Unobligated balances carried forward must meet all of the following conditions: They are balances of budget authority that have never been obligated or that have been obligated and deobligated; They are balances of budget authority that do not expire at the end of the fiscal year; They do not include any amounts for: (1) indefinite appropriations, except available special and trust fund receipts; (2) indefinite borrowing authority; or (3) indefinite contract authority; and The amount can be quantified by subtracting the obligations to date from the amount of budget authority provided (new budget authority and unobligated balances carried forward at the start of the year from the previous fiscal year). That is, the law providing the budget authority must have specified a definite amount or an indefinite amount based on the appropriation of collections from a specified source. \" Such sums as may be necessary \" cannot be quantified. Unavailable special and trust fund receipts or unavailable offsetting collections should not be counted as budget authority and, therefore, there should be no unobligated balances as a result of them. Unavailable receipts are included in the special and trust fund receipts schedule (see section 86.4 ); unavailable offsetting collections are presented as a memorandum entry in the program and financing schedule (see section 82.18 ). In budget schedules, such as the program and financing schedule, the unobligated balance carried forward at the end of a year is equal to the unobligated balance at the start of the next year. The unobligated balances you report for the start and end of the past year must be consistent with the amounts reported in GTAS (see sections 82.11 and 82.12). (g) Obligated balance The term obligated balance is a term of art that is defined in law as a \" net\" concept. It is not the unpaid obligations. The obligated balances are calculated as follows: Take the unpai d obligations (which is the sum of the accounts payable and the undelivered orders); and Subtract the uncollected customer payments from Federal sources (i.e., accounts receivable and the unpaid, unfilled orders from Federal sources). SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 21 of Section 20 (h) Reappropriation A reappropriation is an extension of the availability of unobligated balances of budget authority that have expired or would otherwise expire as a result of legislation enacted subsequent to the law that provided the budget authority. The term does not apply to extensions of the availability of unobligated balances of budget authority that result from standing provisions of law, enacted before the budget authority was provided, or from provisions of law included in the same law that appropriated the funds. An example of an extension included in the same law that appropriated the funds is section 511 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2003, which allows agencies to extend the period of availability (expired to unexpired) of unobligated balances of appropriations (annual or multi -year) provided in the same act. The Act states: \"... not to exceed 50 percent of unobligated balances remaining available at the end of fiscal year 2002 from appropriations made available for salaries and expenses for fiscal year 2002 in this Act, shall remain available through September 30, 2003, ... \" Reappropriations of expired balances that are newly available for obligation in the current or budget year will be recorded as new budget authority (reappr opriations) in the year they are newly available, in the full amount of the potential extension. Likewise, reappropriations of amounts that would expire before the legislation takes affect (e.g., a reappropriation of funds that would expire at the end of FY 2014 included in an FY 2015 appropriations act enacted in August, 2014) would be treated as new budget authority (reappropriations). An example of this type of extension is found in section 137 (Division F) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2003, which states: \"....the funds provided in Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2002, Public Law 107-116, for the National Museum of African American History and Culture Plan for Action Presidential Commission shall remain available until expended. \" In this example the FY 2002 appropriated funds were annual and therefore would have expired at the end of September 30, 2002. The language in the FY 2003 appropriation reappropriated the expired funds to unexpire d no-year funds. Reappropriations of unexpired balances or reappropriations of expired balances that cannot take effect until a fiscal year beyond the budget year will be reported as balance transfers in the year they are newly available for obligation. Similar to reappropriations of unexpired balances, extensions in availability resulting from standing provisions of law or from provisions of law included in the same law that appropriated the funds will be shown as balance transfers. See section 120.66 f or a complete discussion on reporting for all types of extensions in availability. (i) Rescissions and cancellations Rescissions and cancellations are reductions in law of budgetary resources. Reductions are recorded as negative budget aut hority in the year the reduction takes effect, regardless of whether the action reduces new budget authority or unobligated balances. If a law precludes the obligation of budgetary resources in one year and authorizes their obligation in a subsequent year, you record negative budget authority in year of the reduction and new budget authority in the subsequent year. Proposed cancellations and all enacted reductions should be included in the regular budget schedules under transmittal code 0 (see section 79.2). Proposed rescissions, which are subject to the requirements of Title SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 22 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 10 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, require separate schedules under transmittal code 5 (see section 112 ). The Congress can enact reductions in many ways. For example, the language can specify a dollar or percentage reduction and can pertain to a specific account or multiple accounts. Sequestration is also cancellation of budgetary resources (see section 100 for complete guidance on sequestration). Rescissions and cancellations can impact all types of budget authority and can be permanent or temporary subject to the underlying availability of the funds and to the specific statutory authority for the reduction. Rescissions and cancellations of general fund appropriations are considered to be permanent reductions unless the legislation clearly indicates that the reduction is temporary. Permanent reductions of general fund appropriations revert to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Reductions of contract authority and borrowing authority are also usually permanent. Rescissions and cancellations of amounts appropriated from special and trust fund receipts, as well as spending authority from offsetting collections, are considered to be temporary reductions unless legislation states that the reduction is permanent . Temporary reductions remain in the expenditure account from which amounts are being rescinded or cancelled (or in the associated unavailable special or trust fund receipt account in limited situat ions) . Amounts temporarily reduced will be unavailable in the fiscal year they are rescinded or cancelled and are only available in the subsequent fiscal year in accordance with the statutory terms of that appropriations account. Permanent reductions are returned to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Rescissions and cancellations of amounts that have been designated as emergency requirements are not counted as PAYGO offsets for the purposes of the Statutory Pay -As-You -Go Act of 2010. In addition, rescissions and cancellations of amounts that have been designated as a cap adjustment pursuant to a Concurrent Resolution on the Budget or BBEDCA (e.g ., as an emergency requirement or Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War or Terrorism) are not counted as discretionary offsets for base appropriations. (j) Transfer (1) Definition. Transfer means to reduce budgetary resources (budget authority and unobligated balances) in one account and increase them in another, by the same amount. (2) Authority . A transfer may not be made unless a law authorizes it. The law may specify a particular transfer or provide general transfer authority within specified limits. Legislation may include terms such as \"paid to, \" \"transfer to, \" or \"derived from \" when authorizing transfers. (3) Expenditure transfer or nonexpenditure transfer. A transfer is recorded as either an expenditure transfer, which involves an outlay, or a nonexpenditure transfer, which does not involve an outlay. Which you record usually depends on the purpose of the transfer, as explained in the following table, except that nonexpenditure transfers are limited to transactions in which both accounts are within the same fund group (i.e., trust-to -trust or Federal -to-Federal) , except in limited cases. See also e xhibit 20. If the transfer... Record as... (1) purchases goods or services that benefit the transferring account ; for example, transactions under the Economy Act or other authorities, An expenditure transfer. SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 23 of Section 20 If the transfer... Record as... or purchases from revolving funds (including working capital funds), such as a rental payment to GSA 's Federal Buildings Fund...

An expenditure transfer. (3) shifts budgetary resources between a program account and a salaries and expenses account for the purpose of credit program administration... An expenditure transfer. (4) reduces budgetary resources available for the activities of the transferring account and increases them for the activities of the receiving account (for example, a transfer of unobligated balances from the construction account to the salaries and expense s account to fund pa y raises) other than as listed in items 2 and 3 ... A nonexpenditure transfer. (5) corresponds to a transfer of an activity from one account to another (such as in a reorganization)... A nonexpenditure transfer. (6) is for the purpose of a repayable advance between Federal funds and trust funds... A non expenditure transfer . (4) Recording transfers in the budget: Expenditure transfers. Record an expenditure transfer as an obligation (against new budget authority or unobligated balances) and an outlay in the transferring account and as an offsetting collection or offsetting receipt in the receiving account (see section 20.7). If the receiving account is a general fund appropriation account or a revolving fund account (including a trust revolving fund), credit the amount as an offsetting collection to the appropriation or revolving fund account. If the receiving account is a special fu nd or trust fund account, you would normally credit the amount as an offsetting receipt to a receipt account of the fund. Nonexpenditure transfers . Do not record an obligation or an outlay or an offsetting collection or offsetting receipt. Record nonexpenditure transfers as a decrease either in budget authority or unobligated balances in the transferring account and as an increase either in budget authority or unobligated balances in the gaining account. Whether you record the reduction and increase as a change in budget authority or unobligated balances, depends on the circumstances, as described in the following table. If you transfer... And the transfer... Record... Unobligated balances Results from a transfer specified in law enacted after the budget authority was provided and that changes the purpose for which the funds will be used A decrease in budget authority in the transferring account and an increase in budget authority in the gaining account. Unobligated balances Results from general transfer authority provided in a standing provision of A decrease in unobligated balances in the transferring account and SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 24 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) If you transfer... And the transfer... Record... law enacted before the budget authority was provided, or Corresponds to a transfer of an activity such that the purpose does not change (e.g., reorganizations authorized by law) an increase in unobligated balances in the gaining account. Budget authority in the year it becomes available Is for any purpose A decrease in budget authority in the transferring account and an increase in budget authority in the gaining account. (k) Transfer in the estimates A transfer in the estimates means the budget proposes to stop funding an activity under one budget account and start funding the activity under another budget account, beginning in the budget year. This does not involve a transfer of budgetary resources like that discussed in subsection (j). You simply stop showing budget authority in the one account and start showing it in the other. A transfe r in the estimates usually reflects a proposal to do one of the following in the budget year: Transfer the funding of an activity from one account to another. Consolidate funding for related activities from two or more accounts into a single account. Disaggregate the funding for an activity from one account between two or more accounts. See section 82.15 for guidance on presenting these amounts in the program and financing schedules for the transferring and receiving accounts. (l) Allocation Allocatio n means a delegation, authorized in law, by one agency to another agency, of its authority to obligate budget authority and outlay funds. When an agency makes such a delegation, the Treasury Department establishes a subsidiary account called a \" transfer appropriation account \", and the receiving agency may obligate up to the amount included in the account. The budget doesn' t show the transfer appropriation account separately. The budget schedules for the parent account include the obligations by the othe r agency against the subsidiary account. Allocations are appropriate where the receiving agency is acting as the agent for the allocating agency. (m) Transfer and merge When a law states that budgetary resources will be transferred to and merged with another account, the transferred funds will be available for the same purpose and have the same period of availability as the funds in the account to which they are transferred. SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 25 of Section 20 20.5 When should I record obligations and in what amounts? (a) The general rule Obligation means a legally binding agreement that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future. When you place an order, sign a contract, award a grant, purchase a service, or take other actions that require the Government to make payments to the public or from one Government account to another, you incur an obligation. It is a violation of the Antideficiency Act ( 31 U.S.C. 1341(a) ) to involve the Federal Government in a contract or obligation for payment of money before an appropriation is made, unless authorized by law. This means you cannot incur obligations in a vacuum; you incur an obligation against budget authority in a Treasury account that belongs to your agency. It is a violation of the Antideficiency Act to incur an obligation in an amount greater than the amount available in the Treasury account that is available. This means that the account must have budget authority sufficient to cover the total of such obligations at the time the obligation is incurred. In addition, the obligation you incur must conform to other applicable provisions of law, and you must be able to support the amounts reported by the documentary evi dence required by 31 U.S.C. 1501 . Moreover, you are required to maintain certifications and records showing that the amounts have been obligated ( 31 U.S.C. 1108 ). The following subsections provide additional guidance on when to record obligations for the different types of goods and services or the amount ; see Appendix F for discussion of the lines used to record obligations . (b) Personnel compensation and benefits For personnel compensation and benefits the issue is usually the \"timing \" of the obligation and not the \"amount \" of the obligation. The amount is prescribed by laws that cover the civil service and the uniformed service and determined by well-established personnel procedures. As for the timing of the obligation, the amounts generally are recorded as obligat ions as the amounts are earned during the reporting pay period, with the following exceptions: Type of obligations... At the time ... Because... Severance pay It is paid on a pay period by pay period basis Severance pay is not earned with regular salaries and wages. Authorized reimbursable expenses estimated to be paid to employees for real estate, temporary subsistence, and other expenses incident to relocation at the request of the Government The individual travel orders are approved The travel is a bona fide need at the time the order is approved. Cash awards that do not become part of the employee 's basic rate of pay Allowances for uniforms and quarters Subsidies for commuting costs When payable to the employee This is the time the amount is definite. SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 26 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Type of obligations... At the time ... Because... Unemployment compensation payments to the Department of Labor for former Federal employees When the agency receives the bills rendered by Labor Underlying law. Annual leave When it becomes due and payable as terminal leave or tak en in lieu of a lump sum payment Normally, annual leave is unfunded. Funded annual leave When you transfer a person from a revolving fund to another revolving fund, you obligate the employee 's share of funded annual leave and you pay it to the fund to which the employee is transferred When you transfer a person from a revolving fund to a non -revolving fund, you obligate the employee 's portion of the funded annual leave and pay miscellaneous receipts in the general fund of the Treasury The revolving fun d to which the employee is transferred will pay the employee 's salary and wages when the employee takes the annual leave or will pay the lump sum terminal leave for any annual leave not taken. The appropriation from the general fund in the Treasury will pa y the employee 's salaries and wages when the employee takes the annual leave or will pay the lump sum terminal leave for any annual leave not taken. (c) Contractual services and supplies Services and supplies that are purchased by contract are recorded as obligations at the time there is a binding agreement, which is usually when the contract is signed. As a general rule, the amount of the obligation is the maximum liability to the Federal Government. The maximum liability to the Government is normally limited by the terms of the contract (e.g., cancellation clauses). The following provides the nuances of contracts with certain characteristics. Contracts with... Amount obligated is... At the time ... A maximum price The maximum price Amount of downward adjustments (i.e. deobligation), if any The contract is signed. There is documentary evidence that the price is reduced. Letters of intent and letter contracts However, if the letters constitute binding agreements under which Normally, no amount is obligated The maximum amount indicated in the letter that the contractor is The letter is signed. SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 27 of Section 20 Contracts with... Amount obligated is... At the time ... the contractor is authorized to proceed authorized to incur to cover expenses prior to the execution of a definitive contract Contracts for variable quantities The contracts are usually followed by \"purchase orders \" that do obligate the Government Normally, no amount is obligated The amount of actual orders The contract is signed. The order is issued. Orders where a law \"requires \" you to place orders with another Federal Government account The amount of the order The order is issued. Voluntary orders with other Federal Government accounts: If the order is for common- use standard stock item the supplier has on hand or on order at published prices If the order is for stock items other than the above If the order involves execution of a specific contract The amount of the order The order is issued. That you issue the order to the supplier. You receive a formal notificatio n that the items are on hand or on order. The supplying agency notifies you that it has entered into the contract. (d) Intragovernmental services and supplies Obligations are incurred for services (other than the contractual services discussed above) w hen they are rendered. For example, obligations for GSA rental payments are incurred in the year in which the premises are occupied, whether or not a bill has been rendered. Obligations are incurred for supplies when the order is placed. (e) Land and structures Contracts for lands and structures generally follow the same rules as for contracts specified above with the following exceptions. In the case of condemnation proceedings, the amount obligated is the estimated amount for the price of the land, adjusted to the amount of the payment to be held in escrow where there is a declaration of a taking. It is obligated at the time when you ask the Attorney General to start condemnation proceedings. In the case of lease purchases and capital leases covered by the scorekeeping rules developed under the Budget Enforcement Act, see the requirements in Appendix B. SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 28 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) (f) Grants and fixed charges Discretionary grants will be obligated after the amounts are determined administratively and recorded at the time the grant award is signed. The grant award is normally the documentary evidence that the grant has been awarded. Letters of credit are issued after the grant awards are made and generally are not obligating documents. For grants and fixed charges with formulas in law that automatically fix the amount of the charges, record the amount determined by the formula or, if there is an appropriati on, then record the amount appropriated, whichever is smaller. The obligation is reported at the time the grantee is awarded the grant and is liquidated when the payment is made to the grantee. To the extent that a grant awarded in a previous year is no longer valid, you will record a recovery of prior year obligations. The exceptions follow: Grants or fixed charges... Amount obligated is... At the time ... In lieu of taxes The amount appropriated The taxes are due. Interest The amount owed The interest is payable. Dividends The amount declared The dividend is declared. (g) Federal credit programs Obligations in Federal credit programs generally follow the same rules as for \"personnel compensation and benefits\" and \"contracts\" specified above with the following exceptions. The amount is... Amount obligated is... At the time ... Subsidy in direct loan program account The portion of the subsidy cost for the direct loan contract that you are signing You sign the direct loan contract. That is, when you enter into a binding agreement to make a direct loan when specified conditions are fulfilled by the borrower. Subsidy in guaranteed loan program account The portion of the subsidy cost for the binding agreement to make a loan guarantee You make the loan guarantee commitment. That is, when you enter into a binding agreement to make a loan guarantee when special conditions are fulfilled by the borrower, the lender, or any other party to the guarantee agreement. 20.6 What do I need to know about outlays? Outlay means a payment to liquidate an obligation (other than the repayment to the Treasury of debt principal). Outlays are a measure of Government spending. As required by law, the budget presents some SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 29 of Section 20 outla ys as \" on-budget \" and some as \"off -budget. \" Total outlays for the Federal Government include both on-budget and off -budget outlays. Government -wide outlay totals are stated net of refunds, offsetting collections, and offsetting receipts. Function, subfu nction, and agency outlay totals are stated net of related refunds, offsetting collections, and offsetting receipts for most budget presentations. In contrast, offsetting receipts generally are not netted against gross outlays at the bureau level, but when general fund payments are used to finance trust fund outlays to the public, the associated trust fund offsetting receipts are netted against the bureau totals to prevent double -counting budget authority and outlays at the bureau level. (Offsetting receip ts from a few sources do not offset any specific function, subfunction, or agency, but only offset Government -wide outlay totals.) Outlay totals for accounts with offsetting collections are stated both gross and net of the offsetting collections credited to the account. The Government usually makes payments in the form of cash (currency, checks, or electronic fund transfers), and you record outlays equal to the disbursement at the time of the disbursement. Normally the amount of cash disbursed appropri ately measures the value of the transaction. In other cases, however, the cash disbursed does not accurately measure the value of the transactions. In these cases, we require you to record the cash -equivalent value of the transactions (see section 20.8 ). Not every disbursement is an outlay because not every disbursement liquidates an obligation. You don' t record outlays for the following: Repayment of debt principal because we treat borrowing and the repayment of debt principal as a means of financing. Disbursements to the public by Federal credit programs for direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments made in fiscal year 1992 or later (and those made prior to that year if they have been modified) because we treat the cash flows to and from the Government for credit programs as a means of financing. We record outlays equal to the subsidy cost of direct loans and loan guarantees when the underlying direct or guaranteed loans are disbursed. Disbursements from liquidating accounts for direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments made prior to fiscal year 1992 are treated as outlays (see section 185 ). Disbursements from deposit funds because these funds are on deposit with the Government, but are not owned by the Government and are the refore excluded from the budget (see section 20.7). Refunds of receipts that result from overpayments because they are recorded as decreases in receipts, rather than as increases in outlays (see section 20.9). The timing for recording outlays for interest payments varies. Treasury records outlays for the interest on the public issues of Treasury debt securities as the interest accrues, not when it pays the cash. However, most Treasury debt securities held by Government accounts are in the Government account series. Treasury normally records the interest payments on these securities when it pays the cash, and you normally record an offsetting collection or receipt on a cash basis. The Department records interest as the amortization occurs. We discuss the budget treatment of investment transactions in section 113 . Outlays during a fiscal year may liquidate obligations incurred in the same year or in prior years. Obligations, in turn, may be incurred against budget authority provided in the same year or against unobligated balances of budget authority provided in prior years. Outlays, therefore, flow in part from budget authority provided for the year in which the money is spent and in part from budget authority provided in prior years. The ratio of the outlays resulting from budget authority enacted in any year to the amount of that budget authority is referred to as the outlay rate (sometimes informally referred to as the spendout rate ) for that year. SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 30 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Outlays for the past year must agree with amounts reported in the Treasury Combined Statement, unless OMB approves an exception. 20.7 What do I need to know about governmental receipts, offsetting collections, and offsetting receipts? (a) Overview The money collected by the Federal Government and its accounts that is counted as income in the budget is classified as either governmental receipts (also known as receipts or revenues) or as offsets to budget authority and outlays. We sometimes use the generic term collections when referring to all of t his money. Collections result from the following transactions: Sovereign power \u2014payments from the public that result primarily from the Government 's exercise of its sovereign power to tax or otherwise compel payment. Business-like transactions with the pu blic, including payments from the public in exchange for goods and services; reimbursements for damages; and gifts or donations of money to the Government. Intragovernmental transactions \u2014payments from other Federal Government accounts. The universe of money collected also includes the proceeds of borrowing and the other means of financing which are not treated as collections in the budget. Means of financing are discussed in section 20.7(h). The Federal Government normally receives payments in the form of cash and normally records amounts equal to the amount of cash received at the time of collection. Usually the amount of cash collected appropriately measures the value of the transaction. In some cases, the cash collected does not accurately measure the value of the transaction. In these cases, you record the cash equivalent value of the transactions (see section 20.8). As recommended by the 1967 President 's Commission on Budget Concepts, the budget records money collected by Government agencies in one of two ways\u2014depending on the nature of the activity generating the collection and the law that established the collection: Governmental receipts, which are compared in total to outlays (net of offsetting collections and offsetting receipts) to calculate the surplus or deficit; or Offsets to budget authority and outlays (classified as either offsetting collections or offsetting receipts), which are deducted from gross budget authority and outlays to produce net budget authority and outlay figures. SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 31 of Section 20 (b) Governmental receipts Governmental receipts are collections that result from the Government 's exercise of its sovereign power to tax or otherwise compel payment. Sometimes they are called receipts, Federal receipts, or revenues. They consist mostly of individual and corporation income taxes and social insurance taxes, but also include excise taxes, compulsory user charges, regulatory fees, custom duties, court fines, certain license fees, and deposits of earning by the Federal Reserve System. Governmental receipts are deposited in receipt accounts. See section 20.7(f) for more detail on receipt accounts. The types of governmental receipts are summarized in the diagram below. Total governmental receipts for the Federal Government include both on -budget and off -budget receipts. For more information on collections, see the \"Governmental Receipts\" and \"Offsetting Collections and Offsetting Receipts\" chapters in the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget. SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 32 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (c) General information about offsets to budget authority and outlays Offsetting collections and offsetting receipts are recorded as offsets to spending, not as additions to the receipt side of the budget. They are recorded as offsets to spending so that the budget totals represent governmental rather than market activity and to prevent double counting from intragove rnmental transactions. This ensures that the budget totals measure the transactions of the Government with the public. They are recorded in the budget in one of two ways, based on interpretation of laws and longstanding budget concepts and practice. They are offsetting collections when the collections are authorized to be credited to expenditure accounts. Otherwise, they are deposited in receipt accounts and called offsetting receipts. See section 20.7(f) for more detail on receipt and expenditure accounts. Offsetting collections and offsetting receipts are classified according to the type and source of the money collected and how it is treated in the budget. Offsetting collections and offsetting receip ts result from one of the following types of transactions: Business -like transactions with the public \u2014these include voluntary collections from the public in exchange for goods or services; reimbursements for damages (e.g., recoveries by the Hazardous Substance Superfund); and gifts of money to the Government. The budget records these amounts as offsetting collections from non-Federal resources for offsetting collections or as proprietary receipts for offsetting receipts. The amounts are deducted from gro ss budget authority and gross outlays, rather than added to receipts. This produces budget totals for receipts, budget authority, and outlays that represent governmental rather than market activity. Intragovernmental transactions\u2014collections from other Federal Government accounts. The budget records collections by one Government account from another as offsetting collections from Federal sources for offsetting collections or as intragovernmental receipts for offsetting receipts. Intragovernmental offset ting receipts can be further divided into two categories: Interfund receipts, which involve transactions between Federal and trust fund accounts; and Intrafund receipts, which involve transactions between the same types of fund groups (i.e., from Federal fund to Federal fund or from trust fund to trust fund. The amounts are deducted from gross budget authority and gross outlays so that the budget totals measure the transactions of the Government with the public. Offsetting governmental transactions\u2014collections from the public that are governmental in nature (e.g., tax receipts, regulatory fees, compulsory user charges), but required by law to be misclassified as offsetting. The budget records amounts from non-Federal sources that are governmental in nature as offsetting governmental collections for offsetting collections or as offsetting governmental receipts for offsetting receipts. (d) Offsetting collections Some laws authorize agencies to credit collections directly to the account from which they will be spent. Most revolving funds operate with such authority. Offsetting collections credited to expenditure accounts automatically offset outlays and budget authority at the expenditure account level. Where accounts have offsetting collections, the b udget shows the budget authority and outlays of the account both gross (before deducting offsetting collections) and net (after deducting offsetting collections). Totals for the agency, subfunction, and budget are net of offsetting collections. SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 33 of Section 20 Line codes are used to identify the source of the collections in OMB 's budget database. See section 82.18 for the offsetting collection line entries and the definitions. The offsets are used to arrive at net budget authority and outlays for the account and are presented in the program and financing (schedule P) in the Appendix to the President 's Budget. The following chart summarizes the types of offsetting collections and the associated line codes reported in MAX A-11 DE : (e) Offsetting receipts Collections that are offset against gross outlays and budget authority but are not authorized to be credited to expenditure accounts are credited to receipt accounts and are called offsetting receipts. They are deducted from budget authority and outlays in arriving at total budget authority and outlays. However, unlike offsetting collections that are credited to expenditure accounts, offsetting receipts do not offset budget authority and outlays at the account level. Most offsetting receipts deposited in receipt accounts are offset at the agency and subfunction levels, and the offsetting receipts of certain general fund payments are offset at the bureau levels. We call these distributed offsetting receipts. A few offsetting receipts are offset at governm ent-wide totals. We call these undistributed offsetting receipts. For more information on the magnitude of undistributed offsetting receipts see Table 18 -2 in the Anal ytical Perspectives volume of the President 's Budget. Within OMB 's budget database, offsetting receipts are coded to identify the types of offsetting receipt (e.g., proprietary, offsetting governmental, intragovernmental) and to identify how they are treated (e.g., offset at the agency and function level). Each offsetting receipt type also has a number of unique and associated source category codes that enable MAX A-11 DE to produce tables needed for the Budget. These are assigned by OMB when the account is established (see exhibit 79B ). The following chart summarizes the receipt types, with associated receipt type codes in parentheses, for the various types of offsetting receipts. SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 34 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (f) Receipt accounts and expenditure accounts The placement of collections in receipt accounts or expenditure accounts is based on the interpretation of laws and long -standing budget concepts and practice. Receipt accounts.\u2014A general law requires that, except as provided by another law, an official or agent of the Government who receives money for the Federal Government from any source shall deposit the money in the Treasury as soon as practicable. This law (31 U.S.C. 3302) is generally referred to as the \"Miscellaneous Receipts Act.\" The Department of the Treasur y, in consultation with OMB, interprets this law as requiring all collections to be deposited in general fund receipt accounts, which as a group comprise part of \" the general fund. \" Some laws earmark collections from a certain source for a specific purpose. Depending on the legal requirements, Treasury deposits these collections in special fund receipt accounts, trust fund receipt accounts, or credits the collections directly to expenditure accounts, including revolving fund accounts. The legislation als o specifies whether the earmarked receipts are (i) available for obligation and outlay without further appropriations action by the Congress (i.e., available), or (ii) not available for obligation or outlay until the Congress makes the amounts available in annual appropriations or other acts (i.e., unavailable). However, in some cases, receipts are considered to be unavailable because a benefit formula or limitation precludes their use. These amounts of receipts may become available subsequently without appropriations action. See section 20.4(b) for more information about amounts precluded from obligation. When the collections in the receipt accounts are available for obligation and outlay, the amounts are appropriated to general fund, special fund, trust fund, or other expenditure accounts, as discussed below. Expenditure accounts.\u2014Some laws override the requirement to first deposit collections in receipt accounts. These collections are credited directly to expenditure accounts, where the collections are generally available for obligation and outlay without further action by the Congress. These collections are SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 35 of Section 20 called offsetting collections. Most revolving funds operate under such authority. These include public enterprise, intragovernmental, and tru st revolving funds. In addition, the Economy Act allows Federal agencies or bureaus within agencies to do work for each other. When one account reimburses another account for this work, the Act authorizes the collections to be credited directly to the ex penditure account that provided the goods and services. (g) User charges User charge means a fee, charge, or assessment the Government levies on a class of the public directly benefiting from, or subject to regulation by, a Government program or activity. We record user charges as governmental receipts, offsetting collections, or offsetting receipts using the criteria described above. The authorizing law must limit the payers of the charges to those benefiting from, or subject to regulation by, the program or activity. User charges include: Collections from non-Federal sources for goods and services provided (for example, the proceeds from the sale of goods by defense commissaries, electricity by power marketing administrations, stamps by the Postal Service; fees charged to enter national parks; and premiums charged for flood and health insurance); Voluntary payments to social insurance programs, such as Medicare Part B insurance premiums; Miscellaneous customs fees (for example, Uni ted States Customs Service merchandise processing fees); Proceeds from asset sales (property, plant, and equipment); Proceeds from the sale of natural resources (such as timber, oil, and minerals); Outer Continental Shelf receipts; Spectrum auction proceed s; Many fees for permits, and regulatory and judicial services; Specific taxes and duties on an exception basis; and Credit program fees deposited into the credit program account and recorded in the budget on a current basis. User charges do not include: Collections from other Federal accounts; Collections associated with credit programs, except for credit program fees deposited into credit program accounts and recorded in the budget on a current basis; Realizations upon loans and investments; Interest, di vidends, and other earnings; Payments to social insurance programs required by law; Excise taxes; Customs duties; Fines, penalties, and forfeitures; Cost-sharing contributions; and SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 36 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Federal Reserve System deposits of earnings. (h) Means of financing These are monies received or paid by the Government that are not counted in the budget totals as either collections (governmental receipts, offsetting collections, or offsetting receipts) or outgo (outlays). Borrowing and the repayment of debt are the pri mary means of financing. Others are listed below. These monies finance outlays when there is a deficit \u2014that is, when outlays (net of offsetting collections and offsetting receipts) exceed receipts. When there is a surplus\u2014that is, when receipts exceed outlays (net of offsetting collections and offsetting receipts) \u2014the means of financing may be used, together with the surplus, to retire debt. Most of the individual means of financing represent changes in assets or liabilities and therefore can either be a source of financing for the Government or require financing themselves. For example, if the disbursements from credit financing accounts exceed their collections, which is normal, the difference must be financed by receipts or the other means of financing; if the disbursements are less than the collections, the difference may be used to reduce borrowing or to provide any financing required by the other means of financing. The means of financing other than borrowing and repayment of debt include: Net financing disbursements by direct loan and guaranteed loan financing accounts; Seigniorage (the profit from coining money) and profits on the sale of gold (a monetary asset); Certain exchanges of cash, such as deposits by the U.S. in the International Monetary Fund; Changes in Treasury 's operating cash balance, uninvested deposit fund balances, and checks outstanding; and Treasury debt buyback premiums and discounts (see section 113). For more information on the means of financing, see the section on Budge t Deficit or Surplus and Means of Financing in Chapter 15 , \"Budget Concepts \" of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the President 's Budget. 20.8 What do I need to know about cash-equivalent transactions? Normally the amount of cash disbursed or collected is the appropriate measure of the value of the transaction, and you record outlays or collections equal to the cash that changes hands. In other cases, howe ver, the cash disbursed or collected doesn 't accurately measure the value of the transactions. In these cases, you should record the cash -equivalent value of the transactions in the budget. The following are some examples of cash -equivalent transactions: Federal employee salaries. You record an outlay for the full amount of an employee' s salary, even though the cash disbursement is net of Federal and state income taxes, retirement contributions, life and health insurance premiums, and other deductions. We record collections for the deductions that are payments to the Government. Debt instruments. When the Government receives or makes payments in the form of debt instruments (such as bonds, debentures, monetary credits, or notes) in lieu of cash, we reco rd collections or outlays in the budget on a cash-equivalent basis. The Government can borrow from the public to raise cash and then outlay the cash proceeds to liquidate an obligation, or, if authorized in law, it may liquidate the obligation by issuing securities in lieu of the cash. The latter method combines two transactions into one\u2014borrowing and an outlay. Combining these transactions into one does not change the nature of the transactions. Since the two methods of payment are equivalent, we require you to record the same amount of outlays for both cases. Similarly, when the Government accepts securities in lieu of cash from the public in payment of an obligation owed SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 37 of Section 20 to the Government, we record offsetting receipts or collections. In one program, for example, a Government agency may choose whether to pay default claims against it in cash or by issuing debentures in lieu of cash; the agency records the same amount of outlays in either case. In turn, a recipient of these debentures may choose to pay the fees that it owes to the Government either in cash or by returning debentures of equivalent value that it holds. The agency records the same amount of offsetting receipts or collections in either case. Lease-purchases. We require you to record an outlay for the acquisition of physical assets through certain types of lease-purchase arrangements as though the transaction was an outright purchase or direct Federal construction. Lease-purchase transactions in which the Government assumes substantial risk are equivalent to the Government raising cash by borrowing from the public and purchasing the asset directly by disbursing the cash proceeds. You must report outlays over the period that the contractor constructs, manufactures, or purchases the asset that will be leased to the Government, not when the Government disburses cash to the developer for lease payments. Because the Government pays no cash up front to the nominal owner of the asset, the transaction creates a Government debt. In such cases, we treat the subsequent cash lease payments as the equivalent of interest outlays on that debt and principal repayments. (See Appendix B) The scorekeeping effect of cash -equivalent transactions applies to budget authority, as well as to outlays and collections. You record the authority to incur obligations that will be liquidated through cash-equivalent payments as budget authority. The use of cash -equivalents often results in an increase or decrease in Federal debt. In the previous example of the Gove rnment using debentures to pay claims, we record the issuance of a debenture as an increase in debt, and we record the Government 's acceptance of a debenture for payment of fees as a decrease in debt. We also record an increase in debt as the means of financing the cash -equivalent outlays of lease -purchase arrangements in which the Government assumes substantial risk. 20.9 What do I need to know about refunds? Refunds are the repayments of excess payments. The amounts are directly related to previous obligations incurred and outlays made against the appropriation. Refunds received are deposited to the credit of the appropriation or fund account charged with the original obligations as explained in the following table: The following table explains how to record refunds received: If you receive a refund of funds that were... And the appropriation against which the obligation was incurred... You... (1) obligated and outlayed in that year remains available (usually the case) reduce the total amount of obligations and outlays recorded for the year in the budget schedules. (2) obligated and outlayed in a previous year and credited to the same appropriation or fund account remains available for new obligations record the refund as offsetting collections (cash) credited to unexpired accounts (i.e., as offsetting collections on lines 4030 - 4034 or 4120- 4124) and as recoveries of prior year paid obligations, unexpired accounts on line 4053 or 4143; increasing unobligated balances. These SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 38 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) If you receive a refund of funds that were... And the appropriation against which the obligation was incurred... You... offsetting collections are not reported as new budget authority; they are offset against gross outlays but not against gross budget authority. (3) obligated and outlayed in a previous year and credited to a different appropriation or fund account remains availabl e for new obligations record the refund as offsetting collections (cash) credited to unexpired accounts (i.e., as offsetting collections on lines 4030 - 4034 or 4120- 4124); increasing spending authority from offsetting collections. (4) receive a refund of funds that were obligated and outlayed in a previous year has expired but is not yet canceled record the refund as offsetting collections (cash) credited to expired accounts (i.e., as offsetting collections on lines 4030- 4034 or 4120-4124; as offsetting collections credited to expired accounts on line 4052 or 4142 of the schedule P); and recoveries of prior year paid obligations on line 4054 or 4144 of the SF 133). These offsetting collections are not reported as new budget authori ty; they are offset against gross outlays but not against gross budget authority. (5) receive a refund of funds that were obligated in a previous year has been canceled deposit the refund in miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury. Record refunds paid as follows: Record refunds paid by an expenditure account as an obligation and an outlay of the account. Record refunds of receipts that result from overpayments (such as income taxes withheld in excess of a taxpayer 's income tax liability) as reductions of receipts, rather than as outlays. This does not include payments to a taxpayer for credits (such as an earned income tax credit) that exceed the taxpayer 's income tax liability. Record these as outlays, not as refunds. 20.10 What do I need to know about advances? Advances are amounts of money prepaid to a Federal Government account for the later receipt of goods, services, or other assets, or as matching funds. When an advance is required, the budgetary resource provided by the order is e qual to the cash accompanying the order. The advance, per se, is not available for obligation. If both the order and the advance were available for obligation, budgetary resources would be double-counted. Deposit advances with orders in the appropriate appropriation/fund or receipt account. SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 39 of Section 20 Deposit advances without orders as follows: If the advance is from... Deposit the advance in... A non -Federal source Deposit fund account (6500) A Federal source An intragovernmental clearing account (F3885) When a reimbursable agreement with another Federal account is accompanied by a cash advance, you may disburse to pay obligations associated with that advance. However, if you are authorized to incur obligations against customer orders from other Federal accounts without an advance, the order establishes obligational authority only and you may not disburse the account into a negative position (see section 145.2 on Antideficiency Act violations). If you return a cash advance or other offsetting collection or special or trust fund receipts received in a prior fiscal year, you must record an obligation and an outlay in the current fiscal year. 20.11 What do I need to know about accounts and fund types? (a) Accounts The term account may refer to a receipt or expenditure account. Governmental receipts and offsetting receipts are deposited into receipt accounts (see section 20.7 ). Receipt accounts are not available for incurring obligations or making outlays. Expenditure accounts are provided with budget authority (e.g., appropriations or offsetting collections) and are used to incur obligations and make outlays. Receipt and expenditure accounts are further classified into fund types (e.g., general funds and special funds). Fund types are discussed in su bsections 20.12(b) through 20.12(f) below. The term account may also refer to Treasury accounts and budget accounts (also commonly referred to as an OMB account). When the Congress provides budget authority for a particular purpose or under a particular title, it also provides a specific period of time for which the budget authority is available for obligation. This time period of availability (POA) may be annual, multi-year, or no -year. Treasury establishes expenditure accounts based on the POA of the resources in the account. That is, Treasury establishes separate accounts with separate Treasury appropriation fund symbols (TAFS) for each POA, i.e., annual, multi-year, or no- year amount. For budget execution, which is governed largely by the Antide ficiency Act, you must report data for each of the TAFS expenditure accounts established by Treasury (see section 130). A budget account (also commonly referred to as an OMB account) generally covers an organized set of activities, programs, or services directed toward a common purpose or goal. For budget formulation, the appropriations and other budget authority provided to TAFS accounts with the same appropriation title for the years covered by the budget are combined and presented as a single account under a single title, e.g., \"Salaries and expenses.\" As an illustration, the FY 2017 column of the program and financing schedule for a \"Salaries and expenses\" account in the 2019 Appendix would include, as appropriate, outlays made in FY 2017 from the FY 2017 appropriation, the FY 2015 -2017 multi -year appropriation, the no- year appropriation, and the five expired annual appropriations (FY 2012 through FY 2016). For receipt accounts, the budget and Treasury accounts are usually the same. For information on account identification codes, see section 79.2 . SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 40 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (b) Overview of fund types Agency activities are financed through general funds, special funds, and revol ving funds (public enterprise revolving funds, intragovernmental revolving funds, credit financing accounts), which constitute the Federal funds group, and trust funds and trust revolving funds, which constitute the trust funds group. General, special, an d trust fund collections and disbursements may be held temporarily in clearing accounts pending clearance to the applicable account. Agencies account for amounts that are not Government funds in deposit funds. The following table summarizes the character istics of these funds.

No. 1 By law, the budget authority and the outlays (net of offsetting collections) of the Postal Service Fund (a revolving fund), a nd the receipts, budget authority, and outlays of the two social security trust funds (the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund) are excluded from the on-budget totals. The budget documents present these amounts as \"off-budget\" and adds them to the budget totals to show totals for the Federal Government (sometimes called unified budget totals). (c) Federal funds Federal funds comprise several types of accounts or funds. A general fund receipt account records receipts not earmarked by law for a specific purpose, such as individual income tax receipts. A general fund expenditure account records appropriations from the general fund and the associated transactions, such as obligations and outlays. General fund appropriations draw from general fund receipts collectively and, therefore, are not specifically linked to receipt accounts. The Federal funds group also includes special funds and revolving funds, both of which earmark collections for spending on specific purposes. We establish a special fund where the law requires us to earmark collections from a specified source to finance a particular program, and the law neither authorizes the fund to conduct a cycle of business -type operations (making it a revolving fund) nor designates it as a trust fund. For example, a law established the Land and Water Conservation Fund, earmarking a portion of rents and royalties from Outer Continental Shelf lands and other receipts to be used for land acquisition, conservation, and recreation programs. The receipts earmarked to a fund are recorded in one or more special fund receipt accounts. More than one receipt account may be necessary to distinguish different types of receipts (governmental, proprietary, etc.) and receipts from significantly different types of transactions (registration fees vs. fines and penalties, for example). The fund 's appropriations and associated transactions are recorded in a special fund expenditure account. Most funds have only one expenditure account, even if they have multiple receipt accounts. However, a large fund, especially one with appropriations to more than one agency (such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund), may have more than one expenditure account. The majority of special fund collections are derived from the Government 's power to impose taxes, fines, and other compulsory payments, and they must be appropriated before they can be obligated and spent. Revolving funds conduct continuing cycles of business -like activity. They charge for the sale of products or services and use the proceeds to finance their spending. Instead of recording the collections in receipt accounts (as offsetting receipts), the budget records the collections and the outlays of revolving funds in the same account. The laws that establish revolving funds authorize the collections to be obligated and outlayed for the purposes of the fund without further appropriation. The law of supply and demand is expected to regulate such funds. However, in some cases, the Congress enacts obligation limitations on the SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 43 of Section 20 funds in appropriations acts as a way of controlling their expenditures (for example, a limitation on administrative expenses). There are two types of revolving funds in the Federal funds group. Public enterprise funds, such as the Postal Service Fund, conduct business-like operations mainly with the public. Intragovernment al funds, such as the Federal Buildings Fund, conduct business -like operations mainly within and between Government agencies. (d) Trust funds Trust funds account for the receipt and expenditure of monies by the Government for carrying out specific purposes and programs in accordance with the terms of a statute that designates the fund as a trust fund (such as the Highway Trust Fund) or for carrying out the stipulations of a trust agreement where the Nation is the beneficiary (such as any of several trust funds for gifts and donations for specific purposes). Like special funds and revolving funds, trust funds earmark collections for spending on specific purposes. Many of the larger trust funds finance social insurance payments for individuals, such as S ocial Security, Medicare, and unemployment compensation. Other major trust funds finance military and Federal civilian employees' retirement, highway and mass transit construction, and airport and airway development. A trust fund normally consists of one or more receipt accounts to record receipts and an expenditure account to record the appropriation of the receipts and associated transactions. Some trust funds have multiple receipt accounts for the same reasons that special funds have them. Also, like special funds, large trust funds (such as the Highway Trust Fund) may have multiple expenditure accounts. A few trust funds, such as the Veterans Special Life Insurance fund and the Employees Life Insurance Fund, are established by law as revolving funds . These funds operate the same way as revolving funds in the Federal funds group, and we call them trust revolving funds. They conduct a cycle of business -type operations. The collections are credited to the expenditure account as offsetting collections and their outlays are displayed net of collections in a single expenditure account. The Federal budget meaning of the term \"trust\", as applied to trust fund accounts, differs significantly from its private sector usage. In the private sector, the benefi ciary of a trust usually owns the trust 's assets, which are managed by a trustee who must follow the stipulations of the trust. In contrast, the Federal Government owns the assets of most Federal trust funds, and it can raise or lower future trust fund co llections and payments, or change the purposes for which the collections are used, by changing existing laws. There is no substantive difference between these trust funds and special funds or between trust revolving funds and public enterprise revolving f unds. Whether a particular fund is designated in law as a trust fund is, in many cases, arbitrary. For example, the National Service Life Insurance Fund is a trust fund, but the Servicemen 's Group Life Insurance Fund is a Federal fund, even though both a re financed by earmarked fees paid by veterans and both provide life insurance payments to veterans ' beneficiaries. There are a few Federal trust funds that are managed pursuant to a trust agreement. These are identified in the budget as \" gift funds \". In addition, the Government does act as a true trustee on behalf of some entities outside of the Government where it makes no decisions about the amount of these deposits or how they are spent. For example, it maintains accounts on behalf of individual Fe deral employees in the Thrift Savings Fund, investing them as directed by the individual employee. The Government accounts for such funds in deposit funds (see the section after next). In cases where the law provides an appropriation from the General Fun d of the U.S. Treasury to a trust fund, a general fund expenditure account and an associated trust fund receipt account are used to record the financial transaction that moves resources between fund types. SECTION 20\u2014 TERMS AND CONCEPTS Page 44 of Section 20 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (e) Clearing accounts You use clearing accounts to temporarily account for transactions that you know belong to the Government while you wait for information that will allow you to match the transaction to a specific receipt or expenditure account. For example: To temporarily credit unclassified transactions from the public when there is a reasonable presumption that the amounts belong to a Federal Government account other than miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury. To temporarily credit unclassified transactions between Federal agencies, incl uding Intragovernmental Payment and Collection (IPAC) transactions. You should not use clearing accounts to mask an overobligation or overexpenditure of an expenditure account. (f) Deposit funds You use deposit funds to account for monies that do not belong to the Government. This includes monies held temporarily by the Government until ownership is determined (such as earnest money paid by bidders for mineral leases) or held by the Government as an agent for others (such as State and local income tax es withheld from Federal employees' salaries and not yet paid to the State or local government). We exclude deposit fund transactions, as such, from the budget totals because the funds are not owned by the Government. Therefore, the budget records transactions between deposit funds and budgetary accounts as transactions with the public. For example, when the mineral leasing process has been completed, the winning bidder 's earnest money is transferred from the deposit fund to the appropriate receipt accou nt and the budget records a receipt. Similarly, outlays are recorded in an agency 's salaries and expense account when a Federal employee is paid, even though some of the amount is transferred to a deposit fund for State and local income taxes withheld and paid later to the State and local government. Deposits and associated disbursements are recorded in the same account. 20.12 What do I need to know about reimbursable work? Agencies can perform reimbursable work for the public or other Federal agencies. The types of laws that allow you to use advances or reimbursements in return for providing others with goods and services are: Laws that establish revolving funds, including franchise funds and working capital funds; Provisions in appropriations or subs tantive laws that allow agencies to use the amounts they collect; and The Economy Act (31.U.S.C. 1535). Generally speaking, laws that authorize an agency to enter into a \" reimbursable agreement\" with non- Federal transaction partners only provide authority to deposit collections into the agency 's account, rather than the Miscellaneous Receipts Account (31 U.S.C. 3302). One such example is the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1969 (31 U.S.C. 6 501). Authority to enter into a \" reimbursable agreement \" is not sufficient to allow you to record a budgetary resource against account receivable absent additional express statutory authority to do so. Additionally, only activity resulting from a \" reimbursable agreement \" (e.g., an interagency agreement or a buyer/seller relationship) should be classified as reimbursable. For more information on direct and reimbursable authority, see sections 82.5(c) and 83.5 . SECTION 20 \u2014TERMS AND CONCEPTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 45 of Section 20 (a) Revolving funds You may use a rev olving fund when a law establishes the revolving funds and authorizes you to credit payments to the revolving fund that performs the work. Revolving funds operate on a reimbursable basis when working capital (undisbursed cash) is available. Otherwise, advance payments must accompany orders. You may not disburse revolving funds into a negative cash position in anticipation of Federal or non-Federal reimbursements because of the Antideficiency Act. (b) Payments from non-Federal entities If the law author izes an expenditure account to perform work for the public and to credit collections from non-Federal entities as spending authority, you may cover obligations incurred by the account by: Advances collected up to the amount of accompanying orders (see sect ion 20.10 for treatment of advances); and Working capital that is available for this purpose. (c) Economy Act The Act authorizes the head of an agency or major organizational unit within an agency to place an order with a major organizational unit with in the same agency or another Federal agency for goods or services provided that: The ordering agency has enough money to pay for the order; The head of the ordering agency or unit decides the order is in the best interest of the United States Government ; The agency or unit to fill the order is able to provide or get by contract the ordered goods or services; The head of the ordering agency decides that the ordered goods or services cannot be provided by contract as conveniently or cheaply by a commercial enterprise; and Transactions authorized by the Economy Act are limited by the statutory requirement that the amount obligated by the ordering appropriation is required to be deobligated to the extent that the agency or unit filling the order has not incurred obligations before the end of the period of availability of the ordering appropriation. Under the Economy Act, payment (via expenditure transfer) may be made in advance or reimbursements may be made.

Summary of Changes Update to reflect the statutory discretionary caps adopted in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118-5) and to clarify that Administrative Pay-as-you-go, also adopted in that Act, is not related to Statutory P ay-as-you-go (section 21.4) . 21.1 What is scoring ? S coring is the process of estimating the change in Government spending and collections resulting from enacted or proposed legislation, compared to what would happen in the absence of that legislation. These estimates are prepared both to inform policy makers of the budgetary effects of proposed legislation, and to inform congressional and statutory budget enforcement procedures. 21.2 When does scoring occur during the budget process ? S coring occurs typically during budget formulation, the consideration of proposed legislation, and after a law has been enacted. Bu dget formulation. As part of the budget formulation process, a gencies submit baseline program levels and discretionary, mandatory, and governmental receipt proposals to OMB for consideration. Agencies work with OMB to determine the effect of proposals on budget authority, collections, and outlays based on the Administration' s economic and technical assumptions. The scored level of budget authority, collections, and outlays for each app roved budget proposal and the baseline for all programs create an overall picture of the President 's proposed fiscal path. C ongressional process and enactment . During the legislative process, CBO is required by statute to score legislation. Such scoring advises congressional committees on compliance with congressional budget SECTION 21\u2014 OVERVIEW OF SCORING LEGISLATION Page 2 of Section 21 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) enforcement procedures. OMB scores the estimated costs of the annual appropriations bills and publishes PAYGO scorecards that include estimates of enacted legislation that affects mandatory spending or governmental receipts. A sequestration is triggered at the end of a legislative session if OMB's PAYGO scorecard s show a debit in the budget year. See section 100.3 for more information on sequestration, section 100.4 for the budget enforcement reports issued by OMB, and section 15.3 for more information on the congressional budget process. 21.3 What are the basic concepts I need to know to score legislation? (a) Overview of budget laws The Balanced Budget and Em ergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) divides spending into two categories\u2014discretionary and mandatory. The Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference for the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA of 1997) classified all accounts under the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction at the time as discretionary , mandatory, or split between discretionary and mandatory. The \"scorekeepers\" (House and Senate Budget Committees, CBO, and OMB) consult on the classification of spending, determine the classification of new accounts, and may reclassify the designation of an existing account. Discretionary and mandatory spending are controlled by different enforcement procedures. Congress controls discretionary budget authority and outlays through the congressional budget process governed by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Under that Act, Congress sets limits on discretionary budget authority and outlays , in total and for specific categories of spending, through allocations and suballocations . For mandatory spending, t he Statutory Pay -As-You -Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) reestablished and made permanent a statutory procedure to enforce deficit neutrality on new revenue and mandatory spending legislation. For more information on these statutes and budge t enforcement, see the \"Budget Concepts\" and \"Budget Process\" chapters in the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget. For detailed information on how sequestration is applied for purposes of budget enforcement, see section 100 . (b) Definition of discretionary spending Discretionary spending is the budget authority provided by appropriations Acts and the outlays that result from that budget authority. For example, the budget authority and outlays for the salaries and expenses of Federal personnel and other operating expenses of Government agencies are usually pro vided by appropriations A cts and, therefore, are usually discretionary. (c) Definition of mandatory spending Mandatory spending , also referred to as \" direct spending, \" is budget authority and outlays provided by permanent laws. For example, permanent laws authorize payments for Medicare, unemployment insurance benefits, and farm price supports, so the budget aut hority and outlays for these programs are mandatory. In addition, budget authority provided in annual appropriations Acts for certain programs, such as Medicaid, is treated as mandatory . Such accounts are called \"appropriated entitlements \" or \"appropria ted mandatories. \" The BBA of 1997 classified these accounts as such, predominantly because the authorizing legislation directs that the Government make or beneficiaries receive payment s. While mandatory and discretionary classifications are used for measu ring compliance with budget enforcement procedures and PAYGO, they do not determine whether a program provides legal entitlement to a payment or benefit or the availability of funding. You should address questions about account and spending classifications and legal entitlements to your OMB representative. SECTION 21\u2014 OVERVIEW OF SCORING LEGISLATION OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 21 (d) Committee of jurisdiction When scoring legislative language or a Budget proposal , it is important to know which congressional committee s have jurisdiction over the proposal and whether the affected spending is mandatory or discretionary, or whether the proposal would affect governmental receipts. While most scoring concepts apply to each type of spending and to governmental receipts, the budget enforcement laws differ. Authorizing committees have j urisdiction over mandatory (or \"direct\") spending and governmental receipts, and budget enforcement for this spending is governed by PAYGO. The Appropriations Committees have jurisdiction over discretionary spending, and budget enforcement is governed through the Congressional enforcement procedures referenced above. In some cases, legislative action by an appropriations committee may affect spending or receipts under the jurisdiction of an authorizing committee, and vice versa. In these cases, the budgetary effects are scored using the budget enforcement associated with the committee taking the legislative action. Explicit OMB approval is required to include authorizing language in the Budget Appendix , either as account -specific appropriations langua ge or as a general provision. Please consult first with your OMB representative if your agency has such a proposal. Both scoring and jurisdictional issues will be part of the consideration for inclusion of a proposal in the Budget. See section 95.5 and 95.6 for guidance on the legislative language included in the Budget Appendix . (e) How are scoring estimates measured? Authorizing legislation is measured as a change to outlays or governmental receipts from the President's Budget baseline, updated for enacted legislation and certain other actions. See section 80 for how to construct the baseline. Scoring for discretionary programs is generally measured in terms of budget authority provided in appropriations Acts. For both authorizing legislation and discretionary programs, offsetting collections and offsetting receipts net against both budget authority and outlays in the y ear they are collected. (f) Economic and technical assumptions BBEDCA requires agency and OMB scoring to use the economic and technical assumptions underlying the most recently released President's Budget. OMB provides agencies with economic assumptions to be used for Budget estimates. Examples of economic assumptions include interest rate projections, housing price projections , and projections of inflation. Technical assumptions are assumptions that are not determined by economic factors, such as outlay rates, caseload projections, fee collection , and loan volume. For more information on the economic and technical assumptions underlying baseline and policy estimates see section 80 and section 31. For Mid -Session Review, OMB normally provides revised economic assumptions to agencies, and asks agencies to update their technical assumptions. Updates of economic and technical assumptions for the Mid-Session Review are not used for scoring , which is based on the economic and technical assumptions from the most recently released President 's Budget. For more information on Mid-Session Review, see section 10.6. (g) Scoring timeframes The budgetary effects of a uthorizing legislation and discretionary appr opriations are scored over different timeframes. Authorizing legislation is scored as the change to outlays or governmental receipts from the President's Budget baseline in each year of the budget window (the current year, the budget year, and the nine subsequent years). Discretionary appropriations are scored in the current and budget year only, and SECTION 21\u2014 OVERVIEW OF SCORING LEGISLATION Page 4 of Section 21 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) the overall score for those years includes discretionary amounts provided for those years in previous appropriation Acts (i.e., advance appropriations). 21.4 What are the budget enforcement mechanisms for discretionary and mandatory spending? (a) Limits on discretionary budget authority BBEDCA dictates the statutory spending limits (\"caps\" ) on the maximum amount of discretionary budget authority that can be provided through the annual appropriations process . Such caps, when in place, are enforced through sequestration, as described in s ection 100\u2014Sequestration . Discretionary spending levels are also controlled through the congressional budget process governed by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. This congressional budget process occurs whether or not BBEDCA spending limits are in place. The congressional budget process include s many of the same features used when BBEDCA discretionary caps are in place. In particular, BBEDCA require s OMB to adjust the caps for changes in concepts and definitions and for appropriations designated by the Congress and the President as either emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. BBEDCA also specifie s adjustments to the caps for appropriations for continuing disability reviews , redeterminations , cooperative disability investigation units , and special attorneys for fraud prosecution by the Social Security Administration; the Health Care Fraud and A buse Control program at the Department of Health and Human Services; certain programs that improved payments from the Unemployment Trust Fund; and appropriations designated by the Congress as being for disaster relief and wildfires. The congressional budget process uses allocation adjustments for some of these categories in the same way the adjustments are used under BBEDCA \u2014as adjustments to the base spending levels agreed upon in the Budget Resolution . BBEDCA require s OMB to provide several reports on its cost estimates of appropriations Act s when statutory caps are in place (see section 100.4). OMB continue s certain report s of its scoring estimates of appropriations Acts, includ ing differences in scoring from CBO, even when there is no statutory requirement. As a result, OMB require s agencies to provide information that supports its scoring estimates , regardless of the statutory requirement (see section 100.5). (b) Statutory Pay-as-you-go for mandatory spending Statutory PAYGO requires that new legislation changing governmental receipts or mandatory spending or collections must be enacted on a \"pay -as-you-go\" basis; that is, that the cumulative effects of such legislation must not increase projected on -budget def icits. The PAYGO statute established special scorekeeping rules, scorecards, an annual report, and a sequestration requirement. Administrative PAYGO, enacted in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (Public Law 118 -5), is separate from statutory PAYGO enforcement and does not apply to scoring legislation. The enforcement requirements in PAYGO are permanent, unlike the budget enforcement mechanism for discretionary programs, and do not impose a cap on spending or a floor on governmental receipts. Instead, PAYGO requires that bills reducing governmental receipts or increasing mandatory spending must be fully offset by enacting revenue increases or mandatory spending reductions. This requirement of deficit neutrality is not enforced on a bill -by-bill basis, but is based on two scorecards that tally the cumulative budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation over the course of a congressional session. The PAYGO rules also apply to the outlays resulting from changes in outyear budget authority for mandatory programs made in appropriations Acts (CHIMPs) and to all changes to governmental receipts made in appropriations Acts. SECTION 21\u2014 OVERVIEW OF SCORING LEGISLATION OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Section 21 The PAYGO rules do not apply to increases in mandatory spending or decreases in governmental receipts that result automatically under exi sting law. For example, mandatory spending for benefit programs, such as unemployment insurance, rises when the population of eligible beneficiaries rises, and many benefit payments are automatically increased for inflation under existing laws. Also, if the Congress designates a provision of legislation that affects mandatory spending or governmental receipts as a PAYGO emergency requirement, the effect of the provision is not scored as PAYGO for budget enforcement , but the scored cost or savings, if any, are recorded on the PAYGO scorecard for informational purposes . Over the course of a congressional session, all PAYGO legislation is scored to determine the budgetary effects \u2014costs and savings \u2014except if exempted in law. The score for each bill is record ed by OMB on two PAYGO scorecards in which costs or savings are averaged over rolling five- year and 10 -year periods (see section 100.4 ). OMB is required to update the scorecards on a continuous basis. In addition, within 14 business days after the end of a congressional session, OMB is required to issue an annual PAYGO report and determine whether a violation of the PAYGO requirement has occurred. If costs exceed savings in the budget year column of either scorecard, the President is required to issue a sequestration order implementing across -the-board cuts to nonexempt mandatory programs by an amount sufficient to offset the net costs on the PAYGO scorecard. (c) Congressional enforcement procedures Congress has procedural requirements for bills to advance through the legislative process. Agenc ies may be asked to develop cost estimates to inform the Congress of the budgetary effects of potential legislation. For more information on congressional enforcement procedures see section 10.5 in this circular and the section on Congressional Action in the \"Budget Concepts\" chapter in the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget. 21.5 What resources are available to help me score legislation? The general concepts used by scorekeepers are f ound throughout Circular A -11, including the resources cited below. Your OMB representative can provide assistance in applying the concepts, rules, and conventions for scoring legislation. Appendix A, Scorekeeping Guidelines, is used by the House and Senate Budget Committees, CBO, and OMB in measuring compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended; BBEDCA, as amended; and PAYGO. Appendix B, Budgetary Treatment of Lease-Purchases and Leases of Capital Assets, is also used to assist in scoring legislative authority to enter into a variety of leasing contracts. Section 20.4 addresses a variety of scoring concepts, including reappropriations, cancellations and rescissions, and transfers. 21.6 When are scores of legislation due to OMB? Mandatory and governmental receipt proposals for the Budget . OMB requires that all proposals included in the Budget be scored and included in the appropriate transmittal code in MAX A -11 D E by the deadlines provided in the annual budget season guidance. See section 79.3 for information on transmittal codes. The schedule for the 2025 Budget can be found in section 25. Enacted authorizing legislation. Agencies should work with their OMB representative to finalize PAYGO estimates by no more than two weeks after legislation is signed into law. Agencies should follow legislation SECTION 21\u2014 OVERVIEW OF SCORING LEGISLATION Page 6 of Section 21 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) affecting their programs as it moves through the congressional process in order to identify difficult scoring issues as soon as possible and to be prepared to provide scores i n a timely manner to meet the requirements outlined in s ection 21.4(b) . Discretionary appropriations . The annual budget formulation schedule requires the annual appropriations request in time to complete the President's Budget. In addition, throughout the appropriations season, and particularly upon enactment of full -year appropriations Acts, agencies are required to work with their OMB representatives to resolve any questions on scoring effects so that OMB can ensure proper enacted estimates are record ed in MAX A-11 D E and subsequently reflected in budget documents or other supporting budget material s. SECTION 22 \u2014COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC AND CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Section 22 SECTION 22 \u2014COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC AND CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS Table of Contents 22.1 Confidentiality of budget deliberations 22.2 Congressional testimony and communications 22.3 Clearance of materials for the Congress and the media 22.4 Clearance of changes to the President's Budget 22.5 Information available to the public 22.6 Congressional budget justifications 22.1 Confidentiality of budget deliberations. The nature and amounts of the President's decisions and the underlying materials are confidential. Do not release the President's decisions outside of your agency until the Budget is transmitted to the Congress. The materials underlying those decisions may not be released at any time, except in accordance with this section. In addition, outyear discretionary data is considered pre -decisional and may not be released without prior OMB approval. (For additional information on the confidentiality of pre -decisional budget information, please consult OMB Memorandum , M-01-17 of April 25, 2001.) Presidential decisions on current and budget year estimates (other than forecasts of items that will be transmitted formally later), both in total and in detail, become the \"proposed appropriations\" as that term is used in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended, and must be justified by your agency. Do not release agency justifications provided to OMB and any agency future year plans or long-range estimates to anyone outside the Executive Branch, except in accordance with this section. Section 51.16 co nfirms and clarifies the application of this section to pre-decisional, deliberative budget information relating to the Inspectors General. 22.2 Congressional testimony and communications. T he Executive Branch communications that led to the President's budgetary decisions will not be disclosed either by the agencies or by those who have prepared the Budget. In addition, agency justifications provided to OMB and any agency future year plans or long-range estimates will not be furnished to anyone outside the Executive Branch, except in accordance with this section. When furnishing information on appropriations and budgetary matters, you (and your agency representatives) must be aware of the following limitation o n communications: \"...An officer or employee of an agency may submit to Congress or a committee of Congress an appropriations estimate or request, a request for an increase in that estimate or request, or a recommendation on meeting the financial needs of the Government only when requested by either House of Congress\" ( 31 U.S.C. 1108(e) ). You must also be aware of restrictions on communications to influence legislation that are not conducted through proper official channels ( 18 U.S.C. 1913). SECTION 22 \u2014COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC AND CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS Page 2 of Section 22 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) After formal transmitta l of the Budget, an amendment, or a supplemental appropriations request, the following policies apply when testifying before any congressional committee or communicating with Members of the Congress: Witnesses will give frank and complete answers to all q uestions. Witnesses will avoid volunteering personal opinions that reflect positions inconsistent with the President's program or appropriation request. If statutory provisions exist for the direct submission of the agency budget request to the Congress, OMB may provide you additional materials supporting the President's Budget request that you will forward to the Congress with the agency testimony. Witnesses will be prepared to explain the agency submission, the request in the President's Budget, and an y justification material. When responding to specific questions on program and appropriations requests, witnesses will not provide the agency's request to OMB or plans for the use of appropriations that exceed the President's request. Typically, witnesses are responsible for one or a few programs, whereas the President is responsible for all the needs of the Federal Government. Where appropriate, witnesses will explain this difference in perspective and that it is therefore not appropriate for them to su pport appropriations above the President's request. When asked to provide a written response that involves a statement of opinion on program and appropriations requests, witnesses will provide a reply through the agency head. Do not let your communications be perceived as an \"appropriations estimate or request ... or an increase in that estimate or request\" ( 31 U.S.C. 1108 ). You are expected to support the President's budgetary decisions and seek adjustments to those decisions only through established procedures if your agency head determines such action is necessary. 22.3 Cl earance of budget materials for the Congress and the media. Policy consistency between the President's Budget and the budget -related materials prepared for the Congress and the media is essential. To ensure this consistency, you are required to submit budget -related materials to OMB for clearance prior to transmittal to congressional committees, individual Members of the Congress or their staff, or the media. Unless a speci fic exemption is approved by OMB, materials subject to OMB clearance include: All budget justifications and budget -related oversight materials; Testimony before and letters to congressional committees; Written responses to congressional inquiries or other materials for the record; Reports to committees and subcommittees ( e.g., studies, assessments, materials with budget implications ) that are required by statute or requested by report language; Capability statements; Appeals letters; Reprogramming requests and Congressional Notifications ; SECTION 22 \u2014COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC AND CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 22 Administrative actions affecting mandatory spending ( see section 31.1); Related cost information; Financial management documents addressing budget and policy issues (e.g., certain accountability reports, transmittal documents for audited financial statements, or spend plans ); and Proposed press releases relating to the President's Budget. Provide this information to OMB as far in advance as feasible and no less than five working days in advance of transmittal to congressional committees, individual Members of the Congress or their staff, or the media to allow adequate review time. Performance and Accountability Reports must be provided 10 days in advance unless a shorter period is approved by OMB. OMB review of reprogramming requests may take longer in some circumstances (e.g., if the request has not been coordinated or if supporting materials have not been provided concurrently). In exceptional circumstances, where the response time is very short, agencies may request oral clearance or make other arrangements for expedited review. Immediately after the Budget transmittal and after subsequent transmittals, agencies will provide OMB with a schedule of anticipated congressional reviews that require agency oral and written participation. Agencies will r evise this schedule as appropriate, and immediately notify OMB of any changes. Address any questions you have about this subsection to the OMB representatives whom you normally consult on budget -related matters. 22.4 Clearance of changes to the President's Budget. If you want to propose changes to the President's Budget (e.g., appropriations language, limitations, balance s heets required by the Government Corporation Control Act, or dollar amounts), you mu st follow the confidentiality and clearance guidance provided in this section and submit a written request as described in section 110.3 . OMB will notify you whether a formal transmittal of the change will be made. When it is possible to reduce the amount of an appropriations request before action has been taken by the Appropriations Committee of either House, the head of your agency must inform OMB promptly. Before your agency head decides to request restoration of a reduction, the reasons for the reduction, the circumstances under which it was made, and its significance to the President's program should be carefully considered. 22.5 Information available to the public. Agency budget documents that are subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) may be exempt from mandatory release pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5) . Depending on the nature of the record requested, other FOIA exemptions may apply. When deciding whether to withhold a budget document that is exempt from mandatory release, follow the FOIA memorandum i ssued by the President on January 21, 2009 and the FOIA guidance i ssued by the Attorney General on March 19, 2009. Any discretionary decision by an agency to disclose protected information should be made only after full and deliberate consideration of the institutional interests that could be implicated by disclosure, as well as after consultation with OMB. Agency heads are responsible for determining the propriety of record releases under FOIA. C ertain agencies headed by a collegial body are required to hold their meetings open to public observation unless the agency properly determines that the matter to be discussed warrants the closing of those meetings for reasons enumerated in the Government in the Sunshine Act ( 5 U.S.C. 552b ). Some meetings covered by that Act may pertain to budgetary information discussed in this Circular. Although, as with the FOIA, SECTION 22 \u2014COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC AND CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS Page 4 of Section 22 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) it is not possible to determine merely by the generic category of such information whether such an agency would be authorized to close a particular meeting covered by the Act, agencies must review those situations that involve budgetary information under the guidelines in the paragraph above and 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) . Such agencies are responsible for the propriety of determinations under these guidelines and provisions. 22.6 C ongressional budget justifications . Congressional budget justification materials must include or be structured as a p erformance plan submission (section 240). In addition, agencies must include the addi tional information described below, as well as detailed descriptions of agencies' activities and proposals at the program, project, and activity level. ( a) Materials for performance plan submission to the Congress Consult with your congressional representatives to agree on the performance plan format prior to submitting your congressional justification. Please also note the applicable public posting and notification requirements that apply to performance plans as detailed in section 22.6(c) . Your OMB representative should be included in those consultations as appropriate. Accordingly, your OMB representative should be provided with your proposed justification to the Congress with sufficient time for review. (b ) Material s to be included in congressional budget justifications Consistent with 41 U.S.C. 1703(h) , identify funding levels requested for education and training of the acquisition workforce in your budget justifications to the Congress. C onsistent with 42 U.S.C. 8255 , identify funds requested for energy conservation measures in your budget justifications to the Congress. W hen developing reports such as c ongres sional justifications, Annual Performance Plans (APP), or Annual Performance Reports (APRs) agencies should use the definitions found in the following sections of this Circular: B udget Definitions: Section 20.3 O rganizational Planning and Performance Definitions: S ection 200.22 Use of these definitions is required by the Evidence Act, M -13-13, Federal Data Strategy 5 (Identify Priority Data Assets for Agency Open Data Plans) , and Action 6 (Publish and Update Data Inventories). Agencies are reminded of the reporting requirements of the Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act (Public Law 115 -414). This Act requires agencies to include, in their congressional budget justifications, inf ormation on recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the agency. Information on outstanding GAO and O IG recommendations is available from agency OIGs, GAO.gov , or oversight.gov . Provide the Congress with information to assess current and proposed capital projects that is consistent with the Administration's budget proposals, including: appropriate information on planning; budgeting, including the current or proposed use of incremental or full funding; acquisition; and management of the projects. You must submit all budget justification materials to OMB for clearance before transmitting them to the Congress. SECTION 22 \u2014COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC AND CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 22 (c) Availability of congressional budget justifications Consistent with the requirements in the Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act (P ublic Law 117-40), agencies are reminded to make their full congressional budget justification materials, including their performance plan submission, available to the public and post the materials on the Internet at a vanity federal government URL. The vanity URL should contain \"/CJ\" following the public web address of the agency (e.g., agencyXYZ.gov/CJ). Materials should be posted at this address within two weeks after transmittal of those materials to the Congress. The release of these materials must be done in accordance with the requirements of this section and any relevant provisions of law. Materials will not be released if disclosure is prohibited by statute, the materials are classified or must be kept secret in the interest of national security or foreign policy, or the materials are otherwise exempt from release pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b) . Agencies should develop machine - readable (CSV, XML, TSV, or JSON) file(s) for the budget summary table(s) that normally accompany the congressional budget justification, including footnotes (please see section 200.22 for a definition of machine -readable format). Please work with your OMB representative on timelines and plans for preparing this machine-readable information. OM B will collect the following information from every agency that submits congressional justification materials: The date that congressional justification materials were first submitted to the Congress. Where agencies submit several different sets of materials (e.g., for various bureaus), this would be the date that the first set of materials was made available to the Congress either in print or electronically. The date that the congressional justification materials were first posted on a public -facing agency website. Where agencies post several different sets of materials, this would be the date that the first set of materials was first available to the public on the agency website. The web address (URL) which points to the current budget's congressional justification materials. This web address can direct to a page that contains links to the congressional justification materials, or the web address can link directly to those materials. This web address should conform with the vanity URL requirements in t his section. In cases where these requirements are not met, agencies should still provide a web address that points to congressional justification materials for the current budget. Within one week after the release of the budget, OMB will provide a website for agencies to record the above data. Classified congressional justification materials should not be reported. In cases where OMB does not review an agency's congressional justification materials, those agencies are still responsible for providing the above information. A list containing the above information will be made available on USASpending.gov . CIRCULAR NO.

Summary of Changes Updates the instructions related to the Motor vehicle fleet report, Business Case for Non -IT Capital Acquisition, and the Business Case for the Acquisition and Maintenance of Aircraft and dates in \"Table 1: Contents of the Budget Reques t\" (section 25.5). 25.1 Does Part 2 (Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates) apply to my agency? B y law ( 31 U.S.C. 1104 ), the President's B udget must include information on all agencies of all three branches of the Federal Government. Therefore, the instructions in Part 2 generally apply to all Government agencies. In addition, these instructions apply to the District of Columbi a, which must submit information in support of Federal payments to the District. OMB includes the information submitted by certain agencies in the budget without change. In addition, Government -sponsored enterprises (GSEs) submit some of the information required of Government agencies on a comparable basis, and OMB includes it in the Budget for information purposes. I f your agency appears in the following list, it is not subject to Executive Branch review by law or custom. That means that the requiremen ts for submitting materials in support of your budget request do not apply to you. However, you do need to submit the information required for inclusion in the budget database and documents, which OMB incorporates without revision. SECTION 25 \u2014SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS Page 2 of Sectio n 25 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Legislative Branch agencies. Judicial Branch agencies. Executive Branch agencies, as follows: Milk, Fruit, and Vegetable Marketing Orders, USDA. International Trade Commission. Postal Service. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) as follows: Federal National Mortgage Association. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Banks for cooperatives. Agriculture credit banks. Farm credit banks. Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. Federal home loan banks. Financing Corporation. Resolution Funding Corporation. Contact your OMB representative if you have questions about the applicability of these instructions. 25.2 How do I get an exception? For the sake of comparability among the budget data and presentations, OMB does not grant many exceptions to the specific requirements in this Part. However, if you believe special circumstances warrant an exception in your case, submit a written request detailing the circumstances and the specific exception needed to your OMB representativ e by August 1. If OMB approves the exception, it is valid only for the specified Budget. 25.3 For what items do I need advance approval? You must get advance approval from your OMB representative for the items shown in the table below. Item See section... Timing (1) Form and content of justification materials. 51.2 To be determined in consultation with your OMB representative. (2) Program activity structure in the program and financing schedule. 82.5 By October 1. (3) Changes in functional and receipt classifications. 79.4 By October 1. (4) Changes in budget account structure (new accounts, merged accounts, changes in account titles, etc.). 79.4 By October 1 or as soon as possible thereafter for changes dependent on congressional action or other circumstances beyond agency control. SECTION 25 \u2014SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 25 25.4 How do I submit information to OMB? Y ou generally submit information in two stages: ( 1) As part of your budget request . Both Executive Branch agencies that are subject to Executive Branch review and the District of Columbia must prepare information and materials supporting their budget request. Your OMB representative will work with you to determine the specific form, content, and timing of this information. Agencies that are not subject to Executive Branch review are not required to submit this information. (2) After passback . Passback usually occurs around the end of November. In early -mid November, OMB issues detailed guidance and deadlines to complete CY and BY information. This stage includes MAX computer data, print materials, and additional information used to prepare the budget documents and supporting database. Also, you may need to revise and resubmit some materials included in the budget request to reflect the effects of final decisions. Agencies that are not subject to Executive Branch review need to submit information for inclusion in the budget documents and the budget database. I n the following sections, we tell you more about each stage, the items required, the criteria for determining whether the item applies to your agency, and where to find more detailed guidance on the item. 25.5 What do I include in the budget request to OMB? Y ou should include the information described below. In addition, your OMB representative may require you to include other materials (for example, information about your budget request by account and Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) category).

Requirements do not apply to agencies not subject to Executive Branch review (see section 25.1). 2 If final decisions require changes to this information, revised materials must be submitted. 25.6 How is MAX A-11 DE used to produce the Appendix? ( a) Overview A fter the President has considered the estimates and made dec isions, you will be notified. You submit information after passback through the PB20xx President 's Budget, PA20xx Budget Appendix Appropriation Language, PN20xx Budget Appendix Narrative exercises in MAX A -11 DE, as explained in more detail in sections 79-86 and 95. I f the decisions affect other budget accounts (such as the amount of transfers), you need to coordinate these changes with whomever is responsible for the budget submission of those other accounts. W hen you are informed of the President's decisions, your agency head will determine the best and most appropriate distribution of amounts that have been left flexible. This Circular does not address the process by which you appeal passback decisions. We issue separate guidance on the appeals process at the time of passback. ( b) Timing T he core information in the PY column must be completed by mid- November (see Key Dates). In mid - early November OMB issues detailed guidance and deadlines for completing all schedules. These deadlines are based o n the very tight schedule that OMB must maintain in order to transmit the budget in a timely manner. In order to meet the deadlines, you must begin providing the required information based on passback decisions. Do not wait until you have resolved appeal s. Appeals generally affect very little of the information you submit, and you will have an opportunity to change the information as necessary to reflect the appeal resolution. Unless your OMB representative agrees, do not submit information that assumes an appeal resolution different from passback. When an appeal results in changes to passback decisions, the changes often differ from the agency proposal. SECTION 25 \u2014SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Section 25 (c) MAX A- 11 DE data As an agency, you may be required to submit data into MAX A -11 DE through the PB20xx President 's Budget exercise for each applicable budget account.

Federal Reserve Board submits data for schedules A, P, and O only. 2 Information required for schedules A, S, and P will be reported in a single worksheet (schedule X). 3 Schedule P also required for accounts with obligated or unobligated balances. (d) Print materials As an agency, you may be required to submit data into MAX A -11 DE through the PA20xx Budget Appendix Appropriation Language and PN20xx Budget Appendix Narrative exercises for the following print materials that are printed in the Budget Ap pendix : Appropriations language . You must submit language for each account for which appropriations or limitation language was enacted in the CY or is proposed in the CY or BY, including supplemental appropriations requests. You must also submit any general provisions that pertain to you (see section 95). SECTION 25 \u2014SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS Page 6 of Sectio n 25 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Narrative statements, footnotes, and tables . You must provide a narrative statement for each account with activity in the current or budget year and separate statements for supplemental requests, resci ssion proposals, and items proposed for later transmittal. You may be required to provide tables and footnotes that are not generated by MAX A- 11 DE under certain circumstances (see section 95). SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Section 31 SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES Table of Contents 31.1 Basic policies and assumptions 31.2 Advance appropriations 31.3 Equal opportunity 31.4 Full funding 31.5 Government perquisites 31.6 Multi- year appropriations 31.7 Management improvement initiatives and policies 31.8 Construction, leases of capital assets, and acquisition of real property 31.9 Hospi tal costs 31.10 Advisory committees and interagency groups 31.11 Radio spectrum -dependent communications -electronics systems 31.12 Spectrum Relocation F und 31.13 Historically Black Colleges and Universities 31.14 Controlled Unclassified Information 31.15 Additional policies and requirements 31.1 Basic policies and assumptions (a) What should be the basis for my proposals? Your proposals should result from a comprehensive system that integrates analysis, performance management and strategic planning, evaluation, enterprise risk management, and budgeting and appropriately incorporates the analyses and assessments result ing from the agency's annual strategic reviews (see section 260 for more on strategic reviews). In developing the estimates, consider the effect that demographic, economic, or other changes can have on program levels beyond the budget year. Be prepared to discuss the impact that program levels and changes in methods of program delivery, including advances in technology, will have on program operations and administration. Also consider the appropriate roles for Federal, State, and local governments, as well as the private sector, in conducting the covered activities. (b) What is the scope of the policy estimates? (1) Presidential policy estimates for CY and BY. (i) Regular annual estimates . Your regular annual estimates must reflect all requirements anticipated at the time of budget submission and should cover: Continuing activities, including those that must be reauthori zed for the budget year; Authorized activities that are proposed for the budget year; Amounts necessary to meet specific financial liabilities imposed by law; and Decreases for activities proposed for termination or reduction. SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES Page 2 of Section 31 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) (ii) Supplemental proposals . You should make every effort to conduct your programs within the amounts appropriated for the current year and to postpone actions that require supplemental appropriations. OMB will only consider supplemental requests that meet the criteria provided in section 110. (2) Presidential policy outyear estimates. Policy estimates for the nine years following the budget year (BY+1 through BY+9) enable an analysis of the long-term consequences of proposed program or tax policy initiatives. When you develop outyear policy estimates, they should be consistent with the general policies and information required for the budget year and indicate the degree to which specific policy d ecisions made for the budget year or any subsequent year affect budget authority, outlay, and receipt outyear levels. For mandatory estimates, take into consideration changes in spending trends, economic assumptions, and other actions or events when you prepare estimates of budget authority, outlays, and receipts for BY+1 through BY+9. For discretionary budget authority estimates, unless directed otherwise, assume that MAX A -11 DE will generate the outyears using current inflation factors. (c) What econo mic assumptions should I use when I develop estimates? All budget materials, including those for the outyear policy and baseline estimates, must be consistent with the economic assumptions provided by OMB. The specific guidance below applies to outyear policy estimates. OMB policy permits consideration of price changes for goods and services as a factor in developing estimates. However, this does not mean that you should automatically include an allowance for the full rate of anticipated inflation in yo ur request. For mandatory programs, reflect the full inflation rate where such an allowance is required by law and there has been no decision to propose less than required. For discretionary programs, you may include an allowance for the full rate of ant icipated inflation, an allowance for less than the full rate, or even no allowance for inflation. In many cases, you must make trade-offs between budgeting increases for inflation versus other increases for programmatic purposes. Unless OMB determines ot herwise, you must prepare your budget requests to OMB within the budget planning guidance levels provided to you, regardless of the effect of inflation. Economic assumptions may be revised shortly before final budget decisions are made. These revisions w ill not usually result in changes to the previous budget guidance on your agency totals. See sections 32 and 85 for personnel assumptions and costs. 31.2 Advance appropriations Do not request advance appropriations if the only purpose is to shift budget authority for a program that would normally be provided in the budget year. For example, if you would normally request budget authority in the budget year to cover a cohort of obligations for a grant program, even though some of the obligations will not b e incurred until the following fiscal year, you may not request an advance appropriation to cover the obligations expected to be incurred in the following fiscal year. SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 31 31.3 Equal opportunity Your estimates should reflect the Administration's commitment to programs designed to ensure or promote equal opportunity regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), disability, age, sexual orientation, genetic information, or any other non -merit -based factor. These activities include the following: implementation of statutes or regulations requiring fair housing; nondiscrimination in federally assisted or conducted programs; equal credit opportunity; full voting rights; civil and Constitutional righ ts; equal employment opportunity (including nondiscrimination by Federal agencies); and efforts to increase Federal contracting and subcontracting opportunities for minorities, women, and disadvantaged entrepreneurs. 31.4 Full funding Requests for acquisi tion of capital assets must propose full funding to cover the full costs of the project or a useful segment of the project, consistent with the policy stated in the Capital Programming Guide . Specifically, requests for procurement programs must provide for full funding of the entire cost. In addition, requests for construction programs must provide for full funding of the complete cost of construction. You should not submit estimates for construction funds for major construction projects unless planning will reach a point by the end of the current year that will ensure that a contract for construction could be awarded during the budget year. Remember that Administration policy and the Antideficiency Act require you to have sufficient budget authority or other budgetary resources to cover the full amount of unconditional obligations under any contract. Additionally, agencies must comply with the Recording Statute (31 U.S.C. 1501). For policies related to leases of capital assets and lease-purchases, see section 31.9 and Appendix B. For guidance on budget submissions for capital asset acquisitions, see section 51.19. For guidance on principles and techniques of planning, budgeting, procurement, and management of capital assets, see the supplement to this Circular, the Capital Programming Guide . 31.5 Government perquisites Your estimates should reflect Administration policy to limit the use of Government vehicles, Government aircraft, travel, executive dining facilities, conferences, real property, and fleet management in accordance with Bulletin No. 93 -11 \"Fiscal Responsibi lity and Reducing Perquisites.\" 31.6 Multi-year appropriations Consider whether it is appropriate to request appropriations with multi -year availability, particularly for buildings, equipment, and other types of fixed capital assets, including major computer and telecommunications systems, with long acquisition cycles. Where multi -year appropriations requests are appropriate, you should match the period of availability to the expected length of the acquisition cycle. 31.7 Management improvement initiative s and policies Your estimates should reflect your efforts and planned action to strengthen management and improve program performance and service delivery. Part 6 of this Circular, The Federal Performance Framework for Improving Program and Service Delivery, provides a policy framework of organizational routines for the integration and coordination of key management initiatives and functions that support organizational and program performance and management efforts in agencies. In addition to the Fe deral Performance Framework guidance found in Part 6, g uidance on specific areas is provided below. SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES Page 4 of Section 31 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Information technology capital planning and investment control. Agency estimates should reflect the Administration's commitment to information technology investments that directly support agency missions as identified through strategic information resources management planning as described in sections 51 and 55. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) . Agency estimates should leverage and incorporate risk infor mation from agency ERM programs , including risk profiles specified by OMB Circular A- 123, Management 's Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control , and section 260 of Circular A- 11 Part 6. Open data and records management. Your estimates should reflect data sets that have been prioritized through your agency's engagement with customers as specified in OMB Memorandum , M-13-13, Open Data Policy - Managing Information as an Asset. Your estimates should also reflect work necessary to meet the requirements of OMB Memora ndum , M-19-21, Transition to Electronic Records, OMB Circular A -130, the E-Government Act , and OMB's guidance. Initiatives should create a customer -centered electronic presence (maximizing the reuse of current assets) and advancing agency missions as identified through strategic information resources management plans . Transition to Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). Agency estimates should reflect the commitment to completing the transition to IPv6. At a minimum, your estimate should: Include me eting the specific milestones in OMB Memorandum , M-21-07, Completing the Transition to Internet Protocol Version 6; Reflect the alignment between the milestones within OMB Memorandum , M-21-07 and Executive Order 14208, Improving the Nation' s Cybersecurity ; Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of life -cycle planning of your applications and systems to avoid unnecessary costs during transition. Security. Your estimates should reflect a comprehensive understanding of OMB security policies, such as OMB Circular A- 130, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance, including compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, and current year OMB Guidance on Federal Information Security and Privacy Management Requirements , by: Reflecting the cost considerations used to calculate IT security costs (see section 51.19); Demonstrating that the costs of security controls are understood and are explicitly incorporated in the life -cycle planning of the overall system, including the additional costs of employing standards and guidance more stringent than those issued by NIST; Demonstrating how the agency ensures that risks are understood and continually assessed; Demonstrating how the agency ensures that the security controls are commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm; SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 31 Identifying additional security controls for systems that promote or permit public access, other externally accessible systems, and those that are interconnected with systems over which program officials have little or no control; Demonstrating how the agency ensures the effective use of security and privacy controls, as well as authentication tools to protect privacy for those systems that promote or permit public access; Reflecting the cost considerations used to establish a supply chain risk management program per the SECURE Technology Act , including the costs associated with addressing supply chain risk management in IT and National Security Systems, down to the individual component level, as appropriate.

Agency estimates should leverage and incorporate standards and requirements for cybersecurity as outlined in the Executive Order. Budget submissions should reflect associated transition costs and lifecycle cost estimates. All federal information systems should meet or exceed the standards and requirements for cybersecurity set forth in and issued pursuant to the Executive Order. Privacy. Your estimates should reflect the Administration's commitment to privacy and , consistent with OMB Circular A-130, should include a description of your agency's privacy program and the resources required to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements, develop and evaluate privacy policy, and manage privacy risks. At a mi nimum, your estimate should: Demonstrate that your agency is aware of applicable privacy requirements and has fully assessed the cost to the agency for ensuring compliance with those requirements and managing privacy risks; Reflect the consideration of your agency's inventory of information systems that create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose of personally identifiable information; and Reflect the consideration of your privacy continuous monitoring strategy and the resources and associated costs required to ensure that privacy controls are effectively monitored on an ongoing basis at an assessment frequency sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements and to manage privacy risks.

Agency users can access general information about the Federal Real Property Pr ofile https://www.realpropertyprofile.gov/; and Comply with Executive Order 14008, \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad \" and be consistent with agency -approved Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plans . In addition to the requirements above, if you are requesting funds in support of capital facilities projects, includin g new construction, full and partial building renovation/modernization, or facility investments that meet the agency's capital threshold, you must provide the following information upon request by your OMB program examiner: Documentation supporting compli ance with the Capital Programming Guide and section 55, and the agency's Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process. Life Cycle Cost Analysis consistent with OMB Circular A- 94. SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 31 Housing Plan indicating at a minimum the FTEs to be housed and the types of facility space and associated square footage for each type, and the utilization rate for all space and if applicable, office space as a subset of all space. Environmental/Energy Efficiency Analyses, including current and future consumption estimates for renovation/ modernization. Any additional documentation requested by the OMB program examiner. (b) Construction of federally -owned housing If you are proposing to construct federally -owned housing, make sure you: Do not include estimated funding for construction of housing for civilian employees, except where necessary to maintain continuity and efficiency of service and where private capital cannot be found; and Meet the requirements in OMB Circular A-45 for service or protection, or lack of available housing. (c) Construction in the District of Columbia You must consult the Commission of Fine Arts regarding plans for the construction of buildings and other structures in the District of Columbia that may affect in any important way the appearance of the city, and other questions involving artistic considerations with which the Federal Government is concerned.

(e) Leasing capital assets If you propose to lease capital assets rather than purchase them, you should check the requirements in OMB Circular A-94. For additional information on the budgetary treatment of leases, see Appendix B. Occupancy Agreements entered into with the GSA are not lease agreements. (f) Real property acquisition If you plan to acquire real property, you must: Include estimates consistent with the policies of Executive Order 13327 in your budget submission; and Make sure that estimates for acquisition of real property under contract are consistent with obligations reported in object class 32 (see section 83.7 ). SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES Page 8 of Section 31 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 31.9 Hospital c osts If you are developing estimates for hospital costs: Use data based on the use of resources allocated by diagnosis-related groups and compare these data with payment rates of other payers using similar groupings; Indicate whether or not capital and depreciation costs are contained, and describe the cost allocation method underlying the data; and Identify the amount of reimbursement collected from third parties and Federal agencies if you provide hospital care on a reimbursable basis. If you provide estimates for inpatient care facilities and medical care services, make sure they are consistent with Executive Order 12372. 31.10 Advisory committees and int eragency groups If you have advisory committees and interagency groups: Reflect the results of the committee reviews required by Executive Order 12838, which requires agencies to reduce the number and cost of non-statutory advisory committees; Use the ceilings established by OMB Circular A -135; and Separately identify the costs o f advisory committees established by statute that you are proposing for termination. You are prohibited from financing interagency groups (including boards (except Federal Executive Boards), commissions, councils, committees, and similar groups) by contri butions from member agencies' appropriations by a Government -wide general provision unless such financing is specifically authorized by statute. Therefore, you must propose financing for such groups in the budget in one of the following forms: Appropriat ions specifically for the interagency group. Specific language authorizing interagency funding. 31.11 Radio spectrum -dependent communications -electronics systems The value of radio spectrum should be taken into consideration when requesting funding for new or modified spectrum -dependent systems. When replacing systems, agencies should consider improvements in spectrum \" efficiency \" and \" effectiveness\" compared to the prior system. Agencies should also consider whether there are any non -spectrum dependent or commercial alternatives to meet mission/operational requirements, or whether using an existing or alternative Federal system to meet the capability requirement is possible, or whether using existing capabilities of similar Federal users has been considered. In some cases, greater investments in systems could enhance Federal spectrum efficiency (e.g., purchase of more expensive radios that use less bandwidth); in other cases, the desired service could be met through other forms of supply (e.g., private wireless services or use of land lines). Therefore, to identify solutions that have the highest net benefits, agencies should consider greater investment to increase spectrum efficiency along with cost minimizing strategies. To this end, section 6411 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 31 Creation Act , Pub. L. No. 112 -96, directed that A- 11 be updated with sections (a) and ( b) in 2012.1 The National Telecommunications and Information Administ ration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce, which is responsible for managing spectrum use of Federal users, may request and review an agency 's analysis reflecting how it considered spectrum efficiency and value. (a) Guidance for Determining Value of Spectru m-Dependent Assets To ensure the Federal Government demonstrates proper stewardship of the spectrum resource in its procurement decisions, and thus yield improvements in overall Federal spectrum management and use, agencies must include in the development of their budget justifications for procurement of major radio spectrum -dependent communications-electronics systems consideration of the economic value of the spectrum being used. The extent of economic and budget analysis required will depend upon the nature and value of the systems and spectrum involved, and agencies should work with their OMB contacts to ensure a proper level of analysis is conducted. To demonstrate consideration of the value of the relevant spectrum, agencies should indicate whether the system procured was the most spectrum \"efficient\" solution among those qualified bids (i.e., that met specified mission/operational requirements); if an agency is unable to so indicate, then the agency should indicate the investment difference between the solution chosen and the more spectrum \"efficient\" qualified solution. To further advance Federal stewardship of the spectrum resource, agencies should also include the following in their budget justifications for procurement of major radio spectrum -dependent communications- electronics systems : In a Request for Proposal (RFP) 2 to procure the system, the requirement that respondents address spectrum \"efficiency\" factors (e.g., greater adjacent band compatibility, less use of bandwidth, etc.) and assess trade-offs between investment in equipment and spectrum requirements. Whether the system will share spectrum with other Federal or non -Federal systems/operations and, if so, the nature and extent of the sharing relationship. When proposing a new system, whether using an existing or alternative Federal system to meet the capability requirement is possible, or whether using capabilities of similar Federal users has been considered. 1 Section 6411 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required that OMB incorporate into Circular A -11 recommendations included in the January 2011 report issued by the Incentive Subcommittee of the Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee. A -11 meets this requi rement, but OMB suggests that these recommendations are more appropriately applicable for agencies to use during procurement decisions to demonstrate proper stewardship of the spectrum resource. 2 Any efficiency factors included in RFP respondents' proposa l that are selected should also be included as terms of the final contracts. SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES Page 10 of Section 31 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) When replacing systems, what improvements in spectrum \"efficiency\" and \"effectiveness\" exist compared to the prior system. Certification of consideration of non-spectrum dependent or commercial alternatives to meet mission/operational requirements. Spectrum should be considered to have value and be included, to the extent practical, in economic analyses of alternative systems/solutions. In some cases, greater investments in systems could enhance Federal system spectrum efficiency (e.g., purchase of radios that use less bandwidth); in other cases, the desired servi ce can be met with other forms of supply (e.g., private wireless services or use of land lines). In addition to considering cost minimizing strategies, agencies are encouraged to consider whether the investment would provide net benefits. (b)Spectrum Certification . You must obtain a certification by the NTIA that the radio frequencies required can be made available before you submit estimates for the development or procurement of major radio spectrum -dependent communication-electronics systems. The NTIA, which is responsible for assigning spectrum to Federal users, may also review these analyses, during the assignment process.3 31.12 Spectrum Relocation Fund Relocation or modification of systems subject to Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act. For agenc ies that are affected by the reallocation of certain frequencies from Federal to commercial use, the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act (CSEA, P.L. 108 -494, as amended by P.L. 112- 96) streamlines the process for funding the relocation or modification of s ystems and, for certain reallocations after February 2012, for funding spectrum sharing (as well as relocation). Auction receipts from the sale of eligible frequencies will be deposited into the Spectrum Relocation Fund (SRF), unless otherwise directed by statute, and these funds will be used to facilitate Federal agencies' relocation or sharing. Spectrum relocation funds have no- year authority, though agencies are expected to adhere to the timeframes approved by OMB. In accordance with section 120, these funds must be apportioned at least annually prior to obligation, unless specifically exempted. Agencies that receive funds from the SRF will report their expenditures as input into an annual report to the Congress to be submitted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce. If potential cost over -runs or delays become apparent in any spectrum relocation project or if agencies identify additional relocation costs not included in their original spend plans, OMB and NTIA should be notified in order to facilitate further review . Under the terms of the CSEA, agencies may receive more than one transfer from the SRF, subject to prior review and approval by OMB, in consultation with NTIA. If the subsequent transfer or transfers exceed 10 percent of the original transfer, OMB will notify Congress and the Government Accountability Office, in accordance with the requirements of the CSEA. If transferred amounts exceed actual relocation costs, excess amounts will be returned to the SRF immediately after the project is complete, so that NTIA can notify the FCC that the agency's relocation is complete. 3 NTIA may review the economic analyses of alternative systems/solutions at any point in the NTIA authorization processes. SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 31 31.13 Historically Black Colleges and Universities As required by Executive Order 13532, which establishes the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), affected agencies and executive departments must produce an annual plan that establishes clear goals for how the agency or department intends to increase the capacity of HBCUs to effectively compete for grants and contracts and to encourage HBCUs to participate in Federal programs. 31.14 Controlled Unclassified Information Agency estimates must reflect consideration of Executive Order 13556 , Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), the regulation issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), 32 CFR 2002, \"Controlled Unclassified Information,\" and CUI Notice 2020-01 , \"CUI Program Implementation Deadlines\" (and any successor CUI notices on implementation ). The Information Security Oversight Office within NARA was designated as the Executive Agent to implement the CUI program that replaces all existing Sensitive -But-Unclassified (SBU) information handling regimes (e.g., \"For Official Use Only, \" etc.) across the Executive Branch. Agency CUI budget estimates must reflect: Hiring and salary costs for full-time employees and/or contractor support to implement and manage the CUI Program at headquarters, regional locations, and within component agencies; Any development , deployment , or maintenance costs of current or projected automated marking tools to ensure uniform application of CUI markings and timely dissemination of CUI to authorized recipients; Remaining d evelopment costs for internal policies to phase-in and transition to the CUI program , including costs for lower -level office polices or compon ent agency policies; Costs of modifying agency incident reporting mechanisms and systems to include CUI categories and requirements; Modifying and issuing costs for contracts and agreements to reflect the standards of the CUI Program; Training and a wareness program costs to inform affected employees of their responsibilities when handling CUI basic and specified categories; Assessment and any transition of information systems which handle or are used to process CUI to the moderate confidentiality i mpact value; Assessment and transition of physical environments as required for CUI; Development of an internal agency CUI self -inspection program; and Costs to align and integrate the agency 's Insider Threat Program with the agency 's CUI Program.SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES Page 12 of Section 31 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 31.15 Additional policies and requirements Develop your budget estimates consistent with the following laws, rules, and policies: ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS Type of program or expenditure Policies and requirements Activities covered by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act Do not include any new Federal expenditures or financial assistance prohibited by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97 -348). Foreign currencies Refer to guidelines in the Treasury Financial Manual (Vol. 1, Part 2, chapter 3200 and Vol. 1, Part 4, chapter 9000) and the Departme nt of Foreign Affairs Manual (Volume 4, chapter 360). Remedial environmental projects at Federal facilities Follow the policies in Executive Order 12088 and the requirements of sections 205, 206, 207, 208 and 402 of Executive Order 14057 . Mail Include sufficient amounts for official use of United States mail, package delivery, and/or private carrier service, including postage due. Assume maximum use of available postage discounts. Records storage Include sufficient amounts for the costs of storing and servicing temporary and inactive records. Space and related requirements Include payments for space, structures and facilities, land, and building service s provided by GSA and others. Systems acqu isitions Follow the guidance in the Capital Programming Guide . Ensure that electronic and information technology acquisitions meet the requirements of section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and allow individuals with disabilities access to and use of data. Ensure information technology acquisitions are in compliance with the Secure Technology Act of 2018. Travel Minimize official travel. Reflect the allowances authorized under the Federal Travel Regulations issued by GSA or comparable regulations issued by the Department of Defense for travel of military personnel and by the Department of State for foreign service personnel. Tort claims Do not include amounts for payment of tort claims unless a substantial volume of claims is presented regularly. SECTION 31 \u2014POLICIES, LAWS, AND OTHER GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BUDGET ESTIMATES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 13 of Section 31 Water and sewer payments to the District of Columbia Include amounts for payment for water and sewer services . Payments are coordinated with the Department of the Treasury . Construction of nuclear reactors Obtain a letter from the D epartment of Energy setting forth its recommendations before submitting estimates. Contractor claims Include amounts for reimbursement of the claims and judgment fund for the full amount paid from the fund on behalf of the agency during the past year. Subsidies for Medicare Part D eligible individuals for qualified prescription drug coverage Do not assume that agency prescription drug costs for the agency's retirees and/or dependents will be reduced by the Part D program. Federal entities will not rece ive subsidies for Part D eligible individuals for qualified prescription drug coverage through the Retiree Drug Subsidy (RDS) and Federal entities will not administer \u2014or have a third party administer \u2014a Prescription Drug Plan or Medicare Advantage Prescript ion Drug Plan for their retirees and/or their dependents. Administration policy is that Federal Government entities should not receive the Medicare Part D drug subsidies because this would result in the Medicare Trust Fund cross -subsidizing other Federal programs. The primary rationale for creating the Part D RDS was to encourage employers and unions to continue to provide prescription drug coverage to their Medicare eligible retirees and their qualified dependents after the implementation of the Part D Pr ogram. These subsidies are not needed for Federal Government entities because the Federal Government intends to continue providing prescription drug coverage for its retirees and their qualified dependents. SECTION 32 \u2014PERSONNEL COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND RELATED COSTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 1 of Section 32 SECTION 32 \u2014PERSONNEL COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND RELATED COSTS Table of Contents 32.1 How should I estimate personnel compensation in my budget request? 32.2 How do I treat agency benefit payments under the Federal Employees ' Compensation Act? 32.3 How do I budget for Federal employee retirement costs ? 32.4 How do I budget for unemployment compensation? 32.5 How do I budget for personnel vetting? 32.6 How do I budget for Uniformed Services health care? 32.7 Are there other places in Circular A-11 where I can find related guidance? Summary of Chang es Provides guidance on provisional pay raise estimates for the FY 202 5 Budget (section 32.1). 32.1 How should I estimate personnel compensation in my budget request? Personnel compensation (a) Pay scales. For the purpose of planning agency budget requests for the FY 2025 Budget, agencie s should include a provisional estimate of a two percent civilian pay raise for January 2025. Agencies should consult with their OMB representative on the provisional estimate for the military pay raise for January 2025. In making their final estimates for the FY 2025 Budget, agencies should anticipate revising pay raise amounts after the President makes a pay raise decision. Your OMB r epresentative will provide additional guidance during Budget season. The pay guidance above will apply to the statutory pay systems (General Schedule, Foreign Service, and Veterans Health Administration), the Executive Schedule, the Senior Executive Service (SES), and wage grade employees. You should be prepared to provide supporting detail on calculating pay costs, including separate identification of the wage base reflected in the submission. For compensation costs, you must explicitly justify any incr eases in average compensation for the budget year. (b) Awards and recognition. In FY 2025 budget requests, agencies must provide the following information on agency- wide salary and awards spending: (1) an estimate of FY 202 4 salary spending, excluding salary spending for Senior Executive Service (SES), Senior Level (SL), and Scientific or Professional (ST) positions, (2) an estimate of FY 202 4 awards spending as a percent of FY 2024 non- SES/SL/ST salary spending, and (3) the amount requested for FY 2025 non-SES/SL/ST salary spending. Agencies should include an awards budget in the FY 2025 budget request at a level which best meets agency objectives and supports the recruitment and retention of high performing employees. Agencies should be prepared to supply additional information on planned and actual expenditures upon request by OMB. Awards spending is defined as the sum of: (1) individual performance awards for non- SES/SL/ST employees (Nature of Action 840) and, (2) individual contribution awards (e.g., special act awards) for non-SES/SL/ST employees (Nature of Action 849). SECTION 32 \u2014PERSONNEL COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND RELATED COSTS Page 2 of Section 32 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) (c) Hourly rates. For all employees (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5504(b) ), use hourly rates of compensation determined by dividing the annual rate of basic pay by 2,087, in accordance with section 15203(a) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-272). (d) Within -grade increases . Offset the net cost, if any, of within- grade salary increases (i.e., costs after turnover, downgrades, and other grade or step reducing events are taken into account) by savings due to greater productivity and efficiency. (e) Vacancies . For vacancies expected to be filled in the budget year, use the entrance salary for the vacancies involved. (f) Savings in personnel compensation. Give full consideration to savings in personnel compensation due to personnel reductions, delay in filling vacant positions, leave without pay, lag in recruitment for new positions, filling vacancies at lower rates o f pay, part -time employment, and grade reduction actions. Identify terminal leave payments, including those for SES, as offsets against such savings. (g) Positions above grade GS/GM -15. Reflect these positions, including SES, only to the extent that positions have been authorized in those grades by OPM or other authority, or are specifically authorized in substantive law. (h) Executive selection and development programs. Include in your estimates provisions for reasonable amounts for such programs, as required under Title IV of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and by implementing guidelines issued by the Office of Personnel Management. (i) Premium pay and overtime . Fully justify increases over amounts for the preceding year for premium pay. In preparing estimates for overtime, you should analyze the use of overtime to ensure it is used in a prudent and efficient manner; explore all reasonable alternatives to overtime (such as improved sch eduling); and ensure adequate approval, monitoring, and audit procedures are in place to avoid overtime abuses. (j) Special rates for experts and consultants. Reflect these positions and rates only to the extent that they are authorized per 5 U.S.C. 3109. (k) Severance pay . Estimate severance pay at the amount needed for the fiscal year. However, obligations will be incurred on a pay -period by pay -period basis, notwithstanding the fact that a liability arises at the time of an employee's separation. Your estimates must include changes in severance pay and personnel compensation that would occur upon any reduction in force. (l) Physicians comparability allowance . Reflect in your estimates approved plans to pay physicians comparability allowance under 5 U.S.C. 5948. Instructions for reporting on the physicians comparability allowance program are issued separately. (m) Bonuses and allowances . Reflect in your estimates approved agency plans for paying recruitment and relocation bonuses and retention allowances. You should be prepared to supply information on planned and actual expenditures upon request by OMB. (n) Retirement costs. Reflect in your estimates the cost effects of changes in the distribution of employees between the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). Note that FERS contributions have changed as described in section 32.3 . SECTION 32 \u2014PERSONNEL COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND RELATED COSTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 32 32.2 How do I treat agency benefit payments under the Federal Employees ' Compensation Act? For accounts subject to appropriations action, include in your budget year estimates the amount billed by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs of the Department of Labor for benefits paid on behalf of employees of your agency in the past year under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. For accounts not subject to appropriations action, you must pay the bill in the current year. 32.3 How do I budget for Federal employee retirement costs? Agency contributions to the large retirement receipt accounts, including those managed by the Departments of Defense, State, the Treasury, the Social Security Administration, and the Office of Personnel Management, should reflect the effects of changes to the agency contribution rates for employee retirement and of civilian and military pay raises using the provisional pay raise assumptions specified for these accounts in section 32.1. Contribution rates for CSRS employees remain unchanged. Agencies may need to adjust estimates when final pay assumptions for the budget are released. This applies to: 1. Governmental receipt accounts containing Federal employee contributions to Federal employee retirement; 2. Offsetting receipt accounts (employer share, employee retirement) containing employing agency contributions to Federal employee retirement and Federal agency share of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes; and 3. General fund contributions to Federal employee retirement. FERS Contribution Rates Agency FERS contribution rates that are effective beginning FY 2024 can be found in the Benefits Administration Letter 23-306. The provisional FY 2025 contribution rates are listed in the tables below. Agenc ies should use these contribution rates in their FY 2025 budget requests. Contribution rates , when finalized , will be published in OPM Benefits Letters posted https://www.opm.gov/retirement- services/publications- forms/benefits- administrat ion-letters/ .

General ly, you should not budget for the costs of unemployment compensation for former Federal civilian and military personnel. The congressional intent is that such unemployment compensation be paid f rom appropriations available to the employing agencies. The liable agencies must absorb these reimbursements when they are required to be paid. If you do not employ large numbers of temporary employees or other personnel expected to lead to significant u nemployment compensation claims, your estimates for the current and budget year will not contain any special provisions for the costs of reimbursing the unemployment trust fund for such payments. SECTION 32 \u2014PERSONNEL COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND RELATED COSTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 7 of Section 32 If you employ large numbers of temporary employees to meet p art-year workload, you may request approval from OMB to budget for unemployment compensation costs for your temporary employees. OMB will consider such requests if you can demonstrate that you have a sound administrative control system for unemployment compensation claims. 32.5 How do I budget for personnel vetting? Personnel vetting is the umbrella term for the processes departments and agencies use to determine whether individuals are sufficiently trustworthy to fill a certain role within their workforces . These processes include agency determinations on whether an individual should be trusted to serve in a particular job, work with classified information, or have access to government IT systems and facilities. The interagency Security, Suitabil ity, and Credentialing Performance Accountability Council (PAC) leads enterprise- wide reform efforts to improve personnel vetting under the Trusted Workforce 2.0 initiative. Departments and agencies should work with their organization' s designated Senior I mplementation Official to request adequate funding to align with their tailored Trusted Workforce 2.0 Implementation Plan. Potential costs associated with implementation will vary by organization, but may include (1) enrolling personnel within a continuous vetting service, (2) ensuring adequate vetting staff to accommodate anticipated reforms, and (3) acquiring or enhancing IT resources to accommodate personnel vetting shared services. Additional details can be found in the most recent release of the Truste d Workforce 2.0 Implementation Strategy (March 2023). 32.6 How do I budget for Uniformed Services health care? For Uniformed Services post -retirement medical care. Post -retirement medical care for \"Medicare- eligible\" retirees and their dependents/survivors was funded on an accrual basis beginning in FY 2003. Budget estimates must assume inclusion of all Medicare- eligible retirees and f amilies. Agencies must calculate the following estimates for their budget submission: Accrual contribution to the Department of Defense Medicare -Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. Estimate of the health care dollars to be expended for all retirees. Accrual contribution to the Department of Defense Medicare -Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. To develop appropriate annual accrual contribution estimates, agencies must use the per -capita rates set by the Department of Defense Medicare- Eligible Retiree Health Care Board of Actuaries. Every summer, the Board sends a letter to the agencies promulgating the annual per -capita rates. Agencies must multiply these rates by the estimated average number of current uniformed service personnel. The resulting calculation is the accrual contribution, which should be budgeted in the agency' s personnel account. Estimate of the health care dollars to be expended for all retirees. Agencies must estimate expenditures for retiree health care. (Separate estimates must be pro vided for Medicare -eligible retirees and non- Medicare- eligible retirees). The Medicare- eligible estimates are needed to develop the Trust Fund outlays for uniformed service health care and the non- Medicare eligible estimates to be included in agency budge ts. To prevent double counting Medicare -eligibles, each agency must ensure that their health care account request does not include any amount for Medicare -eligible retiree health care other than the accrual contribution amounts.

Requires Agency Evidence Submissions to include proposals to improve secure access to confidential statistical data (section 51.9 ). 51.1 General requirements Your initial budget submission to OMB (due in September) should begin with a summary statement from the head of your agency and include: The broad policies and strategies proposed and the total amounts of discretionary and mandatory budgetar y resources requested; The relationship of the policies, strategies, and resources requested to the planning guidance for budgetary resources provided by OMB; Significant proposed differences, if any, from current Administration policies; SECTION 51 \u2014BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS Page 2 of Section 51 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) A thorough dis cussion of the evidence, both positive and negative, for major proposed policies. This evidence should include any evaluation results, program performance indicators and performance goals, and other relevant data analytics and research studies; Any significant proposals for changes in the current year budget and the relationship of such changes to the budget year and outyear requests; Any significant proposals or changes in spending patterns for the 5- to 10- year period beyond the budget year and their relationship to outyear planning guidance and the policies proposed for the current and budget year; A separate submission that proposes and justifies (if your agency so determines) the need for additional funding for individual programs in excess of the budget year guidance levels to meet the President's priorities. This separate submission should also identify potential discretionary offsets in lower priority programs within your agency's budget; and Significant changes in full -time equivalent (FTE ) employment. Provide justification for changes in relationship to projected workload, strategic planning initiatives, and reengineering efforts. Other sections in this Circular that address budget justification materials include sections 25 through 54, and sections 200- 290. Budget submissions to OMB should be in the form of a performance plan to the greatest extent possible. Section 230, 240 and 210 provide detailed instruction on developing and submitting an updated agency strategic plan and performance plan as required by GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. 51.2 Requirements for program justification You must provide a written justification when you submit your budget. You should determine specific informational requirements and timing of submissions in consultation with your OMB representative. Where possible, you should include the full cost of a program, and you should align budget accounts and program activity lines with programs or the components of the programs that contribute to a single strategic objective. Your request should be consistent with the funding levels included in policy guidance. If the request is not consi stent with policy guidance, you must provide a summary of what your budget request would be at the policy guidance levels and the reasons why a budget request consistent with the guidance is not appropriate. In addition, you may be asked by your OMB repre sentative to identify and discuss the implications of other funding levels. Prepare your justification in concise, specific terms and cover all programs and activities of your agency. Use tables, charts, and graphs in lieu of or to supplement text. Prep are materials in a manner designed to provide all of the information that you and OMB have agreed is necessary for OMB to understand and evaluate your agency's request and make its determinations. Where programs are jointly administrated by or impact mult iple agencies, information on shared program budgets should be coordinated through OMB. Your request should include any new appropriations language provisions or changes to complex appropriations language, including general provisions. Any change to appr opriations language with a SECTION 51 \u2014BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 51 budgetary impact, including changes to general provisions, requires OMB approval. See section 95 for additional information on appropriations language. At the discretion of OMB, you should include the following information for legislative proposals: Your estimates of the costs of implementing or administering proposed legislation. The assumptions underlying your estimates, including new work years, program outputs, and costs of inputs such as materials, contract costs or personnel costs. You should also include a discussion of alternative implementation strategies considered (e.g., contracting out versus in- house), and a discussion of any models used to develop your estimates. The budget classification (mandatory or disc retionary) of the costs of implementing and administering the legislative proposal along with a written justification for your selection. Productivity savings and/or offsets for these costs. You should also provide a discussion of the methods and assumptions underlying your estimates for productivity savings and offsets. You should also include the following: A comparison of total program benefits and total program costs, using quantitative, objective data to the maximum extent possible, as well as qualitative or judgmental material. A comparison of the marginal benefits and the marginal costs associated with the additional funds or reduced funding proposed. Supporting information that takes into consideration agency and outside (e.g., think tanks, GAO, CBO, universities, interest groups) program evaluations and related analytic studies, whether or not they agree with the proposed policy. At the discretion of your OMB representative, these requirements may be modified or alternative justificatio n materials specified. It should be emphasized that late decisions on proposed law provisions for the budget will require flexibility in this process. Other materials may be requested by your OMB representative. 51.3 IT Capital Planning and Investment Co ntrol Milestones Agencies are no longer required to submit an IT Resources Statement as part of their agency budget submission to OMB. Other IT related materials are required , as detailed in sectio n 55, and submitted according to the following IT Capital Planning and Investment Control Milestones: August o Optional draft Agency IT Investment Portfolio Summary submission if the agency has added a new major IT investment or upgraded an existing IT invest ment to \" major \"; o Verification that the required E -Gov/L ine of Business (LoB) contribution levels are being included in the agency's budget plans. September o Agency IT Portfolio Summary submission; o Agency IT Portfolio Summary Details. SECTION 51 \u2014BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS Page 4 of Section 51 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) January o Final Agency IT Portfolio Summary and IT Portfolio Summary Details based on the President's Budget submissions. June o Optional Mid -Session Review submission To the extent possible, you should align your budget accounts with programs, distinguishing among components tha t contribute to different strategic objectives. This alignment should relate program objectives (see section 240 ) and budget accounts or sub- accounts. 51.4 Relationship of justification to account structure Where the major programs in your justification materials do not coincide with the budget account structure, prepare a table to show the relationship. Arrange this table by program, with all relevant accounts and parts of accounts listed, showing budgetary resources (usually budget authority) in millions of dollars and FTE. Report programs that are mainly grants, contracts or other transfers of funds to entities other than your agency, related salaries and expense accounts and parts of accounts, including allocations of overhead amounts. Where it is helpful to explain the coverage of the table or the relationship among accounts, prepare a short narrative to accompany the table. This requirement only applies to major programs and activities. You should consult your OMB representative to ensure that you provide tables for appropriate activities and that you avoid unnecessary paperwork. 51.5 Agency restructuring or work process redesign You should identify restructuring or process reengineering activi ties resulting from proposed and current investments in IT and other areas that yield budgetary savings. Indicate how these activities allow your agency to utilize existing resources better while improving program management and service delivery. 51.6 Information on grant programs and infrastructure investment Include copies of systematic economic analyses of expected benefits and costs completed in accordance with Executive Order 12893 . 51.7 Performance goals, measures, and indicators Agency budget submissions for the FY 2025 Budget may be structured as the agency performance plan required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (see 31 U.S.C. 1115). Therefore, you need not submit a separate agency performance plan to comply with the Act. However, y our budget submission should cover all of your agency's programs and should address all statutory requirements of the annual \"agency performance plan\" required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. Sections 240 and 210 contain detailed information on agency performance plan requirements. Additional details on applicable public posting and notification requirements are also included in section 22 . 51.8 Other analytical information Additional information may be required in budget justifications on the following: Workload analyses; Unit costs; Productivity trends; SECTION 51 \u2014BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Section 51 Enterprise Risk Management Profiles; and Impact of capital investment proposals on productivity. Use productivity measurement, unit costs, enterprise risk management, and organizational performance standards to the maximum extent possible in justifying staffing and other requirements. Include as a specific element in productivity improvement for activities of Federal staff the gains planned or being realized from streamlining, including reduction of unnecessary overhead, creative use of technology, and elimination of low priority tasks and programs. You should also be prepared to provide information on the basis for distributing funds (e.g., formulas or principles for allocation, matching, policies regarding the awarding of loans, grants, or contracts, etc.) and data on resulting geographic distribution (e.g., by State, etc.), with i dentification of any issues. 51.9 Evidence and evaluation Agencies should use evidence (defined in section 200.22) and data to drive better decisio n-making and more effectively deliver on mission. OMB expects that agencies' budget requests will draw on the full range of existing evidence, including program evaluation findings, as part of their FY 2025 Budget submissions. Agencies are also required to submit an Evidence Submission as part of their FY 2025 budget submissions with the following information: Priority proposals to sustain or further develop an agency' s evaluation, sta tistics, performance, and other analysis capacity . Priority proposals to carry out program evaluation projects Key updates on implementation of the agency's Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plans. Proposals to improve secure access to confidential statistical data. The agency 's progress in implementing monitoring and evaluation policies and practices aligned with the guidelines issued in OMB Memorandum , M-18-04, a s required by the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act of 2016 (as applicable). 51.10 Explanations relating to supplemental appropriations requests If you request a supplemental appropriation, explain why the request was not included in the regular estimates for the period concerned and the reasons why it is considered essential that the additional appropriation be granted during the year. Submit proposals for offsets to be made elsewhere in your agency for both mandatory and discretionary resources and indicate related FTE savings or requirements and appropr iate financing changes. Show the effect of requested supplementals in the appropriate portions of the justification material for the program elements affected. 51.11 Taxes and tax expenditures Reflect full and explicit consideration of the resources mad e available by the Federal Government through tax expenditures and other tax incentives. Tax expenditures are attributable to provisions of the Federal income tax laws that allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or that provi de a special credit, rate of tax, or deferral of tax (2 U.S.C. 622). Tax expenditures include subsidies provided through the income tax system. You must consult with the Office of Tax Analysis, Department of the Treasury on all proposals for new taxes or modifications of existing taxes whether or not the modification res ults in a tax expenditure. After SECTION 51 \u2014BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS Page 6 of Section 51 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) consulting with the Office of Tax Analysis submit a justification of the proposal to OMB. The justification should include the views of the Office of Tax Analysis and address the following items: The nature and extent of the problem addressed by the proposal; The reason a subsidy is needed ; The non- tax alternatives ; and The reason a tax change is preferable to the non -tax alternatives. In addition, you should be prepared to submit justifications for continuing or reenacting existing taxes and tax expenditures in the program areas for which you have primary responsibility. Such justifications should contain the information described abov e. In general, tax expenditures are subject to the same degree of performance reviews as spending and regulatory programs. Tax expenditures often complement or substitute for agencies' spending or regulatory programs that contribute to strategic objectiv es, and the resources and incentives provided through tax expenditures can be substantial. Work with the Office of Tax Analysis, which has lead responsibility for tax policy and analysis of tax expenditures, to develop data and methods to evaluate the eff ects of tax expenditures that affect (or are directed at the same goals as) your programs. You should be prepared to furnish, upon request, problem analyses, estimates of economic effects, and other materials that will provide explicit quantitative inform ation on the relationship of existing or proposed tax expenditures to proposed budget expenditures. 51.12 Major changes in receipts estimates Provide narrative explanations for major changes from one fiscal year to the next in the amounts of receipts reported for any account, trends in receipt estimates for the related programs, and any other unusual circumstances relating to the estimates. Advise OMB of increases in amounts reported to the Treasury Depar tment accounts 1435.00 (General fund proprietary interest receipts, not otherwise classified) and 3220.00 (All other general fund proprietary receipts) when you expect that the amounts collected from a single source will exceed $10 million in any year or when legislation is proposed that will affect any receipts reported to those accounts. Make your explanations of legislative proposals consistent with your legislative program and outyear policy estimates. Cover the expected timing of enactment and the an nual level of receipts anticipated. 51.13 User Charges Your budget request should reflect the results of your biennial review of existing user charges and of the potential for establishing user charges, as required by section 8 of OMB Circular A-25. If you propose new user charges that require authorizing legislation, provide a clear explanation of the new user charge and the legislation that will be required to autho rize it. Include a detailed discussion of plans for achieving enactment of the legislation and the administrative actions planned for collecting the charges if the legislation is enacted. Assess the proposal's chances of enactment and explain why the President should propose it in the Budget, taking into account the likely reaction to the proposal by the Congress and the users. Describe the basis for your assessment in detail. SECTION 51 \u2014BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 7 of Section 51 Refer to OMB Circular A -25 for additional information and requirements regarding user charges. You may also find GAO's Federal User Fees: A Design Guide useful. 51.14 Unobligated balances in liquidating accounts All unobligated balances in liquidating accounts must be transferred to the general fund at the end of the fiscal year unless an exemption has been granted by OMB. You must submit information justifying any unobligated balances you expect to carry forward into the current year (see section 185.3(l) ). 51.15 Direct loan and loan guarantee programs Proposed changes to technical assumptions must be included with justification materials for all credit programs unless another date is agreed upon by OMB. Requi red materials include any proposed changes to technical assumptions, methodology, or source data underlying the credit subsidy cost estimate cash flows, and justification for such changes. Consult with your OMB representative and refer to OMB Circular A-129 regarding other requirements for direct loan and loan guarantee programs, including policy proposals for new or existing programs (see se ction 185 ). 51.16 Information on funding for Inspectors General If your agency is covered by the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended ( 5 U.S.C. App. ), your justification materials must include the following information required by section 6(f) of the Act: 1. Information submitted by the Inspector General to the head of the agency under section 6(f)(1) of the Act: The budget estimate and request of the Inspector General to the head of the agency; The portion of the budget amount requested by the Inspector General for training, including a certification that the amount requested satisfies all training requirements for that fiscal year; and The portion of the budget amount sought by the Inspector General as necessary to support the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. 2. Information required to be submitted by the head of the agency under section 6(f)(2) of the Act: An aggregate request by the head of the agency for the Office of Inspector General (OIG); Amounts requested by the head of the agency for OIG training; Amounts requested by the head of the agency for support of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency; and Any comments of the affected Inspector General with respect to the overall Inspector General request by the head of the agency. Prior to the submission of the President's Budget to the Congress, all of the above categories of pre-decisional deliberative information are subject to the confidentiality provisions of section 22. SECTION 51 \u2014BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS Page 8 of Section 51 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) The Act requires some of the above categories of information to be included in the President's Budget submitted to the Congress. All of the other categories of information listed above continue to remain subject to the confidentiality provisions of section 22 even after submission to the Congress of the Presid ent's Budget. 51.17 Information on agency's tribal consultation process Your agency's initial budget submission to OMB must include a description of the tribal consultation process that the agency conducted related to budget development, and the input tha t was received on Tribal needs for programs that serve Tribes. If the agency has no programs with tribal implications, the section should indicate that no consultation is required. Please confer with your agency lead on tribal consultation in developing an appropriate and effective approach to consultation, in light of your agency's programs. This requirement is based on Executive Order 13175 (Nov . 6, 2000) and the President 's Memorandum of January 26, 2021, which reaff irmed the Executive Order. 51.18 Radio s pectrum -dependent communications -electronics systems Agencies must provide a narrative that demonstrates that the value and availability of spectrum has been taken into consideration when requesting funds for new or modified spectrum -dependent systems . The narrative should include (as stated in section 31.11 ) an assessment of the following: Whether any non- spectrum dependent or commercial alternatives can meet mission/operational requirements ; Whether using an existing or alternative Federal system to m eet the capability requirement is possible ; and Whether using capabilities of similar Federal users has been considered . 51.19 Budgeting for the acquisition of capital assets (a) Overview The Government should have a high level of assurance that the funds dedicated to capital acquisitions support the agency mission and provide value to the taxpayer. In addition, agencies should be able to justify the acquisition and operation of an asset. The generation of a sound business case is a best practice for providing that justification and assurance. A business case should include the rationale for the investment and reference any supporting analysis. The Capital Programming Guide provides guidance on the principles and techniques for effective capital programming. Additionally, budget terms and definitions are included in Appendix J, \"Principles of Budgeting for Capital Asset Acquisitions.\" Other references related to capital assets are included in Appendix K , \"Selected OMB Guidance and Other References Regarding Capital Assets.\" The policy, budget justification, and reporting requirements for capital assets apply to all agencies of the Executive Branch of the Government subject to Executive Branch review. Agency business cases are due at the same time as your agency's annual budget submission (see Table 1 in section 25). SECTION 51 \u2014BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 9 of Section 51 (b) Information Technology (IT) Required data for all IT investments is provided by agencies reporting through the IT Dashboard addressing both overall IT investment spending (the agency's IT portfolio), and the information required for major IT investments, as described at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/egov/ under the \"Strategies and Guides\" section. Agencies not reporting data to the IT Dashboard are also accountable for adhering to the guidance provided to all agencies on how to conduct IT capital planning internally, as addressed in the above guidance, and also in Circular A -130, and the Capital Programming Guide. Budget process guidance is communicated to such agencies individually, regarding the data to be submitted as part of their agency budget submissions in the fall, based on the requirements of OMB RMO with agency oversight responsibility, and other considerations. (c) Non-Information Technology (Non -IT) In general, business cases are required for the acquisition and operation of non -IT capital assets. The definition of capital asset can be found in Appendix 1 of the Capital Programming Guide . Links to the template and instructions for the business case are provided in section 25 , Table 1. The instructions include submission requirements, deadlines, and exemptions. (i) Aircraft An aircraft is a type of non -IT capital asset. A business case template tailored to the needs of the aircraft community is available. Links to the template and instructions are provided in section 25, Table 1. The instructions include submission requirements, deadlines, and exemptions. (ii) Facilities Facilities are a type of non -IT capital asset. When justifying a major investment in a facility, including new construction, full and partial building or modernization, or facility investments that meet the agency's capital threshold, you should be prepar ed to provide the materials identified in section 31.8(a) if requested by your OMB representative. 51.20 Requests for increases to reception and representation allowances If your agency's request for reception and representation (R&R) expenses exceeds t he FY 2021 budget level or the current enacted level, the information below must be included in the initial budget submission: The proposed increase in the R&R account; The account title, account number, and draft of appropriations language for the account; and A brief rationale for why the FY 2022 Budget should propose this increase. 51.21 Analysis of Spending Priorities for Low-Value Programs OMB 's spring planning guidance provides funding targets and policy guidance to agencies for their budget submissions. While these planning targets vary, and Administration priorities change in response to SECTION 51 \u2014BASIC JUSTIFICATION MATERIALS Page 10 of Section 51 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) emerging needs, the budget formulation process always requires agencies and OMB to balance competing demands for Federal resources. Since Federal resources are always limited, it is critical for all agencies to closely scrutinize their current spending when preparing their budget submissions to OMB. In part icular, agencies should look for opportunities to redirect resources from lower priority activities to higher priority activities and eliminate unnecessary spending altogether. Opportunities to re direct resources may include: Identifying activities that duplicate or overlap with other Federal efforts, both within agencies and across Government; Proposing to reallocate funding for activities where a Federal role is improper, no longer necessary, or not the most efficient means of achieving agency priorities; Recommending restructur ing programs or offices that receive funds for activities described in the previous two bullets; and Proposing reduction or elimination of unnecessary or high -cost administrative spending, as outlined in section 31. 5 and s ection 31.15. Agencies should review OMB 's spring planning guidance for additional instructions on identifying low priority spending to highlight in their budget submissions. SECTION 54 \u2014RENTAL PAYMENTS FOR SPACE AND LAND OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Section 54 SECTION 54 \u2014RENTAL PAYMENTS FOR SPACE AND LAND Table of Contents 54.1 Do I need to report on rental payments? 54.2 What materials must I provide? 54.3 What terms do I need to know? 54.4 How do I prepare the space budget justification? 54.5 What supporting information must I provide? 54.6 What is new for this fiscal year? Ex-54 Space Budget Justification 54.1 Do I need to report on rental payments? If your agency obligates more than $5 million annually for rental payments to the General Services Ad ministration (GSA) or to others (e.g., other Federal agencies or commercial landlords) for rental of space, structures and facilities, and land and building services, you must submit a space budget justification in the format of exhibit 54 at the same time as your agency's annual budget submission (see section 54.2 fo r the e-mail address for the submission, which must be coordinated with all relevant agency officials). OMB uses this info rmation to evaluate your budget request for rent in the context of personnel and program changes (e.g., downsizing). GSA uses this information to refine its estimates of rental costs. You should use this information to analyze your space requirements and rental costs. For reporting purposes, include a mounts for the services covered by the basic rental charge assessed by GSA as obligations for rental payments to GSA, but exclude amounts above standard services, such as overtime utility services. From GSA 's monthly bill, use line D, \"Total Annual Rental ,\" plus, in some cases, line 14a , \"Billing Adjustments and Corrections, Current Year ,\" to compare to the amount on the line \"GSA rent estimate\" of exhibit 54 . These amounts are already n et of obligations fo r the cost of operations in buildings where GSA has delegated authority for building operations. The cost of building operations in buildings whose operational authority is delegated should be budgeted in the appropriate object classes, such as 25.4, oper ations and maintenance of facilities. These costs should appear on exhibit 54. Make your obligations for rental payments to GSA (Part 1 of exhibit 54) and your obligations for other space services paid to non -GSA entities (Part 2) consistent with data reported as rental payments under the appropriate object classes (see section 54.4). 54.2 What materials must I provide? You must submit an overall summary report in the format of exhibit 54 for the agency as a whole. This report provides a justification of your agency's budget request for rent. In addition, you must submit a separate report for each bureau or subordinate organization that makes rental payments. Submit a single agency -wide summary report if these costs are paid for centrally from one account. You must complete exhibit 54 using an el ect ronic Excel spreadsheet available from GS A. The spreadsheet format includes inflation factors to calculate outyear estimates automatically and it generates total obligations for rental costs and funding sourc es. SECTION 54 \u2014RENTAL PAYMENTS FOR SPACE AND LAND Page 2 of Section 54 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) The report contains information for PY through BY+1 on: Rental payments to GSA, which reconciles the GSA rent estimate with actual, planned, and requested changes in inventory. Funding sources for these rental payments to GSA. Rental payments to ot hers, both non-Federal and Federal sources. Supporting detail on all changes from the GSA rent bill or GSA estimates of rental costs (see section 54.5). Your submission must support your budget year request and list all applicable appropriations and/or other funding sources by account. Report space requirements to the nearest square foot; state obligations in thousands of dollars and round to the nearest thousand. Where an amount falls exactly halfway in between, round to the nearest even figure (for example, both $11,500 and $12,500 round to $12). Do not identify amounts of $500 or less. In addition to the materials provided with your budget submission, submit electronic versions of these materials both to GSA and OMB by sending e -mails to the follow ing addresses: OMBExhibit54@gsa.gov and exhibit54@omb.eop.gov Exhibit 54 is due with the budget submission. Before sending the completed spreadsheet, verify that t he subject line has the three-digit CGAC agency code (see Appendix C) and the full agency name. 54.3 What terms do I need to know? Agency means departments and establishments of the Government, and bureau means the principal subordinate organizational units of an agency. GSA bureau code means the agency/bureau code(s) recorded on the GSA rent bills or GSA budget estimates for each bureau making rental payments. (This number is not the same as the 2 -digit OMB bureau code described in section 79.2 and Appendix C.) GSA rent estimate means a document developed by GSA and sent to customer agencies once a year. This document provides budget year data on estimated assigned space and the associated costs of that space. It is used by GSA's customers for planning and budgeting purposes. You should use this year's GSA budget estimate (available this summer) to report the GSA rent estimate for the CY and BY. OMB -approved inflation factor means the inflation factor used in the GSA budget estimate. Mid -Session Review inflation factors will be used for CY through BY+1. The electronic spreadsheet format provided to you will use these factors to automatically inflate certain outyear estimates. Chargeback (or adjustments to the bill) means the process by which GSA's customers contest a GSA billing. If you claim a chargeback, you are required to complete a Standard Form 2972 if you are an IPAC Agency and a form 2992 if you are a non -IPAC Agen cy, and provide supporting chargeback data justifying your claim. Total Workplace FIT (Furniture, Information Technology) Program Budget Request w ill be included on the exhibit 54 , if you intend to classify those charges as object class 23.1, rental payments to GSA. The SECTION 54 \u2014RENTAL PAYMENTS FOR SPACE AND LAND OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 54 FIT estimate should be entered on the SUM worksheet in row 33 for the BY \"Budget Year\" (column N) and BY+1 (column Q). More information can be found on the GSA web site http://www.gsa.gov/exhibit54 by downloading the PDF file \"Total Workplace FIT (Furniture and IT) Booklet -GSA\". 54.4 How do I prepare the space budget justification? The following table explains the information needed to prepare the space budget justification (see exhibit 54). Exhibit 54 illustrates the summary page of the submission. There are five worksheets that contain the detail for the chargebacks, planned changes to inventory and the requested program changes. One worksheet is for the chargebacks, and there is one for each year in which to detail planned changes to inventory and the requested program changes (i.e., PY, CY, BY and BY+1). The summary justification consists of two parts: Rental payments to GSA (Part 1). (With the exception of the lines \"Other adjustments,\" \"Statutorily - imposed rent caps,\" and \"Funding sources for Rental Payments to GSA,\" data in this part is derived by formul a from five back -up worksheets); and Rental payments to others (Part 2). Subtotals, totals, and certain other entries indicated in boldface will be automatically calculated (see exhibit 54 ). INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE SPACE BUDGET JUSTIFICATION Entr y Description Report in dollars and to the nearest square foot on the individual worksheets. The totals will be automatically calculated for the summary page, with obligations rounded to the nearest thousand. Report net estimates of rental costs and square feet (i.e., net of any adjustments within the relevant category being reported). PART 1 -A: RENTAL PAYMENTS TO GSA In Part 1, include information on rental payments to GSA only. Report data on rental payments to others in Part 2. Sections II, III, AND IV For PY, CY, BY, and BY+1 worksheets Refer to the Exhibit 54 instructions provided by GSA for specific guidance in completing the supporting worksheets of the Exhibit 54 Excel Workbook. In addition to the instructional guide, GSA will provide t he CY and BY Base Rent Estimate files and corresponding files containing anticipated Inventory Changes for those budget years. The GSA Exhibit 54 instructions can be found at: http://www.gsa.gov/exhibit54 Space budget justification \u2014the summary worksheet Other adjustments Use this space to enter any other adjustments that are not included in the individual worksheets. Include an explanation of these items. Statutorily -imposed rent caps Report only on those rental payments to GSA that you consider constrained for legal reasons. Include as a footnote the legal reference (i.e., public law citation). Supporting detail must be provided, as described in section 54.5. Total, net rental payments to GSA The Space Budget Justification worksheet will automatically generat e these totals. SECTION 54 \u2014RENTAL PAYMENTS FOR SPACE AND LAND Page 4 of Section 54 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Entr y Description PART 1 -B: FUNDING SOURCES FOR RENTAL PAYMENTS TO GSA Funded by direct appropriations Account title and ID code List each direct appropriation that funds rental payments to GSA, by account title and identification (ID) code. Use a 9-digit ID code, which includes the OMB agency/bureau code followed by the 4 -digit basic account symbol assigned by Treasury (xxx -xx-xxxx) (see section 79.2). For PY -BY+1, include the amount of obligations for rental payments to GSA that are funded from annual appropriations and permanent appropriations to general, special, and trust funds. If there are more than three accounts listed, change the electronic spreadsheet to add rows, as needed. Subtotal, direct appropriations Report the sum of amounts of direct appropriations for a year for accounts listed. If more than three accounts are listed, change the spreadsheet formula to calculate the amount funded by direct appropriations. Funded by other sources: Account title and ID code List all other sources of funding for rental payments to GSA (i.e., other than direct appropriations) by account title and ID code (described above). Include additional information on the line stub to identify the source of funding, as necessary. For PY -BY+1, include the amount of obligations for rental payments to GSA that are funded from reimbursements, other offsetting collections, and allocations. If there are more than three accounts listed, change the electronic spreadsheet to add rows, as needed. Subtotal, other funding sources Report the sum of amounts for other funding sources for a year for accounts listed. If more than three accounts are listed, change the spreadsheet formula to calculate the amount funded by other sources. Total, net rental payments t o GSA (object class 23.1) Report the sum of amounts paid to GSA for all funding sources (direct a ppropriations plus other funding sources) for a year for accounts listed. Report amounts that are consistent with obligations classified as \"Rental payments t o GSA \" (object class 23.1). Make the totals for each year equal to the corresponding \"Total, net rental payments to GSA \" reported above (see exhibit 54). This includes payments for furniture and information technology equipment made to GSA under the FIT program. PART 2. RENTAL PAYMENTS TO OTHERS In Part 2, report information on rental payments to Federal agencies other than GSA and to entities outside the Federal Government. Exclude data on rental payments to GSA, which are reported in Part 1.

Report amounts consistent with obligations classified as \"Rental payments to others \" (object class 23.2). Federal sources other than GSA (object class 25.3) Include obligations for payments to Federal agencies other than GSA for space, land, and structures that are subleased or occupied by permits, regardless of whether the space is owned or leased. Note: Typically, with the approval of the Administrator of GSA, you may sublease your GSA- assigned space to another agency or bureau. In such cases, if you are the agency assigned the space by GSA, report rental SECTION 54 \u2014RENTAL PAYMENTS FOR SPACE AND LAND OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 54 Entr y Description payments for this space in Part 1 as \"Rental payments to GSA.\" If you are the agency or bureau subleasing space from another agency or bureau, report payments for the sublease in Part 2 as \"Federal sources other than GSA. \" Report amounts consistent with obligations for rental p ayments to Federal sources reported as \"Purchases of goods and services from Government accounts \" (object class 25.3). Total, rental payments to others Report the sum of amounts as rental payments to non -Federal sources and to Federal sources other than GSA. Make the totals consistent with rental obligations classified in object classes 23.2 and 25.3. 54.5 What supporting information must I provide? Complete and submit all six worksheets of exhibit 54 that support the Space Budget Justification summa ry page. For each change, include the GSA bureau code; the GSA building number (if known); State; type of action; effective date; square feet; and rent, on the appropriate worksheet. For any program changes requested, provide supporting informat ion that identifies the program initiatives related to the requested changes. In addition, provide a list that identifies major acquisitions, renovations, or consolidations required to implement agency planned space changes, as well as the timing, amount of work space, and cost of each action. 54.6 What is new for this fiscal year? Agencies are ag ain reminded of the requirement to include all identified space releases for GSA-owned or -leased and agency -occupied locations in the exhibit 54 submission due at the time of budget submission. For FY 2025 reporting, agencies should ensure that all changes in space requirements (either increases or decreases) resulting from any changes in mission execution or work postures are included in the exhibit 54 submi ssion to OMB and GSA. Agencies may consult with the Public Buildings Service to obtain assistance in developing future space requirements for FY 2025 or for future fiscal years.

Summary of Changes Updates the language to instruct agencies to begin their phased implementation of the Technology Business Management Taxonomy, Version 4.0 (TBM) Solutions layer ( section 55.1). Updates the language explaining why agencies must submit their IT portfolio data ( section 55.2). Updates the language describing the IT portfolio data agencies are required to submit ( section 55.3). Updates the Electronic Government (E -Gov) and Line -of-Business (LoB) initiatives table ( section 55.6). 55.1 Overview of Information Technology Investments S ection 55 provides guidance for agency information technology (IT) budget formulation and information technology portfolio management (ITPfM) activities. By following this guidance, agencies enable OMB to review and evaluate each agency 's IT investment spending and to analyze and compare IT investment spending across the Federal enterprise. Section 55 also establishes the foundation for effective IT planning and budgeting and ITPfM processes. The guidance in this section supersedes any previous guidance documents on ITPfM and IT budget reporting. A s provided in this section, agencies must submit their IT budget and IT portfolio summary and detail reports annually to OMB via the Federal IT Dashboard . The data submitted will be made available to the public, with certain exceptions made for procurement-sensitive information and data related to national security systems (NSS). Specific reporting instructions and exhibits related to budgeting for investments in IT can be found in section 25.5 . SECTION 55 \u2014INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS Page 2 of Section 55 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) OMB is continuing the implementation and maturation of the Technology Business Management (TBM) Taxonomy, Version 4.0, by introducing Solutions layer reporting. The Solutions layer implementation strategy calls for phased adoption over a three-year period , beginning with FY 2025 reporting and building toward full implementation as part of FY 2028 reporting. The Solutions layer data will be available to the public after the implementation process is complete and the Solutions layer data submitted by agencies has been reviewed for data quality. For FY 2025 reporting, as part of the first phase of the Solutions layer implementation strategy, agencies will be required to submit only standard IT investment data attributable to Delivery, Platform, or Infra structure solutions . Costs attributable only to Workplace, Business, or Shared & Corporate solutions are out of scope for this first phase of the implementation strategy. For FY 2026 reporting, agencies will be requ ired to report IT investment costs attributable to each of the six types included in the TBM Solutions layer : Delivery, Platform, Infrastructure, Workplace, Business, and Shared & Corporate. For FY 2027 reporting, agencies will be required to report all IT investment costs attributable to the Solutions layer and ensure the alignment of those costs with their reported costs under the TBM IT Towers and Cost Pool layers. The TBM Solutions layer implementation process is projected to be complete by the time for FY 2028 reporting. 55.2 Why must agenci es submit data on their IT portfolios? By statute, OMB is required to develop and oversee a process for IT budgeting and ITPfM, with a focus on analyzing, tracking, and evaluating the risks and performance results of all major capital investments made by an executive agency for information technology systems (40 U.S.C. \u00a7 11302). OMB is also responsible for IT portfolio oversight \u2014promoting and improving agencies ' use of information technologies to enhance access to information and delivery of services and to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity of government operations. Agencies must provide specified data on their total IT funding, and the information should be consistent with the overall budget submission (see section 25), agency IT portfolio summary components, and Major IT Business Case submission. More detailed technical specifications for the submission of required data are publicly available in the IT Collect Submission Overview document on the Federal IT Dashboard. 55.3 What IT portfolio data are agencies required to submit? An agenc y's IT budget -related submissions reported in the a gency IT p ortfolio summary should be consistent with the a gency 's budget materials and should be categorized based upon the following three parts: Part 1: IT Investments for Mission Delivery - IT investments that directly support the delivery of the agency 's mission. This information should map directly to the agency 's strategic and annual performance plan. IT investments may cover more than one agency mission area when reported alongside the mission area overseeing the IT investment. Part 2: IT Investments for Mission Support Services - Mission support services consist of activities that are common across all agencies and include functional areas such as financial management, human resources, contracting, travel, and grants management . Section 55.6 provides guidance on reporting an agency 's contributions to the funding of a shared service officially designated as an electronic government or line of business initiative. SECTION 55 \u2014INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 55 Part 3: Standard IT Investments - IT investments for technology goods and services common to all agencies such as IT infrastructure, IT security, and IT management. These investments should be reported at the point of management, and thus may be defined by bureau level, functional components, or at the agency level. Consequently, more than one of the same types of standard IT investment may exist withi n the agency 's IT portfolio. Agencies should report at the agency level when the IT investments are managed at the enterprise level. An agency 's IT portfolio submissions to OMB are a complete report of all of an agency 's IT spend and related IT management information , and should include the following: All types of IT Investments within the agency IT portfolio IT investment financial data, including TBM Taxonomy Version 4.0 IT Towers and Cost Pools , and partial Solution technical classifications for delivery, platform, and infrastructure IT investment CIO evaluations IT investment contracts data IT investment project data IT investment operational analysis data IT investment performance metrics and actual performance results data Major IT business case reporting Budget accounts summary Data on projects funded by the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) Contributions to Electronic Government (e-Gov) and Line of Business (LoB) Initiatives (a) Types of IT investments within the agency IT portfolio: 01: Major IT investments - those IT investments that have been designated as \" major \" by the agency responsible for the investment or by OMB. When deciding whether a given investment qualifies as major, agencies should consider any relevant factors, including the following: o The investment requires special management attention because of it s importance to an agency 's mission or its implications for agency programs or policies; o The investment was designated as a major IT investment in the previous budget submission; o The investment has a high annual cost or high projected total lifecycle cost; o The agency CIO has designated the investment as a high risk; o The investment involves a Tier I High Value Asset; and/or SECTION 55 \u2014INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS Page 4 of Section 55 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) o The investment has a high- visibility profile with agency executive leadership, congressional leadership, and/or the public. 02: Non-Maj or IT investments - those that are not designated major by the agency or OMB, or are designated as a \"S tandard IT Investment ,\" \"IT Migration Investment, \" or \" Funding Transfer Investment. \" 03: IT Migration Investments - the migration costs associated with systems in a Shared Service partner agency that are not captured by the lead agency when the partner agency is migrating to the shared system. They are generally only a portion of a larger technology asset for which there is an existing business case. The d escription of the IT investment should indicate the unique investment identifier (UII) of the major asset of the lead agency . 04: Funding Transfer Investments - generally, the partner contribution to a lead agency investment through inter -agency or intra -agency transfers. The description of the IT investment should indicate the unique investment identifier (UII) of the lead agency 's investment. 05: Standard IT Investments - expenditures for IT resources that include, but are not limited to, commonly used enterprise -wide information systems and services, computing infrastructure, and other technology services and applications that are commonly used across agencies. Standard I T investments may also include those indirect, general, and administrative costs that are not included in major or non-major IT investment reports, but do support the agency 's IT and information systems. All Standard IT Investments should align to Part 3 o f the Agency IT portfolio summary. o Each standard IT investment may be classified into one of the following categories: IT Security and Compliance, IT Management, Network, Data Center and Cloud, End User, Output, Application, Delivery, and Platform.1 o Busine ss case analysis is not required for IT investments designated as \" standard IT investments. \" (b) Major IT Business Case reporting An agency 's Major IT Business Case analysis is intended to describe the justification, planning, implementation, performance, and risks of individual capital assets designated by the agency responsible for the investment or by OMB. This analysis serves as a key artifact of the agency 's IT budget and IT portfolio management processes. Agencies should regularly review their business case analyses to ensure that the associated IT investments continue to add the expected value to the agency 's stated business or mission outcomes. Major IT business case analysis is required for an agency 's designated major IT investments and must document, at a minimum: Project -level planned, projected, and actual costs, as well as start and end dates of projected life- cycle costs, including development, modernization, and enhancement costs as operations and maintenance costs (Note: activity -level cost and schedule reporting is no longer required) Information on the various contract data that support a Major IT Investment 1 These categories are drawn from the types of IT resources (towers, cost pools, and solutions) delineated by the TBM Council i n TBM Taxonomy, Version 4.0 (Dec. 2020).

Submission requirements for each of the TBM Taxonomy layers is as follows: TBM T axonomy reporting required for all IT investment types: o TBM IT Towers layer - End User, Application, Delivery, Security & Compliance, IT Management, Data Center, Network, Compute, Storage, Platform, and Output. o TBM Cost Pools layer - I nternal L abor, External Labor, Outside Services, H ardware, Software, F acilities & P ower, Telecom, Internal Services, and Other. TBM T axonomy reporting required only for standard IT investments data: o TBM Solutions layer - required reporting for budget year 2025, technical solutions categories for Delivery, Platform, and Infrastructure. (d) Budget Accounts Summary The agency Budget Accounts Summary provides an overview of IT funding levels associated with Budget Accounts/Funding Sources listed for each IT investment in the agency 's IT portfolio. Th is summary is intended to support FITARA requirements and transparency into the IT investment dollar amount that the agency CIO maintains direct oversight authority. This summary is to be completed at the Agency level (i.e., not at a component/bureau/sub -agency organizational level or at an individual 2 These categories are drawn from the types of IT resources (towers, cost pools, and solutions) delineated by the TBM Council in TBM Taxonomy, Version 4.0 (Dec. 2020). SECTION 55 \u2014INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS Page 6 of Section 55 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) investment level) for the prior year (PY), current year (CY), and the budget year (BY). The summary is to include all budget accounts that fund IT investments across the entire agency, comprehensive for all component level organizations, for agency funding only. The Budget Accounts Summary should not include contribution funding amounts that are reported in the agency IT portfolio summary. (e) Projects funded by the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) IT investments receiving TMF funding must report all IT projects that receive TMF funding regardless of investment type . (f) Electronic Government (e- Gov) and Lines of Business (LoB) Initiatives For OMB submission requirements for e -Gov and LoB initiatives , please refer to s ection 55.6. (g) CIO Evaluations While agency CIOs have authority and responsibility over the entire agency IT portfolio, OMB is only requiring CIO s to provide a numeric evaluation for Type 01 M ajor IT Investments and Type 05 Standard IT Investments. The CIO evaluation should reflect the CIO 's best judgement of the current level of risk for an investment in terms of its ability to accomplish its goals (per 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 11315(c)(2)). The evaluation factors should include risk management, requirements management, contractor oversight, historical performance, human capital, and other factors the CIO deems important when assessing the future success of the investment. Evaluations should be updated as soon as the CIO has completed their assessment. The numerical evaluation should be scored on a five -point scale as follows: 1 - High Risk 2 - Moderately High Risk 3 - Medium Risk 4 - Moderately Low Risk 5 - Low Risk Frequency of IT portfolio management data submissions: o Annual submissions - Agencies are required to update their IT portfolio summary and investment cost data at least twice annually. o Regular update s - Update s to the IT Dashboard should be ma de as necessary to reflect the most current informa tion for reported projects, performance, and risk metrics. Additional updates to an agency 's IT portfolio may be required after the final budget decisions to ensure alignment with Congressional Justification materials or if the agency requests supplemen tal funds that require changes to improve reporting accuracy. Dates of public release of the IT portfolio data submitted to the IT Dashboard will be consistent with the release dates of the President 's Budget. SE CTION 55 \u2014INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 55 55.4 To which agencies do these data submission requirements apply? The following agencies are required to submit their IT portfolio management and budget data to OMB: Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Defense Department of Education Department of Energy Department of Health and Human Services Department of Homeland Security Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of the Interior Department of Justice Department of Labor Department of State Department of Transportation Department of the Treasury Department of Veterans Affairs U.S. Agency for International Development U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Environmental Protection Agency General Services Administration National Aeronautics and Space Administration National Archives and Records Administration National Science Foundation Nuclear Regulatory Commission Office of Personnel Management Small Business Administration Social Security Administration OMB may, as needed, request the submission of IT portfolio data by additional Federal agencies not identified in the table above. 55.5 Where can agencies find additional information on submission requirements? OM B Circular No. A -130 provides general guidance on planning, programming, budgeting, and management of IT portfolio investments. This section outlines the reporting requirements from those A- 130 processes as they relate to the budget. The specific data field elements required for each budget submission have been published on the Federal IT Dashboard, and their technical specifications are available within the system interface Application Programming Interface ( API) documentation, w hich describes how agency portfolio management systems can transmit the required data to the Federal IT Dashboard. Agency personnel with questions about the IT portfolio data submission requirements outlinedwithin this section should consult with the OMB Desk Officer assigned to their agency foradditional assistance. 55.6 What are the submission requirements for Electronic Government and Line of Business Initiatives? As par t of the annual MAX Collection of information on expected agency contributions to Electronic Government (E -Gov) and Line -of-Business (LoB) initiatives, agencies must submit data on their contributions to specific initiatives over a period of three years: previous year (PY), current year (CY), and budget year (BY). Agency shared services investments included in the table below should report code \"24\" for the \" Shared Services Category \" field in the IT Portfolio Summary. Other shared services investments should report code \"48. \" In r eporting to the IT Dashboard, a partner agency should list its investment as a Type 04 Funding Transfer and report funding in the agency funding fields. The lead agency for an initiative should report both their investment as a Type 01 Major Investment and funding from customers in the agency contribution field. SECTION 55 \u2014INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS Page 8 of Section 55 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) The E -Gov and LoB initiatives listed below should be included as part of the agency IT portfolio data submission: E-Gov or LoB Initiative Responsible Agency Identifier Benefits.gov Labor 0020 Budget Formulation and Execution LoB Education 3200 Disaster Assistance Improvement Plan DHS/FEMA 4100 E-Rulemaking GSA 0060 Federal Federal PKI Bridge GSA 0090 Financial Management LoB Treasury 1100 FOIA Justice 0099 Geospatial LoB Interior 3100 Grants.gov Hiring LoB OPM/OMB 1275 Human Resources LoB OPM 1200 Integrated Award Environment GSA 0230 Performance Management LoB GSA 0900 Security, Suitability, and Credentialing LoB OPM 1250 SECTION 79 \u2014THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Section 79 SECTION 79 \u2014THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM Table of Contents 79.1 How do I submit budget data, and how is the data organized? 79.2 What should I know about account identification codes? 79.3 What should I know about transmittal codes? 79.4 How do I request new accounts and changes to existing accounts from OMB? 79.5 What are the budget schedules? 79.6 What changes were made to lines in the budget schedules this year?

Directs agencies to review their accounts' user charge classification and notify OMB of changes (section 79.4 ). 79.1 How do I submit budget data, and how is the data organized? MAX A -11 Data Entry (MAX A -11 DE) is the application used to collect and process most of the information required for preparing the President's Budget. It can be accessed here: htt ps://a11de.max.gov Within MAX A -11 DE, \"exercises\" are used to identify types of data collections. Each exercise name begins with a two- letter designation, followed by the budget year and then a short description of the exercise. The following exercises are used in the formulation of the President's Budget: PB20xx President's Budget PA20xx Budget Appendix Appropriation Language PN20xx Budget Appendix Narrative Additional exercises are used to collect, analyze, and produce information for other major budget processes and include, but are not limited to, the following: EC20xx Corrections for PB \u2014used to collect budget data corrections EA20xx Corrections for PA \u2014used to update appropriations language for budget amendments (section 110 ) MS20xx Mid- Session \u2014used to produce Mid- Session Review (section 10.6) SECTION 79 \u2014THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM Page 2 of Section 79 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) SE20xx Sequestration Execution\u2014used to ensure proper execution of the annual sequestration order (section 100 ) SP20xx Sequestration Popup\u2014used to analyze and track resources temporarily reduced by the sequestration order (section 100.13) SQ20xx Sequestration Report \u2014used to produce the annual sequestration report (section 100 ) The exercises in MAX A -11 DE used to f ormulate the President's Budget are organized by budget account (or \"OMB account\") (see section 20.11(a) ). Before you can submit your budget data, an account must be present in OMB 's budget database. Section 79.4 provides information on how to request ne w accounts or request changes to existing accounts. The next level of organization within a budget account is the \"transmittal code\", or \"transmit\", which is us ed to identify the nature or timing of the request. Most accounts in any year will only use a single transmittal code, but if an account is affected by a legislative proposal or other special circumstance, that effect must be shown using a separate transmittal code. When added together, the data in all the transmittal codes equals the request. For instance, the baseline presentation of an account will be shown in transmittal code 0 of a budget account, while the changes from the baseline due to a legislative proposal may be shown in transmittal code 4. More detail on transmittal codes is provided in section 79.3 and exhibit 79C . In the PB20xx President's Budget exercise, transmittal codes are further divided into \"schedules\". A sch edule is a complete set of data that describes a view or slice of the account. For example, schedule O shows all the obligations for an account, organized by object class. An overview of all the schedules is provided in section 79.5. The budget data is aggregated to provide the totals presented in many of the tables in the President's Budget. Most amounts are reported in millions of dollars. The preferred method of rounding a number that is exactly mid-way between two whole millions is the \"round- to-even\" method, meaning the number is rounded to the nearest even whole million. For example , both $11.5 million and $12.5 million would round to $12 million, and $13.5 million and $14.5 million would round to $14 million. However, use of standard off - the-shelf packages that round these numbers up is acceptable (for example, $11 .5 million would round to $12 million and $12.5 million would round to $13 million ). Within the PB20xx President's Budget exercise, there are crosschecks, or error messages (\"edit checks\") , to help ensure the consistency of the data. An account is \" balan ced\" when the edit checks no longer appear, or when OMB agrees that they do not apply to the account in a particular instance. In that case, OMB will \"suppress\" or \"exclude\" the edit check . Excluded edit checks appear in MAX A -11 DE with \"Excl\" in the \"Type\" column on the left side of the edit check box, and do not appear in the reports that display outstanding issues. You can see the whole list of potential edit checks in the MAX Edit Checks report on the Budget Season Reports page. Y ou can find additional account -specific reports in MAX A -11 DE when you are working on a particular account. C onsult the MAX C ommunity page for resources about how to use MAX A - 11 DE. 79.2 What should I know about account identification codes ? OMB and the Department of the Treasury collaborate to assign account identification codes. These codes are used to store and access data in MAX A -11 DE, run reports, assign user permissions, and identify accounts in OMB and Treasury documents. Each account can be identified in several ways. For example, you can access your accounts in MAX A -11 DE by entering either the budget (or \"OMB\") account number or the Treasury account number. Regardles s of which method you use, familiarity with the following codes SECTION 79 \u2014THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 79 is helpful. See exhibit 79D for examples of various account code combinations, and Appendix C for a list of OMB agency and bureau codes, and Treasury and CGAC agency codes. OMB agency code\u2014Each department or independent agency has a unique three-digit number. OMB bureau code \u2014Each bureau within each department or major agency has an agency -unique two-digit number assigned by OMB. Agencies that do not have multiple bureaus have a bureau code of \"00\". Most receipt accounts have a bureau code of \"00\". Treasury agency code\u2014Each agency also has a two -digit number assigned by Treasury. The use of these two -digit codes is being phased out. Common Government -wide Accounting Classification (C GAC) agency code\u2014Each department or agency has a unique three- digit agency identifier assigned by Treasury. Agencies and OMB are in the process of transitioning from the two- digit Treasury agency code to the three- digit CGAC agency code. In most cases, t he CGAC agency code for departments and major independent agencies is equal to zero followed by the old two -digit Treasury agency code. For other independent agencies, it is usually equal to the OMB agency code. Account symbol\u2014The information in each acc ount has a four-digit main account code assigned by Treasury (or, in the case of budget accounts associated with multiple Treasury accounts, by OMB) that corresponds to the fund type (e.g., general, special). For receipt accounts, OMB combines this accoun t symbol with the sub -account code to create an agency -unique symbol for display. Transmittal code \u2014Each set of budget schedules in MAX A -11 DE has a one- digit code that identifies the nature or timing of the associated data as described in section 79.3. Fund code \u2014Sections 79.4(b) and 20.11 explain fund codes and the account symbols associated with each fund type. Subfunction code \u2014OMB assigns each account a three -digit code that corresponds to the account's subfun ctional classification (e.g., national defense, income security, agriculture). (See section 79.4(d) for further explanation of subfunctions and exhibit 79A for a list of functional classifications.) 79.3 What should I know about transmittal codes? The fo llowing codes are used to identify the nature or timing of the request. Most accounts in the President's Budget show only estimates of the baseline or requests for appropriations for the upcoming fiscal year. This information is normally reported in tra nsmittal code 0. The combination of those regular schedules and any non-zero transmittal code schedules should display the condition of the account as it would exist if the Congress enacts the budget proposals. SECTION 79 \u2014THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM Page 4 of Section 79 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Transmittal Code Title and description 0 Regular budget schedules, including baseline estimates and appropriations requests for the upcoming fiscal year that are not contingent on the enactment of authorizing legislation. 1 Supplemental proposal. Use only for requesting supplemental CY amount s. 2 Legislative proposal , not subject to PAYGO. Use for the effects of proposals requiring authorizing legislation where those effects are not subject to PAYGO. These include both discretionary proposals that are contingent on the enactment of authorizing legislation, as well as mandatory and revenue proposals that do not have a PAYGO impact, e.g., new interfund payments. Do not use for routine reauthorization of ongoing programs. 3 Appropriations language to be transmitted later. Use only with prior approval of OMB when language for a significant policy proposal cannot be transmitted in the budget. 4 Legislative proposal, subject to PAYGO. Use for the effects of proposals requiring authorizing legislation that are subject to PAYGO. Do not use for routine reauthorization of ongoing discretionary programs or for an extension of a mandatory program assumed to be continued in the baseline (transmittal code 0). 5 Rescission proposal pursuant to Title 10 of the Con gressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act. Use only for requesting rescission of CY amounts. 7 Amounts included in the adjusted baseline . Use only with OMB approval. 8 Reserved for OMB use. 9 Reserved for OMB use. When a supplemental proposal or legislative proposal involves a transfer between accounts, omit the transaction from the regular (transmittal code 0) schedules and display it in separate schedules for each of the affected accounts. See exhibit 79C for help in determining if your legislative proposal should be coded as a transmittal code 0, 2, or 4. When a budget account has multiple transmittal codes, MAX A-11 DE includes a \"combined\" display that sums the data in all the transmittal codes. The \" combined\" display is for MAX A -11 DE only; it does not allow data entry, and is not printed in the budget Appendix. 79.4 How do I request new accounts and changes to existing accounts from OMB? OMB's budget database contains detailed information on budget accounts, including: The account title, as it will be printed in the budget; The Treasury and OMB identification codes; Fund type; Subfunctional classification; SECTION 79 \u2014THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 79 Budget enforcement (BEA) category; Congressional subcommittee assignment; Type of account (i.e., expenditure or receipt); Whether more than half of the collections are user charges; Whether the account will finance payments for individuals; Whether the account has obligation limitations; Citation of legal authority to establish the account; For receipt accounts, the receipt type and source category; and for offsetting receipts, character classification (see section 84.3(d) ); and Where the account will be printed in the budget (see section 95.3). (a) General If you need to request a new Treasury account symbol (TAS, or \"account\") or make changes to an existing account, please contact your OMB budget representative. For a new account, provide information on all the items in the bulleted list above except for the identification codes. The se classifications are discussed further below. For new deposit funds, only a subset of the information above is required, as deposit funds are not included in OMB 's budget database. Provide the citation of legal authority and any proposed account number and title. When you request a new account, OMB will coordinate with Treasury 's Bureau of the Fiscal Service to reserve a TAS, create a budget account, and notify you of the new TAS . To establish an account created pursuant to statutory authority, when you have the TAS , submit a completed Treasury Account Action Request form to Treasury 's Budget and Appropriations Analysis Section (BAAS) at baasgroup@f iscal.treasury.gov . For more information about this process, see the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM). If you want to propose new financing methods, reorganizations, account mergers, or changes to the program activity structure in the program an d financing schedule, OMB approval is required. You should submit requests for such changes by October 1, unless OMB specifies another date. If a change is dependent on pending decisions or results from late congressional action or other circumstances beyond your control that delay the submission of the request beyond October 1, submit the request as soon as possible after October 1. If prospective internal reorganizations are likely to require budget structure changes, obtain OMB approval prior to imple menting the reorganization. Until requests are approved, base budget materials on the existing structure. If changes are approved, you must revise budget schedules and other materials accordingly. (b) Fund type and code OMB and Treasury will assign i d entification codes based on the type of fund involved and other characteristics of the proposed new account. The account symbol is based on the fund type. See section 20.11 for a detailed discussion of fund types. SECTION 79 \u2014THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM Page 6 of Section 79 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) FUND TYPES AND CODES Account symbol Type of fund OMB Fund Code Treasury Fund Type Code 0000 -3899 3800- General fund Any receipt accounts here are clearing accounts Special fund Public enterprise revolving fund Intragovernmental revolving fund Management fund Consolidated working fund Management fund Trust non -revolving fund Trust revolving fund Deposit fund 1 2 3 4 1 7 8 N/A EG ES EP ER EC EM ET TR 90xx 991x -998x Assigned by OMB to designate allowances Assigned by OMB for certain merged accounts (c) Budget enforcement (BEA) category For each expenditure or receipt account, OMB assigns a BEA category (e.g., discretionary, mandatory) that designates how the budgetary resources of the account will be classified for budget enforcement purposes (see section 81.2 for a summary of budget enf orcement data classifications). In cases where the account will contain resources classified in more than one BEA category, OMB will identify the account as a \"split\" account. (d) Functional and subf unctional classification OMB normally assigns each expenditure and offsetting receipt account a single subfunction code (see exhibit 79A for a list of functional classifications). In rare cases, an expenditure account may be split between two or more subfunctions. If the subfunctions are in the same function, the account identification code in the budget Appendix includes the code of the function (e.g., 500, 550); if the subfunctions are in multiple functions, the account identification code uses \"999\". In MAX A -11 DE, information on policy and baseline budget authority and outlays must be submitted for each subfunction, not summed up to the function or the m ulti-function level. Annually, OMB consults with CBO and other relevant budget and appropriation committee staff members regarding functional and subfunctional classification. This process, which is required by statute, typically occurs from October through December (see section 25.3). (e) User charge classification OMB designates whether any collections related to the account are user charges, as defined in section 20.7(g) . Governmental receipts, offsetting receipts, and offsetting collections may be classified as user charges. Agencies should regularly review the composition of each account 's collections, and notify OMB SECTION 79 \u2014THE BUDGET DATA SYSTEM OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 79 of changes in the user charge classification (i.e., whether more than half of the collections in the account are user charges). (f) Receipt type Receipt accounts are classified either as governmental receipts or offsetting receipts. If the receipts associated with a particular program have more than one classification, separate receipt accounts must be established (see section 20.7 for a full discussion of re ceipts). (g) Source category code Each receipt type has a number of unique source category codes that enable OMB to produce tables needed for the budget. OMB assigns the codes when a new receipt account is established by determining the receipt type for the account and selecting an appropriate program category within that receipt type (see exhibit 79B for a list of source category codes). (h) Payments for individuals An account finances payments for individuals if it pays for Fed eral Government spending programs de - signed to transfer income (in cash or in kind) to individuals or families. To the extent feasible, this category does not include reimbursements for cu rrent services rendered to the Government (e.g., salaries and interest). The payments may be in the form of cash paid directly to individuals, or they may take the form of the provision of services or the payment of bills for ac tivities generally finance d from personal income. (i) Account mergers Two or more Treasury accounts may be merged into a single budget account with a single set of budget schedules: When two or more appropriations are replaced by a single appropriation. Sometimes the amounts in the old accounts are merged by law into the successor account. When the budget proposes to merge several appropriations into a single account and request budget year appropriations on that basis. The objective of such proposed mergers is to permit greater flexibility in achieving program goals by managing and budgeting at a higher level of aggregation. This objective must be balanced against other needs, including the need for public disclosure and review and control by the President and the Congress. For revolving fund feeder accounts, which are appropriation accounts whose budgetary resources are available only for transfer to specified revolving fund accounts. They should be merged into the revolving funds to which they relate, and the amounts incl uded in the feeder accounts should not be separately identified. In some situations, OMB may choose to merge two or more Treasury accounts for presentation purposes. In the case of mergers involving trust funds and Federal funds, a trust fund may be merged into a Federal fund presentation (and vice versa) only if the amounts in the trust fund (or in the Federal fund) are too small to round to at least a million dollars. The data is displayed in the Appendix in a single budget account, but the underlying Treasury accounts continue to be accounted for separately pursuant to law, unless Congressional action merges them.

OMB baseline estimates follow the rules in section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control A ct of 1985, as amended (BBEDCA). The baseline rules were reinstated through amendments to BBEDCA enacted in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). Each agency, including the legislative and judicial branches, must submit estimates of budgetary resources, outlays, and receipts that project the current year (CY) levels into the budget year ( BY) through BY+9, except: For credit financing accounts, baseline data is required only for net financing disbursements; and Government -sponsored enterprises do not have to submit baseline estimates. Section 82 pr ovides detailed information on entering baseline data into MAX A-11 DE . BBEDCA provides explicit instructions on how to develop the baseline estimates. Some apply to all baseline estimates. However, most rules are specific to two categories of collections and spending: Those that are control led through appropriations acts (discretionary spending); and Those that are controlled through authorizing legislation ( mandatory spending and receipts). The classification of collections and spending as discretionary or mandatory spending generally follows the criteria specified in BBEDCA. Consult your OMB representative if you have questions concerning the classification. OMB may work with affected agencies to make adjustments to the estimates to produce an adjusted baseline to be used in the budget documents. 80.2 What general rules do I need to know? The baseline is a projection of the budgetary resources, outlays, and receipts for mandatory programs and governmental receipts based generally on current law, and a projection of the CY levels of budge tary resources, outlays, and receipts into the outyears for discretionary programs. Below are general rules that apply to the baseline estimates: SECTION 80 \u2014DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE ESTIMATES Page 2 of Section 80 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Legislative proposals . Legislative proposals are considered to be changes from the baseline projection . Do not reflect legislative proposal budgetary effects in the baseline estimates. Supplemental proposal s. Include only supplementals associated with mandatory programs that would finance obligations required by current law in the baseline. Regulations , management initiatives, and administrative actions . Include the effect s of these actions, including planned regulations that are not final, in the baseline estimates, as long as they can be implemented without further legislation. Credit programs. Base the estimates for credit programs on enacted appropriations of subsidy budget authority for direct loans and guaranteed loan commitments. In addition, see section 185.11(d) for baseline requirements for net financing disbursements in liquidating and financing accounts (s chedule Y) . 80.3 What rules apply to discretionary spending and collections? Follow the BBEDCA guidelines and base the baseline estimates for discretionary spending and collections on the levels provided in the most recent appropriations A ct or full-year continuing resolution (CR). If a short -term CR is in effect, base the estimates on the annualized level of the CR. Except for advance appropriations, the most recent appropriations A ct or full -year CR is normally for the CY. (a) CY base Estimates will equal the enacted CY amounts reported in MAX A-11 DE under transmittal code 0. You must s eparate discretionary budgetary resources, except those related to spending authority from offsetting collections, into portions related to civilian pay and benefits, military pay and benefits, or not related to pay and benefits . See section 81. 2 for pay and non-pay definitions. (b) BY through BY+9 baseline estimates In most cases, baseline estimates of budgetary resources are calculated by MAX A-11 DE to be equal to the most recent full -year appropriation (generally the CY level) adjusted for anticipated pay and non-pay inflation using factors supplied by OMB. For the four BBEDCA-specified accounts with social insurance administrative expenses (the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, the U nemployment Trust Fund, and the Rail Industry Pension Fund), you must report estimates of the beneficiary population (see explanation of line 5150-00 in section 82. 9). For programs financed by the Highway T rust Fund and controlled by annual obligation limitations, projections of discret ionary outlays are derived from a projection with inflation of the CY level of the obligation limitation. Outlays from budgetary resources provided prior to the BY should be the same in the baseline and in the Presidential policy estimates. Baseline budgetary resources generally should outlay at a rate that is consistent with Presidential policy outlay rates. Section 82.6 describes outlays more fully. (c) Advance appropriations If an account is completely funded through advance appropriations, the last fiscal year of the enacted advance appropriation is the base for calculating the baseline estimate for the remaining fiscal years. SECTION 80 \u2014DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE ESTIMATES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 80 However, if the Congress discontinues an advance appropriation and provides the funding for that advance in the current appropriations instead, the last fiscal year of the advance appropriation should be assumed to be zero , and the regular appropriation should be inflated accordingly. If an account is funded with both current and advance appropriations, inflate the current appropriation as described in (b) above; for the advance appropriation, follow the guidance in the paragraph above. (d) Discretionary credit accounts MAX A-11 DE inflates CY subsidy budget authority using the annual adjustment factor for non-pay costs from the economic assumptions for the Budget . The estimated policy subsidy rate for the BY should be a separate and distinct calculation from that done for the CY. The OMB credit subsidy calculator computes the subsidy rate using the economic assumptions for the Budget. (See section 185.5 for instructions on calculating baseline subsidy estimates, including programs with negative subsidies.) OMB does not collect baseline information on direct loan obligations and guarantee commitments. (e) Discretionary offsetting collections and receipts The baseline estimates should be consistent with the levels of budgetary resources assumed for the account conducting the activity that generates the collections. When the level of collections is independent of the appropriated level, reflect collections consistent with the level of activity anticipated under current law. (f) Multi-account appropriations If an appropriation covers more than one account and does not specify the amount provided for each account, such as the limitation on administrative expenses under the Social Security Act, the distribution of the budget authority by account in the CY is the base for subsequent fiscal years. MAX A-11 DE i nflate s the CY amount by account to derive the budget authority for BY through BY+9. (g) Accounts with negative budget authority in the CY If the account has net negative budget authority in the CY as a result of a rescission, reduction, or transfer of balances, estimate the budget authority for BY through BY+9 as zero. Prior to setting the budget authority for BY through BY+9 to zero, contact your OMB representative to request that the MAX A- 11 DE automatic calculator be turned off for this row. If the account has negative budget authority because the offsetting collections credited to the account exceed the spending authority from those offsetting collections (e.g., as a result of limitations on administrative expenses or repayments of debt), provide your best estimate of the offsetting collections under current law, and If the spending authority is controlled by appropriations , project the authority using the guidance in section 80.3(b) . If the spending authority from offsetting collections is indefinite , reflect the level of activity anticipated under current law. 80.4 What rules apply to mandatory spending and collections ? Section 257 of BBEDCA requires the estimates for budgetary resources provided in authorizing law and for appropriated entitlements to re flect the level of activity anticipated under current law, using the Budget 's economic and technical assumptions. Include the effect of changes to programs and activities directed by SECTION 80 \u2014DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE ESTIMATES Page 4 of Section 80 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) previously enacted legislation (such as a change in a benefit formula that becomes effective in BY+2) in the fiscal year that the changes become effective. The following special rules apply: Expiring authorizations . Assume that a program explicitly designated as temporary will expire in the baseline if the program was enacted after the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 . Assume that programs scheduled to expire under current law (even if not explicitly designated as temporary) will expire in the baseline if CY outlays for the program are $50 million or less. Assume th at all other expiring program s will continue in the baseline if CY outlays exceed $50 million. For programs with definite budget authority ( BA), extend the BA at the same level authorized in the last full fiscal year, and for programs with indefinite BA, project future BA and outlays based on the program 's eligibility criteria, benefit formulas, and other provisions in effect at the point of expiration. A ssume an expiring provision of law (in contrast to an expiring program ) will expire if that assumption do es not have the effect of terminating the basic program. Veterans' compensation cost -of-living -adjustment (COLA) . Assume enactment of a COLA for veterans' compensation that is equal to the COLA required by law for veterans ' pensions. Agencies affected by these special rules should contact their OMB representative for guidance. You should b ase collections affected by Federal pay rates on rates used for Presidential policy, not on the levels of compensation assumed in the baseline for the pay -related portion of discretionary accounts . If a pay increase for the CY has not been enacted, you should assume a CY pay increase equal to the pay increase proposed for the CY in the previous President 's Budget, unless otherwise directed by OMB. Similarly, if a Presidential policy decision on the pay increase for the BY has not been made, you should use the provisional pay inc rease for the BY from section 32.1, unless otherwise directed. Certain substa nt ive changes to or restrictions on entitlement law or other mandatory spending law contained in appropriations laws (including changes in offsetting receipts or collections) shall be treated as changes in discretionary spending for the purposes of scoring those appropriations laws (see section 21 and Appendix A ). However, in the subsequent budget, OMB can decide to reclassify such changes, especially in accounts that are generally mandatory. If advised by OMB to reclassify the change, the mandatory spend ing entries for the account should reflect the change made in appropriations law . S equestration of m andatory resources for all fiscal years that sequestration is required under current law should be reflected in the baseline in MAX A-11 DE . Temporary reductions of budgetary resources sequestered in revolving, trust, or special fund accounts, or offsetting collections sequestered in appropriations accounts, that are determined by OMB to become available in a subsequent fiscal year without furt her legislative action should be included in the baseline for the fiscal year in which they become available. See section 100.14 f or more information on showing these r esources in budgetary reporting. 80.5 What rules apply to mandatory supplemental requests? Baseline estimates for mandatory supplemental requests will reflect CY baseline estimates of budget authority and the related outlays insofar as that budget authori ty will finance obligations that exist under current law. Budget authority estimates for BY through BY+9 will be zero. However, you should reflect the outlays for CY budget authority, as appropriate, over the period BY through BY+9. 80.6 What rules apply to governmental receipts? Governmental receipts should be projected based on provisions of the tax code under current law , except that excise taxes dedicated to trust funds are assumed to continue after their scheduled expirations. (These receipts will not necessarily be carried over in policy if the trust fund spending is assumed to expire.) Thus, SECTION 80 \u2014DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE ESTIMATES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Section 80 estimates should include the effect of changes to governmental receipts directed by previously enacted legislation (such as a change in a tax rate, deduction , or credit that becomes effective in BY+2) in the fiscal year that the changes become effective. 80.7 What materials must I provide in support of baseline estimates? After final budget decisions, you may be required to submit a table showing the impact on the baseline of estimates for some or all of the following : Major regulations; Expiring provisions of law or programs assumed to be extended in the baseline; Expiring provisions of law or programs not extended in the baseline; Caseloads for major mandatory programs; Management initiatives; Administrative actions; and Other major program assumptions included in the baseline . Show the budgetary impact of each major assumption separately. For example, a change in outlays due to a regulatory change should be shown separately from a change due to the expiration of a provision of law. Consult with your OMB representative on the format and content of this table.

(a) Expenditure accounts (b) Receipt accounts 81.1 What are the basic requirements? MAX A-11 DE contains detailed information on budgetary resources, outlays, and receipts for presidential policy (schedules A and R) and baseline (schedules S and K). You will enter the data for schedules A and S in the combined schedule X in MAX A-11 DE. The system will copy the appropriate entries from schedule X into schedules A and S. Baseline and policy data cover the period PY through BY+9. Schedules A and S include information on budget authority, limitations and outlays. Schedules R and K include information on receipts. For all accounts, except credit financi ng accounts and Government -sponsored enterprises, you must: Submit policy data (all transmittal codes). Submit baseline data for the regular budget schedule (transmittal code \"0\"). Submit baseline data for supplemental requests (transmittal code \"1\") that are classified as mandatory and finance obligations that exist under current law (such as payments under entitlement programs). Do not provide baseline estimates for discretionary supplemental requests. Do not provide baseline estimates for other transmittals (e.g., codes \"2\", \"4\", \"8\") unless specifically requested by OMB. Use the guidance in section 31 and section 32 to develop the policy estimates. Use the guidance in section 80 to develop the baseline estimates. 81.2 What data classifications do I use to enter data into MAX A-11 DE? Report data using the classifications specified below. Multiple entries are required when more than one classification applies to a budgetary resource, limitation, offset, or outlay. When inserting or revising data in MAX A-11 DE, choose the appropriate line number, subfunction, budget enforcement subcategory, and other classifications from a list provided on the screen. For more information on inserting data classifications in MAX A- 11 DE, visit this MAX Community page . POLICY AND BASELINE ESTIMATES OF BUDGET AUTHORITY, OUTLAYS, AND RECEIPTS (SCHEDULES A, S, R, AND K) Page 2 of Section 81 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) DATA CLASSIFICATIONS FOR SCHEDULES X (A and S), R, AND K Classification Description LINE NUMBER Line numbers for schedules A, S, R and K consist of a four -digit number and a two -digit suffix (xxxx -xx). For schedules A and S, the first four digits describe the type of data being reported and the last two digits distinguish between policy and baseline data or describe the types of outlays (see section 82.4). For schedules R and K, the six -digit number (xxxx -xx) indicates the character classification (see section 81.3 and 84.4). SUBFUNCTION For accounts with a single subfunctional classification (see section 79.2), you can enter data without specifying the subfunction; MAX A -11 DE automatically provides the subfunction designation. For accounts with multiple subfunctions, you must enter data for each subfunction separately. CIVILIAN PAY AND BENEFITS/ MILITARY PA Y AND BENEFITS/ NON -PAY Indicates whether amounts are used to fund personnel compensation and benefits (\"pay\") or other activities (\"non -pay\"). This is entered in schedule X on line xxxx -50. Applies to baseline budget authority (other than spending authority from offsetting collections) and limitations. The requirement to distinguish baseline pay and benefits from other amounts applies only to discretionary budget authority and limitations. For mandatory amounts, you may choose to make the distinction, or just to code all amounts as non -pay. Civilian pay and benefits means the amount of new budgetary resources used to fund personnel compensation and benefits for civilian personnel, consistent with the definitions for object classes 11.1 through 11.5 and 12.1. Military pay and benefits means the amount of new budgetary resources used to fund personnel compensation and benefits for military personnel, consistent with object classes 11.6, 11.7 and 12.2. Other than pay and benefits means the amount of new budgetary resources not used to fund personnel compensation. BUDGET ENFORCEMENT CATEGORY/ SUBCATEGORY/ JURISDICTION/ Indicates: Budget enforcement category. (i.e., discretionary, mandatory, net interest, governmental receipt) As a general rule, for offsetting collections from Federal sources, you should classify any spending authority from offsetting collections, the offsetting collections from which they ar e derived, and the associated outlays as mandatory or discretionary based on the activities for which the offsetting collections are spent in the receiving account. This means the classification will have the same classification as the funding provided fo r similar activities being carried out by the account. For offsetting collections from non -Federal sources (e.g. , user fees), amounts should be classified as mandatory if the legislative language that creates the collection is in authorizing legislation or discretionary if the legislative language is in an appropriations act. Subcategory. Includes subcategories from before discretionary enforcement expired in 2002 (e.g. , third scorecard, highway, mass transit, non -emergency supplemental funding, and discretionary change in a mandatory program), as well as the cap adjustments included in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (\"BCA \") (e.g., overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism, emergency funding, program integrity, and disaster relief). Report data by the categories listed in the next table, \"Summary of Budget Enforcement Data POLICY AND BASELINE ESTIMATES OF BUDGET AUTHORITY, OUTLAYS, AND RECEIPTS (SCHEDULES A, S, R, AND K) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 81 Classification Description Classifications.\" Use multiple entries if more than one classification applies to the budgetary resources and outlays in an account. Jurisdiction. (appropriations or authorizing committee) All discretionary resources are under the jurisdiction of appropriations committees. The classification for mandatory resources differentiates between appropriations and authorizing committee jurisdiction. Only accounts that have been approved by OMB should include mandatory resources under the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees. Rescissions and cancellations. Use an emergency, overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism (OCO/GWOT), or disaster relief subcategory to classify rescissions and cancellations of amounts that have been designated as emergency, OCO/GWOT, or as disaster relief appropriations, respectively. Reductions of funds that have been designated as emergency requirements will not be counted as PAYGO offsets for the purposes of the Statutory Pay -As-You-Go Act of 2010. Reductions of funds that have been designated as emergency requirements, as OCO/GWOT appropriations, or as disaster relief will not be counted as discretionary offsets for appro priations of non-emergency funds. Other . The above rules apply to all line entries except the number of beneficiaries (line 5250 -00). SUMMARY OF BUDGET ENFORCEMENT DATA CLASSIFICATIONS If the resource is classified as ...

Governmental receipts Authorizing committee (Not applicable) GOVERNMENTAL RECEIPTS Applies to governmental receipts in schedules K and R. 81.3 What information do I need to report? (a) Expenditure accounts Report all budgetary resources, limitations, outlays, and offsets in schedule X and MAX A-11 DE will automatically copy the data to schedules A and S. For more information about schedule X, see section 82. The following rules apply to expenditure accounts: For PY through BY, the sum of amounts for total policy BA (lines xxxx- 40) and offsets (lines xxxx- 41) must equal the amounts entered for schedule P (four -digit line numbers). POLICY AND BASELINE ESTIMATES OF BUDGET AUTHORITY, OUTLAYS, AND RECEIPTS (SCHEDULES A, S, R, AND K) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 81 For discretionary CY amounts in transmit 0, baseline BA; limitations; and of fset amounts must equal policy amounts. You will enter data in the baseline lines, and MAX A-11 DE will copy it to policy and lock the policy amount. For mandatory amounts in CY through BY+9 in transmit 0, all baseline amounts must equal policy amounts. Y ou will enter data in the baseline lines, and MAX A-11 DE will copy it to policy and lock the policy amounts. For discretionary baseline BA and limitations (except spending authority from offsetting collections), you will enter a CY amount and MAX A-11 DE will generate and lock BY through BY+9. For mandatory baseline BA and limitations, you will enter all amounts. For discretionary policy BA and limitations (except spending authority from offsetting collections), you will enter a BY amount and MAX A-11 DE will generate and lock BY+1 through BY+9. In some cases, OMB will unlock BY+1 through BY+9 so you can overwrite the amounts in the outyears. For discretionary offsets and spending authority from offsetting collections, you will enter data for CY in baseline and BY in policy, and MAX A -11 DE will generate the outyears. You may overwrite these generated amounts. For discretionary outlays, you will enter in policy: o Outlay amounts in PY. o Outlay amounts in all years for outlays from balances (both obligated and unobligated) of budget authority brought forward from PY (end of PY balances). o Outlay rates that apply to BA or limitations provided in the CY and beyond. You may use different outlay rates for the CY than you use for BY and beyond. MAX A-11 DE will copy PY amounts, all outlay rates, and end of PY balance outlay amounts to baseline. For mandatory outlays, you may choose to enter all amounts by hand, or use the outlay rates where applicable. MAX A-11 DE will copy outlay amounts and rates to baseline. (b) Receipt accounts Report data on all collections deposited in receipt accounts (i.e., governmental receipts and offsetting receipts) in schedules R and K. The line numbers for offsetting receipts are also used to designate receipt character classification (see section 84.3(d) ). Only one character classification (line number) is valid for each receipt acco unt, and that information must be specified in advance in OMB's database of account information before you can report the character classification data for the applicable account. The following rules apply to receipts: Past year data will be loaded into schedule R from agency data reported to Treasury. These amounts cannot be overridden but can be changed by OMB when agencies provide valid justification, to include coordination with Treasury (see section 82.12 ). POLICY AND BASELINE ESTIMATES OF BUDGET AUTHORITY, OUTLAYS, AND RECEIPTS (SCHEDULES A, S, R, AND K) Page 8 of Section 81 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) MAX A-11 DE automatically calculates discretionary policy receipts in schedule R through BY+9 for the years that are subject to across-the -board rules. You may overwrite these amounts, if necessary. MAX A-11 DE also automatically calculates discretionary baseline receipts in schedule K for BY through BY+9 based on the CY budgetary resources entered by the agency and inflation factors entered by OMB. You may overwrite these amounts, if necessary. MAX A-11 DE copies the mandatory baseline receipts data you enter in schedule K to schedule R. To change the policy estimates, you must revise the baseline estimates. The following table indicates the line numbers used to report receipts in schedules K and R: RECEIPTS Entry Title Description 0000 -00 Governmental receipts Report all collections classified as governmental receipts (see section 20.7). Offsetting receipts: Report all offsetting receipts based on the character classification of the receipts (see section 84.4 ).

Only applies t o special a nd t rust non-revolving f und expenditure a ccounts ( section 82.18). 82.1 W hat is schedule X? Sch edule X facilitates entering like data into MAX A-11 DE. Instead of entering similar or identical data into three different schedules, you use one master worksheet. The data entered into schedule X populates: Schedule P (Program and financing schedule) Schedule A (Presidential policy data for expenditure accounts) Schedule S (Presidential baseline data for expenditure accounts) For credit financing accounts and government -sponsored enterprises, schedule X populates only schedule P, because these accounts do not have policy or baseline data. 82.2 What are schedules P, A, and S? Sc hedule P is the program and financing schedule. It is printed in the budget Appendix and presents information on agency programs, the allocation of budgetary resources by activity, the status of those resources, and spending patterns. The schedule covers PY through BY. It is used to: Analyze and evaluate the estimates; Compare enacted funding levels to the President's request; Relate budget formulation to budget execution (estimates to actuals); and Identify programmatic and historical trends. Sch edule A shows budget authority (BA) and outlays by OMB account for the most recent actual year (PY), enacted levels for the current year (CY), and the levels proposed by the President for the budget year (BY) through BY+9. Sch edule S shows baseline estimates of BA and outlays by OMB account and covers CY through BY+9. To learn more about the additional data classifications you will use for schedules A and S, see section 81. 82.3 How is schedule X organized? Sc hedule X follows the flow of the program and financing schedule (schedule P): Obligations by program activi ty (lines 0001 -0900) (section 82.5) Budgetary resources (lines 1000 -1966) (section 82.6) Change in obligated balance (lines 3000 -3200) (section 82.7) SECTION 82\u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 82 Budget authority and outlays, net (lines 4000 -4190) (section 82.8) Memorandum (non-add) entries (lines 5000 -5250) (section 82.9) Unfunded deficiencies (lines 7000 -7020) (section 82.10) The data you enter in the Budgetary Resources section and the Budget Authority and Outlays, Net section will automatically populate schedules P, A, and S. The remainder of the sections populate schedule P. The Budgetary Resources section is a common section used in schedule X, the SF 133 report on budget execution, and the apportionment schedule. The Change in Obligated Balance; the Budget Authority and Outlays, Net is used in schedule X and the SF 133. 82.4 How are schedules A and S derived from schedule X? In the Budgetary Resources section, where schedule X shows the total for a type of BA (e.g., line 1160), you will also enter a more detailed breakout of budget authority and outlays used to populate schedules A and S. In the Budget Authority and Outlays, Net section, where schedule P shows offsets (e.g., line 4030), you will also enter a more detailed breakout of offsets for schedules A and S. You will do this by using more than one version of the line. For example, for total discretionary appropriations, you will use line X 1160 to populate schedule P, line X 1160 -40 to populate schedule A, and line X 1160- 50 to populate schedule S. Since baseline and policy should be equal in CY for all data in transmit 0 and for BY through BY+9 in transmit 0 for mandatory receipts and spending, MAX A -11 DE will copy your data entry from baseline lines to policy. MAX A-11 DE will display a CY error if the amounts you enter in schedule X to populate the P and A schedules do not match the corresponding amounts that populate schedule A. Schedules A and S also require that you associate outlays with your BA, so for each line of policy and baseline BA, you will show the associated outlays. These outlays are copied directly into schedules A and S, and are used to populate the Budget Authori ty and Outlays, Net section of schedule P. See the MAX Community help page for more guidance on entering outlays. Schedule P line numbers always have four digits. Schedule A and S line numbers always hav e six digits. Subtotals that appear only onscreen (i.e., do not print) also have 6 digits. This chart shows what the fifth and sixth digits in line numbers mean: MAX A -11 DE Line and Line Numbers Schedule New Budget Authority and limitations: xxxx -40 Policy program Schedule A xxxx -50 Baseline program Schedule S Outlays (policy): xxxx -61 Outlays from new authority Schedule A xxxx -62 Outlays from balances Schedule A xxxx -63 Outlays from end of PY balances Schedule A xxxx -64 Outlay subtotal Schedule A SECTION 82 \u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X Page 4 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) MAX A -11 DE Line and Line Numbers Schedule Outlays (baseline): xxxx -81 Outlays from new authority Schedule S xxxx -82 Outlays from balances Schedule S xxxx -83 Outlays from end of PY balances Schedule S xxxx -84 Outlay subtotal Schedule S Offsets: xxxx -41 Policy program Schedule A xxxx -71 Baseline program Schedule S Other: xxxx -10 Sum of detail lines xxxx -20 Computed totals Sum of the detail lines xxxx -30 Pick list placeholders MAX A -11 DE displays these lines only in the pick lists for collapsible lines in schedule X. Choose this line number when you want to enter a line with a new BEA category, BEA subcategory and Spending Committee (e.g., authorizing committee) code combinati on. 5250 -00 Number of beneficiaries (in thousands) Schedule S Use only with OMB approval 82.5 How do I report obligations by program activity? The Obligations by Program Activity section of schedule X, lines 0001- 0900, shows the new obligations of unexpired accounts for each of the principle program activities or projects financed by the account (see section 20.5 for instructions on when to recor d obligations). Direct obligations are shown on lines 0001- 0799, reimbursable obligations are shown on lines 0801- 0899 (see section 83.5 for more on the distinction between direct and reimbursable obligations), and the 07xx series is reserved for credit -specific activities. The total direct and reimbursable obligations in this section must tie to the totals in schedule O, object classification. In transmit 0, all amounts in this section must be positive. (a) Selecting program activities Use activities t hat provide a constructive basis for analyzing and evaluating the estimates. Keep the number of activities to a reasonable minimum without sacrificing clarity. Do not use subactivities (such as projects or recipient institutions), unless the amounts are significant and the breakdown necessary to provide full understanding. The activities should: Clearly indicate the services to be performed or the programs to be conducted; Finance no more than one strategic goal or objective; SECTION 82\u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 82 Distinguish investment, developmental, grant and subsidy, and operating programs; and Relate to administrative control and operation of the agency. In cases where a single program activity line is used to group a variety of activities that do not lend themselves to a more specific description, the line title will start with the name of the account and indicate whether the obligations are direct or reimbursable, as follows: Account Title (Direct) Account Title (Reimbursable) This naming convention will better standardize and improve the program activity line descriptions reported in the Budget. Unless otherwise noted, you must: Distinguish direct obligations from reimbursable programs; and, Have adequate accounting support for obligations shown in the actual column. Having adeq uate accounting support means that your agency 's financial system records obligations in a way that allows you to create a straight -forward cross-walk between the projects or limitations in the financial system and schedule X program activities. Typically , you will have many projects or limitations in your financial systems that correspond to one schedule X activity. Obtain OMB approval for any changes to program activities compared to the most recent published President 's Budget Appendix volume . The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act ( \"DATA Act \", P.L. 113 -101) requires that agencies report obligations and gross outlays using the program activities published in the President 's Budget Appendix volume . Because DATA Act reporting is done monthly, and is based on agency budget execution data, there are often timing issues with the application of program activity from the President 's Budget Appendix volume to DATA Act reporting. Agencies are encouraged to coordinate internally to ensure that program activities in the a gency 's DATA Act submissions are appropriately aligned to the President 's Budget Appendix volume and to ensure awareness where changes are being made. (b) Allocating expenses to activities Charge personnel compensation to activities on the basis of organizational units or on the basis of specific assignments. When feasible, distribute other administrative and overhead expenses among activities. However, you must be able to readily separate these overhead expenses from other charges. If you need to distribute amounts between two or more activities, base the distribution on readily supportable factors. Be consistent from year to year, and do not rely on overly detailed procedures. Do not report adjustments to obligations in expired accounts in this part of schedule X. Report them under changes in obligated balance, on lines 3011 and 3041 (see section 82.5). (c) Reimbursable programs If your account includes reimbursable obligations (see section 20.5), show the obligations financed by reimbursements separately from direct obligations. For classifying obligations as direct or reimbursable see section 83.5. SECTION 82 \u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X Page 6 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Report all the obligations in credit program, financing, or liquidating account and associated with a credit program as direct. For classifying obligations in non-credit fund accounts see section 83.5 . (d) Program activity codes Program activity codes are unique to each account and have no relationship to the codes shown in other schedules, except for credit programs. For obligations specific to credit accounts, use the 07xx series, as specified in the list of line numbers at the end of this chapter. 82.6 How do I report the budgetary resources available for obligation? This section identifie s the budgetary resources available for obligation in the account and provides detailed information on the new budget authority. This section is also used in the SF 133 report on budget execution and in the apportionment schedule. (a) Unobligated balance The entries include unobligated balances carried over from prior years and adjustments to those amounts (such as transfers of balances to and from other budget accounts and recoveries resulting from downward adjustments of prior -year unpaid obligations). The unobligated balances reported on schedule X do not include expired amounts or amounts unavailable for obligation. The end-of -year balances are shown as a memorandum entry on line 1941. (b) Budget authority The entries indicate the type of budget authority (such as appropriations, contract authority, spending authority from offsetting collections) and whether the authority: Is discretionary or mandatory; and Pertains to a special or trust fund account. Separate entries identify adjustments result ing from transfers, temporary and permanent reductions, capital transfers, repayments of outstanding borrowing, etc. Discretionary budget authority means budget authority under the jurisdiction of appropriations committees and controlled by annual appropr iations acts. It includes budget authority provided in appropriations acts except where such authority funds direct -spending programs, such as appropriated entitlements. Use the appropriate discretionary entries to report budget authority that is classif ied as discretionary under the Balance Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), see sections 20.4(e) and 81.3. Mandatory budget authority means budget authority resulting from permanent laws and includes programs the BBEDCA defines as \" appropriated entitlements and mandatories, \" direct spending programs included in appropriations Act such as the Medicare program. Use the appropriate mandatory entries to report all budget authority that is classified as mandatory under the BBEDCA, as well as budget authority that is classified as net interest . Also use the appropriate mandatory entries to report budget authority associated with credit financing accounts. (c) Entering policy and baseline budgetary resources data Below is additional detai l on entering the data into schedule X that will populate schedules A and S for budgetary resources and outlays. SECTION 82\u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 7 of Section 82 BUDGETARY RESOURCES Entry Description 1160 -xx to 1850 -xx Budget Authority. Includes total lines for each BEA category (e.g., discretionary, mandatory,) for the different budgetary authority types (i.e., appropriations, advance appropriations, borrowing authority, contract authority, spending authority from offsetting collection s). Policy estimates of advance appropriations (line 1180) for BY+2 and beyond will be set equal to BY+1, unless OMB approves as exception. 1963 -xx to 1966 -xx Limitations in Trust Funds. MAX A -11 DE includes data on limitations for selected trust funds where limitations on administrative expenses or contract authority are enacted or proposed. Limitation lines are only used, with OMB approval, in two specific circumstances: 1. Mandatory (l ines 1963- xx). To report information on mandatory administrative expenses for the social security and Medicare trust funds. The limitation(s) applicable to an account must be specified in advance in OMB database of account information before you can report limitation data in MAX A -11 DE. When more than one limitation is applicable, report each one separately. 2. Discretionary (lines 1966 -xx). To report discretionary limitations on mandatory contract authority, and the discretionary outlays therefrom, in trust fund accounts in the Department of Transportation. Supplemental requests and legislative proposals that involve limitations should be reported under the appropriate transmittal code. xxxx -40 Policy budget authority. The amounts on this line will be copied to schedule A. For discretionary policy budget authority and spending authority from offsetting collections, as a general rule, MAX A -11 DE automatically calculates entries for BY+1 through BY+9 based on the BY bu dgetary resources entered by the agency and growth factors entered by OMB. For discretionary spending authority from offsetting collections entries (line 1750), you may overwrite these amounts, if necessary. For mandatory budget authority and spending authority from offsetting collections, amounts will be copied from line xxxx -50 in transmittal code 0 only. xxxx -50 Baseline budget authority . The amounts on this line will be copied to schedule S. As mentioned in section 81.2, amounts on this line should be broken out by civilian pay/ military pay/ non -pay. For discretionary baseline budget authority and spending authority from offsetting collections, as a general rule, MAX A -11 DE automatically calculates entries for BY throug h BY+9 based on the CY budgetary resources entered by the agency and growth factors entered by OMB. For discretionary spending authority from offsetting collections (line 1750), you may overwrite these amounts, if necessary, to accurately reflect levels of activity anticipated under current law. For mandatory budget authority and offsetting collections, entries should reflect the levels of activity anticipated under current law. SECTION 82 \u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X Page 8 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (d) Entering policy and baseline outlay data Discretionary outlays. MAX A-11 DE automatically calculates discretionary outlays (policy and baseline) for CY through BY+9 based on the information reported in schedule X for: The levels of budgetary resources reported; The percentage of new BA that is outlayed in the year th e BA is provided and in each subsequent year (outlay rate); and Outlays from PY balances. You report outlay rates using the separate MAX A- 11 DE drop down menu that is accessible for each budgetary resource, as described in the MAX Community help page . If necessary, you can report multiple outlay rates for the budgetary resources within an account, along with the corresponding outlays from PY balances. To support the automatic outlay generation feature i n MAX A-11 DE, you must enter information developed using the method of calculation (i.e., the waterfall method) that is specified in this Circular and the MAX Community help page . As a general rule, you cannot override automatically generated discretionary outlay amounts. Mandatory outlays . If you enter outlay rates for mandatory resources, MAX A -11 DE will automatically generate the outlays. Remember to include information on outlays from PY balance s if you use the automatic feature. Otherwise, you must enter mandatory outlays by hand for all years. A benefit of using outlay rates to calculate outlays is that MAX A-11 DE will automatically generate revised outlays if you change the BA, saving you the work of calculating and entering revised outlay estimates. Outlays from new and prior authority . Outlays must be distributed between those from new authority and those from balances of prior authority. The distribution of prior authority should be available from accounting records. For CY through BY+9, estimate the distribution based on experience in the timing of outlays for the respective obligations. The following line numbers indicate the type of outlays. You will enter these data in schedule X, and MAX A-11 DE will automatically copy them to schedules A and S. OUTLAYS Policy Baseline Description xxxx -61 xxxx -81 Outlays from new authority. The outlays from new budget authority for that year. For outlays from discretionary and mandatory authority, the sum of all outlays from new authority may not exceed the sum of new budget authority entries (lines 11xx through 16xx) for that year. For outlays from spending authority from offsetting collections, outlays may not exceed the total amount reported on lines 1750 and 1850. Policy (xxxx -61) and baseline (xxxx- 81) outlays from new authority will generally be the same for mandatory programs in all years and discretionary programs in the CY. Discretio nary policy outlays may be different from baseline outlays if budget authority amounts are different between the two. xxxx -62 xxxx -82 Outlays from balances. The outlays from balances (both obligated and unobligated) of budget authority brought forward from CY to BY+9. Policy (xxxx -62) and baseline (xxxx- 82) outlays from balances will generally be the same for mandatory programs in all years and discretiona ry programs in the BY. SECTION 82\u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 9 of Section 82 Policy Baseline Description Discretionary policy outlays may be different from baseline outlays if budget authority amounts are different between the two. xxxx -63 xxxx -83 Outlays from end of PY balances. The outlays from balances (both obligated and unobligated) of budget authority brought forward from PY. Amounts should be shown in the year the outlay will be made, from CY to BY+9. Do not report outlays from new budget authority provided in CY to BY+9. This line can also be used to display the outl ay impact (+ or -) of balance transfers (lines 1010 to 1031) and adjustments in expired accounts (line 3011, 3041). The sum of all years of the outlays from end of PY balances lines (xxxx -63) should not exceed the total end of PY balances plus PY unpaid obligations, end of year, plus or minus CY and BY balance transfers / adjustments. The amounts shown on baseline outlays from PY balances (xxxx- 83) will be copied from policy outlays from PY balances (xxxx -63). 82.7 How do I report the change in obligated balances? Obligated balances are composed of unpaid obligations (shown as positive amounts) and uncollected customer payments from Federal sources (shown as negative amounts). Unpaid obligations are obligations you have incurred but have not ye t paid. Uncollected customer payments are money you 're owed from Federal sources plus orders that have been placed with you by Federal sources, but you have not yet fulfilled. Only if an account has explicit legal authority to count orders from non-Federal sources as a budgetary resource may it do so. Schedule X separately bridges between start and end of year unpaid obligations and uncollected customer payments from Federal sources. For unpaid obligations, new obligations are added to the start of year balance, and gross outlays are deducted. Adjustments, such as transfers of unpaid obligations are added or subtracted, as appropriate, and recoveries of prior -year unpaid obligations are subtracted to determine the unpaid obligations at the end of the yea r. For uncollected customer payments from Federal sources, adjustments, such as transfers of uncollected payments and the change in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources (both unexpired and expired), are added or subtracted, as appropriate, t o determine the uncollected payments at the end of the year. In addition to reporting transactions in unexpired accounts, reflect outlays from and adjustments in expired (but not canceled) accounts. 82.8 How do I report budget authority and outlays, net? This section of schedule X bridges between gross and net budget authority and outlays. It begins with mandatory and discretionary gross budget authority and outlays. Budget authority is reported for unexpired accounts only; outlays include both expired and unexpired accounts. Outlays are distinguished between outlays from new authority and from balances. Next, cash collections of offsetting collections are shown as negative amounts that offset both gross budget authority and gross outlays. Following that are several items that further adjust only gross budget authority: changes in uncollected customer payments; offsetting collections credited to expired accounts; and recoveries of prior year paid obligations. (1) Increases in uncollected customer payments from the start to the end of the year increase the amount of the offset (and are shown as negative amounts in this section) because the increase constitutes an increase in gross budget authority; decreases reduce the amount of the offset because a decrease SECTION 82 \u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X Page 10 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) means that a portion of the offsetting collections (cash) received has been applied to liquidate obligations for which an offset was already counted. (2) Offsetting collections credited to expired accounts are shown as positive amounts here so that there is no total effect on budget authority of receiving a cash collection that is credited to an expired account. The amount on this line (line 4052 or 4142) and the amount in the cash collection line (e.g., 4030) have opposite signs and sum to zero. We do this because gross budget authority includes only unexpired amounts. (3) Recoveries of prior -year paid obligations credited to unexpired accounts are shown as positive amounts here so that there is no total effect on budget authority of receiving a cash refund that is credited to an unexpired account. The amounts on this line (line 4053 or 4143) and the amount on the cash collection line (e.g., line 4030) have opposite signs and sum to zero. We do this because gross budget authority does not include recoveries of prior -year paid obligations. Finally, net budget authority and outlays are shown as the sum of gross budget authority and outlays and any applicable offsets. Below is additional detail on entering the data into schedule X that will populate schedules A and S for offsets. OFFSETS Entry Description 4030 -xx to 4144 -xx Offsets against gross budget authority and outlays Includes total lines for each BEA category (e.g., discretionary, mandatory, see section 82.3 for line definitions) within the different sources of offsetting collections (e.g., Federal sources, interest on Federal securities, interest on uninvested funds, non -Federal sources, offsetting governmental collections from non- Federal sources, change in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources unexpired accounts and offsetting collections credited to expired accounts and recoveries of prior -year paid obligations credited to unexpired accounts). xxxx -41 Policy offsetting collections . The amounts on this line will be copied to schedule A. For discretionary policy offsetting collections, as a general rule, MAX A -11 DE automatically calculates entries for BY+1 through BY+9 based on the BY amounts entered by the agency and growth factor s entered by OMB. You may overwrite these amounts, if necessary. xxxx -71 Baseline offsetting collections. The amounts on this line will be copied from policy offsetting collections (xxxx -41) and will be copied to schedule S. For discretionary baseline offsetting collections, MAX A -11 DE automatically calculates entries for BY through BY+9 based on the CY amounts entered by the agency and growth factors entered by OMB. 82.9 What memorandum information must I report in schedule X? Lines 0910 and 0911 of schedule X display supplementary information related to amount of appropriations used to liquidate deficiencies of lease payments. Use only with OMB approval. While lines 1940 and 1941 of schedule X display supplemental infor mation related to unobligated balances at the end of the fiscal year for all accounts, lines 1950 through 1955 specifically address unobligated balances of special and trust non -revolving trust funds including canceling amounts. SECTION 82\u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 11 of Section 82 Lines 5000 -5201 of schedul e X display supplementary information related to investments in Federal securities; investments in non -Federal securities, balances of contract authority, unavailable unobligated balances (derived from appropriations, borrowing authority, contract authorit y, offsetting collections), and discretionary mandated transfers. Addition ally, certain accounts will use line 5250 -00 to report on the annual average number of beneficiaries who are served by Federal hospital insurance, supplementary medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and rail industry pension fund programs. MAX A -11 DE uses this data to generate discretionary baseline budget authority for administrative expenses for these programs. Use only with OMB approval. None of the amounts on the lines above are added or deducted from the budget authority or outlay amounts reported above. 82.10 How do I show unfunded deficiencies that have not been liquidated? Section 145 explains prohibited agency actions under the Antideficiency Act and associated r eporting requirements when a violation is discovered. Lines 7000 -7020 of schedule X identify unfunded deficiencies that have not yet been liquidated by either a new appropriation that specifically authorizes amounts to be applied to the deficiency or by the administrative application of other budgetary resources not expressly provided to liquidate deficiencies. 82.11 What control totals do I need to tie to? Some of the data you enter into MAX A -11 DE needs to tie to control totals. The following list is not exhaustive: (a) Controls reported by the agency The following is data that your agency has already reported. You must either tie to those controls, or, if appropriate, fix your other reporting: GTAS . This data is drawn from the 4th quarter U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) accounting information reported by your agency accounting office at the Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol -level into a Treasury -operated system named Government -wide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS). Almost all the lines that are used to populate schedule X/P will be edit checked against your GTAS submission. The PY amounts on the edit checked schedule X/P lines must also equal the amounts reported in GTAS within a +/- one or two million toleran ce. The following types of lines are not edit checked against GTAS: Individual obligations by program activities (X0001- X0899) Non-expenditure transfers, e.g. appropriation transfers from other accounts ( -) (X1120) * Specific MAX A-11 DE -generated detai l entries, e.g. new obligations, unexpired accounts (X3010) Specific MAX A-11 DE -generated subtotals and totals, e.g., total discretionary appropriations (X1160) Specific memorandum (non-add) entries, e.g. unobligated balance, SOY: contract authority (X50 50) SECTION 82 \u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X Page 12 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) *OMB will begin to edit check between Treasury accounts (i.e., AID plus main) in different OMB accounts the net amount of non-expenditure transfers for unobligated balances, contract authority, exercised borrowing authority, and obligated balances between schedule P and GTAS data. PY net outlays (line X4190) and PY receipts (schedule R) . This data is drawn from the following budget execution documents: CTA, FS 1219, and FS 1220. The data is loaded into MAX A -11 DE by OMB and locked. The PY net outlay amount on schedule X/P line 4190 must equal the net outlays reported in GTAS within a +/ - one million tolerance. If you do not agree with the amount on line X/P 4190 \"Outlays, net (discretionary and mandatory) \", after the GTAS database is locked (late-October) and the amount is reported in GTAS and imported into MAX A -11 DE, then you must submit a written explanation of the difference to your OMB representative before OMB will consider revising the amount. Since these types of issues generally require a revised Statement of Transactions, you must submit your explanation via a backdated Treasury document request at https://community.max.gov/x/6YLrHQ . Applies to GTAS and non - GTAS users. Follow the process in the bullet above if your agency does not agree with the receipt actuals that have been imported into schedule R from Treasury 's FS 224 data . (See section 81.1). Receipt account information is not collected vi a GTAS. Non-Federal securities (Market value). Line X5011, Total investments, end of year: non-Federal securities: Market value is checked against amounts agencies report to Treasury' s Bureau of the Fiscal Service in Business Event Type Codes associated with the previous subclasses 42 and 43 on the Statements of Transactions. Credit . For Federal credit programs, credit subsidy cost data must match amounts approved by OMB. Control totals for schedule X reestimate and interest on reestimate obligations are verified against agency submissions to OMB through the Credit Supplement Report Exercise (CSR). For most programs, both control totals and schedule X obligation data for reestimates are automatically loaded into MAX A-11 DE, upon OMB approval. Start of year balances. Start of year balances for investments in non-Federal securities (X 5010) and the unavailable balance of offsetting collections (X 5054) are checked against the end of year amount shown in the previous budget. If you disagree with this number, provide an explanation to your OMB representative for the discrepancy. (b) Controls reported by Treasury Interest earnings on Federal securities. Lines X4031 and X4121, Offsetting collections collected from interest on Federal securities are checked against amounts reported by Treasury' s Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Federal securities (Par value). Lines X5000 and X5001, Total investments, start and end of year: Federal securities: Par value is checked against amounts reported by Treasury 's Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Financing account interest. Lines X0713 (Obligations for payment of interest to Treasury) and X4122 (Offsetting collections from interest on uninvested funds) are checked against amounts reported by Treasury 's Bureau of the Fiscal Service for financing accounts only. Capital transfers. Lines X1022 (capital transfer of unobligated balances to general fund), X1235 (capital transfer of appropriations to general fund) and X1720/1820 (capital transfer of spending authority from offset ting collections to general fund) are checked against amounts reported by Treasury 's Bureau of the Fiscal Service. SECTION 82\u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 13 of Section 82 Unobligated balance transfers between expired and unexpired accounts. Line X1012 (unobligated balance transfers between expired and unexpir ed accounts) is checked against amounts reported by Treasury 's Bureau of the Fiscal Service. (c) Controls reported by OMB For both the formulation of the Budget and for mid-session review, OMB provides control totals for net discretionary levels. There are four types of edit checks which compare net discretionary levels in MAX A-11 DE to OMB control totals. Control total amounts are in whole millions. For each OMB account, these lines are included in each type of check: BA/Obligation Limitation: The sum of lines X1160, X1340, X1540, and X1966, which are associated with budget authority (excluding advance appropriations) and obligation limitations. Advance Appropriation : Line X1180 associated with advance appropriations. Spending Authority and Offsetting Collections (Net Offset): The sum of line X1750 (discretionary spending authority and orders on hand) collections) are compared to the net totals for each OMB account. Offsetting Receipts: The total for lines R2004-03 and R1330 -03 for discretionary offsetting receipts. Contact your OMB representative about how to view reports comparing live MAX A-11 DE data to the OMB discretionary control totals. CY net discretionary control totals . The OMB control totals are based on BEA scoring of enacted appropriations for CY. If there are no final enacted CY appropriations at the time, OMB will determine what funding levels to include in the CY column. In some cases, OMB 's control total may need to be updated (e.g., for updated offsetting collection or receipt estimates, for transfers, or for other technical updates). Please contact your OMB representative if a change is needed to a control total. You wi ll need to provide a written explanation of the change and the enacted legislation supporting that explanation. BY net discretionary controls for mid -session . The OMB control totals will be the net discretionary levels from the President 's Budget, with limited changes based on: technical adjustments due to legislation enacted since the Budget 's release budget amendments formally transmitted to the Congress corrections submitted to OMB 's errata database OMB anticipates very few changes to the net BY d iscretionary levels during mid -session. Please contact your OMB representative if you believe a change is needed to a control total. You will need to provide a written explanation of the change and the enacted legislation and/or Budget Appendix language supporting that explanation. SECTION 82 \u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X Page 14 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 82.12 How do I resolve issues with my GTAS control totals? (a) What actuals in schedule X are imported from the actual I reported to Treasury? To reduce duplicate reporting while improving the consistency of year -end data, your agency accounting office reports U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) accounting information at the Treasury account - level into a Treasury -operated system named Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS), which was developed by agencies, Treasury, and OMB. The GTAS information is then translated/crosswalked and copied into the following reports: SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (used to monitor SF 132 Apportionments and used as the basis of the audited Statement of Budgetary Resources); and Much of the PY column of schedule P. For more information about GTAS and the USSGL and crosswalks from the USSGL to schedule P, see USSGL Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) supplement located at http://www.fms.treas.gov/ussgl/index.html. When year -end GTAS information is submitted, the information must not only pass a number of GTAS edit-checks, but a person separate from the \" preparer \" (i.e. data entry person) named a \"certifier\" must certify that the information is correct. In addition, GAO requires your auditors to determine whether controls exist to ensure that the amounts in your systems and the amounts submitted via GTAS agree. See GAO- 02-126G \"Guide for Auditing the Statement of Budgetary Resources \". On a daily basis, Treasury provides your agency with an Account Statement via the Governmentwide Accounting System. The Account Statement reflects all activity reported to Treasury. You are required to reconcile the Account Statement with your accounting system each month. At year -end, this reconciliation should be accomplished before submitting your GTAS data. During the preparation of the Budget, refer to https://community.max.gov/x/h4CpAg for budget season GTAS reports that include the following: MAX A-11 DE Issue Status Report - GTAS only GTAS submissions that will lead to errors in MAX A-11 DE GTAS suppression requests ( link) GTAS revision reports ( link) GTAS TAFSs revised after 4th quarter window GTAS TAFSs with budgetary changes GTAS TAFSs with budgetary and proprietary changes The following table summarizes the actions you need to take if MAX A-11 DE does not agree with GTAS edit-checked amounts: If an error is found... Then... Before GTAS and MAX A- 11 DE agency lock -out AND Consult with your accounting office. Correct the amount in MAX A -11 DE. SECTION 82\u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 15 of Section 82 If an error is found... Then... Financial audit was ongoing or complete Ensure that your accounting office revises the amount in GTAS. Your accounting office must revise both material and non-material amounts in GTAS. Work with your accounting office to determine the source of the problem and internally develop a plan to make sure the problem does not recur in the future. Your accounting office will also need to talk with the financial statement auditors to determine w hether your financial statements for the next reporting cycle should be restated or a footnote to the financial statements is required for the changes made in GTAS. For limited situations where there appears to be insufficient budgetary accounting to suppo rt the budget presentation, submit a PY GTAS -related suppression request to https://community.max.gov/x/kQJuFw. OMB will review the suppression requests on a case- by-case basis. Agency requests should include affected Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol, MAX A- 11 DE edit error, the amount of the adjustment in actual dollars, agency contact information, and an action plan that explores the various options to improve the budgetary accounting. After GTAS and MAX A -11 DE agency lock -out AND Financial audit was on -going or complete Consult with OMB representative. Submit a PY GTAS -related suppression request to https://community.max.gov/x/kQJ uFw for any situation where appropriate revisions were not made in the FY 202 3 GTAS revision window. Refer to section 82.12(d) below. Submit a CY GTAS -related suppression request to https://commu nity.max.gov/x/kQJuFw for any situation where the certified end of year unobligated and/or obligated balance(s) differ from the balances shown in MAX A -11 DE. Refer to section 82.12(d) below. Ensure that your accounting office revises the amount in GTAS no later than 2nd quarter FY 202 3 GTAS reporting window for both PY and CY changes. Include a statement in your action plan of your GTAS -related suppression request. Your accounting office must revise both material and non - material amounts in GTAS. OMB will review the suppression requests on a case -by-case basis. The GTAS revision window will be open to agency accounting offices at the same time agency budget offices are working on the actual column (PY) data in the budget database. During this time, the GTAS -related suppression request exercise ( https://community.max.gov/x/kQJuFw ) will also be available. Agencies may prepare suppression requests during and after the GTAS revision window. As a general rule, OMB will not suppress any MAX A-11 DE edit-checks related to GTAS data before the GTAS revision window closes. SECTION 82 \u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X Page 16 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) While the GTAS revision window is open, OMB will use the revised GTAS data in its edit checks. If your agency accounting office has made all the appropriate revisions in GTAS, then your agency should have no edit -checks problems related to GTAS. (b) What do I do if I do not agree with GTAS non-edit -checked PY amounts imported from Treasury? You may over -write amounts imported from GTAS that are not edit-checked. However, before over - writing an amount in the PY column of Schedule P in MAX A -11 DE, you should talk with the person who entered the data into GTAS to see why they entered that amou nt. If you both find that an amount reported via GTAS was incorrect, then over -write the amount and let the person who entered the information in GTAS know, so that they can revise it. This may indirectly impact other GTAS data that is edit checked. (c) What do I need to do if a backdated Treasury document is required to revise MAX A -11 DE to report corrections to data for previous fiscal years? If you discovered an error in the budgetary reporting for a previous fiscal year, you may be required to record the correction as an adjustment to the data for the previous fiscal year, even though the action taken to correct the data occurs in the current year. This is because budgetary transactions must be booked against the fiscal year in which they were i ncurred so that they can be reconciled to the legal period of availability of the appropriations available at the time. Where necessary, Treasury will backdate the correction to the appropriate fiscal year, to prevent recording prior fiscal activity as current fiscal year activity. This is accomplished by filing a backdated Treasury document (Classification Transactions and Accountability, non-expenditure transfer, or warrant), which shows both the date the correction is requested and a prior - year adjustm ent attribute to backdate the change to the correct period. If this also requires making a change to MAX A- 11 DE data, then you are required to submit a request in the exercise (located at https://com munity.max.gov/x/6YLrHQ ) and identify the appropriate information such as an explanation of why the error happened, affected Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol, MAX A -11 DE edit error, the amount of the adjustment in actual dollars, an action plan, and age ncy contact information. Refer to Appendix F for more details. Once you have submitted your request and your backdated document in the exercise, you may monitor the status of your request via the exercise. You should get PY -related matters like this taken care of as soon as the budget database opens so that you can concentrate on the BY column later. The following table summarizes the actions you need to take to process a backdated Treasury document: If an error is found... Then... Before GTAS and MAX A- 11 DE agency lock -out AND Financial audit was ongoing or complete Consult with your accounting office. Submit a backdated Treasury document (Classification Transactions and Accountability, non -expenditure transfer, or warrant) request to https://community.max.gov/x/6YLrHQ . If your action impacts line X /P 4190 \"Outlays (net) \" or receipt data, and your request is approved, line X/P 4190 or the receipt data will be centrally changed. If the action impacts any line X/P other than line P 4190, ensure that your accounting office revises the amount in GTAS. Refer to section 82.11 . Your accounting office must revise both material and non -material amounts in GTAS. SECTION 82\u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 17 of Section 82 If an error is found... Then... Work with your accounting office to determine the source of the problem and internally develop a plan to make sure the problem does not recur in the future. Your accounting office will also need to talk with the financial statement auditors to determine whether your financial statements for the next reporting cycle should be restated or a footnote to the financial statements is required for the changes made in GTAS. After GTAS and MAX A -11 DE agency lock -out AND Financial audit was on -going or complet e Consult with OMB representative. Submit a backdated Treasury document (Classification Transactions and Accountability, non -expenditure transfer, and/or warrant) request to https://community.max.gov/x/6YLrHQ . If the action impacts lin e X/P 4190 \" Outlays (net) \" or receipt data, and your request is approved, line X/P 4190 or the receipt data will be centrally changed where appropriate. If the action impacts any line X/P other than line X/P 4190, submit a PY GTAS -related suppression req uest to https://community.max.gov/x/kQJuFw for any situation where appropriate revisions were not made in the FY 202 3 GTAS revision window. Refer to section 82.12(d) below. If the action impacts any line X/P other than line X/P 4190, submit a CY GTAS -related suppression request to https://community.max.gov/x/kQJuFw for any situation where the certified end of year unobligated and/or obligated balance(s) differ from the balances shown in MAX A -11 DE. Refer to section 82.12 (d) below . OMB will review the suppression requests on a case- by-case basis. (d) Why do I need to revise GTAS if I do not agree with PY amounts imported from Treasury? Before the MAX A-11 DE agency lock -out, the GTAS database opens for revisions. You must revise the incorrect information in GTAS because the revised GTAS database is used as a basis for revised SF 133s, audited Statements of Budgetary Resources (if material), and central analysis. Information is copied from GTAS to MAX A-11 DE once per year before MAX A-11 DE opens to agency budget offices. However, information is never copied from MAX A -11 DE to GTAS. Revisions are intended to help you correct errors (not to give you extra time to verify your data) and should be used sparingly. The primary purpose of this revision period is to make GTAS consistent with the amounts in the prior -year column of the Budget. Consult with the financial statement auditors to determine whether your financial statements for the next reporting cycle should be restated or a footnote to the financial statements is required for the changes made in GTAS that result in differences between the Statement of Budgetary Resources and the Budget. For GTAS reporting periods, see http://www.fms.treas.gov/factsii/. SECTION 82 \u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X Page 18 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (e) What actions do I need to take if I changed amounts imported from GTAS in MAX A -11 DE for the Budget but did not change them in the GTAS revision window? Before OMB will suppress any PY or CY GTAS -related edit error request, agencies must submit a suppression request to https://community.max.gov/x/kQJuFw and identify the appropriate information such as affected Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol, MAX A-11 DE edit error, the amount of the adjustment in actual dollars, an action plan, and agency contact information. If the changes do not affect ending balances (e.g., c hanges to discretionary versus mandatory coding), you do not need to make changes in GTAS in the next fiscal year GTAS reporting window. For example, if you changed an appropriation from mandatory to discretionary, this change does not impact the ending balances. Therefore, no change is required in GTAS after the revision window has closed. If the changes affect ending balances (e.g., changes to amounts of budget authority, new obligations and upward adjustments, gross outlays, beginning balances), you will need to make changes in GTAS in the next fiscal year GTAS reporting window. You should consult with the person who entered the data into GTAS. If you both agree that the amount should have been revised in GTAS, then the person who entered the information in GTAS should adjust the appropriate beginning balances (whether material or non-material) in the next fiscal year GTAS reporting window. For example, if you increased the amount of new obligations (but not disbursed) by 100, then the ending unobli gated balance would decrease by 100, and the obligated balance would increase by 100. Therefore, the beginning unobligated balance reported in the preceding fiscal year GTAS reporting window should be decreased by 100, and the beginning obligated balance reported in the preceding fiscal year GTAS reporting window should be increased by 100. Until changes are made in both GTAS and MAX A-11 DE, there will be an ongoing difference in the balances reported in GTAS and the Budget. (f) How can I prepare? Actuals reported in the budget must be consistent with amounts reported to Treasury and must be based on actual accounting data. Review any differences from last year 's actuals reported to Treasury at https://community.max.gov/x/HAAQAw to prevent these differences from reoccurring. The website also includes reports that show FY 2020 quarterly GTAS submissions and how they would crosswalk into schedule P. Typically, one group within your agency (for example, the accounting office) reports amounts to Treasury (see section 130.2), while another group (for example, the budget office) prepares budget schedules. Before your accounting office submits its actuals to Treasury in GTAS (described below), you must ensure that the amounts are conceptually and numerically consistent with the amounts that you are going to report in MAX A-11 DE. GTAS facilitates, and to a large extent eliminates the need for, this reconciliation. Consult with your accounting office for any differences that you are aware of and review your obligations and balances reported on your quarterly SF 133 throughout the year. Also, review any differences from last year at https://community.max.gov/x/HAAQAw to prevent these differences from reoccurring. SECTION 82\u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 19 of Section 82 82.13 What amounts in schedule X need to tie to other schedules? The data you enter into schedule X needs to tie to data in other schedules. The following list is not exhaustive: (a) Other schedules in the same account All accounts, not including financing accounts Schedule O (obligations): The total obligations you report in the Obligations by program activities section of schedule X must equal the total obligations you report in schedule O, the object classification schedule. In addition, the breakdown of direct vs. reimbursable obligations must be the same as in O, with a small rounding tolerance. Schedule C (net BA and outl ays): Net policy BA and outlays you report in schedule X must match, by subfunction, the net BA and outlays reported in schedule C, the character classification schedule. If you have only one BA line and one outlay line in schedule C, MAX A -11 DE will ge nerate these amounts for you. Schedule T (pre -transfer appropriations): The pre -transfer policy BA you report in schedule X as controlled by the appropriations committee must match the BA you report in schedule T, the schedule for the budget year appropr iations request in thousands of dollars. Credit accounts only Schedule U (obligations and outlays): In credit program accounts, the obligations you report on lines 0701- 0709 in schedule X must tie to schedule U. In addition, the gross outlays you report in schedule U cannot exceed the gross outlays you report in schedule X on lines xxxx- 61, xxxx -62, and xxxx- 63. Schedules G and H (obligations): In credit financing accounts, obligations you report on lines 0710- 0744 in schedule X must tie to schedule G for direct loan financing accounts or schedule H for guaranteed loan financing accounts. Schedule Y (net financing disbursements): In credit financing accounts, the net financing disbursements you report on line 4190 of schedule X must match t he policy net financing disbursements you report in schedule Y. (b) Schedules in other accounts Non-expenditure transfers: When you enter a line in schedule X for a non -expenditure transfer to or from another account, you must enter the primary Treasury account code associated with that account. The amounts you enter for your account must match the amounts entered in the other account for PY through BY. Credit accounts: Transactions between program accounts, financing accounts, and receipt accounts for the same program must match. For example, if the program account reports negative subsidies in schedule U on lines x341- 99, the same amount must be reported in the associated financing accounts on line 0740 in schedule X and in the associated negative subsidy receipt account. Interfund account: For general fund accounts that make payments to trust fund accounts, the amounts paid by the general fund account must match the amounts received by the trust fund account. SECTION 82 \u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X Page 20 of Section 82 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) 82.14 How do I present transfers of resources? Transfers between agencies resulting from Presidential reorganization plans or enacted r eorganization legislation may involve unique problems. Agency staff must consult with OMB representatives in each instance. When the gaining agency assumes all of the activities previously financed under a single account in another agency, as a general r ule, the losing agency should omit budget schedules and appropriation language for the affected account and the gaining agency should show the transferred activities and appropriation language with its schedules. Use footnotes to identify the amounts invo lved. (See section 82.13 for an example of how the footnote should be worded and section 95 for guidance on submitting the footnotes for printing.) 82.15 How do I present transfers in the estimates? When a transfer in the estimates (see section 20.4(k) ) for the budget year results in a significant increase to or decrease from the amount of budget authority for the past or current year, include footnotes explaining the transfer after the program and financing schedule. (See section 95 for guidance on sub mitting the footnotes for printing.) For the account assuming the responsibility, use the following footnote: Note\u2014Includes $_million in budget authority in BY for activities previously financed from: PY CY [List the full title of each losing account, including agency and bureau, and the budget authority amount applicable to each. Where it is appropriate to show the amount on some other basis, such as obligations, you may modify the footnote accordingly.] If the entire BY estimate is for the transferr ed activity, the footnote may be worded, \"BY estimate is for activities previously financed from [List agency, bureau, and account title]. \" For the account losing the activity, use the following footnote: Note\u2014Excludes $_million in budget authority in BY for activities transferred to: [List the title of each gaining account, including agency and bureau, and the budget authority amount applicable to each. Where it is more appropriate to show the amount on some other basis, such as obligations, modify the footnote accordingly.] Comparable amounts for PY ($_million) and CY ($_million) are included above. You only need to provide a transfer in the estimates footnote in the year the transfer proposal is made. If you use more than one footnote, include them under a centered heading, \" NOTES.\" Modify the wording of footnotes as necessary to explain current year transfers. At the discretion of OMB, transfers in the estimates may be shown on a three-year comparable basis. If they are, the footnotes should be m odified accordingly. 82.16 How do I present merged accounts? Where two or more appropriations have been or are proposed to be replaced by a single appropriation (see section 79.4(i) ), submit a single set of schedules for the new appropriation. SECTION 82\u2014COMBINED SCHEDULE X OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 21 of Section 82 When you merge accounts, you may find it helpful to append a distribution of budget authority and outlays by account to the bottom of the program and financing schedule. For accounts where you have created a distribution table, list each merged budget account by name and provide data for PY through BY. 82.17 How should I treat allocation accounts? Combine schedule P information for allocation accounts with the parent account without separate identification (see section 20.4(l) ). 82.18 What should I know about the individual lines in schedule X? Use the entries in the following tables to prepare the individual lines in schedule X. MAX A-11 DE will automatically generate the line entries indicated in bold face . OBLIGATIONS BY PROGRAM ACTIVITY This section on ly includes obligations by program activity in unexpired Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbols. Entry MAX A -11 DE Details All accounts: 0xxx The first digit will always be zero (0). Non-credit programs: The line codes are unique to each account and have no relationship to information shown in other schedules.

Ex-83A Summary of Object Class Codes and Standard Titles ( Schedule O) Ex-83B Object Classification presentation in the Appendix 83.1 What are object classes? Object classes are categories in a classification system that presents obligations by the items or services purchased by the Federal Government. These are the major object classes: 10 Personnel compensation and benefits 20 Con tractual services and supplies 30 Acquisition of assets 40 Grants and fixed charges 90 Other We divide these major classes into smaller classes and present them in the Budget Appendix in object class schedules. The object classes present obligations according to their initial purpose, not the end product or service. For example, if you pay a Federal employee who constructs a building, classify the obligations for the SECTION 83 \u2014OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE O) Page 2 of Section 83 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) employee's wages under Personnel compensation and benefits , rather than Acquisition of assets. If you purchase a building, classify the contractual obligations under Acquisition of assets . You record obl igations when the Federal Government places an order for an item or a service, awards a contract, receives a service, or enters into similar transactions that will require payments in the same or a future period (see section 20.5). You also record obligations when you make an expenditure transfer between Federal Government accounts (see section 20.4(j) ). 83.2 Why must I report object class information? You must report object class information because the law ( 31 U.S.C. 1104(b) ) requires the President's Budget to present obligations by object class for each account. 83.3 H ow do object classes compare to functional and character classes and pro gram activity? The following table shows how the object classification system differs from the other classification systems used in the President's Budget. Classification System What is classified? What does it tell me? Object class Obligations Goods or services or items purchased, for example, supplies, rent, or equipment Program activity (see section 82. 5) Obligations Activity, project, or other programmatic distinction Functional class (see section 79. 3(d)) Budget authority, outlays, and offsetting receipts Major purpose served, for example, national defense, health, income security Character class (see section 84. 4) Budget authority, outlays, and offsetting receipts Whether the amount pays for an investment or noninvestment and whether the amount is a g rant to a State and local government or a direct Federal program; If investment, then, what type: physical asset, conduct of R&D, or conduct of education and training 83.4 How does the object class schedule relate to the program and financing schedule? You report object class information whenever you report obligations on a program and financing (P&F) schedule (except you do not report object class information for credit financing accounts). This means you report obligations by object class separately for the regular budget requests, supplemental budget requests, rescission proposals, and legislative proposals. In addition, object class schedules separately identify the following types of obligations: Direct and reimbursable obligations (see section 83.5). Obligations between agencies (see section 83.14). 83.5 How can I determine whether an obligation should be classified as direct or reimbursable? In general, reimbursable obligations are those financed by offsetting collections (see section 20.7(d) ) received in return for goods and services provided, while all other obligations are direct. However, there are exceptions. The following table identifies the criteria used to identify whether obligation s are direct or SECTION 83 \u2014OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE O) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 83 reimbursable. For information regarding budget authority and fund type when considering the classification of obligations , please refer to section 19 of Appendix F. If the obligations are . . . And if . . . And the offsetting c ollections lines are from . . . Then the classification is . . . NOT financed from offsetting collections Direct Financed from any type of budgetary resources, including offsetting collections The activity is in a credit program, financing, or liquidating account and associated with a credit program Direct Financed from offsetting collections from: Direct Asset sales (including GSA recycling funds); Non-Federal sources (lines 4033 or 4123) Interest 4031 Interest on uninvested funds; Lines 4032 or 4122 Compulsory collections derived from the government exercising its sovereign powers, e.g., taxes, compulsory user charges, regulatory fees, inspection fees, customs duties, license fees; Non-Federal sources (lines 4033 or 4123) or Offsetting Governmental Collections (lines 4034 or 4124) Intragovernmental expenditure or non - expenditure transfers; There is no benefit exchanged to the paying account (e.g., does not receive a good or service) Federal sources (lines 4030 or 4120) Donations; Non-Federal sources (lines 4033 or Federal (lines 4030 or 4120) or Non-Federal sources (lines 4033 or 4123) Intergovernmental Cooperation Act Non-Federal sources (lines 4033 or 4123) SECTION 83 \u2014OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE O) Page 4 of Section 83 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) If the obligations are . . .

Financed from offsetting collections from other Federal government account(s) The collections are for a jointly funded grant or project Federal sources (lines 4030 or 4120) Reimbursable The amounts you classify as reimbursable obligations in both schedule O and P for a budget account should be identical with the following exceptions: Line 9995, Adjustment for rounding, schedule O may contain a mixture of direct and reimbursable obligations. These a mounts are not material because they are normally $4 million or less; Credit financing accounts do not have any schedule O . Schedule O . Use the 4 -digit object class line numbers in exhibit 83A when you enter obligations by object class in schedule O. Be sure to use the correct prefix to distinguish reimbursable from direct obligations. Schedule P . Use the 4 -digit program activity codes described in section 82.5 when you report obligations. For reimbursable obligations, use 08xx. 83.6 What object cla ss codes and definitions should I use? Major object classes are divided into smaller classes. The following table provides the codes, standard titles, and definitions used to identify detailed object class data. Exhibit 83A summarizes the codes and standard titles used in schedule O. Entry Description 10 PERSONNEL COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS This major object class consists of object classes 11, 12, and 13. 11 Personnel compensation Compensation directly related to duties performed for the g overnment by Federal civilian employees, military personnel, and non -Federal personnel. Object class 11 covers object classes 11.1 through 11.8. SECTION 83 \u2014OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE O) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 83 Entry Description 11.1 Full- time permanent For full -time civilian employees with permanent appointments. Full- time permanent employees are those who are full- time civilian employees with permanent appointments as defined by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The nature of the employee's appointment is contro lling, not the nature of the position. For this object class, include full-time permanent employees in the: Competitive Service with career and career -conditional appointments. Excepted Service whose appointments carry no restriction or condition. Include those serving trial periods or whose tenure is equivalent to career -conditional tenure in the Competitive Service. Exclude those serving on indefinite appointments and appoint ments limited to a specific time. Senior Executive Service (SES) with career appointments as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(4) a nd non -career appointments as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(7). Refer to your agency's human resources office for assistance on the types of appointments for staff in your agency. Include: Regular salaries and wages paid to the employees (some of which may be withheld from the employee's check to pay taxes, to pay a bill in a credit union, or to pay the employee's share of life and health insurance). Other payments that become part of their basic pay (for example, geographic differentials, and critical position pay). Regular salaries and wages paid while the employees are on paid leave, such as annual, sick, or compensatory leave. Lump sum payments for annu al leave upon separation (also known as terminal leave payments). Exclude: Compensation above the basic rate, for example, overtime or other premium pay, which will be classified in object class 11.5, Other personnel compensation. Full- time temporary employees who are full -time civilian employees with temporary appointments as defined by OPM who will be classified in object class 11.3, Other than full -time permanent . 11.3 Other than full -time permanent Regular salaries and wages paid to civilian em ployees for part -time, temporary, or intermittent employment (see note below). Include: Part-time permanent employees, that is, employees with appointments that require work on a prearranged schedule of fewer hours or days of work than prescribed for full -time employees in the same group or class. Temporary employees, that is, employees with appointments for a limited period of time that is generally less than a year. For example: SECTION 83 \u2014OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE O) Page 6 of Section 83 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Entry Description (a) full -time temporary employees, (b) seasonal employees without permanent appointments, (c) employees with term appointments, and (d) employees with indefinite appointments. Personnel appointments and advisory committees. Intermittent employees, that is, employees with appointments that require work on an irregular or occasional basis and who are paid only for the time actually employed or services actually rendered. Note: For personal services contracts with individuals, who are classified by OPM as Federal employees, classify the basic pay in this obje ct class and classify compensation above the basic pay in object class 11.5, Other personnel compensation. On the other hand, classify the payments to a contractor principally for the personal services of a group of the contractor's employees according to the type of contract involved (for example, classify personal services contracts for operation and maintenance of facilities under object class 25.4). 11.5 Other personnel compensation Compensation above the basic rates paid directly to civilian employees. Include: Overtime, which is pay for services in excess of the established work period as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5542 , standby duty and administratively uncontrollable in 5 U.S.C. 5545 , and unscheduled availability duty hour s for criminal investigations as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5 545(a) .

Post differentials, which are authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5925 above the basic rate for service at hardship posts abroad that are based upon conditions of environment substantially different from those in the continental United States and warrant additional pay as a recruitment and retention incentive. Hazardous duty pay, which is pay above the basic rate because of assignments involving performance of duties that subject the employee to hazards or physical hardships. Note : Post diff erentials and hazardous duty pay result from the job or services performed. For example, a job performed at a hardship post abroad or under hazardous duty is different from what might appear to be the same job performed elsewhere and under non -hazardous c onditions. Hence, both are classified with other pay in object class 11 and not as benefits in object class 12. By contrast, compensation in the form of cost of living allowances are classified as benefits in object class 12 because they do not result fr om the job or services performed. The cost for a job in one locale is different from the same job in another locale simply because the cost of living is higher in one locale. Supervisory differential, which is pay above the basic rate to adjust the compensation of a supervisor to a level greater than the highest paid subordinate.

A detailed Federal employee continues to receive pay, allowances, and benefits from the Federal agency. In some cases, these costs are reimbursed by the non -Federal organization. Federal employees on leave without pay (LWOP) . A Federal employee on LWOP is paid by the non-Federal organization to which he or she is assigned. The salary paid by the non-Federal organization may be more or less than the employee's current Federal salary. If the rate of pay of the non-Federal organization is less, then the Federal agency may pay a su pplemental salary to the employee. Also under the IPA, an employee of a non -Federal organization may be assigned temporarily to a Federal agency either (1) with a temporary Federal appointment or (2) on detail. Non-Federal employees with temporary Federa l appointments . A non-Federal employee with a temporary Federal appointment is paid by the Federal agency to which he or she is assigned. However, he or she is eligible to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program only if the Federal appoin tment results in the loss of coverage under the non -Federal health benefits system. He or she is not covered by any retirement system for Federal employees or by the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Program. Non-Federal employees detailed to a Federal p osition . A non-federal employee who is detailed to a federal agency continues to receive pay, allowances, and benefits from the non -federal organization to which he or she is employed. In some cases, these costs may be reimbursed by the Federal agency. In addition, if the non -Federal salary of the employee on detail is less than the minimum rate of pay for the Federal position, the Federal agency may supplement the salary to make up the difference. Cost-shar ing arrangements for IPA assignments are negotiated between the participating organizations. The Federal agency may agree to pay all, some, or none of the costs associated with an assignment. These include basic pay, supplemental pay, fringe benefits, and travel and relocation expenses. Because of these cost -sharing arrangements you should use the following table to classify these obligations. If the obligations are ... And if the employees is ... Then classify in object class ...

Tricare is a regionally administered program which provides healthcare for uniform service members, retirees, survivors, and their families. This program combines healthcare resources of the Air Force, Army, and Navy while enhancing them with a variety of civilian healthcare professionals. The National Defense Authorization Act replaces annual appropriations to the military personnel accounts of the Department of Defense (DoD) with permanent , indefinite appropriations from the General Fund of the Treasury. The Tricare accrual payments are made at the beginning of each year, instead of at the end of each month, and will be based on planned troop levels within the enacted DoD budget, instead of on the actual number of military personnel at the end of each month. The funding is shown in separate accounts for the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Army reserve, the Navy reserve, the Marine Corps reserve, the Air Force reserve, the Army National Guard and the Air Force National Guard. These accounts will, in turn, pay the accruals to the DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. Tricare benefits are earned by all current uniformed service members not just those in the DoD. This means that accounts for the Commissioned Corps in the Public Health Service in the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Coast Guard in the Department of Homeland Security, and the Commissioned Corps in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Department of Commerce will also pay the accruals to the DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund.

You must first enter all object class information in schedule O in order to populate the Appendix with object class data. The Appendix presents object class information in tables called object class schedules, which display the object class codes, the object class titles, and the amounts of obligations in the past, current, and budget year. Schedule O . Object class data are displayed in on the basis of a 4 -digit line number followed by a 2-digit line serial number. The 4 -digit line number is made up of a prefix and a 3-digit object class code . The prefix for direct obligations is 1xxx and for reimbursable obligations is 2xxx. See exhibit 83A for a list of the 3 -digit objec t class codes. Note: The 3 -digit object class code in schedule O is the same 3 -digit object class code in the Appendix , except that in the Appendix there is a decimal before the last digit . See section 83.7 for the definitions of the object classes. Appendix schedules. The object class schedules in the Appendix present the 3 -digit object class codes and the object class titles. Normally, the Appendix will include a separate object class schedule for each P&F schedule that reports obligations (see exhib its 83B). However, when all obligations in a P&F schedule are classified in a single object class, there will be no object class schedule in the Appendix . Instead, the code for the appropriate object class will be identified in the P&F schedule in parentheses at the end of the line for total new obligations, unexpired accounts. For example, if all obligations in a P&F are for grants, then \"(object class 41.0)\" will be at the end of the stub entry on line 10.00 of the P&F. Although there will be no object class schedule printed in the Appendix , you must enter the data in schedule O. Normally, the Appendix includes only one object class line for each object class code and uses the standard titles listed in section 83.7. The default 2 -digit line serial number is 01. However, you may insert additional object class lines in MAX A-11 DE and edit the standard titles. For example, to present employee travel separately from grantee travel in object class 21.0, Travel and transportation of persons , you may insert another line in schedule O, edit the standard titles, and distribute the obligations between the two lines. SECTION 83 \u2014OBJECT CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE O) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 31 of Section 83 Allocations between agencies . In some cases, funds appropriated to the President or to an agency are allocated to one or more agencies that help to carry out the program. Obligations incurred under such allocations are included in the data for the account to which the appropriation was made in t he allocating agency, that is, the parent account. The parent account must enter the data in schedule O. The parent account may use additional object class lines (as described above) to separately present the parent and allocation account activity. 83.18 When I report data in schedule O , will it generate subtotals or totals? Yes. MAX A-11 DE will generate subtotals for different types of obligations from the amounts that you entered, as follows: For reimbursable obligations (lines 2xxx), MAX A -11 DE w ill automatically generate a subtotal line 2990 when you enter at least one amount on lines 2xxx. For direct obligations (lines 1xxx), MAX A -11 DE will automatically generate a subtotal line 1990 when you enter more than one amount on lines 1xxx. MAX A-11 DE will generate \"Total new obligations, unexpired accounts\" on line 9999, when you enter more than one amount above this line.

SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Section 84 SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) Table of Contents 84.1 What is the purpose of the character classification system? 84.2 What are the different character classifications and how are they used? 84.3 What do I need to know about reporting the data and relationships with other data requirements? 84.4 How do I report character classification in MAX A-11 DE ? Ex-84 Summary of Character Classification Codes (Schedule C) Summary of Changes Clarifies technical guidance on entering character classification lines in MAX A-11 DE (section 84.3). Clarifies language and requirements for reporting character classification when there are transfers (section 84.3). Removes reference that research and development spending should be consistent with financial reporting, as the requirements in OMB Circular A-136 section II.4.10 and the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards 8, Chapter 7 have been rescinded by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (section 84.3(g) ). Adds reminder to agencies that the research and development service contracts should follow acquisition guidance ( section 84.3(h) ). 84.1 What is the purpose of the character classification system? Character classification is used to distinguish between funding for investment and non -investment activities in the Budget and also to distinguish funding for grants -in-aid from funding for direct Federal programs. Character classi fication is used to capture gross spending on these activities even when they are financed by offsetting collections within an account. Character classification is recorded in s chedule C of MAX A - 11 DE. See exhibit 84 for a summary of character classification line numbers in s chedule C and see section 79 for more information about MAX A-11 DE . The data entered in s chedule C are used in the production of the Historical Tables publ ished with the Budget as well as for special analyses in the Budget.1 84.2 What are the different character classifications and how are they used? I nvestment activities in s chedule C are coded as Construction and rehabilitation (lines 1311- 1314); Major equipment (lines 1321-1324); Commodity inventories (line 1330); Purchases and sales of land and structures for Federal use (line 1340); Other physical assets (lines 1351 -1352); Conduct of research and development (lines 1411- 1432); and Conduct of education and training (lines 1511-1512). 1 For example, for the 2024 Budget, character class data informed the analyses in the \"Federal Investment \", \"Research and Development \", and \" Aid to State and Local Governments \" c hapters of the Analytical Pe rspectives volume of the budget. SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) Page 2 of Section 84 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Non-investment activities are coded as Grants, other than shared revenues (line 2001); Grants, shared revenues (line 2003); and Direct Federal programs (line 2004). In every classification series, grants are coded on odd numbered lines while direct Federal programs are coded on even numbered lines. See section 84.4 for detailed descriptions of all of the line numbers that you must use to report character classification. (a) Federal Investment (character class co des 1xxx) Federal investment is spending for programs and activities that will yield benefits largely in the future. (b) Physical Assets (character class codes 13xx) Physical assets are land, structures, equipment, and intellectual property (e.g., software or applications) that have an estimated useful life of two years or more; or commodity inventories. This character class code is used to enter amounts for the purchase, construction, manufacture, rehabilitation, or major improvement of physical assets regardless of whether the assets are owned or operated by the Federal Government, States, municipalities, or private individuals. The cost of the asset includes both its purchase price and all other costs incurred to bring it to a form and location for its intended use. Within this character class code, agencies are also required to identify spending for research and development (R&D) facilities and major equipment. For reporting Construction and Rehabilitation, R&D facilities (lines 1311 and 1312), include the following: Construction of facilities that are necessary for the execution of an R&D program. This may include land, major fixed equipment, and supporting infrastructure such as a sewer line, or housing at a remote location. Many laboratory buildings will include a mixture of R&D facilities and office space. The fraction of the building directly related to the conduct of R&D may be calculated as a percentage of the building's total square footage. Exclude: Construction of other facilities, such as office space (which should be reported in the other construction and rehabilitation category on line 1313 or 1314). Major movable R&D equipment. For reporting Major Equipment, R&D equipment (lines 1321 and 1322), include the following: Acquisition, design, or production of major movable equipment, such as mass spectrometers, research vessels, DNA sequencers, and other major movable instruments for use in R&D activities. Programs of $1 million or more that are devoted to the purchase or construction of R&D major equipment (see section 84.3(a) ). Exclude: Minor equipment purchases, such as personal computers, standard microscopes, and simple spectrometers (report these under Conduct of R&D character class 14xx). SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 84 For reporting Other Major Equipment (non-R&D, line s 1323 and 1324), include the following: Software, applications, and other information technology (see section 55) that have an estimated useful life of two years or more, not used for R&D activities . Acquisition, design, integration, recapitalization, improvement or production of major movable equipment, not used for R&D activities. User demonstrations where the cost and benefits of a system are being validated for a specific use case. Pre-produc tion development, which is defined as non -experimental work on a product or system before it goes into full production. For reporting Other Physical Assets (lines 1351 and 1352), include the following: Amounts for all physical assets not captured under another category, such as conservation, reforestation, and range improvements; grants to State or local governments for the purchase of land or structures; and amounts for certain privately held assets, including improvements to private farms, land, and sales of such land and structures. Offsetting receipts collected from the sale of Federal Government physical assets. Exclude: The operation and maintenance of land and structures. (c) Conduct of Research and Development (character class codes 14xx) Research and experimental development activities are defined as creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge \u2014including knowledge of people, culture, and society \u2014and to devise new applications using available knowledge. For reporting R&D activities, include the following: Administrative expenses for R&D, such as the operating costs of research facilities, minor equipment purchases, and other overhead costs. Exclude: Investments in physical assets such as major equipment and facilities that support R&D programs. These investments should generally be reported under physical assets (13xx), discussed above. Routine product testing, quality control, collection of general -purpose statistics, routine monitoring, and evaluation of an operational program (when that program is not R&D). Spending of this type should generally be reported as non-investment activities (2xxx). Training of scientific and tech nical personnel should be reported as conduct of education and training (15xx). However, if an activity includes a mixture of R&D objectives as well as the education of graduate students, agencies should report under the lowest relevant line number in the 14xx series (see section 84.3(a) ). SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) Page 4 of Section 84 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Additional discussion and examples of activities to include or exclude are available in the Interagency R&D Collaboration Space page in the MAX Community . Agencies should use these character classifications to identify three different types of R&D: 1. Basic research (character class codes 141x). Experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts. Basic research may include activities with broad or general applications in mind, such as the study of how plant genomes change, but should exclude research directed towards a specific application or requirement, such as the optimization of the genome of a specific crop species. 2. Applied research (character class codes 142x). Original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. Applied research is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective. 3. Experimental development (character class codes 143x). Creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from resea rch and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes. Like research, experimental development will result in gaining additional knowledge. For reporting experimental development activities, include the following: The production of materials, devices, and systems or methods, including the design, construction, and testing of experimental prototypes. Technology demonstrations, in cases where a system or component is being demons trated at scale for the first time, and it is realistic to expect additional refinements to the design (feedback R&D) following the demonstration. However, not all activities that are identified as \"technology demonstrations\" are R&D. Exclude: User demonstrations where the cost and benefits of a system are being validated for a specific use case. This includes low-rate initial production activities. Pre-production development, which is defined as non -experimental work on a product or system before it goes into full production, including activities such as tooling, and development of production facilities. For example, exclude activities and programs that are categorized as \"Operational Systems Development\" in the Department of Defense's budget acti vity structure. Activities and programs of this type should generally be reported as investments in other major equipment (1323 or 1324). (d) Conduct of education and training (character class codes 15xx) Conduct of education and training includes vet erans' education and training; operating assistance for elementary, secondary, vocational, adult, and higher education; agricultural extension services; and income support activities directly contingent upon participating in such programs. This character classification excludes training of military personnel or other persons in Government service. SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Section 84 (e) Grants to State and local governments, also known as grants-in -aid (character class codes xxx1 or xxx3) For preparing character classification data, Stat e or local governments include the following: The 50 States and the District of Columbia. Cities, counties, townships, municipalities, school districts, special districts, and other local governmental units, as defined by the Bureau of the Census. Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other U.S. territories. The Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Palau, if the payments are in an account that has grants to other State or local governments. Indian Tribal governments when: The legislation authorizing the payment includes such entities within the definition of eligible State or local units. The Tribal government acts as a nonprofit agency operating under State or local auspices. Quasi -public nonprofit entities, such as community action agencies, when the boards of such entities must either be elected in State or local elections, or must include significant representation of State or locally elected officials. Report budget authority and outlays as grants to State and local governments if the Federal Government's resources support State or local programs of government operations or provision of services to the public. For reporting character classification data for grants, include th e following: Direct cash grants to State or local governmental units, to other public bodies established under State or local law, or to their designee. Payments for grants-in -kind, such as purchases of commodities distributed to State or local governmental institutions (e.g., school lunch programs). Payments to nongovernmental entities when such payments result in cash or in -kind services or products that are passed on to State or local governments, for example, payments to the Corporation for P ublic Broadcasting, or to the American Printing House for the Blind. Payments to regional commissions and organizations that are redistributed at the State or local level to provide public services. Payments to State and local governments for researc h and development that is an integral part of the State and local governments' provision of services to the general public (e.g., research on crime control financed from law enforcement assistance grants, or on mental health associated with the provision of mental rehabilitation services; see discussion below for exclusions related to research and development and payments for services rendered). Direct loan or loan guarantee subsidies to State or local governments. Shared revenues. These include pay ments to State or local governments that are computed as a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of certain Federal property, products, or services (e.g., SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) Page 6 of Section 84 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) payments from receipts of Oregon and California grant lands). Tax or other collections by the Federal Government that are passed on to State or local governments (e.g., internal revenue collections for Puerto Rico) are also included. Exclude the following: Federal administrative expenses associated with grant programs. Grants directly to profit -making institutions, individuals, and nonprofit institutions not covered above, for example, payments to Job Corps centers and trainees. Payments for research and development not directly related to the provision of services to the general publi c, for example, basic research awarded via competitive grants. Payments for services rendered, for example, utility services, training programs and expenses for Federal employees, research and development for Federal purposes conducted under contracts, grants, or agreements by such agencies as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Department of Defense (DOD). Federal grants to cover administrative expenses for regional bodies and other funds not redistributed to the States or their subordinate jurisdictions (e.g., the administrative expenses of the Appalachian Regional Commission). (f) Direct Federal program s (character class codes xxx0, xxx2, or xxx4) . Federal programs that are not classified as grants to State and local governments will be classified as direct Federal programs. Direct Federal programs include both programs operated directly by Federal emp loyees and programs operated through contract or by grants to non-Federal entities not included in the definition of \"State and local governments\" under (e). 84.3 What do I need to know about reporting the data and relationships with other data requirement s? (a) General requirements Budget authority and outlay totals for each subfunction must be consistent between s chedule C and the policy lines of s chedule X in each transmit. If an account has multiple subfunctions, report budget authority and outlays by s ubfunction. See section 81 for more information on entering estimates of budget authority, outlays, and receipts. When entering a new grant line (an odd numbered line) in s chedule C, the correct Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) category (i.e. , discretionary or mandatory) for those amounts should be selected. The BEA category for amounts on non -grant lines is not recorded in schedule C. OMB does not control centrally the addition or deletion of character classification codes of expenditure accounts. If the nature of an account changes or otherwise requires the use of different character classes, you may add (or delete) the appropriate code and enter gross budget authority and outlays in MAX A -11 DE in that code without advance approval from OMB. SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 7 of Section 84 If you have entered only one character classification code in schedule C in an account, MAX A-11 DE will automatically generate the amounts for s chedule C based on the amounts entered on the policy lines in s chedule X. Report gross budget authority and gross outlays on character classification lines 1311- 2003. Use line 2004 to capture non-investment and non-grant amounts, as well as non -investment offsetting collections, and balance the totals for s chedule C with net BA and outlay amounts on the policy lines in schedule X. Also see (b) below. Report rescissions on the same line as the original funding. For example, if funding appropriated for the construction of a new Federal facility is rescinded, the funding and the r escission should be recorded on line 1314. Character classifications should be used consistently across all transmits, but can change to properly reflect program proposals (e.g., an account with investment funding on line 1512 under current law, could also have a mandatory proposal for a new grant on line 1511 in a transmit 4). If a transaction fits into more than one classification, report it in the classification category with the lowest numerical character classification code. For example, record amounts for construction of research and development facilities in the appropriate 13xx grouping, not in the 14xx grouping. If an account contains activities that fall under two or more character classifications, omit any classification involving less than $1 million in each of the three fiscal years (PY, CY, and BY), and include the amounts in the next largest classification in that particular account. In some cases, grants to State and local governments allow the recipient jurisdiction the option of using funds for current or investment -type purposes, such as in Community Development Block Grant programs. In such instances, record all of the budget authority and outlays for grants in the category where the majority of the funds are anticipated to be used. Avoid double counting. If an appropriation is made to one account and paid to another account (expenditure transfer) , only code the funding as investment once in the account that makes the investment . For example, if an appropriation for an investment is made to a Federal fund and transferred to a Trust fund, record the appropriation as an investment only once in s chedule C, in the account that makes the investment (usually the Trust Fund). See also (c) below. If a correction in MAX A- 11 DE to the character classification of current or prior year funding is necessary, it is required that the agency also provide corrected historical amounts for years prior to the current budget exercise 's PY. In such cases, contact your OMB representative to provid e the corrected amounts. (b) Reporting offsetting collections (expenditure accounts) In almost all cases, offsetting collections in the account should be included in character class Direct Federal Programs, non-investment as part of a net total on line 2 004. An exception would be offsetting collections from the sale of physical assets (e.g. , land, structures, equipment, or commodities), which should be reported as negative amounts in the correct physical asset character class code. The gross budget authority and outlays for investments and grants should be identified first and classified with the appropriate character class code (i.e., character class codes 1xxx, 2001, or 2003). For the remaining spending and offsetting collections, use character class code 2004 as a residual balancing entry to ensure that the sum of entries in s chedule C add to total net budget authority and outlays o n the policy lines in SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) Page 8 of Section 84 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) schedule X by subfunction. This means that, in appropriate cases, character class code 2004 amounts may be negative. As an example, consider an account with gross BA and outlays of $100 million that receives $20 million in offsetting collections from the public and spends all of it. If $70 m illion of the funds in the account are for the construction of a non-R&D Federal facility (character class code 1314) and $30 million for direct Federal non -investment activities (character class code 2004), then schedule C would show $70 million in gross BA and outlays on line 1314, and character class code 2004 would show a net $10 million. The net $10 million can be thought of two ways: as a residual balancing entry to ensure that total net outlays in schedule C equal total net outlays on the policy lin es in schedule X (in this case $80 million), or as the sum of $30 million for direct Federal non-investment spending, and -$20 million for collections from the public. The sum of all character class codes would add to net outlays and, in this example, wou ld be $80 million. (c) Classifying activities financed by expenditure transfers If grants to State or local governments or investments are financed by payments from one Federal account to a second Federal account ( e.g., offsetting collections from Federal sources or transfers from Federal funds to trust funds ), you must ensure that the amounts are recorded as grants or investments only once (i.e., ensure that they are not double -counted). In general, the amounts should be recorded as follows: For all grants to State or local governments, record the grants in the second account (i.e., the account that actually makes the payment to the State or local government). Record the payment from the first account to the second account as direct Federal spend ing. For direct Federal investment (which includes all investments except those through grants to State or local governments), record the investment in the account that is primarily responsible for funding the investment. (Note that grants to research in stitutions are classified as direct Federal investment, not as grants to State or local governments.) This is usually the initial account. For example, if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides funds to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for research, record the R&D in the EPA account that funds the research, not in NSF. In this example, the NSF spending should be coded as non-investment spending (line 2004) rather than as spending for research. However, in certain cases, primary responsi bility might occur in the second account. For example, regarding rental payments to the GSA Federal Buildings Fund, some of the rental receipts may ultimately be used for construction by GSA. In these situations, the investment should be recorded in the second account because primary responsibility for the investment would be in that account. (d) Reporting offsetting receipts (receipt accounts) You must also report offsetting receipts for PY through BY by character class in s chedules K (baseline) and R (policy). Classify offsetting receipts in receipt accounts as Federal investment to report: Proceeds from the sale of physical assets (e.g., land, structures, equipment, or commodities) in the corresponding physical asset character classes; and Credit r eform offsetting receipts for downward reestimates and negative subsidies for investment -related credit programs (i.e., for physical assets or for the conduct of education and training) on the appropriate investment line number (i.e., 13xx or 1512). OMB controls the character classification of offsetting receipts centrally. When setting up a new receipt account, discuss the usage of a character classification with your OMB representative. Unlike expenditure accounts, for receipt accounts, you must get a pproval from your OMB representative before you can enter SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 9 of Section 84 data under a different character classification code. (See section 79.4 for proposing changes to budget account classifications.) For general guidance on reporting collections deposited in off setting receipt accounts in s chedules K and R, use the instructions in section 81.3(b) . (e) Credit programs For credit program accounts, classify subsidies and subsidy reestimates for direct loans and loan guarantees and their administrative expenses a ccording to the purpose of the program in s chedule C using the appropriate character class line. For example, credit subsidies for construction should be in the character class for construction and rehabilitation (131x), and credit subsidies for the conduct of education should be in the character class for the conduct of education and training (15xx). Classify direct loans and loan guarantees to State or local governments on a grant line. Do not report character class for credit financing accounts. (f) Outyear projections Agencies should enter character class data in MAX A-11 DE for PY through BY. MAX A-11 DE will automatically generate outyear projections of grant outlays through BY+9 based on in- year data. Other entries will be shown through BY only. For the projection of grant outlays , MAX A-11 DE will assume, using an algorithm, that the percentage of grant outlays estimated for the outyears is the same as that reported in the BY. For example, if 18 percent of net outlays in the account are on line 1511 -02 (grant outlays for education and training) in BY, then 18 percent of the net outlays on the policy lines in s chedule X will be estimated in schedule C on line 1511- 02 for each outyear. Agencies may view these outyear projections on-screen. If projections do not accurately reflect outyear policy, contact your OMB representative to request permission to override the projections in MAX A-11 DE . In limited cases, a policy proposal affecting grant outlays will begin in a year beyond BY. In these cases, contact your OMB representative to request permission to enter amounts on the grant lines in the outyears of schedule C. (g) Relationships with other data requirements You should be able to reconcile information reported in this schedule for the conduct of R&D with information reported in the National Science Foundation's Survey of Federal Funds for R&D (see description of line 14xx), and with information provided in the supplemental R&D data request described in (h) below. You should also be able to reconcile the total reported in this schedule for the construction of R&D facilities (1311 or 1312) and major movable R&D equipment (1321 or 1322) with information reported in the National Science Foundation's Survey of Federal Funds for R&D as R&D plant. (h) Additional research and development reporting requirements Crosscutting R&D data for specific topics, such as climate change research, and nanotechnology R&D, will be requested in order to meet Congressional r eporting requirements. These data are collected outside of MAX A-11 DE in an online MAX Collect exercise (see section 25.5 ). Annual reports that complement the budget data are issued by components of the National Science and Technology Council. Detailed instructions and definitions will be distributed by OMB through a Budget Data Request. SECTION 84 \u2014CHARACTER CLASSIFICATION (SCHEDULE C) Page 10 of Section 84 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) For the purposes of ensuring continuity with data reported for the NSF Survey of Federal Funds for R&D under section 84.3(g) , agencies should ensure that R&D service contracts, as well as minor equipment and product purchases for R&D, follow the FPDS Product and Service Code guidance (https://www.acquisition.gov/psc -manual ). 84.4 How do I report character classification in MAX A-11 DE ? In schedules C, K, and R, character class data are identified by a line number that consists of a four -digit number and a two-digit suffix (xxxx- xx). The line number identifies data as investment or non -investment, and as grants or direct Federal programs. Character class line numbers include the following: Investment activities: Lines 13xx, physical assets. Lines 14xx, research and development. Lines 15xx, education and training. Non-investment activities: Lines 2xxx. Classify all investment activities in the 1xxx series and all non -investment activities in the 2xxx series. The two-digit suffix differentiates among budget authority, outlays, and offsetting receipts, as follows: 01\u2014Budget authority 02\u2014Outlays 03\u2014Offsetting receipts Use the guidance in section 84.2 to ensure that data are reported in the correct categories. Only some of the following codes apply to offsetting receipts; they are specifically noted below with an asterisk (*). All of the line numbers ap ply to budget authority and outlays. For grants to State and local governments lines (odd numbered lines) , make sure to select the appropriate BEA category when entering a new line. Use guidance in section 79.4(c) to assist. For non- grants lines, MAX A-11 DE does not code amounts by BEA category. Also , for grants to State and local governments, MAX A-11 DE will automatically calculate outlays in the outyears.

Your budget submission must identify the human capital management and development objectives, key activities, and associated resources that are needed to support agency accomplish ment of programmatic goals. 85.2 What terms do I need to know? Employee, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 , means an officer or an individual who is appointed under a delegated authority, is engaged in the performance of a Federal function, and is subject to the supervision of an officer or employee of the Federal Government. Full-time equivalent (FTE) employment means the total number of regular straight -time hours worked (i.e., not including overtime or holiday hours worked) by employees divided by the number of compensable hours applicable to each fiscal year. Annual leave, sick leave, compensatory time off an d other approved leave categories are considered \"hours worked\" for purposes of defining full -time equivalent employment that is reported in the employment summary (see section 85.6 ). A list of compensable days (with associated hours) is provided in secti on 85.5(c) . 85.3 What should be the basis for my personnel estimates? (a) Staffing Requirements. Base estimates for staffing requirements on the assumption that improvements in skills, organization, procedures, and supervision will produce a steady increase in productivity. Personnel should be reassigned, to the maximum exte nt, to meet new program requirements. Use personnel currently funded to the maximum extent in staffing new programs and expansions of existing programs. These actions should be part of your agency's overall human capital strategy and reflected in the int egrated performance plan (see section 220). Reductions generally should be planned where the workload is stable. Where information technology systems are installed or enhanced, gains in productivity should result in lower personnel requirements after the first year. You should be prepared to explain the assumptions underlying staffing requirement adjustment upon request. SECTION 85 \u2014ESTIMATING EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY (SCHEDULE Q) Page 2 of Secti on 85 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Where appropriate, use calculations converting workload to required personnel that include an estimate of available workhours per employee. You should exclude annual leave, sick leave, administrative leave, training, and other non-work time from these calculations. Base estimates of available time on current data, reflect steps taken to improve the ratio of available time to total time, and recognize differences in available time by organization, location, or activity. Base exclusions for annual and sick leave on current experience of actual leave taken rather than leave earned. Employment levels should reflect budget proposals and assumptions with regard to workload, efficiency, proposed legislation, interagency reimbursable arrangements, and other special staffing methods. Employment intended for proposed legislation, or for carrying out proposed supplemental appropriations, cannot begin until the additional funds become available by congressional action. Employment proposed for activation of new facilities or start -up of new programs cannot begin until the new activity begins. Employment under estimated reimbursable arrangements al so cannot begin until such arrangements have been negotiated and justified. (b) Personnel resources. Base estimates of personnel resources on the total number of regularly scheduled straight -time hours (worked or to be worked) in the fiscal year (see se ction 85.5(c) ). Note that, although budgetary resources must be sufficient to cover any extra compensable days in a fiscal year, some of the corresponding outlays may not occur until the following year. (c) Requirement for FTE data . Wherever entries in schedules or materials required by this Circular pertain to personnel requirements or total employment levels, state such entries for all years in terms of FTEs, as defined in section 85.2, unless another measure is explicitly required. For military employment, see section 85.9. 85.4 What is the requirement for reporting civilian FTE data in the Budget? With the exception of some national security functions, agencies will report prior fiscal year civilian F TE actuals in MAX A -11 DE schedule Q each fall, along with current and budget year estimates. Therefore, agencies should maintain a system of accounting for their FTE on a regular basis. 85.5 What do I need to know about FTE budgeted levels? (a) Federal FTE requirements Agencies have the flexibility to manage their FTE levels, within their budget constraints, and to determine how many FTEs are required to successfully accomplish their mission. In exercising this autho rity, agencies may put into place internal management controls with respect to FTEs that, among other things, help to ensure that the agency does not exceed its appropriated funding level. Within their own authorit ies, agencies generally may use appropria ted funds available for such purposes across the total workforce to accomplish their mission s in the most efficient manner. For the current and budget years, each agency 's Federal workforce estimates should reflect FTE levels that are funded in their subm ission to OMB and should not include unfunded positions. Agency submissions should include supporting data to justify and validate those FTE estimates. (b) Workforce conversions Agencies should not convert the work of their employees to contractors unless they determine that the work is not inherently governmental (as defined in the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998, P.L. 105-270), the agency has sufficient internal capability and capacity to maintain control of its mission and operations, and the agency undertakes cost comparisons that demonstrate that such a conversion is of financial advantage to the Government (see OMB Circular A-76). Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 1710 and 10 U.S.C. 2461 , agencies are precluded from converting, in whole or in part, functions performed by Federal SECTION 85 \u2014ESTIMATING EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY (SCHEDULE Q) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 85 employees to contract performance absent a public- private competition (a practice known as \"direct conversion\"). The conversion of work from in-house to private sector performance may only occur through public -private competition. Appropriations acts since 2009, however, have prohibited agencies from using funds to \"beg in or announce a study or public -private competition regarding the conversion to contractor performance of any function performed by Federal employees pursuant to Office of Management and Budget Circular A \u201476 or any other administrative re gulation, directive, or policy. \" See, e.g., S ection 737 in Division D of Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-8. (c) Determining FTE usage You must prepare budget estimates relating to personnel requirements in terms of FTE employment as specified in this Circular. Agencies may choose from two methods to determine current year and budget year FTE employment estimates: Regular Method \u2014Divide the estimated total number of regular hours by the number of compensable hours in each fiscal year. Divide the total regular hours worked during the actual fiscal year (October 1 - September 30) by the number of compensable hours shown in the table below for the applicable fiscal year. The regular method derives compensable days by counting days in the standard Monday -through- Friday workweek in the given fiscal year. Compensable hours are derived by multiplying the number of compensable days by 8 hours (i.e., the standard workday). Pay Period Method \u2014Divide regular hours worked during a period of 26 biweekly pay periods (closely corresponding to the fiscal year) by 2080 hours. (The 26 biweekly pay periods cover 52 weeks with 40 hours in a standard workweek. 52 x 40 = 2080.) The 26 biweekly pay periods that closely correspond to a fiscal year are identified as the pay p eriods that end in the given fiscal year. If there are 27 pay periods that end in a fiscal year, agencies should drop the one implicating the fewest work days in that fiscal year, so that 26 pay periods are always used. FTE employment levels apply to str aight -time hours only. Include foreign national direct hire employees in your FTE employment totals. FTEs funded by allocations from other agencies will be included with the performing agency where the employees work and are paid (see section 85.7). Be sure to include in FTE employment estimates for all Federal employees, including persons appointed under the Worker Trainee Opportunity Program, Presidential Management Fellows, Federal Cooperative Education Program, summer aids, Stay -in-School Program, an d the Federal Junior Fellowship Program.

In addition, you must ensure that the FTE estimates are consistent with all applicable laws. In particular, some statutes providing agencies with authority to use voluntary separation incentive proposals (or \"buy -outs\") stipulate that agency -wide F TE levels must be reduced one -for-one for each buy -out. Further, FTE estimates must represent an effective and efficient use of resources to meet program requirements. Current year FTE estimates should be consistent with PY actuals, should be fully funded, and should be very close to the actual usage reported at the end of the fiscal year. For example, the estimates in the previous Budget should be very close to the actuals published in the current Budget. (e) FTE transfers between agencies Prior to en tering into new or expanded agreements to perform work for other agencies on a reimbursable basis, you must prepare a cost justification. As part of this agreement, you may transfer FTEs on a one-for- one basis, provided that you notify OMB prior to making such a transfer. You may proceed with the FTE transfer fifteen days after notification to OMB, unless OMB objects. (f) Adjustment requests Send all requests for adjustments in employment levels, including agreements to transfer FTEs between agencies, t o your OMB representative. 85.6 What do I need to know about the employment summary (schedule Q )? This schedule shows the total full -time equivalent (FTE) civilian employment of straight-time compensable work years (i.e., not overtime) financed by an account for PY through BY. FTE employment excludes estimates for terminal leave and overtime hours. The method for calculating FTE employment is described in section 85.5. You must provide an employment summary when an account contains an entry for either direct or reimbursable personnel compensation in the object class schedule (i.e., object class entry 11.1 or 11.3 (see section 83.7)). You must also provide an employme nt summary when employees are compensated via an allocation account. For reimbursable and allocation FTE arrangements, see the discussion on their budget schedule treatment in section 85.7. This schedule also shows military average strength employment as discussed in section 85.9 . The definition of object class 11.1 stipulates that compensation must be included for all workdays in the fiscal year. You must ensure that FTE levels in the employment summary and funding for FTEs in the object class schedule are reported consistently. You must also ensure that agency -wide FTE totals agree with the negotiated levels in the current and budget years. Prior year FTE in the employment summary must equal your agency's FTE execution level. When entering FTE data in schedule Q, use the four -digit line numbering scheme described in the following table: SECTION 85 \u2014ESTIMATING EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY (SCHEDULE Q) OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Section 85 EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY (SCHEDULE Q) Entry Description Xxxx The first digit of the line number distinguishes between direct, reimbursable, and other categories, consistent with the reporting of data in the object classification schedule (see section 83.5). Use the following codes: 1\u2014direct 2\u2014reimbursable 3\u2014allo cation account xXxx The second digit of the line number distinguishes between civilian and military employment. Use the following codes: 0\u2014civilian employment 1\u2014military employment xx0x The third digit is 0. xxx1 The fourth digit is 1. 85.7 Are allocation and reimbursable FTE presented differently in the Budget ? Yes, FTE financed by allocation and reimbursements are presented differently as depicted in the diagram below. In an allocation arrangement, the \"parent account\" receives the initial b udget authority and delegates its obligational authority to another organization or agency in the form of an \"allocation account .\" See section 20.4 (l). For Budget presentation, the parent and the receiving agency/bureau allocation account's obligations are all reported in the parent account while the allocation FTE are reported in the receiving agency/bureau. Allocation FTE are presented differently in order to be consistent with agency personnel reporting systems. The parent account does not show the receiving agency/bureau allocation FTE. The parent account only shows its own direct/reimbursable FTE. The allocation FTE are shown by the \"receiving agency/bureau\" in an account of its choice. When applicable, show the allocation FTE in an account that funds FTE performing a similar activity as the allocation arrangement. Allocation FTE are separately identified in schedule Q on lines 3XXX. For example, if legislation mandates that OMB allocate funds to the Government Publishing Office (GPO) for print ing requirements, then OMB will show allocation obligations in schedule O of the account that received the budget authority. The GPO will show the associated allocation FTE in schedule Q in an account that typically funds FTE involved in printing operations. In a reimbursable arrangement, the customer account receives the services and reports direct or indirect obligations in the object class that best describes the services received (e.g., printing and reproduction). The transfer of funds to the servici ng account is accomplished in the form of an expenditure transfer. The servicing account reports reimbursable compensation and benefit obligations in schedule O. Likewise, the reimbursable FTE are reported in schedule Q of the servicing account. SECTION 85 \u2014ESTIMATING EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY (SCHEDULE Q) Page 6 of Secti on 85 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) 85.8 How do agencies check FTE totals in the Budget? OMB provides diagnostic reports on its website showing the status of FTE data in MAX A -11 DE by account. In addition, MAX A-11 DE has edits that check for missing FTE or inconsistencies between personnel compensation in schedule O and FTE levels in schedule Q. 85.9 How do I account for active duty military personnel in the Budget ? Your budget submission should also account for all active duty personnel in the seven Uniformed Services. These Services include the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, plus th e NOAA and PHS Commissioned Corps. Since active duty personnel are always full -time employees, attempting to compute full-time equivalents is not appropriate. Therefore, for active duty personnel, \"average strength\" data is used in place of FTEs for the prior fiscal year. Estimate average strengths for current and budget years as well. For the non -DoD Uniformed Services, record military average strengths in the MAX A-11 DE employment summaries using the line designated for military (see section 85.6 regarding schedule Q line numbers). The Department of Defense will continue to provide military employment data directly to their OMB representative.

(a) General instructions The balance sheet provides information on program assets, liabilities, and net position and is used to assess the resources available for Federal programs for PY- 1 through PY. You must submit balance sheets for: All Government -sponsored enterprise funds; All credit liquidating and financing accounts; Financing vehicles; and Revolving funds, when specifically required by OMB. For budget presentation purposes, data in program and financing schedules (schedule P) fulfill the legal requirement in 31 U.S.C. 9103 for \"business-type budget\" information on wholly -owned Government corporations in the President 's Budget. SECTION 86 \u2014SPECIAL SCHEDULES Page 2 of Section 86 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Amounts in schedule F for PY -1 should be consistent with your agency 's audited financial statements. Prepare balance sheets in the format of exhibit 86A with audited actual amounts as of the close of PY- 1 and actual amounts as of the close of PY. For credit accounts only, agencies should refer to the USSGL Crosswalk - Schedule F - Budget Balance Sheet (under the USSGL Guidance section of the page) to prepare schedule F. This new guide is meant to assist agencies in reporting consistent data in schedule F and GTAS. (b) Balance sheet entries Use the entries listed below to prepare the balance sheets. These entries correspond to entries used in OMB Circular A -136, Financial Reporting Requirements which instructs agencies to prepare financial statements at the entity level. Use the terms, definitions, and instructions provided in that bulletin to prepare the balance sheets at the account level. MAX A -11 DE will automatically generate the line entries i ndicated in boldface . If your agency is a Government -sponsored enterprise (GSE), you will need to modify line entries to reflect the non-Federal status of GSEs. Consult your OMB representative for additi onal guidance. BALANCE SHEET Entry Description ASSETS Federal assets: These assets arise from transactions among Federal agencies. Federal agency assets are claims of a Federal agency against other Federal agencies which, when collected, can be used in the agency 's operations. 1101 Fund balances with Treasury The unobligated and obligated balances with Treasury from which you are authorized to make expenditures and pay liabilities, including cleari ng account balances and the dollar equivalent of foreign currency account balances. Your agency 's fund balance with Treasury also includes the unobligated balances in guaranteed loan financing accounts, the obligated balances in direct loan financing accounts, and the unobligated and obligated balances in liquidating accounts. Investments in Federal securities: Total investments in Federal sec urities. These consist of securities issued by Federal agencies including non- marketable par value Treasury securities, market -based Treasury securities, marketable Treasury securities, and securities issued by other Federal agencies. 1102 Treasury securities, net Net value of Treasury securities acquired \u2014the par (face or nominal) value of a security minus the amount of any unamortized discounts or plus the amount of any unamortized premiums. 1104 Agency securities, net Net value of agency securities acquired \u2014the par (face or nominal) value of a security minus the amount of any unamortized discounts or plus the amount of any unamortized premiums. 1106 Receivables, net Accounts receivable and interest receivable, net of uncollectible amounts. Interest receivable is the amount of interest income earned but not received for an accounting period. Report SECTION 86 \u2014SPECIAL SCHEDULES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 86 Entry Description receivables from Federal agencies separately from receivables from non -Federal entities (on line 1206). Report interest receivable related to direct loans and acquired defaulted guaranteed loans separately below as a component of credit program receivables. 1107 Advances and prepayments Advances are cash outlays made by a Federal agency to cover a part or all of the recipients ' anticipated expenses or advance payments for the costs of goods and services the agency is to receive. Prepayments are payments made by a Federal agency to cover certain period expenses before those expenses are incurred. Advances and prepayments made t o Federal agencies are intragovernmental and are accounted for and reported separately from those made to non- Federal entities. Non-Federal assets: These assets arise from transactions of the Federal Government with non -Federal entities. These entities include domestic and foreign persons and organizations outside the U.S. Government. 1201 Investments in non -Federal securities, net Securities issued by State and local governments, private corporations, and government -sponsored enterprises, net of prem iums, discounts and allowances for losses. Securities are normally reported at acquisition cost or amortized acquisition cost. However, you should use market value when there is: An intent to sell the securities prior to maturity; and A reduction in the value of the securities that is more than temporary. 1206 Receivables, net Accounts and interest receivable due from non -Federal entities, net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts. Do not recognize interest as revenue on accounts receivable or investments that are determined to be uncollectible unless the interest is actually collected. Report interest receivable related to direct loans and acquired defaulted guaranteed loans as a component of credit program receivables. 1207 Advances and prepayments Advances are cash outlays made by a Federal agency to its employees, contractors, grantees or others to cover a part or all of the recipients ' anticipated expenses or advance payments for the costs of goods and services the agency receives. Prepayments are payments made by a Federal agency to cover certain periodic expenses before those expenses are incurred. Credit program receivables and related foreclosed property: These items represent the net value of assets related to pre -1992 and post -1991 direct loans receivable and acquired defaulted guaranteed loans receivable. Net value of assets related to post -1991 direct loans receivable: 1401 Direct loans receivable, gross The face value of all direct loans outstanding e xcluding amounts repaid or written off. 1402 Interest receivable Amount of interest receivable. 1403 Accounts receivable from foreclosed property Amount of accounts receivable related to foreclosed property. SECTION 86 \u2014SPECIAL SCHEDULES Page 4 of Section 86 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Entry Description 1404 Foreclosed property Value of foreclosed property associated with post -1991 direct and acquired defaulted guaranteed loans at the net present value of the projected cash flows associated with the property. To practicably accomplish this requirement, you may record foreclosed property at the estimated net realizable value at the time of foreclosure. A portion of the related allowance for subsidy account will apply to the foreclosed property, but that amount need not be separately determined. Rather, subtract the allowance account fro m the sum of the credit program assets to determine the net present value of the assets. 1405 Allowance for subsidy cost (+ or -) The unamortized amount of subsidy expenses for the direct loan disbursements that the direct loan financing account has made in that year and all previous years, for all direct loans outstanding. (The allowance for subsidy costs of a direct loan is the present value of estimated cash outflows over the life of the loan minus the present value of estimated cash inflows. It is due to defaults, delinquencies, lending at interest rates below the Treasury borrowing rate, etc., with an offset for fees, penalties, and recoveries. Generally, the allowance for subsidy cost for most programs is negative. However, when the present value of estimated cash inflows exceeds the present value of estimated cash outflows, the allowance for subsidy will be positive.) 1499 Net present value of assets related to direct loans The sum of lines 1401 through 1405.

Use schedule T to report, in thousands of dollars, the amount of budget authority and obligation limitat ions under the jurisdiction of the appropriations committee in the budget year column T (see exhibit 86B). For SECTION 86 \u2014SPECIAL SCHEDULES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 86 accounts with transfers specified in appropriations language, report amounts on a pre -transfer basis. Each transmittal code that contains a request under the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees will include a schedule T. In most cases, this means only amounts in transmittal code zero. Only a small number of accounts wi ll include discretionary requests through transmittal code 2 or 4 in the budget year. Schedule T is not required in an account or transmittal code that does not have any of the resources listed below. Include the following amounts in schedule T for each transmittal code with the following amounts: Discretionary appropriations; Discretionary limitations on expenses, including obligation limitations in the Department of Transportation; Appropriated entitlements (include the pre -sequestration amount, if a sequestration applies) ; Changes in a mandatory program (either a cost or a saving) proposed in appropriations language (see the definition of CHIMP in section 20.3); Appropriations for the account included in a general provision or in an administrative provisions; Best estimates for indefinite appropriations; and Proposed cancellations either in the account appropriations language or in a separate general provision. Exclude the following from your schedule T amounts: Transfers specified in appropriations language; Mandatory appropriations (except for CHIMPs and appropriated entitlements - see above); Spending authority from offsetting collections; Advance appropriations for any year; Amounts applied to repay debt; Amounts applied to liquidate contract authority; and Mandatory proposals (other than proposals impacting appropriated entitlements). The majority of budget accounts, require only a single line. For merged accounts, use separate lines for each component account and identify all lines using the three digit CGAC agency code and four digit account symbol assigned by Treasury. Ensure all amounts reported in schedule T are consistent with the amounts in the program and financing schedule (schedule P). The schedule T data is shared with the House and Senate appropriations committees, who use the data to inform the Budget Request Column of the Comparative Statements of Budget Authority (CSBAs). The CSBA is presented in thousands, rather than millions and used by each subcommittee for tracking the different stages of the appropriations process. 86.3 What do I need to know about the schedule on the status of funds (schedule J )? Schedule J presents cash flow data for certain special, trust, and other funds. MAX A-11 DE generates the data for the status of funds schedule from the receipt and expenditure accounts that make up the fund, storing it in the database as schedule J. Only the accounts listed in the following table have schedule J data presented in the Appendix. Many of these accounts print in Analytical Perspectives ( \"Trust Funds and Federal Funds \" chapter) detailed in the listing on the Budget Season Reports page , under Other Reports. SECTION 86 \u2014SPECIAL SCHEDULES Page 10 of Section 86 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) STATUS OF FUNDS DATA PRESENTED FOR THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTS Agency Account HHS Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund DHS Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund Interior Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund Labor Unemployment Trust Fund Black Lung Disability Trust Fund State Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund Transportation Highway Trust Fund Airport and Airways Trust Fund Veterans Affairs National Service Life Insurance Fund United States Government Life Insurance Fund DOD -Civil Military Retirement Fund Education Benefits Fund Uniformed Services Retiree Health Care Fund EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund OPM Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund Employees and Retired Employees Health Benefits Fund SSA Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund RRB National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust Rail Industry Pension Fund Railroad Social Security Equivalent Benefit Fund The Budget includes only one schedule J for each of the specified funds. The schedule covers all the collections in the receipt accounts and all the cash outlays from the various expenditure accounts that receive appropriations from the funds. It aggregates all data reported under different transmittal codes to a single schedule presented under transmittal code 0. Schedule J includes several sets of adjustment lines. These include adjustments for start of year balances, cash income, and cash outgo. These lines will only be used by OMB if there is a compelling need to make an adjustment. The reason for the adjustment will be included in the stub description for each line. You can run a report in MAX A-11 DE that shows what schedule J looks like in \"real time\". Changes made on-screen will be reflected in the schedule J report. However, information from other accounts that feed into schedule J will reflect the latest uploaded data in MAX A-11 DE for those accounts. Run the report from the master version of the account to see what will print in the Appendix . SECTION 86 \u2014SPECIAL SCHEDULES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 86 The receipt and expenditure accounts that make up schedule J can be seen in the Account Information Viewer (see schedule N in Other Account Relationships). Schedules N and J share the same relationships. The Account Information Viewer can be accessed through the link in MAX A-11 DE or directly at https://aiv.max.gov/. Schedule J data are displayed in MAX A-11 DE on the basis of a 4 -digit line number. Detail rows are indicated by a 2 -digit MAX A-11 DE generated line serial number.

This line should equal the amount on line 4999. If it does not, you will receive an error message. 86.4 What do I need to know about the special and trust fund receipts schedule (schedule N) ? Schedule N is an automatically generated schedule that shows the flow of funding into and out of spec ial and non-revolving trust funds. It shows new receipts deposited into the fund, new appropriations taken out of the fund - including any amounts appropriated but precluded from obligation, and the remaining balances of unappropriated receipts (if any). For budgetary purposes, receipts deposited into a special or non-revolving trust fund can be either \"available\" or \"unavailable\". If the amounts are unavailable for obligation, they are included in the balances shown in schedule N. Unavailable receipts require further congressional action to be available for obligation and may also be referred to as unappropriated receipts. Unavailable receipts also require a warrant to be processed by Treasury. As a point of clarification, Treasury considers available receipts to be any receipts that are authorized to be invested even if they require further congressional action before they can be obligated. The balance in schedule N represents what remains to be appropriated by the Congress for the established purpos es of the special or non -revolving trust fund or what is not yet available according to law (e.g., benefit formula limitations). The size of the remaining fund balance relative to the remaining program needs may guide future executive or congressional act ion. For example, if there are insufficient amounts in a fund, a change in fee rates or eligibility requirements may be necessary. MAX A-11 DE generates schedule N from: Data reported in the previous year 's Budget Appendix ; Data in schedule R; and Data in schedule X. SECTION 86 \u2014SPECIAL SCHEDULES Page 16 of Section 86 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) MAX A-11 DE generates only one schedule N for each special or trust fund. If there are multiple expenditure accounts that receive an appropriation from a special or trust fund, only one expenditure account will display a schedule N. When requesting new special or non -revolving trust fund accounts, please specify whether OMB 's budget database should include a new schedule N or use an existing schedule N to report the transactions related to the new account (see section 79.4). The schedule includes all the receipts and offsetting receipts that pertain to a particular special or trust fund account. It aggregates all the data reported under different transmittal codes to a single schedule presented under transmittal code 0. The related receipt and expenditure accounts for schedule N can be seen in the Account Information Viewer application (see Schedule N under Account Information - Other Account Relationships.) The Account Information Viewer can be accessed through the link in MAX A-11 DE or directly at https://aiv.max.gov/. Schedule N includes adjustment lines to correct start of year (SOY) and/or end of year (EOY) balances. These adjustment lines correct for rounding issues, timing of late surplus warrants, etc. OMB identifies needed adjustments by validating SOY balances against the reported balances in the Central Accounting Reporting System (CARS) or GTAS. If agencies believe any SOY or EOY amount needs to be adjusted, they should provide their OMB program examiner the CARS or GTAS data to support the requested change. The reason for the adjustment will be included in the stub description for each line. Even though the schedule is automatically generated and you cannot change any amounts, line titles of the detail lines (lines 11xx, 12xx, 21xx, 22xx) can be changed by OMB. Contact your OMB representative to request a change to the line titles. You can run a report in MAX A -11 DE that shows what schedule N looks like in \"real time\". Changes made on-screen will be reflected in the schedul e N report. However, information from other accounts that feed into schedule N will reflect the latest uploaded data in MAX A-11 DE for those accounts. Run the report from the master version of the account to see what will print in the Appendix . Sched ule N data are displayed in MAX A-11 DE on the basis of a 4- digit line number. Multiple detail rows are indicated by a 2 -digit MAX A-11 DE generated line serial number. The following table identifies the source for each line in schedule N. SPECIAL AND TRUST FUND RECEIPTS SCHEDULE Entry Description 0100 Balance, start of year MAX A-11 DE derives the PY amount from the PY amount reported on line 0799 in the previous year 's Budget Appendix.

SECTION 95 \u2014BUDGET APPENDIX AND PRINT MATERIALS Page 2 of Section 95 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) THE APPENDIX 95.1 What is the budget Appendix? The Appendix \u2014Budget of the United States is one of several volumes that constitute the President's Budget. The President transmits the Appendix to the Congress with the other volumes, and it is published through the Government Publishing Office (GPO) and digitally on http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ . The Appropriations Committees, in particular, use the Appendix because it contains the appropriations language proposed by the President for each account that requires such language. The Appendix contains other detailed information about each account, such as program and financing information, obligations by object class, narrative statements and data about the work performed, and employment data. The information printed in the Appendix is often referred to as print materials. 95.2 How is the Appendix organized? The Appendix consists of these parts: Detailed Budget Estimates by Agency \u2014This is the main part of the Appendix and contains general provisions of law that apply to all Govern ment activities, and print materials for accounts organized by agency. Section 95.3 describes the organization of this part in more detail. Other Materials\u2014This part may contain: A summary of proposed changes to current year estimates through supplement al appropriations and rescissions; Detailed print materials for proposed supplemental appropriations; A list of amendments and revisions to budget authority requested between transmittal of the previous and current budgets; and A list of advance appropriations. Financing Vehicles and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \u2014Contains descriptions of and data on certain entities that are excluded from the main part of the Appendix. Government -Sponsored Enterprises \u2014Contains descriptions of and data on Government -sponsored enterprises (private corporations chartered by Federal law), such as Fannie Mae. 95.3 How is the \"Detailed Budget Estimates\" section organized? This part of the Appendix presents materials in the following general order: Legislative Branch Judicial Branch Cabinet agencies in alphabetical order SECTION 95 \u2014BUDGET APPENDIX AND PRINT MATERIALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 95 Large or prominent non-departmental agencies (for example, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Executive Office of the President) and accounts grouped under the heading, \"Other Defense\u2014Civil Programs\" The remaining agencies, under the heading \"Other Independent Agencies,\" in alphabetical order, with a short list of Federally created non -Federal entities grouped at the end. We use the term chapter to refer to the presentation of materials for a separate agency or group of agencies. Within the chapter for a department or large agency, the materials are organ ized by bureaus or other major subordinate organizations within the agency (for example, the Farm Service Agency in the Department of Agriculture) or by major program areas (for example, Community Planning and Development in the Department of Housing and U rban Development). When we establish a new account in the MAX database, we assign a bureau and account sequence code, which determines the order in which bureaus and accounts appear in the Appendix (see section 79). For the sake of convenience in these i nstructions, we refer to all equivalent subdivisions of a chapter as bureaus. The Appendix presents accounts in a uniform, logical order in all bureaus, unless there is a compelling reason for an exception. Accounts normally appear as follows: General f und accounts Special fund accounts Public enterprise funds Intragovernmental revolving funds and management funds Credit reform accounts, with related accounts grouped together in the following order: Program account Financing accounts Liquidating account Trust funds Trust revolving funds General fund receipt accounts Certain materials are required for each account. The following table shows the print requirements and print sequence for all materials that could be required for an account . Because not all materials apply to a given account, the second column describes the circumstances in which they apply. The fourth column tells you which materials are automatically generated and which ones you must revise using the MAX A-11 Data Entry (DE) application, as outlined in the User's Guide.

Also required when FTE are funded by allocations from other accounts. 85.5 Generated from schedule Q 95.4 What is the process for getting print materials published in the Appendix? To submit appropriations language or narrative text for the Appendix , use the MAX A-11 DE application, which is available to registered users at https://a11de.max.gov. You will need a MAX ID to access MAX A-11 DE. For information about how to obtain a MAX ID, visit the MAX homepage: https://max.gov/maxportal/ . Appropriations language appears in t he \"PA20xx\"exercises; narrative language appears in exercises under \"PN20xx\" and schedules under \"PB20xx.\" You will be able to edit your narrative in PN20xx exercise when the PB exercise opens in late October. SECTION 95 \u2014BUDGET APPENDIX AND PRINT MATERIALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 95 The process for getting print materials published includes these steps: When the Congress passes appropriations bills, OMB will load the appropriations language into the PA20xx exercise in MAX A-11 DE. You will then be notified that your appropriations language is ready to be edited. At this time, begin updating the appropriations language. When you have finished editing the appropriations language and narrative, you will move it forward to the next stage in the workflow. This notifies OMB that you are finished and gives editing permission t o OMB. If you miss your deadline, OMB may move accounts from the agency editing stage to the OMB editing stage. OMB will review the text and make changes as necessary. Once OMB has completed its review, the text will move to the next stage in the workfl ow\u2014the \"amounts only\" stage \u2014which permits changes to the funding levels requested in the appropriations language. OMB will contact you, as needed, to update the funding level in the \"amounts only\" stage. Accordingly, if your agency has outstanding funding decisions and no outstanding policy decisions that require new language , use a funding placeholder that is $0,000,000 when submitting your language to the first stage of the workflow. At any time during the process, you can print out the latest text b y account or (depending on your user permissions) for your whole Appendix chapter in draft form. OMB may also, from time to time during the process, provide a PDF of your chapter for your review. For detailed information on how to use the MAX A-11 DE application to edit and print your text, see the help page: https://community.max.gov/x/YY4eIw APPROPRIATIONS LANGUAGE 95.5 What do I need to know about the appropriations language included in the Appendi x? (a) In general . The Appendix includes appropriations language that reflects the President's annual request to the Congress for budget authority or other statutory authority. For each account for which appropriations language was enacted in the CY or is proposed for the BY, the Appendix proposes appropriations language. Legislative proposals that request authorizing legislation are not included in the Appendix . Proposed appropriations language that would change budget authority or outlays in a mandatory program (also known as \"CHIMPs,\" see section 20.3) requires advance approval from OMB. In most cases, you will submit proposed BY appropriations language by marking up language enacted as part of a regular CY appropriations act provided by OMB in MAX A -11 DE. However, if regular appropriations have not been enacted, OMB will provide you wit h special instructions. If you propose new provisions or changes to enacted language (other than changes in amounts) for individual accounts or administrative and general provisions, include an explanation and justification either with the budget submis sion to OMB or separately to your RMO if the proposal occurs after that time. Any change to appropriations language with a budgetary impact, including changes to general provisions, requires OMB approval (see section 51.2). (b) Funding under a general provision. As a general matter, the President 's Budget should request appropriations underneath the account header where the funding will be executed, not as part of a general provision. If Congress enacts an appropriation SECTION 95 \u2014BUDGET APPENDIX AND PRINT MATERIALS Page 6 of Section 95 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) in a general provision, and the President 's Budget is continuing that funding, incorporate that funding within the amounts requested underneath the applicable account header. Please work with your OMB examiner if you think a particular appropriation should remain in the general provisions section of a bill. (c) Language related to personnel . If you propose language that relates to employment of personnel without regard to civil service or classification laws, send a copy of the letter from the Office of Personnel Management approving the new provision(s) to your OMB contact. Submit this information separately from the language submissions; do not write any explanations in MAX A -11 DE. Whenever possible, try to include proposed substantive changes in appropriations language with the budget submission to provide adequate time for review by OMB. When you edit your appropriations language in MAX A -11 DE, do not provide additional parenthetical statutory references following the text of the appropriations language. (d) Technical edits to appropr iations language . When making technical edits to appropriations language, follow the guidelines below (See exhibit 95B for illustrations of technical edits for appropriations language): 1. Inserting language. If you are inserting language to replace deleted language, insert such language after the deleted language; also, add new General Provisions at the very end of existing General Provisions. 2. Punctuation. a. Dollar Symbols . Include the $ dollar symbol for funding levels, whether you are inserting or deleting text. If funding levels are not yet available, use \"$0,000,000\" as a placeholder (not \"$X,XXX,XXX\" and not \"$0\"). b. Existing Punctuation . When inserting text, do so before existing punctuation (and, in so doing, retain existing punctuation). 3. Provisos. a. Use colons before provisos (not semi -colons or periods); b. Use \"Provided\" for the first proviso (capitalized), and \"Provided further\" for any subsequent proviso in the paragraph [note, new paragraphs begin this rule again]; c. Place a comma after \"Provided\" or \"Provided further\" (as the case may be); and d. Capitalize \"That\". If no change to the enacted amount is requested in the BY appropriations language, do not strike the amount and re -insert the same amount. In this case, no change to the amount requested is required. Work with your OMB representative to remove an unnecessary strikeout or insertion. 95.6 Is legislative language for mandatory proposals included in the Appendix or with other Budget materials? No. The Appendix only includes the President's request to the Congress for budget authority or other legislative authority to be provided through the annual appropriations process. Legislative language for SECTION 95 \u2014BUDGET APPENDIX AND PRINT MATERIALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 95 mandatory proposals is not included in the Budget materials transmitte d by OMB. OMB may undertake a separate process subsequent to the Budget release to transmit authorizing language for mandatory proposals. Questions on the development of authorizing legislation should be directed to your OMB representative. 95.7 What ar e the special appropriations language requirements for credit programs? The Federal Credit Reform Act imposes special appropriations language requiremen ts for credit programs. (See section 185 for general guidance on credit programs.) Each program account for a direct loan or loan guarantee program must contain: A request for an appropriation for the subsidy costs on a net present value basis; A specif ication of the loan level supportable by the subsidy cost appropriation; and A request for an appropriation for the administrative expenses for operating the credit program. Use the following standard subsidy appropriation language, using the bracketed el ements as appropriate. If you need to transfer the amount for administrative expenses to a salaries and expenses account, modify the language as described below. Where loans are disbursed beyond the five year period after obligation, you need to add the proviso discussed in section 95.8 . [For the cost of direct loans, $___,] [and] [for the cost of guaranteed loans, $___,] as authorized by [authorizing statute]: Provided , That such costs, including the cost of modifying such loans, shall be as defined in section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974: Provided further, That these funds are available to subsidize [gross obligations for the principal amount of direct loans not to exceed $___] [,and] [total loan principal, any part of which is to be guaranteed, not to exceed $___.] In addition, for administrative expenses to carry out the [direct] [and] [guaranteed] loan program[s], $___. In cases where the Budget will propose to transfer administrative expenses to a salaries and expenses account, substitute the following for the last sentence above: In addition, for administrative expenses to carry out the [direct] [and] loan [guarantee] program[s], $___, which of account]] [or, to the extent necessary,] [used to reimburse the Federal Financing Bank as authorized in section 505(c) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974]. If you believe that the nature of a program requires a modification of the specified langua ge, you may request an exception (see section 25.2). 95.8 What are the special language requirements for programs that disburse over a period longer than five fiscal years? Unless other wise specified by law, budget authority is available for liquidating obligations (that is, outlays) for only five fiscal years after the budget authority expires. This could be problematic for programs funded by annual or multi -year budget authority where disbursements are expected to occur more than five fiscal years after the budget authority expires. Where loans or other costs (such as termination costs for some contracts and annual lease payments under operating leases, capital leases, or lease-purcha se agreements) will be disbursed beyond the five -year period, use the following standard proviso, modified as appropriate, to ensure that the budget authority will remain available for disbursement over the full term of the contract: SECTION 95 \u2014BUDGET APPENDIX AND PRINT MATERIALS Page 8 of Section 95 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Provided, That such sums are to remain available through 20XX for the liquidation of valid obligations incurred in fiscal year 20XX. 95.9 What are the special language requirements for cancellations of unobligated balances? When developing legislative language for cancellati ons of unobligated balances, you must consider whether: (1) the account contains funds that were designated as an emergency requirement, as overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism (OCO), or as disaster funding; and (2) the cancellation is permanent or temporary. Each issue is discussed below. (1) Appropriations language must be clear that the cancelled funds do not include funds that were designated pursuant to a Concurrent Resolution on the Budget or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended (BBEDCA), as an emergency requirement, as OCO, or as disaster funding. This is important because cancellations of such funds are not counted as discretionary offsets for appropriations of non-emergency, non -OCO, or non-disaster funds (see section 20.4(i)). Unless the appropriations language specifies to the contrary, cancellations may be executed from funding that was provided using either a congressional or statutory emergency, OCO, or disaster designation. Inclu de the following proviso whenever you are drafting language that would cancel funds from an account that has ever contained emergency or OCO funding: Provided , That no amounts may be cancelled from amounts that were designated by the Congress [as an emerg ency requirement] Terrorism] [for disaster funding] pursuant to the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. (2) Appropriations language must specify whether or not the cancellation is intended to be permanent, meaning that the funds should be returned to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury , or temporary, meaning that the funds are not returned to the General Fund and could becom e available for obligation in a subsequent fiscal year depending on whether they are permanently appropriated or subject to appropriations. (see section 20.4(i) ). Unless otherwise approved by OMB, all cancellations proposed in the Budget should be perma nent. Regardless of the source of the funding, use the following standard language, modified as appropriate. Of the unobligated balances from prior year appropriations available under this heading, $____ are hereby permanently cancelled: If OMB has ap proved a proposal for a cancellation of funds from special or trust receipts or spending authority from offsetting collections as temporary, use the following standard language, modified as appropriate. Of the unobligated balances from prior year appropriations available under this heading, $____ are hereby cancelled: Temporary and permanent reductions are recorded on distinct line numbers in MAX A -11 DE (see section 82). SECTION 95 \u2014BUDGET APPENDIX AND PRINT MATERIALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 95 95.10 When BBEDCA discretionary caps are in place or proposed, what are the special language requirements for requests that designate an adjustment to the discretionary caps, such as emergency, Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO), or disaster funding? If your request includes amounts that the Administra tion intends the Congress to designate as an emergency requirement or for OCO as defined by the BBEDCA, use the following proviso, modified as appropriate: Provided, That such amount is designated by the Congress [as an emergency requirement] [for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism] pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended: Provided further, That such amount shall be available only if the President designates such am ount [as an emergency requirement] [for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism] pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A). If your request includes amounts that the Administration intends the Congress to designate as disaster funding as defined by the BBEDCA, use the following proviso, modified as appropriate: For [specify the type of expenses] resulting from major disasters declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), $___: xProvided, That such amount is designated by the Congress as being for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. If the Administration intends the Congress to designate onl y a portion of the amount being requested as disaster funding, use the following proviso, modified as appropriate: Provided, That, of the funds provided herein, $____ shall be for major disasters declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.): Provided further, That the amount for major disasters in the previous proviso is designated by the Congress as being for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. For other designations, such as program integrity, wildfire, or proposals for a new designation, specific language is needed in the Budget request. Use of any of these designations is not permitted without the prior approval from your OMB Representative. In the absence of discretionary caps, the Budget may use different language than that described above when an Administration seeks similar consideration for an allocation adjustment (see section 21.3) or other budget ary enforcement through the c ongressional budget process. SECTION 95 \u2014BUDGET APPENDIX AND PRINT MATERIALS Page 10 of Section 95 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) NARRATIVE STATEMENTS 95.11 How do I prepare narrative statements? Exhibit 95A provides general style guidance for use in preparing narrative statements. The exhibit also describes other conventions, such as those used for capitalizing account titles and program activities. (a) Active accounts. You must prepare a narrative statem ent (revising last year's statement, if there was one) for every active account, including supplemental requests and legislative proposals. An account is active if the program and financing schedule shows obligations in the CY or BY, or you estimate that the account will incur obligations in the outyears. Follow these guidelines when writing the narrative for an active account: Write the narrative statements in a concise and factual manner, avoiding hyperbole. Orient them toward the policies and objectiv es for the budget year. Include quantitative tables that match program performance and dollar data. Discuss performance goals and indicators and how the budget request supports them. Discuss efforts to improve program performance and efficiency. Discuss pertinent legislation enacted since the previous budget and legislative initiatives proposed in the budget. Do not discuss the history, authorizing statutes, and other legal references except in special cases, as explained below. The separate activities (and any subactivities) listed in the obligations by program activity section of the program and financing schedule should present a meaningful breakdown of the total program (see section 82.5). Therefore, it usually makes sense to address them separately in the narrative statements. You should identify the activities in side headings by the title used in the program and financing schedule and present them in the same order. (b) Inactive accounts. An account is inactive if it sho ws no obligations in the CY or BY and you estimate that no obligations will be incurred in the outyears. The narrative for inactive accounts should explain why the account is inactive. For example, it may be that the account funded a temporary study comm ission that is no longer authorized, received no appropriation after the past year (PY), and simply spends out obligated balances. If an inactive account shows any budgetary resources (budget authority or unobligated balances) in the CY, BY, or outyears, the narrative should explain the expected disposition of the budgetary resources. 95.12 How should performance information be incorporated into the narrative statements? The statements should support the agency 's annual performance plan by explaining wha t outcomes the agency expects to achieve with the requested funding and how the agency is working to improve performance and efficiency. Statements should highlight how quarterly reviews and assessments are used to inform funding allocations and what foll ow-up the agency is taking to improve program performance. Finally, statements should describe, where appropriate, program alignment to achieve Agency Strategic Objectives, implement the Priority Goals and their contributions to agency efforts to improve its operations and make better use of taxpayer dollars. See Part 6 - The Federal Performance F ramework for Improving Program and Service Delivery of this Circular for a dditional guidance on agency strategic and performance planning in support of efforts t o improve organizational and program performance. SECTION 95 \u2014BUDGET APPENDIX AND PRINT MATERIALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 95 95.13 Are there any special requirements for narrative statements? In addition to the information required for active accounts, the narrative should include certain specific information, described in the following paragraphs, if the account involves any of the following: (a) Narrative statements for revolving funds . For revolving funds, the narrative statement should include the information requir ed for active accounts in general (see section 95.11 ) using the side heading Budget program. In addition, the narrative statement should address the following topics, with the side headings shown: Financing . Provide significant information on the fund's means of financing, such as sources of income and authority to borrow (including limits on such authority, amounts actually borrowed and repaid during the year). For funds with a statutory limit on the amount of borrowing or on the amount of debt that ca n be outstanding at any one time, indicate the amount of the limit and discuss the position of the fund with respect to the limit during the budget year. Include in the statement a discussion of how close to the limit the fund will approach during the yea r. Operating results. Provide significant information relating to levels of revenue, expense, and net income or loss. Explain the steps being taken to dispose of any deficits and the planned disposition of net earnings. Include an analysis of retained income on a cumulative basis, disclosing any budget authority amounts used to offset deficits for non-revenue producing outlays since the inception of the fund. For each fund covered by section 102 of the Government Corporation Control Act, include a spec ific recommendation on the application of the retained earnings or restoration of capital impairment at the end of the past year. The recommendation should indicate: The amount of retained income to be returned to the Treasury and the use to be made of t he remainder, if any; and Whether restoration of any capital impairment is required and whether this should be done by appropriations or other means. (b) Narrative statements for Federal credit programs. Narrative statements for Federal credit programs should address these items: Significant factors in developing subsidy estimates, such as default rates and interest rates charged to borrowers. Where relevant, information about how risk categories are defined (see section 185.3). For loan guarantee programs, the percentage of the loan covered by the guarantee. (c) Narrative statements in special cases. The narrative statement should explain any special circumstances affecting the means of financing the program. Cover the following cases in particular: Mandatory spending. Indicate the legal basis for the budget authority (since no appropriations lan guage is presented for such items). SECTION 95 \u2014BUDGET APPENDIX AND PRINT MATERIALS Page 12 of Section 95 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Offsetting collections and receipts. When offsetting collections or receipts earmarked in a special or trust fund finance a significant portion of the obligations of the account, discuss the source of the collections or receipts and the purposes of and restrictions on their use. For example, discuss user charges to the public, reimbursable work performed for other organizations, and asset sales. The narrative should also discuss receipts generated by the program but de posited into the General Fund of the Treasury, when pertinent to the operations of the program. Agency debt issued and investments in agency debt . Unless the information is provided in a balance sheet for the account, the narrative statement should inclu de the following information, as applicable, for the year before the past year (PY-1) through BY. For accounts that issue debt instruments to other Federal accounts (excluding debt issued to Treasury or to the Federal Financing Bank) or to non-Federal ent ities, indicate the par value of outstanding debt securities issued by the account to other Federal accounts (in total) and non-Federal entities (in total). For accounts that own securities issued by other Federal accounts (excluding securities issued by the Treasury or the Federal Financing Bank) or by non-Federal entities, indicate the par value of the securities owned that were issued by Federal accounts (in total) and non -Federal entities (in total). Limitations on borrowing or debt. For accounts wit h a statutory limit on the amount of borrowing or on the amount of debt that can be outstanding at any one time, indicate the amount of the limit and discuss the position of the fund with respect to the limit during the budget year. Include in the stateme nt a discussion of how close to the limit the fund will approach during the year.

SECTION 100 SEQUESTRATION Page 2 of Section 100 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) INTRODUCTION TO SEQUESTRATION 100.1 What is sequestration? Sequestration is the cancellation of budgetary resources for budget enforcement purposes. Sequestration is required under certain circumstances as set forth in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), as amended, and the Statutory Pay -As-You -Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO Act). 100.2 What terms and concepts should I understand? Baseline refers to the baseline from the most recent President's Budget, updated for enacted legislation. A sequestration order issued with the President's Budget uses the baseline from that budget. (See section 80 for more information about the baseline.) Breach is the amount by which new budget authority within a category of discretionary appropriations for that year exceeds that category's discretionary spending limit (\"cap\") for new budget authority. Budget account means an account for which there is a designated budget account identification code number in the President's Budget. A budget account may be associated with one or more Treasury accounts. (See section 20.11(a) for more information about accounts.) Budgetary resources refer to new budget authority, unobligated balances, direct spending authority and obligation limitations. It includes the authority to spend offsetting collections and receipts. Under BBEDCA, any budgetary resources reflected in the President's Budget are subject to sequestration unless exempted by law. Cap adjustment refers to funding provided in an appropriations act that results in an upward adjustment to the discretionary spending limits pursuant to section 251(b)(2) of BBEDCA. Cap adjustments include those for emergency funding, disaster assistance, wildfire suppression, overseas contingency operations (OCO), and program integrity. Such upward adjustments may be to either the defense or non-defense discretionary spending limit, depending on the type of funding provided. Defense function refers to budget authority designated under budget function 050. Non-defense function refers to budget authority in all non-050 budget functions. Under BBEDCA, for discretionary appropriations the non- defense category is called the \"revised nonsecurity category\" and the defense category is called the \"revised security category. \" (See exhibit 79A for functional classifications.) Exempt refers to budgetary resources that are not subject to sequestration because the program, account, or resource type is specifically exempted by section 255 or section 256 of BBEDCA or by other laws. BBEDCA provides a list of specific and general exemptions. (See section 100.5 for more information on exempt resources. ) Programs, projects, and activities (PPA) are delineated in the appropriations act or accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering an account, or, for accounts n ot included in appropriations acts (most mandatory accounts), in the most recently submitted President's Budget. Agencies may consult with relevant congressional committees to aid in understanding the delineation of PPAs in report language. Sequestrable resources are budgetary resources not exempted by any provision of BBEDCA (see section 20.3) or other law and therefore subject to sequestration. SECTION 100 \u2014SEQUESTRATION OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 100 Sequestration order is an order issued by the President as required by law that directs agencies to implement sequestration reductions as required by OMB calculations set forth in the accompanying sequestration report. Sequestration percentage is a uniform percentage reduction applied to sequestrable budgetary resources within a budget account to achieve the amount of the sequestration. The sequestration percentage is set forth by OMB in a sequestration report. Sequestration report is compiled by OMB and details estimates, calculations, and other requirements as set forth in BBEDCA or the PAYGO Act. (See sect ion 100.4 for a list of all the required OMB budget enforcement reports.) Special rules for calculating and executing sequestration for specific programs are listed in sections 251A(6) , 251A(7) , and 256 of BBEDCA, and section 6 of the PAYGO Act. For those specific programs subject to a special rule, OMB works with agencies to determine the application of the special rule. 100.3 What are the different types of sequestration? There are three sequestration triggers in current law: two that affect mandatory (direct) spending and one that affects discretionary spending. Sequestration of mandatory spending: Section 251A of BBEDCA requires sequestration of nonexempt mandatory budgetary resources through 2031 except for Medicare, which extends through 2032. The sequestration order for each year is issued with the President's Budget and takes effect on the first day of the upcoming fiscal year. The PAYGO Act requires sequestration of nonexempt mandatory budgetary resources if revenue or mandatory spending legislation is enacted that, in total, increases projected deficits or reduces projected surpluses relative to the baseline in the budget year. OMB maintains five - and 10- year scorecards and issues an annual PAYGO report that includes a determination of whether a violation of the PAYGO requirement has occurred. If there are more costs than savings in the budget year column of either the five - or 10- year scorecard, the President is required to issue a sequestration order implementing across -the-board cuts to nonexempt mandatory programs by an amount sufficient to offset the larger of the net costs on the PAYGO scorecards. As described in section 100.4, such an order generally would be issued between mid-December and mid -January. Sequestration of discretionary resources: A sequestration of discretionary resources can occur when there are statutory limits, or caps on discretionary budget authority. Most recently, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (P.L. # TK) amended BBEDCA to set defense and non -defense caps on the amount of discretionary budget authority for 2024 and 2025. If discretionary appropriations breach either the defense or non - defense caps, section 251(a) of BBEDCA requires a sequestration of nonexempt budgetary resources in that category. If OMB determines that a breach to a cap has occurred, the President must issue a sequestration order canceling budgetary resources in nonexempt accounts by the amount necessary to eliminate the breach in the affected category. Cap adjustment funding provided in appropriations a cts does not cause a breach of the caps, but is subject to a discretionary sequestration if a breach of the caps occurs, unless specifically exempted in sections 255 or 256 of BBEDCA or in another law. SECTION 100 SEQUESTRATION Page 4 of Section 100 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) For more information on discretionary caps, BBEDCA Section 251A , and the PAYGO Act, see the section on Budget Enforcement in the \"Budget Process\" chapter of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the President's Budget and section 21.4 in this circular. 100.4 What are the BBEDCA Section 251A sequestration percentages? The sequestration percentages are: 8.3 percent - Defense mandatory 5.7 percent - Nondefense mandatory 2.0 percent - Medicare , Community and migrant health centers BBEDCA requires that all fiscal years through 2031 use the same percentages that were calculated for sequestrable resources in 2021. Subsequent legislation extended the reduction for Medicare through 2032. 100.5 Wh at budget enforcement reports are required? BBEDCA requires OMB to issue six different kinds of reports to the President and the Congress, which are explained in more detail in the table below. Reports on discretionary spending are only required when discretionary caps are in place. BBEDCA also requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to issue update reports, final reports, and within-session reports similar to the ones described below, with its estimates due five days earlier than the OMB reports. However, the CBO reports are advisory only, and OMB reports determine whether a sequestration is required when statutory caps under BBEDCA are in place. The following table describes the BBEDCA reports that cover discretionary spending . What OMB reports... When... Preview Report . This report, required by section 254 of BBEDCA, discusses the status of discretionary caps at the beginning of the new appropriations year based on current law. It explains whether any OMB adjustments to the discretionary caps are made for concepts and definitions, and publishes the revised caps. This report also details any proposed changes to the discretionary caps included in the President's Budget. With the President's Budget 7-day-after Reports . As part of enforcing the discretionary spending caps, OMB must issue a report following enactment of each appropriations act (including a supplemental appropriations act) estimating the amount of new discretionary budget authority provided by the act for the current year and budget year. This report, required by section 251(a)(7) of BBEDCA, also contains detailed explanations of any scoring difference between OMB and CBO and provides a summary of enacted legislation versus the discretionary caps. 7 days after enactment of a bill Update Report . This report, required by section 254 of BBEDCA, revises the Preview Report estimates to reflect the effects of discretionary appropriations enacted since the Preview Report , including any cap adjustments under section 251(b)(2) . This report includes a summary of OMB scoring of pending appropriations legislation, which notifies the Congress about the potential for a sequestration in the Final Report , and a pre view estimate of the adjustment for disaster funding for the upcoming fiscal year.

Section 254 of BBEDCA requires OMB to report if a discretionary appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted before July 1 that breaches a cap. The report triggers a sequestration order. (If an appropriation is enacted after July 1 that breaches a cap, BBE DCA requires OMB to reduce the same cap for the following year.) Between the end of a session of Congress and July 1 BBEDCA and the PAYGO Act require OMB to issue t hree different kinds of reports on mandatory spending, which the following table describes.

Report to the Congress on the BBEDCA Section 251A Reductions for the Fiscal Year. This sequestration report, required by section 251A(9) of BBEDCA, provides the calcu lations of the amount by which direct spending resources are required to be reduced and lists the reductions required for each budget account with nonexempt direct spending. With the President's Budget 100.6 Which budgetary resources are subject to sequestration? Budgetary resources are subject to sequestration unless they: (1) Are expressly listed as exempt in section 255 or section 256 of BBEDCA; (2) Meet the requirements for one of the general categories for exemption provided in section 255 or section 256 of BBEDCA; or (3) Are exempt from sequestration pursuant to another provision of law. BBEDCA exempts certain general categories of budgetary resources from sequestration, including: Unobligated balances of budgetary authority carried over from prior fiscal years, except balances in the defense function. SECTION 100 SEQUESTRATION Page 6 of Section 100 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Payments made to individuals pursuant to provisions establishing refundable income tax credits. Activities resulting from private donations, bequests, or voluntary contributions to the Governme nt. Activities financed by voluntary payments for goods or services. Generally, these activities involve a business -like transaction where (1) the Government, acting in a business-like capacity, sells goods or services to a non-federal purchaser, (2) the sale takes place at the discretion of the purchaser, and (3) the spending derived from the sale is directly related to the provision of goods or services that are offered for sale. This exemption does not include regulatory activities financed by fees i mposed on non -federal entities. Intragovernmental funds. This exemption applies to budgetary resources financed by collections from other budgetary accounts. This exemption does not apply to: a. The paying account; b. The account receiving a non -expenditure transfer; or c. Budgetary resources financed by collections of interest paid by the Treasury to other Federal accounts. Prior legal obligations of the Government in credit liquidating accounts or credit reestimates. Amounts temporarily reduced by sequestr ation that are determined to become available in a subsequent fiscal year without further legislative action pursuant to section 256(k)(6) of BBEDCA are not again subject to sequestration pursuant to the same authority that required the original reduction. However, such amounts would be subject to any sequestration issued pursuant to a different law, unless the separate law exempts them. BBEDCA provides the President with the option to annually exempt or provide for a lower uniform percentage reduction in military personnel accounts, subject to congressional notificatio n. This is the only optional exemption specified in law. OMB maintains a list of the sequestrable/exempt classification of budget accounts on the Budget Season Reports page on the MAX Federal Community. Even if an account, program, or resource is exempted, the portion that funds Federal administrative expenses is sequestrable pursuant to section 256(h) of BBEDCA. The definition of Federal administrative expenses in otherwise exempt budgetary resources depends upon the nature of the program. Generally , the object classes in exhibit 100 are used to define Federal administrative expenses subject to sequestration. However, for certain programs, such as business-like programs whose budgetary resources are exempted as voluntary payments for goods or services and partiall y or fully exempt direct -service health care programs, a more narrow definition of administrative expenses \u2014overhead expenses\u2014 applies. Overhead expenses are defined as the expenses necessary to run a business that are not directly tied to the production and delivery of goods or services (e.g., central management, rent for office space, human resources, and sales). In the case of direct -service health care programs overhead would encompass central administration, but not salaries and other expenses for the direct provision of health care, such as the salaries of doctors and nurses. Section 256(h) does not apply to exempted accounts consisting entirely of administrative expenses. SECTION 100 \u2014SEQUESTRATION OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 7 of Section 100 OMB works with agencies to determine the correct definition of Federal administrative expenses for particular programs. Funding designated as a PAYGO emergency will not trigger a PAYGO sequestration, but is subject to a sequestration if one is triggered, unless otherwise exempted by law. Similarly, BBEDCA does not provide an exemption for discretionary funding counted as an adjustment to a statutory cap or for discretionary funding not counted under statutory caps. These types of funding will not trigger a sequestration of discretionary resources, but are subject to a discretionary sequestration if one is triggered, unles s otherwise exempted. 100.7 How does OMB use outlays to calculate a sequestration percentage under the PAYGO Act? The PAYGO Act requires OMB to calculate a sequestration by dividing the required reduction by the sequestrable base. For a sequestration of mandatory budgetary resources, the sequestrable base is defined as the sum of estimated outlays in the budget year and in the subsequent fiscal year from sequestrable mandatory budget year resources in the baseline. 100.8 How does a sequestration of mandatory budgetary resources interact with a discretionary change in a mandatory program (CHIMP)? A sequestration that affects mandatory budgetary resources uses the baseline, as required by law, to determine the sequestrable base for an account. The mandatory baseline generally reflects current law and therefore includes the effects of any previously -enacted CHIMPs, wh ich are returned to the mandatory side of the budget after enactment. The baseline does not include the effects of any CHIMPs proposed or anticipated to be enacted in future appropriations acts. EXECUTION GUIDANCE 100.9 When should I begin to execute a sequestration? If the sequestration order is issued during the fiscal year in which the sequestration is to occur, the sequestration should begin to be executed as soon as practicable after the President issues the sequestration order. If the sequestration order is issued before the start of the affected fiscal year, the sequestration should be executed beginning on the first day of the affected fiscal year. 100.10 What is my sequestration amount? Although the reduction amounts contained in a sequestra tion report are rounded to the nearest million, agencies should calculate the specific dollar reduction required. To do this, multiply the dollar amount of the sequestrable budgetary resources in each budget account listed in the report by the sequestrati on percentage and round the result to the nearest dollar. If an account has sequestrable budgetary resources that do not appear in the report because they do not round to a million dollars, a sequestration is still required, and the calculation is the s ame. If a budgetary resource is sequestrable and is estimated in the baseline to be zero, but the actual budgetary resource is greater than zero, it must be sequestered. SECTION 100 SEQUESTRATION Page 8 of Section 100 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 100.11 When can the sequestration amount differ from the amount in a sequestration report? The two most frequent reasons the sequestration amount differs from the amounts in a report occur when budgetary resources in the baseline change from estimates to actuals and when errors occur in the baseline or the sequestration report . Chang es from estimates to actual budget authority . There are certain programs where the amount of the sequestrable budgetary resource depends on factors that can only be estimated at the time a sequestration report is prepared, for example when the amount of sequestrable budget authority is determined by the amount of receipts collected in the same fiscal year or derived by a benefit formula that determines the number of eligible beneficiaries. In cases such as these, where the actual amount of the sequestrabl e budgetary resource can vary from the baseline estimate used to prepare the sequestration report due to the nature of the program, OMB may direct agencies to achieve the reduction by multiplying the sequestration percentage by the actual amount of sequest rable budgetary resources, as opposed to multiplying by the estimate of budgetary resources reflected in the report. Apportionments with budgetary resources subject to this requirement should have an OMB -approved footnote making this method of achieving t he reduction explicit. Questions on the application of this requirement to specific accounts should be directed to your OMB representative. Changes due to errors in the baseline or sequestration report. Sequestrable budgetary resources are required to t ake a reduction, even if the baseline used to determine the reduction was in error due to miscalculation or a recording error. If you have an error in the baseline that results in a change from the amount issued in a sequestration report, consult with your OMB representative to determine if a footnote on your apportionment is needed. Budgetary resources subject to sequestration are required to take the correct reduction, even if the corrected amount differs from the amount listed in the sequestration repor t. Please work with your OMB representative to determine the corrected application of sequestration. 100.12 What if a continuing resolution (CR) is in effect when a sequestration is required? If a sequestration of mandatory resources is ordered while a CR is in effect, the annualized effect of the CR will be considered when determining the baseline for affected mandatory resources. 100.13 Can I choose which program, project, or activity (PPA) to reduce? No. Within a PPA, you have discretion on how to achieve the required reduction. However, the sequestrable budgetary resources for all PPAs within a budget account must be reduced by the sequestration percentage that applies to those resources pursuant to section 256(k)(2) of BBEDCA. Cap adjustment funding is generally not considered a separate PPA unless the funding is otherwise delineated in the appropriations act or accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering an account. If a single budget account is subject to more than one sequestration per centage (e.g., it has both defense and non-defense function budgetary resources), this rule applies within those resources subject to the same sequestration percentage (e.g., the sequestrable non -defense function resources must be reduced by the same percentage in each PPA). Sequestration has no effect on existing reprogramming and transfer authorities. Agencies may take into account the availability of reprogramming and transfer authority in determining how best to implement a program after sequestration . SECTION 100 \u2014SEQUESTRATION OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 100 100.14 What happens to sequestered budgetary resources? Generally, budgetary resources sequestered from an account are permanently cancelled, meaning they revert to the General Fund of the Treasury. However, section 256(k)(6) of BBEDCA provides an exception for budgetary resources sequestered in revolving, trust, and special fund accounts, and spending authority from offsetting collections sequestered in appropriations accounts. These funds are temporarily reduced, meaning that the money is not returned to the General Fund, but instead remains as an unavailable balance in the account where the funding was originally deposited. Resources that have been temporarily reduced are not available for obligation during the fiscal year in which they are sequestered, but remain in the fund or account and may be available in sub sequent years only to the extent provided in appropriations or authorizing language. Resources that have been temporarily reduced will not be available in the subsequent year simply because funding is appropriated on a no-year (\" available until expended\" ) or multi -year basis. Once an amount provided in a given fiscal year has been reduced, an extended period of availability for funds appropriated in that year does not make those funds available in the following year. Instead, there must be statutory language that makes the unavailable funding in the account available in a subsequent year, such as an appropriation of all funding in the account (since sequestered funding from a prior year would constitute funding in the account, it would be made available by such an appropriation). Resources that have been temporarily reduced will also not be available in a subsequent year to the extent statutory language states that only funds from a specific fiscal year are appropriated (assuming that the sequestered f unds were not provided in that fiscal year). OMB, in conjunction with agencies, determines which resources become available in a subsequent fiscal year. 100.15 How do I show the effects of sequestration in my budgetary reporting? Line numbers used to capture the effects of sequestration in an apportionment, the report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (SF 133), and the budget Program and Financing schedule (schedule P) are shown in Appendix F. Apportionments : Each line relating to sequestration should use \"SEQ\" in the line split column. See section 120.19 for more details on line splits and exhibit 120T for an example of how to report sequestration amounts in an apportionment. Budget execution in SF 133s : Exhibit 130L shows an example of how accounts that report the availability of temporarily reduced amounts record their reductions in one year and then record the availability of previously unavailable budgetary resources in the subsequent year. MAX A-11 Data Entry : Agencies are required to show their pre -sequestration and sequestration reduction amounts in their baseline presentation for all years where the BBEDCA Section 251A sequestration is in effect (currently until 203 1 for all programs except for Medicare, which extends through 2032). The sequestration reduction amounts should be recorded in a specific budget enforcement subcategory , \"Mandatory, Sequestration, Authorizing Committee .\" Note that temporarily reduced amounts are not available for obligation, and should not be entered on line 1000, unobligated balance brought forward, October 1, in the subsequent year. SECTION 100 SEQUESTRATION Page 10 of Section 100 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) For accounts that show the availability in the CY or BY of budgetary resources sequestered in the previous year, record the available budgetary resource on a specific budget enforcement subcategory, \"Mandatory, Sequestration Pop -Up, Authorizing Committee.\" See section 81.2 for more information on budget enforcement categories in MAX A -11 DE. 100.16 What happens if enacted legislation affects an account or program with sequestrable budgetary resources after a sequestration order and report are issued? A sequestration reduction applies to budgetary resources provided by laws enacted as of the date the sequestration order is calculated, or for certain expiring programs, resources extended in the baseline according to the baseline rules set forth in section 257 of BBEDCA. Additional budgetary resources above the baseline amount provided in laws enacted between the date on which the sequestration order is calculated and the end of the fiscal year for which it is in effect do not change the sequestrable base for an account during that fiscal year. These additional budgetary resources are not subject to sequestration in that fiscal year. Additional budgetary resources can be provided through the extension of an expiring program that was not extended in the baseline pursuant to section 257 of BBEDCA, through the creation of a new program, or through increases in budgetary resources for an existing program. Newly provided budgetary resources will be subject to sequestration in subsequent years unless specifically exempt. Likewise, reductions in budgetary resources provided in laws enacted after the date of the order (e.g., reductions to mandatory budgetary resources in subsequent appropriations acts, or CHIMPs) do not reduce the amount of the sequestration reduction required by the order. However, if the effect of new legislation is to alter the method of calculating a program already included in the baseline, the sequestration percentage continues to apply to the sequestrable portion of the program, adjusted for the new legislation. Generally, this guidance applies when the program achieves the required sequestration reduction by multiplying the sequestration percentage by the actual amount of sequestrable budgetary resources rather than by using the reduction amount i n the report issued for the fiscal year (see section 100.10). If you believe legislation has changed the amount of budgetary resources subject to sequestration in a fiscal year for which sequestration is ordered, contact your OMB representative. 100.17 Do I need to record decisions made about how my agency implemented sequestration? Yes. Your agency should record how sequestration is implemented in order to maintain consistency from year to year, to inform your efforts to plan for sequestration in future years, to build institutional knowledge, and to provide adequate documentation in the event of an audit. 100.18 Does sequestration have an effect on my program's ability to collect fees? Sequestration applies to budgetary resources, which includes spending authority derived from fee collections. Generally, sequestration does not affect a program's ability to collect fees. For questions about how sequestration may interact with the authority to collect a specific fee, contact your OMB representativ e. 100.19 What do I do if I incorrectly recorded a sequestration reduction? If you have discovered an error in the budgetary reporting for the current fiscal year, you will be required to record the correction in the current fiscal year as a current year transaction (e.g., appropriation permanently reduced). If you have discovered an error in the budgetary reporting for a previous fiscal year, you will be required to record the correction (e.g., adjustment to unobligated balance brought forward, October 1) in the current fiscal year as an adjustment to the data for the previous fiscal year, even though SECTION 100 \u2014SEQUESTRATION OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 100 the action taken to correct the data occurs in the current year. See Appendix F for more information on how to resolve an error in budgetary reporting. Failure to properly record a reduction in budgetary resources may result in a violation of the Antideficiency Act (ADA). See section 145 for more information on ADA violations. 100.20 Which sequestration percentage applies if my collections are recorded in one fiscal year but obligated in a different fiscal year? Apply the sequestration percentage specified in the sequestration report for the fiscal year in which the sequestrable bud getary resource is recorded. 100.21 How does a sequestration reduction differ from an across-the-board reduction (ATB) in an appropriations act? ATBs historically occur in appropriations acts, while sequestration occurs pursuant to BBEDCA or the PAYGO Act. In addition, ATBs historically affect discretionary budgetary resources, while sequestration can affect both discretionary and mandatory budgetary resources. Generally, the reductions are applied differently in the following cases: If the Budget Authority / Budgetary Resource... Under an ATB reduction*, amounts are... Under a sequestration reduction, amounts are... Is derived from the General Fund and resides in a special fund or in a non-trust revolving fund Permanently reduced Temporarily reduced Is derived by non -expenditure transfer Taken pre -transfer Generally taken post -transfer in the receiving account Is derived from offsetting collections Taken against the net BA Taken against the gross BA, after mandated non -expenditure transfers Is borrowi ng authority or contract authority Permanently reduced Temporarily reduced, if it meets the criteria in section 256(k)(6) of BBEDCA Is unobligated balances Not reduced Reduced only in the defense function (050) Is funding that will result in a cap adjustment pursuant to section 251(b)(2) of BBEDCA Not reduced Reduced *This guidance does not apply to ATB reductions in short -term CRs.

Ex-110A Supplemental requests\u2014appropriations language examples Ex-110B Budget amendments\u2014appropriations language examples 110.1 How does the President propose changes in the Budget in b etween the annual transmittals of the Budget? After the President 's Budget has been transmitted to the Congress, the President proposes changes in the Budget by transmitting appropriations requests that either propose changes to enacted appropriations fo r the current year (supplemental appropriations ) or revise the request for the budget year ( budget amendment) . The President may also include proposed appropriations language for new legislative initiatives that were included in the Budget. All Executive Branch proposed revisions to the Budget must conform to the policies of the President. The requests may be for additional amounts or proposed changes in appropriations language that do not affect amounts previously requested, such as technical corrections or changes in a limitation on the use of trust funds. These requests may be either supplementals or amendments, depending upon when they are transmitted (see section 110.2). You should make every effort to postpone actions that require supplemental appropriations. However, submit proposals that decrease or eliminate amounts whenever such changes are warranted. When requesting supplementals and amendments that increase the amounts contained in the Budget, provide proposals for reductions elsewhere in the agency. OMB will only consider requests for supplementals and amendments when: Existing law requires payments within the fiscal year (e.g., pensions and entitlements); An unforeseen emergency situation occurs (e.g., natural disaster requiring expenditures for the preservation of life or property); New legislation enacted after the submission of the annual Budget requires additional funds within the fiscal year; Increased workload is uncontrollable except by statutory change; or Liability accrues under the law and it is in the Government 's interest to liquidate the liability as soon as possible (e.g., claims on which interest is payable). SECTION 110 \u2014SUPPLEMENTALS AND AMENDMENTS Page 2 of Section 110 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) It generally takes a minimum of three weeks for OMB and the White Hous e to consider agency proposals for supplementals or amendments that are not transmitted in the annual Budget request. Allow for this timing when making requests. See section 79.3 for instructions on identifying supplementals and amendments that will be t ransmitted with the Budget request. If the Congress has not completed action on your appropriations bill for the current year before the President transmits the request for the budget year, OMB will issue guidance on the presentation of any amendments to the President 's current -year request. 110.2 What are supplementals and amendments? Supplementals are appropriation requests that are transmitted after enactment of an annual appropriations bill or that are in the public interest. They may be transmitte d prior to, with, or subsequent to transmittal of the succeeding annual Budget request. Supplemental requests that are known at the time the Budget is prepared are normally transmitted to the Congress with the Budget, rather than later as separate transmi ttals. However, each case will be decided separately. OMB representatives will inform you which supplementals will be transmitted with the Budget so you can submit the necessary information. These supplementals may be: Requesting additional amounts not previously anticipated; or Requesting changes in appropriations language that do not affect amounts previously appropriated. Amendments are proposed actions that revise the President 's Budget request and are transmitted prior to completion of action on the budget request by the Appropriations Committees of both Houses of the Congress. This includes appropriations language for activities authorized since transmittal of the President 's Budget that were included in the Budget as a legislative proposal. The most common Budget amendments are technical corrections to fix errors in the appropriations language included in the Budget Appendix . Since OMB must submit amendments to the Congress prior to enactment of new appropriations bills, at some point after tr ansmitting the Budget to the Congress, OMB will initiate a separate exercise asking agencies to identify any needed technical corrections to the Budget. This effort is generally known as the Budget Corrections process and is mainly managed using the EC20xx Corrections and EA20xx Language Corrections exercises in MAX A -11 DE. OMB may use your inputs to author a technical corrections amendment package in the format found in exhibit 110B . The EC20xx Corrections and EA20xx Language Corrections exercise s are also used to correct errors in OMB 's budget data base. Corrected budget data does not result in a Budget amendment, but is eventually used as a start in developing the MS20xx Mid- Session exercise. Your OMB representative w ill contact you at the time of the EC20xx Corrections and EA20xx Language Corrections exercises and provide additional information. The transmittal of Budget amendments to reflect new policy (i.e., not technical corrections) occurs infrequently . Please contact your OMB representative directly to communicate the need for such an amendment. 110.3 What do I need to send to OMB? You need to submit the materials below. Also, you should be prepared to revise the material, as appropriate, to reflect Presidential decisions.

Title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Public Law 93- 344), as amended, requires the President to transmit a special message to the Congress whenever a permanent rescission of budgetary resources is proposed. It also requires that special messages be transmitted to the Congress when funds are withheld temporarily from obligation (i.e., deferred). SECTION 112 \u2014DEFERRALS AND PRESIDENTIAL PROPOSALS TO RESCIND OR CANCEL FUNDS Page 2 of Section 112 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) The President transmits supplementary messages to the Congress when information contained in a special message transmitted previously is revised. This section provides instructions on agency reporting procedures and required submissions to OMB. The instructions provided in this section apply only to rescission proposals and deferrals. 112.2 What is the difference between an impoundment and a cancellation proposed by the President? Impoundment means any Executive Branch action or inaction that withholds or precludes the obligation or expenditure of budget authority. In contrast, a cancellation proposal is a proposal by the President to reduce budgetary resources that are not subject to the requirements of Title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 . Importantly, amounts proposed for cancellation are not to be withheld from obligation. Such amounts are subject to the normal apportionment instructions (see section 120). There are two types of impoundments: Rescission means enacted legislation that reduces budget authority (as defined in section 20.3) previously provided by law, prior to the time when the authority would otherwise expire. See section 112.18 for detailed instructions on rescission proposals by the President. Deferral means any Executive Branch action or inaction that temporarily withholds or effectively precludes the obligation or expenditure of budgetary resources with the intent of using the funds before they expire. Deferrals are permitted only to provide for contingencies, to achieve savings made possible by or through changes in requirements or greater efficiency of operations, or as specifically provided by law. Deferrals are generally effected through the apportionment process. See section 112 .4 for instructions on reports to the Congress. Rescission proposals and deferrals are subject to the requirements of Title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 , which require the President to transmit a special message to the Congress (see section 20.4(i) ). 112.3 When are funds deferred or proposed by the President for rescission withheld from obligation? Rescissions. Generally, amounts proposed for rescission will be withheld starting immediately after the President submi ts the Special Message to the Congress. The withholding continues during the time proposals are being considered by the Congress. This will be accomplished through apportionment action. For amounts withheld through the apportionment process, see sectio n 112.19 for instructions on completing the apportionment and SF 133 reports for enacted and proposed rescissions. (For timing of apportionment actions, see approve apportionments that reflect available budgetary resources temporarily withheld from obligation through the apportionment process. OMB may take such deferral action on its own initiative or at the request of an agency. Do not defer funds without prior approval of OMB. SECTION 112 \u2014DEFERRALS AND PRESIDENTIAL PROPOSALS TO RESCIND OR CANCEL FUNDS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 112 112.4 What materials are sent to the Congress? Title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires the President to transmit the following materials to the Congress: Special messages; Supplementary messages, whenever any in formation contained in a previous special message is revised; and Cumulative reports listing the status, as of the first day of the month, of all deferrals and rescission proposals previously included in special messages. The cumulative reports are to be transmitted to the Congress by the 10th day of each month. Instructions on reporting procedures are provided in section 112.18 . 112.5 When do I need to submit material to OMB? For deferrals and proposed rescissions withheld through the apportionment process: Submit the required materials when the corresponding apportionment requests are made to OMB; or If OMB suggests changes in or initiates rescission proposals or deferrals, furnish requested materials expeditiously on a time schedule determined by OMB. Submit a supplementary report to OMB, including a revised rescission proposal report and proposed rescission language, or deferral report, as appropriate, whenever you submit an apportionment request changing the amount of the rescission proposal or increasing the amount of the deferral, or making any substantial changes to information contained in a previous report. OMB will report reductions in amounts deferred in cumulative reports based on approved apportionments. Contact OMB no later than the first day of the following month to report the release of all or portions of agency deferrals. 112.6 What materials do I submit for inclusion in a special message for a rescission proposal? Submit the following materials to OMB for each rescission proposal: Information required by OMB to create a rescission report for each proposal (see exhibit 112A for an example of a rescission proposal); Proposed rescission appropriations language (see exhibit 112A ); and An apportionment request that reflects the amo unt withheld pending rescission on line 6180 of the apportionment (see exhibit 112B ). For proposed rescissions that are transmitted on the same day (or shortly thereafter) as the Budget, verify that amounts on the rescission report agree with the amounts printed in the Budget Appendix . If accounts with amounts proposed for rescission are combined (or merged) with other accounts in the Appendix , the budgetary resources on the rescission report will agree with the combined (or merged) account in the SECTION 112 \u2014DEFERRALS AND PRESIDENTIAL PROPOSALS TO RESCIND OR CANCEL FUNDS Page 4 of Section 112 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Appendix , even if some of the combined accounts have no proposed rescission. Express all amounts in dollars (per the latest apportionment). 112.7 What materials do I submit for inclusion in a special message for a deferral? Submit the following materials to OM B for each deferral: Information required by OMB to create a deferral report (see exhibit 112C for an example of a deferral); and An apportionment request that reflects the amount deferred on line 6181. When a deferral is enacted, include the amount, as a negative on line 1134. For deferrals that are transmitted on the same day (or shortly thereafter) as the Budget, verify that amounts on the deferral report agree with the amounts printed in the Appendix . If accounts with amounts deferred are combined (or merged) with other accounts in the Appendix , the budgetary resources on the deferral report will agree with the combined (or merged) account in the Appendix , even if some of the combined accounts have no deferral. Express all amounts in dollars. (For information on materials required for supplementary messages, see section 112.10.) 112.8 What narrative information do I need to include with rescission or deferral reports? In accordance with sections 1012(a) and 1013(a) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, include information in the rescission or deferral reports specifying: The amount proposed for rescission or deferral; The affected account and specific project or governmental functions involved; The reasons why the amount should be rescinded or deferred; The estimated fiscal, economic, and budgetary effects of the rescission proposal or deferral; The effect of the rescission proposal or deferral on the objects, purposes, and programs for which the amount was provided, to the maximum extent practicable; and Any other relevant facts, circumstances, and considerations. Also specify in the deferral report the period of time the budget authority is to be deferred and any legal authority invoked to justify the deferral . The information you provide and that is incorporated into special messages constitutes formal notification to the Congress of rescission proposals and deferrals. As such, rescission and deferral reports that you prepare should set forth a brief descript ion of the program; a justification that presents the reasons for the rescission proposal or deferral in a logical, clear, and concise fashion; a persuasive argument in support of each rescission proposal or deferral; and any other relevant information. P rovide information to OMB that specifically addresses the estimated program and outlay effects. For instructions on preparation of rescission and deferral reports, see section 112.18. SECTION 112 \u2014DEFERRALS AND PRESIDENTIAL PROPOSALS TO RESCIND OR CANCEL FUNDS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Section 112 112.9 What am I required to do when a previously reported deferral or r escission proposal changes? You are required to prepare a supplementary report whenever the purpose of the rescission proposal or deferral has changed. Alternatively, OMB may determine that a new rescission or deferral report is required instead of a supplementary report. In addition, you are required to prepare a supplementary report when the purpose of the rescission proposal or deferral has not changed, but: The amount of the proposed rescission changes; The amount of the deferral increases; or Other substantial changes are made to the previous report. Do not prepare a supplementary report when the amount of a deferral decreases. OMB reports reductions in deferrals to the Congress in monthly cumulative reports based on approved apportionments. When all or portions of agency deferrals are released, contact your OMB representative no later than the first day of the following month so that OMB can report these deferrals in the cumulative reports. 112.10 What information is required for the supplementary report? The supplementary report should specify: The amount of the initial proposed rescission or deferral reported in a special message or, when revised reports have been made previously, the amount of the latest revision; The amount currently being deferred or proposed for rescission; The amount of the increase in the deferral or change in proposed rescission; and The reason for the change. Whenever you revise information on a rescission proposal or deferral previously included in a special message, submit: A supplementary report explaining the change; The corresponding revised rescission or deferral report; In the case of rescissions, revised proposed rescission language; and In some cases, an apportionment r equest. (NOTE: Insert an asterisk (*) before revisions to information (e.g., amounts withheld or explanations) contained in rescission or deferral reports. Footnote the report \"*Revised from previous report.\") The supplementary report, the revised rescission or deferral report, and revised rescission language will be included in a special message from the President to the Congress. SECTION 112 \u2014DEFERRALS AND PRESIDENTIAL PROPOSALS TO RESCIND OR CANCEL FUNDS Page 6 of Section 112 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) 112.11 What are the responsibilities of OMB in preparing special messages? OMB will compile and transmit the special and supplementary messages to the Congress and to the Comptroller General. After the special and supplementary messages are transmitted to the Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), they are printed as House and Senate documents and in t he Federal Register. 112.12 What should I do to help OMB prepare cumulative reports? Notify OMB on the first day of each month when all or portions of agency deferrals are released. After the cumulative reports are transmitted to the Congress and GAO, th ey are printed as House and Senate documents and in the Federal Register. 112.13 What are my responsibilities after a deferral is reported to the Congress? Review all deferrals periodically so that amounts deferred for only part of the year may be released in time to be used prudently before the year ends. 112.14 What apportionment action is required when a rescission is enacted? If a Presidential rescission proposal is enacted into law , a new apportionment action is required. Adjust the apportionment to reflect the enacted rescission in the budgetary resources section (see section 13 of Appendix F for the appropriate line numbers) and remove the amount withheld pending rescission on line 6180. Submit the apportionment requests to OMB promptly upon compl etion of the congressional action. You should follow congressional action on proposed rescissions affecting your programs or activities to ensure accurate and timely apportionment action. 112.15 What apportionment action is required when a rescission is not enacted? Funds withheld pending rescission must be released following expiration of the prescribed 45 days of continuous session if a Presidential rescission proposal is not enacted into law. When funds must be released because of congressional inact ion on proposed rescissions, and the apportionment does not include a footnote automatically reapportioning the withheld funds, submit apportionment requests reflecting the release of the affected amounts to OMB before the end of the prescribed 45 days, as determined by OMB. If the Congress is in session, the 45 -day period begins the first day after the Congress receives a special message. If the Congress is not in session at the time of the transmittal of a special message, the 45 -day period begins the f irst day the Congress convenes. If the second session of a Congress adjourns sine die before the expiration of the 45 days, the special message is considered retransmitted on the first day of the succeeding Congress and the 45- day period begins the follow ing day. If either House recesses during a session for more than three days to a day certain, the number of days in recess is excluded from the counting period. OMB, in consultation with GAO, will determine the day for the release of each proposed rescission and will notify agencies when funds should be released. 112.16 What apportionment action is required when a deferral is disapproved? When legislation is enacted that disapprove s of an Executive Branch deferral, you must take prompt action to ensure t he release of the affected amounts. If funds have been deferred through the apportionment SECTION 112 \u2014DEFERRALS AND PRESIDENTIAL PROPOSALS TO RESCIND OR CANCEL FUNDS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 7 of Section 112 process, submit an apportionment request to OMB, reflecting release of amounts previously deferred not later than the day following enactment of the legislation. 112.17 How do I treat proposals to rescind budget authority that is also subject to a limitation in a trust or revolving funds? A Presidential rescission proposal under Title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is a proposal to rescind budget authority. Statutory limitations on the availability of trust or revolving funds are a mechanism to control funds that would otherwise be available for obligation under broad authority. The limitations are generally not the source of authority to incur obligations; rather, they place a ceiling on the use of a portion of the obligational authority by limiting the amount that can be obligated or committed for a specific purpose or time. Generally, amounts in trust or revolving funds are multi-year or do not expire. Careful programmatic and legal analyses of the account, the limitation, and the basic legislation authorizing the program are required. 112.18 What information is included on the different lines of the rescission, deferral, and supplementary reports? Rescission, deferral, and supplementary reports are prepared using the entries below as a guide. (Examples of these reports are illustrated in exhibits 112A and 112C .) Entry Description Rescission proposal no. ................... A number (RC Y-XX) is used to identify each proposed rescission. OMB will assign a serial number to distinguish between individual reports. In a revised rescission report, an \"A\" will be added to the OMB - assigned serial number (XX) of the initial rescission proposal to indicate the first revision, a \"B\" to indicate the second revision, etc. Deferral no. .............................. .. A number (DCY -XX) is used to identify each deferral. OMB will assign a serial number to distinguish between individual deferrals. In a rev ised deferral report, an \"A\" will be added to the OMB -assigned serial number (XX) of the initial deferral to indicate the first revision, a \"B\" to indicate the second revision, etc. Agency .................................... .. The name of the department or agency for which the rescission is proposed or the deferral action is taken. Bureau ....................................... The name of the subordinate organization as shown in the most recent Budget. Account ................................... ... The title of the appropriation or fund account from which the funds are being proposed for rescission or are being deferred. Also include the Treasury account symbol(s) to indicate the coverage of the report, and the affected Treasury Account Fund Symbols (TA FS). Enter the account symbols: For the accounts affected by the resciss ion proposal or deferral; or SECTION 112 \u2014DEFERRALS AND PRESIDENTIAL PROPOSALS TO RESCIND OR CANCEL FUNDS Page 8 of Section 112 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Entry Description For all accounts that are included under the appropriation title\u2014not just those subject to the proposed rescission or deferral. If the account affected by the proposed rescission or deferral is merged in the Budget, footnote this line as follows: \"Includes all accounts included under this appropriation title.\" New budget authority ...................... You may be requested to provide the amount of new budget authority specified in appropriation or substantive acts available in th e current year for the accounts covered by the rescission or deferral report. If so, this amount should equal the sum of new budget authority shown on lines 1100- 1105, 1170- 1171, 1200 -1204, 1270, 1271, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700 and 1800 of the latest a pportionment in exact dollars. For deferrals and proposed rescissions that are transmitted on the same day (or shortly thereafter) as the Budget, amounts should agree with the amounts printed in the Appendix . Thus, if accounts with amounts deferred or pr oposed for rescission are combined (or merged) with other accounts in the Appendix , the budgetary resources on the deferral or rescission report will agree with the combined (or merged) account in the Appendix , even if some of the combined accounts have no deferral or proposed rescission. Express amounts in dollars (per the latest apportionment). Other budgetary resources ............... You may be requested to provide the amount of other budgetary resources. This amount is equal to the amount on line 1920 minus t he sum of lines 1100 -1105, 1170- 1171, 1200 -1204, 1270, 1271, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700 and 1800 on the latest apportionment. Total budgetary resources ................ You may be requested to provide the total amount of budgetary resources. This should equal the amount on line 1920 of the latest apportionment. Amount proposed for rescission ......... Provide the amount of budgetary resources proposed for rescission. Proposed appropriations language ...... Include proposed appropriations language (double -spaced and underlined) for rescission proposals. Amount to be deferred .................. ... For deferral reports, provide the amount of budgetary resources to be deferred, as follows: Part of year .............................. Entire year ............................... Report the amount to be deferred for part of the current year. Because you may not defer funds past the time that the funds would expire, you must report a part -year deferral when amounts to be deferred would expire at the end of the year (annual accounts and the last year of multiple -year accounts). Report the amount to be deferred for the entire current year. Use only when the funds remain available beyond the end of the fiscal year. Justification ................................. Provide a justification that briefly descri bes: The activities funded by the account. The rationale for the deferral or the proposed rescission and the consequences of not expending the funds. The authority for withholding the funds. SECTION 112 \u2014DEFERRALS AND PRESIDENTIAL PROPOSALS TO RESCIND OR CANCEL FUNDS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 9 of Section 112 Entry Description Any legal authority in addition to sections 1012 and 1013 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 683 -684) for a rescission proposal or deferral. Whether a rescission proposal or a deferral action is taken pursuant to the Antideficiency Act. Since these reports are transmitted by the President to the Congress, they should be written in a clear, concise, and logical manner so that those who are not familiar with the program will be able to understand the proposal. Estimated programmatic effect .......... When there is a program effect, include a brief, clear statement of the expected effect in the Justification. Effect on outlays ........................... Provide information on the outlay impact of the proposed rescission or deferral in the Justification. Most deferrals will have no outlay savings. Only show outlay savings for deferrals in special circumstances, as provided by OMB. Footnotes .................................... Footnotes will be used as needed, including possible citation of any past or current year rescission proposals or deferrals affecting the same account. A revised rescission or deferral report may indicate all sections containing changes from the initial report with an asterisk (*) and a footnote: \"*Revised from previous report.\" Subsequent revisions to a report will also indicate changes from the previous report with the specified footnotes, as needed. When more than one Treasury account is aff ected by a proposed rescission or deferral, OMB may require that detail on budgetary resources and changes be supplied at the Treasury account level. SECTION 112 \u2014DEFERRALS AND PRESIDENTIAL PROPOSALS TO RESCIND OR CANCEL FUNDS Page 10 of Section 112 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) 112.19 How do I reflect the deferral or the proposed rescission on the apportionment?

RCY-XX PROPOSED RESCISSION OF BUDGET AUTHORITY Report Pursuant to Sect ion 1012 of the Congressional Budg et and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 683) Agency: DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT Bureau: Bureau of Statistics Salaries and expenses (080-0200 20AA/20BB) New budget budgetary resources: proposed for rescission: $223,000 Proposed rescission appropriations language: Of the funds made available under this head ing in Public Law XXX-XXX, $223,000 are rescinded. Justification: The proposal would rescind $223,000, thereby reducing the amount generally available in the Bureau of Statistics. The Bu reau conducts research to provide the means for a safer, more economical supply of office supply pr oducts for the Nation and to provide producers with technologies to supply these products competitively. The proposed rescission is possible because applications for research efforts have falle n drastically from expected levels. Federal outlays will decrease by the amount of the proposed rescission. The 20AA/20BB represents the period of availability and therefore should be changed. Change 20AA to the initial year of availability. Change 20BB to the ending year of availability. For example, for FY2018 annual funds, use (080-0200 2018/2018). For FY2017 two year funds, use (080-0200 2017/2018). For no-year funds, replace 20AA/20BB with /X (i.e., 080-0200 /X). Each proposal must include the requirements of section 1012(a)(1) through (5) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which includes information on the fiscal, economic, budgetary, any estimated programmatic effect, and other related information about a rescission proposal. OMB will provide guidance on meeting these requirements.

The President is authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to furnish assistance to countries and organiza tions, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, in order to promote economic or po litical stability. Section 531(b) of the Act makes the Secretary of Government, in cooperation with the Administrator of the Bureau of Statistics, responsible for policy decisions and justifica tions for economic support programs, including whether to provide an economic support program for a country and the amount of the program for each country. These funds have been deferred pending the deve lopment of country-specific plans that assure that aid is provided in an efficient manner and ar e reserved for unanticipated program needs. This action is taken pursuant to the An tideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1512). Each proposal must include the requirements of section 1013(a)(1) through (6) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which includes information on the fiscal, economic, budgetary, any estimated programmatic effect, and other related information about a deferral.

(a) Overview. You may only invest funds in securities if you are authorized to do so by law. Authorizing laws usually specify investment in Federal securities; they r arely authorize investment in non-Federal securities (see the definitions below). The budget treatment of investment in non-Federal securities, described in subsection (c), differs from that of Federal securities, described in subsection (d). The guidance in this section regarding purchase premiums and discounts does not apply to the Treasury Department's purchases of marketable Treasury securities from the public prior to their maturity (often referred to as \"debt buybacks\"). The budget records buyback premiums and discounts as means of financing a surplus or deficit, rather than as outlays or offsetting collections or receipts. The buyback premium or discount is the difference between the purchase price of a security and its book value. The book value can be expected to differ from the par value (face value) of the security. SECTION 113 \u2014INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS Page 2 of Section 113 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (b) Special terms for investment defined. (1) Accrued interest purchase means payments to the seller of a security, when a secur ity is purchased, for interest that has accrued to the seller but that will be paid to the purchaser. (2) Amortization means to record a portion of any purchase discount or purchase premium in each reporting period over the life of a security, or it means the amount so recorded. (3) Book value means the par value of a security minus the amount of any unamortized discounts or plus the amount of any unamortized premiums. (4) Earnings refer collectively to some or all of these components: interest, accrued interest purchases, the amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, and sales gains and losses. (5) Federal securities consist of securities issued by Federal agencies, including nonmarketable par value Treasury securities, market -based Treasury securities, marketable Treasury securities, and securities issued by other Federal agencies. This includes investments in Federal securities through the secondary market by Federal agencies. (Compare this to non-Federal securities.) (6) Interest means the nominal interest or stated amount of interest received on a security. (7) Marketable Treasury securities, including Treasury bills, notes, bonds, and Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities (TIPS ), are types of securities that Treasury initially issues by sale to the marketplace and that can be bought and sold on securities exchange markets. (8) Market -based Treasury securities are special series debt securities that the U.S. Treasury issues to Federal entities without statutorily determined interest rates. These securities are not offered to the marketplace and cannot be bought and sold on exchange markets, but Treasury sets their terms (prices and interest rates) to mirror the terms of marketable Treasury securities. Because they mirror market terms, the purchase price may reflect a premium or discount. (9) Net value, for the purpose of budget schedules, means the par value of a security reduced by the amount of any purchase discount on a cash basis. This definition differs from the definition of \"Treasury securities, net\" as reported in balance sheets under section 86.2 (see Differences between amounts recorded in budget schedules and financial statements in subsection (d)). (10) Nonmarketable par value Treasury securities are special series debt securities that the U.S. Treasury issues to Federal entities at par value. These securities are not offered to the marketplace and cannot be bought and sold on exchange markets. As required by the authorizing laws, Treasury sets the interest rate on such securities taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable Treasury securities of specified maturity. Because these securities are sold at par value, there is no purchase premium or discount. (11) Non-Federal securities consist of securities issued by a non -Federal entity, including State and local governments, private corporations, and Government-sponsored enterprises, regardless of whether the securities are federally guaranteed. This includes investments by Federal agencies in money market as well as mutual funds, even if the money market or mutual fund's assets consist entirely of Federal securities. SECTION 113 \u2014INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 113 (12) Par value is the amount of principal a security pays at maturity. It is the amount printed on the face of a Treasury security, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the face value, or the equivalent book-entry amount. (13) Purchase discount means the excess of a security's par value over its purchase price. (14) Purchase premium means the excess of a security's purchase price over its par value. (15) Sales gain means the excess of the sales price over the purchase price of the security. (16) Sales loss means the excess of the purchase price over the sales price at the time of the sale. (c) Non-Federal securities. The budget treats an investment in a non -Federal security (equity or debt security) as a purchase of an asset, recording an obligation and an outlay in an amount equal to the purchase price in the year of the purchase. You cannot incur such an obligation unless budget authority (or unobligated balances of budget authority) is available for the purpose. If a law clearly requires such investment without requiring further action by the Congress, we will generally construe that law as providing budget authority for the purpose. Investment in non-Federal securities consumes budgetary resources, unlike investment in Federal securities. The purchase of non-Federal securities using unobligated balances reduces the balances. The balance doesn't include the value of non-Federal securities because the funds have been spent for the purchase of the assets. When such securities are sold or redeemed at maturity, the budget records the proceeds as offsetting collections or receipts, which adds to the balances of the account. You record interest and other earnings on such investments as described for earnings on Federal securities in the next subsection, except that you must account for such earnings separately from earnings on investments in Federal securities. You record earnings credited to a general fund appropriation account or revolving fund account as offsetting collections on line 4033 or 4123, Non-Federal sources, of the program and financing statement. You record earnings credited to a special or trust fund account as proprietary receipts in a separate receipt account for this purpose. In a few cases, the budgetary treatments described in this subsection are superseded by statutory accounting r equirements. For example, the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) accounts for the government's issuance of a direct loan (as defined in that Act), which is conceptually similar to the acquisition of a private debt security, on a present-value rather than a cash basis. Also see section 185, Federal Credit. Some other statutes, such as those governing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, prescribe accou nting akin to that in FCRA for the acquisition by those programs of non-F ederal equity, debt, or analogous securities. T he Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) provides guidance to agencies for the accounting and reporting of cash not deposited in a Treasury General Account and investments in non -Federal securities. Chapter 3400 provides guidance on cash and investments held outside of the U.S. Treasury as they relate to budgetary funds and non-budgetary funds under the Federal Government's custodial responsibility. An electronic version of the TFM chapter can be found at: http://tfm.fiscal.treasury.gov/v1/p2/c340.html SECTION 113 \u2014INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS Page 4 of Section 113 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) In addition to the Treasury guidance, please contact your OMB representative to establish the appropriate receipt accounts, where necessary, to properly report the non -Federal investment activity. Receipt accounts may include, but are not limited to, the following: Interest and dividends on non-Federal securities; Realized gains o n non-Federal securities; and Proceeds from non-Federal securities not immediately reinvested. (d) Federal securities. Because Federal securities are the equivalent of cash for budget purposes, we treat investment in them as a change in the mix of assets held, rather than as a purchase of assets. The following bullets describe the treatment in general terms, and the following table explains how to record specific transactions in the budget. The purchase, sale, or redemption of an asset, or the earnings in a year, may combine several transactions. Principal. The investment reduces the cash balances by the purchase price and increases balances of Federal securities. How you report balances of Federal securities depends on which budget schedule you are working with. Special and trust fund receipts schedule (schedule N). This schedule doesn't divide the unavailable balances into cash and Federal securities. It presents the balances as a single amount (unless the balances are divided for other reasons). The amount equals the uninvested cash balance, plus the net value (as defined in subsection (b)) of Federal securities held. MAX A-11 DE generates schedule N automatically. (See section 86.4.) Program and financing schedule (schedule P ). This schedule doesn't divide balances (unobligated or obligated balances) into cash and Federal securities. It presents the balances as a single amount (unless the balances are divided for other reasons). The amount equals the uninvested cash balance, plus the net value (as defined in subsection (b)) of Federal securities held. Enter the end of year unobligated and obligate d balances in MAX A-11 DE as you would normally. In addition, you must enter memorandum entries for total investments at par value at the start and end of each year. MAX A-11 DE copies the CY and BY start of year amounts from the end of year amounts reported on line 5001 for the previous year. (See section 82.18.) Status of funds schedule (schedule J ). We require this schedule for certain accounts listed by agency in section 86.3 . For unexpended balances at the start of the year, the schedule presents one amount. For unexpended balances at the end of the year, the uninvested amount plus unrealized discounts on shown on line 4100 and a separate amount for the Federal securities at par value on line 4200. The OMB budget database generates schedule J automatically. ( See section 86.3.) Earnings. You record all earnings as net interest. Some components may be positive (such as interest and realized purchase discounts) and others negative (such as accrued interest purchases and purchase premiums). Record each component as an increase or decrease in the net interest for the year in which the transaction occurs. For investments from a general fund appropriation account or revolving fund account (including a trust revolving fund account), record interest as an offsetting collection credited to the account (line 4031or 4121 Interest on Federal securities) of the schedule P. For investments from a special or trust fund account (non -revolving), record interest in a receipt account for interest (usually one ending with the suffix .20). The Status of Funds schedule, if one is required for the account, records earnings on lines that correspond to the entries for offsetting collections in the schedule P or the receipts credited to receipt accounts, as appropriate. Interest SECTION 113 \u2014INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 113 earned on invest ments in Federal securities are, by their nature, an intergovernmental payment from Treasury to the receiving account and do not increase the overall budgetary resources of the Government. We may specify an alternative treatment for certain accounts where these rules may result in significant distortions of amounts presented in the budget. The following table lists the transactions associated with investments in Federal securities in the first column and explains how to record them in the budget schedules in columns 2 through 4. Please note these features of the table: The second column contains instructions for recording transactions in the schedule P. The instructions for recording principal transactions apply to all accounts investing or disinvesting in securities. The instructions for recording earnings apply only to investments from general fund appropriation accounts or revolving fund accounts (including trust revolving funds). The third column contains instructions for recording earnings in special and trust fund (except trust revolving fund) receipt accounts for interest. The fourth column contains instructions for recording transactions \u2014both principal transactions and earnings transactions\u2014in the Status of Funds schedule required for certain accounts listed in section 86.3. Although the instructions on balances specify end of year balances, they apply equally to start of year balances, because end of year balances are carried forward and become the start of year balances for the next year. MAX A-11 DE automatically generates the start of year balances in the Unavailable Collections schedule (schedule N), the Program and Financing schedule (schedule P), and the Status of Funds schedule (schedule J). A negative sign \"(- )\" at the end of a stub label means that you normally report negative amounts on this line. A direction to increase the amount reported means you should report a larger negative amount, and a direction to decrease the amount means you should report a smaller negative amount. The absence of a sign means you normally report positive amounts on this line. It is possible for negative earnings (such as a sales loss) for an account for a year to produce a positive amount for offsetting collections, or a negative amount for receipts, if the amounts reported for other transactions during the year are not sufficient to offset the negative earnings.

Differences between amounts recorded in budget schedules and financial statements. Purchase discounts. Budget schedules record them when the security matures. In most cases, financial statements amortize them over the term of the security. Purchase premiums. Budget schedules record them at purchase. In most cases, financial statements amortize them over the term of the security. SECTION 113 \u2014INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS Page 8 of Section 113 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Net value. For budget schedules, the term means the par value of a security minus the amount of any purchase discount on a cash basis. Do not confuse it with the term Treasury securities, net used in financial statements, which means the par value of a security min us the amount of any unamortized discounts or plus the amount of any unamortized premiums. Signs. Earnings reported as offsetting collections in the program and financing schedule carry the opposite sign from income reported in financial statements. In the program and financing statement, increases in income are reported as negative amounts and decreases are reported as positive amounts. Differences between amounts recorded by Treasury and the budget. You will encounter differences between Treasury records and the budget if a law authorizes you to invest special or trust funds in Federal securities but requires appropriations acts to determine the amount of receipts available to incur obligations. Treasury treats the authority to invest the receipts as an appropriation, recording the receipts as appropriated in the year received and subsequently as unexpended balances of appropriations (combined unobligated and obligated balances). Since such appropriations do not provide budget authority, do not record budget authority in the program and financing schedule. The OMB budget database will report these amounts, along with the other amounts reported as special and trust fund receipts, in the special schedule required under section 86.4 (without separate identification for the invested portion of the balances). 113.2 How do I treat an investment in a Federal security other than a zero coupon bond and a Treasury Inflation-Protected Security on an SF 133 ? If you purchase a Federal security at a discount , the total bala nces on the SF 133 should not change. See exhibit 113A for all accounts. See section 130 for a discussion of the SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources. If you purchase a Federal security at a premium: For a general fund appropriation account or a revolving fund (including a trust revolving fund), you reduce the collections on line 1700 or 1800 by the premium, i.e., the amount greater than par, or accrued interest. However, the amount recorded as a negative amount on line 1700 or 1800 must never result in an amount of less than zero on lines 1910 and 1920. See exhibit 113B . For a special or trust fund account (excluding a trust revolving fund), normally there will be no change on the SF 133 because the amount is only available for investment, but there will be a reduction in the special or trust fund receipt account. However, it is important to understand the budgetary and programmatic impacts of purchasing a Federal security other than a zero coupon w ith a premium or accrued interest. If you have a special or trust fund account (excluding a trust revolving fund) where only the interest and earnings are available for obligation, there will be a reduction in the special or trust receipt account that will then be shown as a reduction to an appropriation on line 1101 or 1201. However, the amount recorded as a negative amount on line 1101 or 1201 must never result in an amount of less than zero on lines 1910 and 1920. The SF 132 should also be consistent with the appropriate budgetary treatment. SECTION 113 \u2014INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 113 113.3 How do I treat the redemption of a Federal security other than a zero coupon bond and a Treasury Inflation -Protected Security on an SF 133 ? If the purchase was at a discount and if the redemption is at par : For a general fund appropriation account or a revolving fund (including a trust revolving fund), you show the discount realized on line 1700 or 1800. See exhibit 113C . For a special or trust fund account (excluding a trust revolving fund), you will show the discount realized when the amount is appropriated out of the special or trust fund receipt account. See exhibit 113D . If the purchase was at a premium, the total balances on the SF 133 should not change. 113.4 How do I treat investments in securities issued by non -Federal entities on an SF 133 ? Treat investment in non-Federal securities (equity or debt securities) as the purchase of an asset. You must record an obligation and an outlay for the purchase in an amount equal to the purchase price. 113.5 How do I treat an invest ment in a zero coupon bond on an SF 133 ? If you purchase a zero coupon bond at a discount , the total balances on the SF 133 should change. At the time the bond is purchased, record an amount equal to the purchase price (par value minus purchase discount) as precluded from obligation. As the discount is amortized and recorded as earnings, record the earnings as precluded from obligation. See A ppendix F and section 82.18 for treatment of investments in zero coupon bonds. 113.6 How do I treat the redemption of a zero coupon bond on an SF 133 ? When the bond matures or is redeemed, all amounts previously precluded from obligation become available for obligation. 113.7 How do I treat an investment in a Treasury Inflation -Protected Security on an SF 133 ? If you purchase a TIPS at a discount , the total balances on the SF 133 should not change. Compared to the typical Federal securities, the purchase price will be the par value minus the discount , plus accrued interest and inflation compensation. The principal (par value) plus inflation/deflation compensation is generally referred to as \"inflated/deflated par.\" If you purchase a TIPS at a premium : For a general fund account or revolving fund (including a trust revolving fund), you reduce the collections on line 1700 or 1800 by the premium, i.e., the amount greater than par, or accrued interest. However, the amount recorded as a negative amount on line 1700 or 1800 must never result in an amount of less than zero on lines 1910 and 1920. For a special or trust fund account (excluding a trust revolving fund), normally there will be no change on the SF 133 because the amount is only available for investment, but there will be a reduction in the special or trust fund receipt account. However, it is important to understand the budgetary and programmatic impacts of purchasing a Federal security other than a zero coupon with a premium or accrued interest. If you have a special or trust fund account (excluding a trust SECTION 113 \u2014INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS Page 10 of Section 113 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) revolving fund) where only the interest and earnings are available for obligation, there will be a reduction in the special or trust receipt account that will then be shown as a reduction to an appropriation on line 1101 or 1201. However, the amount recorded as a negative amount on line 1101 or 1201 must never result in an amount of less than zero on lines 1910 and 1920. The SF 132 shoul d also be consistent with the appropriate budgetary treatment. 113.8 How do I treat the daily inflation/deflation compensation of a Treasury Inflation -Protected Security on an SF 133 ? As daily inflation or deflation compensation is calculated, you show the amount on: line 1700 or 1800 by the inflation(+)/deflation( -) compensation amount and then preclude the amount on line 1724 or 1824 respectively for a general fund account or revolving fund (including a trust fund). line 1101 or 1201 by the inflation(+)/deflation( -) compensation amount and then preclude the amount on line 1135 or 1235 respectively for a special or trust fund account (excluding a trust revolving fund). 113.9 How do I treat the redemption of a Treasury Inflation -Protected Security on an SF 133 ? If the purchase was at a discount and if the redemption is at par : For a general fund appropriation account or a revolving fund (including a trust revolving fund), you show the discount realized on line 1700 or 1800. For a special or trust fund account (excluding a trust revolving fund), you will show the discount realized when the amount is appropriated out of the special or trust fund receipt account. If the purchase was either at a discount or premium and if the redemption is at \" inflated par \" or \"deflated par\": For a general fund appropriation account or a revolving fund (including a trust revolving fund), you show the discount realized on line 170 2 or 1802 in accordance with the statutory terms of that appropriations account . For a special or trust fund account (excluding a trust revolving fund), you show the discount re alized on line 1103 or 1203 in accordance with the statutory terms of that appropriations account . 113.10 What steps do I take if I overinvested in Federal securities? Step 1. If not already established, you must submit a written request to Treasury Fiscal Service Budget and Appropriation Analysis Section (BAAS) group ( baasgroup@fiscal.treasury.gov ) t o establish TAS [AID] -3250 \"Earnings on Federal Investments Unavailable to Agencies and Returned to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury.\" Step 2. Treasury Fiscal Service BAAS ( baasgroup@fiscal.treasury.gov ) will confirm th e establishment of TAS (general fund receipt account) to you. Step 3. Treasury Fiscal Service Federal Investments and Borrowings Branch (FedInvestor@fiscal.treasury.gov ) a nd you will agree upon the amount of interest that should not be retained by the agency. SECTION 113 \u2014INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 11 of Section 113 Step 4. If required to (re)apportion, show a negative amount on SF 133/Schedule P 1152, 1252, 1742 or 1842 depending on whether the source is classified as discretionary or mandatory, and is der ived from appropriations or spending authority from offsetting collections. Step 5. You will submit and record (once approved and processed by Fiscal Service) a capital transfer (i.e., nonexpenditure transfer) for the amount identified in step 3 above to r eturn the amount to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. Step 6. Once processed, you will reclassify the negative amount to SF 133/Schedule P 1140, 1240, 1720 or 1820 depending on whether the source is classified as discretionary or mandatory, and is derived from appropriations or spending authority from offsetting collections.

Removes the requirement to have a separate allocation worksheet if you are using allocations in an apportionment and former e xhibit 120S, \"Allocation Accounts\". 120S - 120V ). Updates when a reapportionment is necessary in order to adjust amount s apportioned in Category C (section 120.49). Clarifies that the apportionment authority provided in section 120.49, which allows certain apportionment amounts to be adjusted without submitting a reapportionment, applies to upward adjustments when OMB apportions funds for two or more categories on the same apportionment and does not affect downward adjustments (section 120.49). Adds guidance that an apportionment is not required to send funds back to Treasury (section 1 20.49). INT RODUCTION TO APPORTIONMENTS 120.1 What is an apportionment? An apportionment is an OMB-approved plan to use budgetary resources (31 U.S.C. 1513(b); Executive Order (E.O.) 6166, as amended by E.O. 12608). It typically limits the obligations you may incur for specified time periods, programs, activities, projects, objects, or any combination thereof. An apportionment is legally binding, and obligations and expenditures (disbursements) that exceed an SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 120 apportionment are a violation of, and are subject to reporting under, the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1517(a)(1), (b)). See section 145 for more on reporting violations of the Antideficiency Act. 120.2 What terms and concepts should I understand to work with apportionments? Account -sp ecific ap portionments are approved by an OMB Deputy Associate Director (or designee) or a n OMB official that has been delegated apportionment authority and typically include specific amounts. They are in contrast to automatic apportionments, described below. A Tr easury Appropriation Fund Symbol (TAFS) has adj ustment authority if OMB has approved an apportionment with a footnote in the Application of Budgetary Resources section (footnote indicator that starts with A) describing what new or additional resources are automatically apportioned without the need for OMB to approve a new apportionment and a YES is in the Line Split column of the adjustment authority line (AdjAut). For instance, OMB may provide adjustment authority for cases where actual earned reimburseme nts exceed the estimate on the apportionment. For more on adjustment authority, see sections 120.49 and 12 0.50. The Antideficiency Act pr ohibits Federal employees from obligating or disbursing amounts in excess of an appropriation, an apportionment (or in its absence), an allotment, a suballotment or any other subdivisions of funds that are identified in your agency's administrative control of funds. For more on the Antideficienc y Act, see section 145 . An amount is apportioned fo r obligation in the current fiscal year when it appears on the Category A, Category B, or Category AB lines. Amounts apportioned for obligation in future fiscal years appear on the Category C lines. The Application of Budgetary Resources section also includes lines for amounts that are exempt from apportionment or not apportioned for either current or future fiscal years. An automatic apportionment i s approved by the OMB Director in the form of a Bulletin or provision in Circular A-11, and typically describes a formula that agencies will use to calculate apportioned amounts. An automatic apportionment is in contrast to the account -specific apportionments, described above, which typically include specific amounts, and which are approved by an OMB Deputy Associate Director (or designee) or an OMB official that has been delegated apportionment authority. Carryover amounts are u nobligated balances that are available from the prior fiscal year(s) in multi -year and no- year accounts. See section 120.2 3 regarding the submission, for OMB approval, of requests for the apportionment of carryover amounts. Pursuant to sections 120.7 and 120 .56, carryover amounts are automatically apportioned at zero until an account -specific apportionment is issued for such amounts. Category A, Category B, Category AB or Category C \u2014A pportioned amounts appear on different groups of lines in the A pplication of Budgetary Resources section of an apportionment. Amounts are identified in an apportionment : by time (Category A) ; by program, project, or activity (Category B) ; by a combination of program, project, or activity and time period (Category AB) ; or for future years (only for multi -year/no -year accounts) (Category C). You must report obligations to Treasury with the same categories as used on the apportionment. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 6 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Exception apportionment is a colloquial term that describes a type of account -specific apportionment that can be issued for operations under a continuing resolution (CR), in lieu of the OMB -issued automatic apportionment. This excludes account -specific written apportionments for an anomaly provided in the CR. OMB approves exception apporti onment requests only in extraordinary circumstances. See section 123.9 for additional guidance. Footnotes provide additional information and direction beyond the line stubs and dollar amounts. See section 120.34 for more information. Impoundment \u2014Pursua nt to the Impoundment Control Act, apportionments may also set aside all or a portion of the amounts available for obligation. Amounts deferred through the apportionment process are those portions of the total amounts available for obligation that are s pecifically set aside as temporarily not available until released by OMB. Amounts withheld pending rescission are those portions that are set aside pending the enactment of legislation reducing the authority to obligate such funds. For further informat ion on deferrals and rescissions, including the difference between an impoundment and a cancellation proposed by the President, see section 112. The line split column allows you to provide information about a line or to distinguish between two or more budgetary resource amounts that you would otherwise put on a single line. For more details on line splits, see section 120.19. Memo obligations are amounts obligated during the current fiscal year at the time the apportionment request is prepared. The dat e of the obligations is at the top of the column. Program reporting category\u2014Agencies and OMB will work together to determine the program reporting categories (if any, section 120.67 ) under which the agencies will report their obligations in their SF 133 Reports on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (see section 130 ). Program reporting categories should be based on elements that agencies track in their financial systems. Thoug h you are encouraged to use program reporting categories, there are some cases where OMB and agencies will choose not to use any. The program reporting categories are not used to apportion funds and are not subject to the Antideficiency Act ( Appendix G ). Reapportionments are made when you need to make changes to the previously approved apportionment for the current year (section 120.48). For example, you should request a reapportionment when approved apportionments are no longer appropriate or applicable because the amounts available for obligation have increased or unforeseen events have occurred. The Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol (TAFS) combines the Treasury agency or department code, the Federal account symbol, and the period of availability of t he resources in the account (section 20.3). The period of availability may be annual, multi -year, or no -year (section 20.4(c) ). Annual TAFSs have funds that are available for obligation for no longer than one fiscal year. Multi -year TAFSs have funds that are available for a specified period of time in excess of one fiscal year. No -year TAFSs have funds that are available until expended. See section 20.4 for more details. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 120 The Department of the Treasury's list of account symbols may be found here: http://fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/fastbook/fastbook_home.htm . 120.3 Are apportionments made at the Treasury appropriation fund symbol (TAFS) level? Yes, apportionments are only made at the TAFS level. See section 20.11 f or more details on TAFSs. For cases of allocation transfers, see section 120.29 . 120.4 What TAFSs are required to be apportioned? All TAFSs are required to be apportio n ed, except in the case of a TAFS that is in its entirety exempt from apportionment. See section 120.6 for a TAFS that is partially exempt from apportionment. OMB is required to post all approved apportionment documents on a public website. Those apportionments can be found here: https://apportionment following types of TAFSs are exempt from apportionment: TAFSs specifically exempted from apportionment by 31 U.S.C. 1511(b) o r other laws. TAFSs for which budgetary resources: have expired and therefore the expired TAFS cannot be reapportioned in the expired phase (in this case, the last apportionment during the unexpired phase applies); have been fully obligated before the beginning of the fiscal year ; or are available only for transfer to other TAFSs (unless OMB determines otherwise), which can include TAFSs where the sole purpose of the TAFSs is to effectuate an expenditure transfer between fund types (e.g., between Federal funds and trust funds) (see below for additional information). Because transfer -only TAFSs that require expenditure transfers (due to crossing Federal fund group to a trust fund) involve an obligation, you must request a letter from your OMB Deputy Associate Director for proper funds control documentation that the TAFS is exempt from apportionment because the funds are available only for transfer to other TAFSs. TAFSs of the following types, which the OMB Director may exempt from apportionment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1516 : Trust funds or working funds if an expenditure from the fund has no significant effect on the financial operations of the United States Government; Management funds (Treasury TAFSs with the symbols 3900- 3999) ; Payment of claims, judgments, refunds, and drawbacks; Payment under private relief acts and other laws that require payment to a designated payee in the total amount provided in such acts; SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 8 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Foreign currency fund TAFSs (unless OMB requests), section 120.63 ; Interest on, or retirement of, the public debt; and Items the President has determined to be of a confidential nature for apportionment and budget execution purposes. In order to request that the OMB Director exempt a TAFS from apportionment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1516, you must send in a formal request with the justification. Your OMB Deputy Associate Director (DAD) or an OMB official that has been delegated apportionm ent authority will formally notify you in writing about your exemption request. Memoranda that the DAD or delegated official provides to the agency providing an exemption will also be posted within the apportionment system. If your exemption request is pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1516 and specifically for a trust fund or working funds with expenditures that do not have significant effect on the financial operations of the United States Government, your request needs to demonstrate that fact using historical information such as the magnitude of the gifts and donations funding compared to the overall size of the agency 's budget, the pattern of obligations in that fund, etc. To see a list of TAFSs that are exempt from apportionment, a report is available through t he apportionment system. 120.6 Can a portion of my TAFS be exempt from apportionment? Yes, in a very limited number of cases, only a portion of the budgetary resources for a TAFS must be apportioned. In these cases, agencies must show the full amount of budgetary resources \u2014both exempt from apportionment and non-exempt \u2014in the Budgetary Resources section and show the amounts subject to apportionment on apportioned lines , and the amounts not subject to apportionment on Line 6183, Exempt from apportionment in the Application of Budgetary Resources section . 120.7 Do I need to submit an apportionment every fiscal year for TAFSs that are multi -year/no - year? Yes. Multi -year/no -year TAFSs with unexpired budgetary resources available for obligation MUST be appor tioned every fiscal year, unless exempt under section 120.5. See also section 120.56 . 120.8 Can I incur obligations without an apportionment? No, an obligation cannot be incurred without an OMB approved apportionment (account - specific or automatic), except when the relevant account, from which the amounts are being obligated, is exempt from apportionment. The Antideficiency Act (section 145) prohibits the incurring of obligations that exceed the approved apportionment amount (including, e.g., purchase services or merchandise). See section 145 fo r specifics on the Antideficiency Act. 120.9 Ca n I u se an apportionment to resolve legal issues about the availability of funds? No. The apportionment of funds is not a means for resolving any question dealing with the legality of the amounts available by law or the legality of using funds for the purpose for which they are apportioned. Any question as to the legality of the amounts available by law, or the legality of using funds for a particular purpose, must be resolved through agency legal channels. Importantly, OMB' s approval of an apportionment request does not reflect OMB's concurrence with an agency 's legal position. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 120 WHAT IS IN AN APPORTIONMENT? 120.10 How is the apportionment organized? The top of the apportionment shows the name and account number of the TAFS being apportioned, and often includes other descriptive information, e.g., agency name, bureau name, budget account name and number. The apportionment always includes two sections: Budgetary Resources and Application of Budgetary Resources. The Budgetary Resources section always appears toward the top of the apportionment, and must show all budgetary resources available to the TAFS ( e.g., appropriations, reductions, non-expenditure transfers). The Application of Budgetary Resources shows apportioned amounts, which are legal limits that restrict how much an agency can obligate, when it can obligate, and what projects, programs, and activities it can obligate for. Apportionments for guaranteed loan accounts include a third section, Guaranteed Loan Levels and Applications. Each section of an apportionment includes line numbers and descriptions of all pertinent amounts. See Appendix F1 for a complete list of line numbers and detail descriptions for each line. 120.11 Why is the Budgetary Resources section needed? The Budgetary Resources section is necessary for several reasons. First, it provides sufficient detail for OMB to see what level of funding is coming into the TAFS and therefore available to be apportio ned. In many cases, apportioned amounts tie back to amounts on specific budgetary resource lines. Second, budgetary resource lines on apportionments match the lines used in the President's Budget Program and Financing schedule and SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources. The reason that these three presentations use the same line numbers is to facilitate comparisons that provide agencies and OMB with a basis to know they are looking at the right numbers. In addition, the Budget Enfor cement Act (BEA) category (i.e., discretionary or mandatory) information in this section is provided to the Treasury Department to facilitate agency reporting of BEA information in budget execution reports. Third, the apportionment is the first step in a fiscal year's budget execution process, and provides the basis for agencies to post information in their funds control and financial systems. 120.12 After OMB approves an apportionment, can I obligate against all budgetary resources? Not necessarily. You should not obligate until apportioned amounts have been allotted in accordance with your agency's OMB -approved funds control regulations (see section 150, Administrative Control of Funds). There are other circumstances in which you cannot obligate fu nds following an apportionment. For example, you cannot obligate against anticipated resources. You must wait until the resources are realized before incurring obligations. Additionally, in some cases, a footnote to the apportionment will state that amounts are apportioned, but are only available for obligation when specified events occur (such as an agency taking certain action). SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 10 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 120.13 What is the format of the Application of Budgetary Resources section and what categories does OMB use to apportion funds? OMB usually uses one of four categories to apportion budgetary resources in a TAFS. Category A a pportions budgetary resources by fiscal quarters, e.g., quarter one (October 1 through December 31) and quarter two (January 1 through March 31). Lines 6001 through 6004 are used for quarters one through four, respectively. Category B a pportions budgetary resources by program, project, activities, objects or a combination of these categories. Lines 6011 through 6110 are used for Category B apportioned amounts. One TAFS can potentially have dozens of Category B apportionments, each pertaining to specific activities, projects, and so on. There are also cases when it makes programmatic sense for OMB to use a single, Category B apportionment for a given T AFS. Category AB a pportions budgetary resources by a combination of fiscal quarters and projects. You may use Lines 6111 through 6159 to apportion in this manner . See section 8 of Appendix F for a full list of line number s and descriptions . Category C apportions budgetary resources in multi -year and no -year TAFSs into future fiscal years. Lines 6170 thru 6173 are used for Category C apportioned amounts. (Note: Category C amounts that OMB apportions in one year are not available for you to obligate against in the following year. For these amounts to be available, OMB must approve a new request in the following year that apportions these amounts on Category A, B, or AB lines.) See section 120.52 f or additional information. Apportionments may include a combination of categories. In some cases (uncommon), resources in the Budgetary Resources section are not apportioned. In such cases, the non -apportioned budgetary resources are shown using one of four apportionment lines \u2014 (1) 6180, Withheld pending rescission (rarely used), (2) 6181, Deferred (rarely used), (3) 6182, Unapportioned balance of a revolving fund, and (4) 6183, Exempt from apportionment (uncommon, and used in TAFSs with both budgetary resources subject to and exempt from apportionment \u2014 at the bottom of the section on the Application of Budgetary Resources). Agencies must report obligations to Treasury (GTAS) using the same level of specificity as appears on the apportioned section of your most recent approved apportionment. For instance, if OMB uses a single Category B project with five program reporting categories, you must report obligations for each program reporting category. Likewise, if OMB uses ten Category B projects and you incur obligations for each of these projects, your GTAS submission and SF 133 budget execution report must show obligations for each of these ten Category B projec ts and continue to report them in the expired phase. 120.14 What is the format of the Guaranteed Loan Levels and Applications section? An apportionment for guaranteed loan financing accounts can have a third section, Guaranteed Loan Levels and Applications section. This section shows limitations on loan levels by program level either from the current year and/or unused from prior year(s), and the application of the program level by quarter, risk SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A - 11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 120 category , or a combination . The tota l of the limitation o n loan levels by program level sho uld equal the total of t he application of t he pr ogram l evels. 120.15 What o ther kinds o f information may a n apportionment inc lude? Many ki nds of a dditional informatio n can be i ntegrated into an app ortionmen t request. Here a re some examples. Allocations . The allocations tab (if required by your RMO examiner) includes a list of all transfer allocation (or children) accounts that are expected to receive a non-expenditure tran sfer of funds from the parent TAFS being appo rtioned. The allocation accounts are subject to the Antideficiency Act . Unless OMB separately apportions an allocation account after apportioning the parent account, the allocation account must follow all apportioned amounts, footnotes, and other guidance of the p arent accoun t (see section 120.29 for more details). Footnotes . Footnotes appear on one of three tab s: \"Previously Appro ved Footnotes ,\" \"Agency Footnotes ,\" and \"OMB Footnotes.\" F ootnotes on the OMB Action column in the Application of Bu dgetary Resources section (footnote indicator starts with A) are subject to the Antideficiency Act. See section 120.34 for additional information on footnotes. Program Rep ortin g Categories . When used, these identify the level of detail that an agency must use in reporting its oblig ations on SF 133 budget execution reports. These appear on the PgmCat t ab in the apportionment request. These are not subject to the Antideficiency Act. See section 1 20.67 for additional information on p rogram reporting categories. System-g enerated reports . When agencies validate requests, the apportionment system sometimes creates reports showing latest SF 133 versus the apportio nment request; warrants; and non -expenditure transfers. These re ports are not subject to the Antideficiency Act. Additional tabs . Ap portionments are almost always prepared, submitted and approved in Excel files. Certain tabs in the Excel file house the apportionment request or footnotes. Others are reserved for other specific kinds of information. Agencies may also use additional tabs as attachments to the apportionment. Tabs in the Excel file are only subject to the Antideficiency Act if specifically referenced in a footnote in the OMB Action column of th e Ap plication of Budgetary Resources section of the ap portionment (s ee section 120.36). Attachments . Attachments may include Word, PDF, or Excel files with a wide range of information that pertains to the apportionment request, but that is not included in the Excel file containing the request. T hese attachments are subject to the Antideficiency Act only if they are specifically referenced in a footnote in the OMB Action column of th e Ap plication of Budgetary Resources section of the ap portionment (s ee section 120.36). PREPARING THE APPORTIONMENT REQUEST 120.16 How c an I s ubmit a n apportionment r equest? The vast majority of apportionmen ts are submitted by agencies and approved by OMB using OMB's secure, web-b ased apportionmen t system. When qu estions or issues arise using the system, please send the Excel file you are working with and a brief description of the issue to \"apportio nment@omb.eop.gov.\" Please direct questions of a su bstantiv e natu re to your OMB representative. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 12 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) In a limited number of cases necessitated by extenuating circumstances, OMB may approve an apportionment by e -mail or other non -system methods consistent with 31 U.S.C. 1513 . Once the extenuating circumstances have passed (or sooner if possible) , agencies and OMB should process these same requests u sing the apportionment system. 120.17 Is there a standard, set number of lines to show in an apportionment request? No. While the format of the request is fixed and uses specific columns to hold certain kinds of information, the number of lines used for a given TAFS varies considerably. The apportionment system allows you to pick from more than 125 different budgetary resource lines, but agencies will only want to show amounts on a few of these lines for any given TAFS. For example, a TAFS with only an annual appropriation may just use one budgetary resource line. The system provides significant flexibility to allow agencies to put in other lines with zero amounts. For instance, an apportionment for a given TAFS might show all discretionary appropriations lines, but no mandatory appropriations lines. Agencies must work closely with their OMB representatives in determining which budgetary resource lines to show with zero amounts (e.g., post short-term continuing resolution, see section 120.6 2). Appendix F1 shows all possible line choices that are available in the apportionment system. 120.18 What header information at the top of the apportionment must I complete? The header must provide the fiscal year for the apportionment and a public law (if no public law is available right after the enactment of the bill, the H.R. number is acceptable) . The public law reference may be descriptive if there are multiple public laws covered by the apportionment or if the annual appropriations act is not enacted. Some examples are: Funds provided by Public Law N/A - Carryover Funds provided by Public Law N/A - Multiple 120.19 What do I put in each column of the apportionment request? TAFS . TAFS information appears in columns A through F of apportionment requests. The columns show: Treasury agency; period of availability (FY1 and FY2); and allocation account and sub- account, if applicable. For presentation purposes, these columns are often hidden. You can unhide these columns if necessary. As part of validating requests or sending requests, the system checks that these columns are filled out properly; if they are not, the system provides an error message. For fiscal year 2024, the apportionment system will begin accepting apportionments that use the CGAC agency codes (see Appendix C for a listing). For these apportionments, each TAFS code will appear in a single cell, and columns A through F will no longer be dedicated to showing that information. Line numbers. Appendix F1 shows a complete list of line numbers and descriptions. Line splits . You must provide line split in the following cases: The IterNo (Iteration Number) line shows the number of times OMB has approved (apportioned) an apportionment for a given TAFS in a fiscal year. No action is necessary if you use the Create Template function in the apportionment system as a starting point for preparing your requests. The SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 120 apportionment system automatically puts in the Iteration Number in the line split column, as well as puts the last approval date in the line stub column. The RptCat line indicates whether the TAFS uses Program Reporting Categories (section 120.67 ). Use \"YES\" or \"NO\", as appropriate, for the line split column. The AdjAut line indicates whether OMB has approved a footnote in the Application of Budgetary Resources section (footnote indicator that starts with A) on the apportionment that allows specific types of adjustments to be made without submitting a reapportionment request. Use \"YES\" or \"NO\", as appropriate, for the line split column. (See section 120.50) Line 1000 shows unobligated balances. For unobligated balances in no- year and multi -year TAFSs with both mandatory and discretionary funding, you must use a line split that starts with the letter \"D\" to show the portion of the balances that are discretionary. To distinguish between estimated and actual balances, use line splits of \"E\" to show estimated balances or \"A\" to show actual balances. Use \"DE\" or \"DA\" to indicate estimated from actual discretionary balances, respectively, and use \"ME\" and \"MA\" to indicate estimated from actual mandatory balances (section 120.20). You may use the line splits to distinguish between two or more amounts that you would otherwise put on a single line. For example, you may use line splits to distinguish between two or more sources of collections, to distinguish between unobligated balances from reimbursable authority versus direct appropriations, or even to distinguish sequestration amounts on an apportionment. You cannot use line number splits for the Application of Budgetary Resources section. Previous Approved Column. Leave the column blank for the first request you submit for a given fiscal year. See exhibits 120C , and 120D , and 120F for examples of an annual (one -year) appropriation, a no- year appropriation, and appropriations provided by a continuing resolution. Include amounts from the \"OMB Action\" column of the previously approved apportionment within the same fiscal year. This includes any adjustments under sections 120.49 or unless your RMO determines any other adjustment authority granted to you by OMB in writing ( section 120.50 ). When appropriations are enacted following one or more CRs, include the amounts from the last CR in this column (see section 120.60) unless otherwise required by your RMO. For reapportionment requests add the indicator, e.g., A1, B1\\ B2, which indicates that a footnote(s) appears on the previous approved footnote worksheet tab. If your earlier apportionment had footnotes, the worksheet tab will be automatically populated by the apportionment system. Agency Request Column . Include the amounts you are requesting in this column. Include an indicator, e.g., A1, B1, which indicates that a footnote appears on the agency footnote tab. See section 120.34 for more information on footnotes. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 14 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) OMB Action Column. The apportionment system places formulas in the OMB Action column to set it equal to the Agency Request column. OMB will adjust the OMB Action values as necessary when reviewing and approving your request. Include an indicator, e.g., A1, B1, which indicates that a footnote appears on the approved footnote tab. The footnotes in the OMB Footnote column override all other footnotes. Memo Obligations Column. Include memorandum obligations in this column. Also include the date of the obligations using the MM -DD-YYYY format on the RptCat row. The memo obligations support your reapportionment request. 120.20 Do I need to follow special conventions to show the portion of discretionary balances in split accounts (TAF Ss with both mandatory and discretionary funds)? Yes. For unobligated balances in no- year and multi -year TAFSs with both mandatory and discretionary funding (split accounts), you must show the discretionary portion of the balances by using a line split that starts with the letter \"D\" and you must show t he mandatory portion of the balances by using a line split that starts with the letter \"M\". You will do this solely on Line 1000, Unobligated balance, brought forward, Oct. 1. You must also change the Line Stub to start with the word Discretionary, e.g., Discretionary Unobligated balance, brought forward, Oct. 1 or Mandatory Unobligated balance, brought forward, Oct. 1, as appropriate. Many agencies use line splits of \"E\" or \"A\" to distinguish Estimated from Actual balances, respectively. In these cases, you would use \"DE\" or \"DA\" to indicate estimated from actual discretionary balances, respectively and you would use \"ME\" or \"MA\" to indicate estimated from actual mandatory balances, respectively. 120.21 Can I use amounts that include decimal points or cents in an apportionment? No. You must round all amounts up to a dollar in apportionment requests. In addition, you may not round amounts to thousands. When you round up, the delta between the actual cents and the amount apportioned is not available f or obligation and your funds control system must reflect that. Additionally, you should add a \"B\" footnote on line 1920 of the Budgetary Resource section of the apportionment to indicate that rounding has occurred and, therefore , rounded amounts on the apportionment will not match amounts reported on the SF 133 which are reported to the penny. Here is an example of such a footnote: \"Pursuant to section 120.21 of OMB Circular A -11, one or more lines in the Budgetary Resources se ction may be rounded up. As a result , those rounded lines will not match the actuals reported on the SF 133. Agency will ensure that its funds control system will only allot actuals.\" 120.22 Should I use a specific numeric format in the Excel file that holds my request? Yes, you must use whole numbers (decimal points are not permitted) or blanks in numeric columns. Numeric columns include the Previous Approved Amount, Agency Request, OMB Action, and Memorandum Obligations columns. Numbers (including z ero) must be formatted using the number format with thousands separator (a comma), and with a leading negative sign ( -). You cannot use asterisk, special characters, or letters in numeric columns of any apportionment request. Further, you cannot format a number, zero or otherwise, to appear as an asterisk or other special character. There is a single exception : in the memorandum obligations column only, you may use a date format on the RptCat line. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 15 of Section 120 120.23 When are apportionments due at OMB for a new fis cal year? If ... Then, submit your first apportionment request by... Any part of the budgetary resources for a TAFS is not determined by current action of the Congress (such as permanent appropriations, public enterprise and other revolving funds subject to apportionment, reimbursements and other income, and balances of prior year budget authority) August 21, as required by 31 U.S.C. 1513(b) All or any part of the budgetary resources for a TAFS are determined by current action of the Congress August 21, or within 10 calendar days after the enactment of t he appropriation or substantive acts providing new budget authority (i.e., authorization bills), whichever is later After August 21, OMB requires an explanation for any delayed initial apportionment requests in accounts with budgetary resources not dependent on current action of the Congress. We encourage you to begin preparation of apportionments and related materials as soon as the House and Senate have reached agreement on funding levels. In this way, you can make a timely submission of your request to OMB, and OMB can have adequate time for its review. 120.24 When is the apportionment system open for a new fiscal year? The apportionment system will open to agencies to start preparing requests no later than August 1 (or the following business day). Agencies can submit their requests starting August 8. 120.25 Can I combine TAFSs on a single apportionment? No. From time to time, agencies ask whether they can combine (or \"roll -up\") the amounts from two or more TAFSs, and submit an apportionment for this single \"combined\" TAFSs (e.g., miscellaneous accounts). Agencies may not do this because the apportionments must tie back to the statutory authority, which explicitly makes distinctions between accounts and defines the period of availability of the funds in the accounts. These are the same pieces of information that distinguish one TAFS from another. 120.26 Should I assemble apportionment requests for multiple TAFSs in a single package or file? Yes, unless your OMB representative determines otherwise. To the extent practical, submit apportionment requests for each independent agency, departmental bureau, or similar subdivision together. 120.27 Can I cross- check information in the Budgetary Resources section? Yes. You can cross-check information in certain cases against the President's Budget or the most recent SF 133 Reports. In addition, for general fund TAFSs, you should check that appropriations and warrants by Treasury (if any) are consistent and you can check that actual non-expenditure tr ansfers match transfers processed at Treasury. See https://community.max.gov/x/HAAQAw . 120.28 Who can approve the apportionment request for the agency? Agencies must use appropriate internal controls in preparing apportionment requests, and specifically ensure that the agency official with authority to review and approve the request has done so. The approving SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 16 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) official at the agency is not required to sig n the request that is sent to OMB, but may do so if required by the agency's internal controls or if requested by the OMB examining division. OMB's apportionment system does not accommodate electronic signatures of agency officials. 120.29 Who is responsi ble for preparing the apportionment request for allocation (parent/child) accounts? Allocation accounts involve both a \"parent\" appropriation and a \"child\" recipient of budgetary resources via an allocation non-expenditure transfer. For instance, if an appropriation is enacted to the Funds Appropriated to the President's International Military Education and Training account (11-1081 /X), and a subsequent allocation is made to the Department of the Army (Treasury agency 21), then the allocation non-expend iture transfer from 11 -1081 /X to Army would be as follows: 11-1081 /X transfer to 21-11- 1081 /X. Unless OMB determines otherwise, the agency that receives the appropriation to be allocated (the \"parent\") s hould submit a single, consolidated apportionment request that encompasses both the parent TAFS and all the allocated recipient \"child\" agencies and/or bureau TAFSs (see exhibit 120P for an example that uses different lines to distinguish between the parent and children on the apportionment). Additionally, allocation transfers are normally apportioned at the same category level as the parent account (e.g., Category A, B, AB, or C). The agency administering the parent TAFS will indicate to the receiving agency what portion of the consolidated apportionment is transferred to the allocation TAFSs. Allocation account apportionments, however, can be done in different ways. See ex hibit 120R for an example of a parent -only allocation apportionment and e xhibit 120Q for an example of a child-only allocation transfer apportionment. T he parent agency must ensure that the recipients are provided the approved apportionment request on a timely basis. Obligations incurred for the program as a whole are limited by the approved apportionment. Receiving agencies will be responsible for keeping obligations within the amount so specified in the apportionment or to the amount transferred to it from the parent. Allocation worksheets are no longer required if you are using allocations on the apportionment. In order for the transfers to crosswalk correctly in the SF 133 and President's Budget, please ensure that both the parent and child use the appropriate USSGL for allocation transfers (http://www.fms.treas.gov/ussgl/index.html) . SUBMITTING APPORTIONMENT REQUESTS 120.30 How do I submit apportionment requests to OMB? Agencies will typically use OMB's web - based apportionment system to submit their apportionment requests to OMB (see section 120.32 for getting permission in the system to send). In those circumstances when you are unable to use the web -based system, e- mail the Excel file containing your request to your OMB representative. You will almost always be required to send OMB an electronic copy of the apportionment request. In some cases, the OMB representative may request you to provide a hard copy of the signed request. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 17 of Section 120 120.31 What functions will I perform using the apportionment system? OMB's web -based apportionment system is the primary system agencies will use to prepare, submit, and run reports on their apportionment requests. Staffers with authority to use the system may use the Support \\Links tab to find detailed guidance on using the system. Below is a brief overview of the major functions. (a) Create template Use the Create Template screen to get a starting point for your request . If you are only creating one TAFS, the data entry screen is the best starting point . If the TAFS you are working with has already been apportioned in the fiscal year for which you are submitting a request, the system will create a properly formatted Excel file with the most recently approved information in the Previous Approved column. If the TAFS ha s not yet been apportioned or has never been apportioned, you can draw source data from a previous fiscal year and/or a different TAFS to provide a starting point for your request. (b) Validate After you have created a template and updated it to reflect the proper information for your request, use the Validate Request screen to do two things: check for any math or formatting errors, and if there are no errors, create a new file that is ready to be submitted to OMB. This file will have several Excel tabs that were not in your original template. It will have the tab called Appor_Req_to_OMB with the primary apportionment information. It will have a tab to hold any footnotes that OMB may wish to include with the apportionment. If any of the TAFSs in your file have warrants, transfers, or SF 133 data (excluding parent or child allocation accounts) for the fiscal year of your requests, the validated file will also have tabs to display these items. You will need to download and save this file wherever you k eep your apportionment files. (c) Send If your agency administrator has given you the ability to send requests, you can use the Send tab to send files to OMB, or in some cases, to send files to a central office in your agency that will approve requests and send them to OMB. (d) Run reports At any time, you can go to the Run Reports tab to find information associated with your apportionment request, including the latest approved amounts, the latest submission and approval dates, etc. 120.32 How do I gain access to the apportionment system? The apportionment system can be found here: https://apportionment.max.gov . In order to use the apportionment system to prepare requests and run reports, you must have a MAX User ID and your agency administrator must add you to one or more apportionment groups. Your administrator may also choose to give you the ability to submit requests to OMB. You can register for a MAX User ID here: https://portal.max.gov/portal/main/displayRegistrationForm .

SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 18 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 120.33 Are there situations when I would not use the apportionment system? In limited circumstances, OMB may apportion using a letter apportionment. Additionally, during a continuing resolution period, OMB will sometimes apportion certain type s of budgetary resources, such as spending authority from offsetting collections, using a blanket written letter apportionment in addition to the OMB CR Bulletin. Consult your OMB representative for more information. FOOTNOTES TO APPORTIONMENTS 120.34 What are apportionment footnotes (and footnote indicators)? The request tab of an apportionment includes columns for previous approved amounts, agency request, and OMB action. Next to each of these columns, in turn, is a column for a footnote indicator. The use of a footnote indicator on the request tab, e.g., A1, B1, indicates that one or more footnotes are associated with that line. Footnotes appear as textual descriptions on specific tabs in the apportionment file, and typically provide additional information or direction associated with one or more lines on the request. A request includes separate footnote tabs associated with amounts in the previously approved request column, agency requests column, and OMB Action column. Footnotes are divided int o two basic groups: footnotes for apportioned amounts (in the Application of Budgetary Resources section), and informational footnotes for budgetary resources. Footnotes for Apportioned Amounts (Application of Budgetary Resources section) . Each footnot e indicator in this section begins with the letter A. These footnotes are associated with one or more lines in the Application of Budgetary Resources section (the bottom section of the apportionment, OMB action column), have legal effect, and are subject to the Antideficiency Act. For example, a footnote may allow for an upward adjustment of budgetary resources in excess of amounts prescribed in section 120.49 without the need for further action by OMB. Footnotes for Budgetary Resources (Budgetary Resour ces section) . Each footnote indicator in this section begins with the letter B. These footnotes are informational and are associated with one or more lines in the Budgetary Resources section (the top section of the apportionment). For example, a footnot e may identify the source of offsetting collections or explain the basis for amounts on a recovery line. Because these footnotes are not in the Application of Budgetary Resources section (e.g., apportioned), they have no legal effect. Indicators for foot notes . Footnotes are designated (indicated) through a letter/number combination. Each footnote indicator starts with a letter A or B (A for apportioned amounts in the application of budgetary resource section; B for budgetary resource), which is followed by a one - or two -digit number: e.g., B1. If a single line has more than one footnote, separate the indicators with commas: A1, A2, A3. You can find more detailed implementation guidance in OMB's secure, web -based apportionment system under the \"Open Support \\ Links\" tab in navigation menu. 120.35 Do footnotes starting with the letter A correspond to Category A apportioned amounts while those starting with the letter B relate to Category B apportioned amounts? No. Footnote indicators associated with lines in the Budgetary Resources section start with the letter B. Footnote indicators associated with lines in the Application of Budgetary Resources section (apportioned SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 19 of Section 120 amounts) start with the letter A (irrespective of whether apportioned amounts are Category A, B, AB, or C). 120.36 Will footnotes and additional tabs/attachments become part of the apportionment? Yes, but they will only be subject to the Antideficiency Act if they are specifically referenced in a footnote in the OMB Action column of the Application of Budgetary Resources section of the apportionment. It is no longer necessary to include a footnote stat ing that attachments not referenced in the apportionment are not subject to the Antideficiency Act . 120.37 What footnotes are required for agencies to include in their apportionment requests? There is no universal requirement to include footnotes in an apportionment request, except for those r equired after a short-term CR (see section 120.60). M any apportionments are approved without footnotes. Here are examples of cases when you use footnotes: I f you submit an apportionment request and OMB included footnotes in the OMB Footnotes tab of the last approved apportionment, the previously approved footnote indicators must appear in the Prev Footnote column and the text must appear in the Previously Approved Footnotes tab. If a particular TAFS has a standard footnote year after year, retain it in your apportionment request unless you have consulted w ith OMB. Include any footnotes your OMB examining division has specifically directed you to include. Un less OMB determines otherwise, when amounts are automatically apportioned (as specified in sections 120.49, 120.50 (if applicable) or section 185.20) and there is a subsequent need for reapportionment, show automatically apportioned amounts in the previously approved column. Include a footnote noting where changes have been previously made as automatic apportionments. 120.38 Are t here footnotes that are automatically applied to annual and multi-year apportionments? Yes. The following footnote is automatically apportioned for all annual and/or multi -year TAFS that may need to liquidate obligations that were incurred against canceled appropriations: \"Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1553(b), not to exceed one percent of the total appropriations for this account is apportioned for the purpose of paying legitimate obligations related to canceled appropriations.\" W ritten apportionments should no longer include this footnote. APPROVING APPORTIONMENT REQUESTS 120.39 How will OMB indicate its approval of an apportionment? When OMB approves an apportionment through the apportionment system, you will receive an e -mail with the approved Excel file attached. The e- mail will be from 'apportionment@omb.gov,' and the subject line will include the words 'Approved Apportionment .' SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 20 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) The Excel file will include a tab called 'Approval Info ,' which shows the name, title, and digital signature imprint of the OMB official who approved the apportionment, as well as other pertinent inform ation. o The official who approves the apportionment may affix her or his electronic signature to the request; or o The official approving a request may sign a paper copy in ink and instruct a staffer to put a digitized picture of the official 's signature ( along with a note saying which staffer affixed the signature) on the apportionment. In some cases, the 'Approval Info' tab may not be present. In those cases, OMB will e-mail or fax a hard copy of the apportionment that displays the signature of the approving OMB official. The Excel file is locked, and should be opened in read-only mode. OMB maintains a copy of the approved apportionment in its secure, web -based system. OMB also maintains the signed -in-ink apportionment in those cases when a designat ed staffer affixes an official's digitized signature to the apportionment. As OMB continues to transition from using ink signatures to using digital authoritative marks, you may receive apportionments that have been approved using either method. OMB may also choose to indicate its approval of an apportionment in other ways, including by letter, telephone, hard copy, or other method that is appropriate to the particular circumstance. For instance, in rare circumstances where you need to obligate against a submitted reapportionment as soon as possible, you do not have to wait to receiv e the signed apportionment in the system before obligating if OMB has notified you that your reapportionment has already been approved. 120.40 When can I expect OMB to approve my first apportionment request for the fiscal year? If a TAFS has any budgetary resources that are not determined by current actions of the Congress (e.g., permanent appropriations, carryover of unobligated balances, anticipated collections), OMB will notify you of the action taken on your first apportionment request for the fiscal year by September 10, as required by law (for requests submitted by the August 21 deadline specified by law). For TAFSs that have budgetary resources solely as a result of current action by the Congress (e.g., TAFSs where the only budgetary resource is a discretionary appropriation), OMB will notify you of the action taken on your request by September 10 for requests submitted by August 21 or within 30 calendar days after the approval of the act providing new budget authority, whichever is later. 120.41 In the case of newly enacted full -year appropriations, am I under an automatic apportionment until OMB approves my first full- year enacted appo rtionment request? Yes. Under this section, newly enacted full -year appropriations, including supplemental appropriations for the current year, are automatically apportioned the pro -rata share (1/365 th for each day, 1/366th for a leap - year) of the curren t year's enacted appropriation level. Once a full -year appropriations Act is enacted, and if the Act was preceded by a short -term continuing resolution (CR), the automatic apportionment provided by the OMB CR Bulletin is no longer in effect ; however , the amounts apportioned remain in effect even if the President enacts the full -year appropriation bill prior to the end of the short -term CR period . For example , a CR ending November 15 th would result in a pro -rata amount of 12.60% ( 46 days/365 days , non-leap year) apportioned. If t he CR is extended through December 20th an additional 9.59% (35 days/365 days) would be apportioned, bringing the total percentage of the rate of operations apportioned to 22.19% since October 1st. If full-year appropriati ons are enacted on December 15th (before the end of the CR SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 21 of Section 120 period), o n December 15th you are automatically apportioned the 30 days ' worth of the enacted full year appropriation (30 days/365 days = 8.2 2%) pursuant to the automatic authority provided by this section. Therefore, from October 1st through January 15th you have been apportioned a total of 30.41%, 22.19% of the rate for operations provided by the short -term CR from the OMB CR Bulletin plus 8.22 % of the final appropriated amount pursuant to this section. The automatic apportionment does not apply to any budgetary resource provided by authorizing legislation or by reauthorizations that affect appropriated resources, such as the Farm Bill or surface transportation reauthorizations. Additionally, pursuant to sections 120.7 and 120.56 , automatic apportionment does not apply to carryover amounts, which are automatically apportioned at zero until an account -specific apportionment is approved for such amounts. Pending OMB 's approval of the first written account -specific apportionment request for full -year enacted appropriations for the current fiscal year, agencies are automatically apportioned 30 -calendar days of funds calculated using the above rate. Note that the pro -rata share calculation does not include rescissions and other transactions used to calculate the pro -rata share pursuant to the OMB CR Bulletin. The 30 -calendar days begin on the date of enactment of a full -year appropriation, except for after a lapse in appropriations (see below). If OMB has not approved a request on the 30th calendar day after enactment, agencies are automatically apportioned another 30 calendar days of funds using the above rate. This repeats until an account -specif ic apportionment is approved. Once a written account -specific apportionment is approved by OMB, the automatic apportionment ceases to remain in effect. If an agency has not yet submitted its first written account-specific apportionment request to OMB wit hin the first 30-day automatic apportionment period, the agency must provide an explanation of the delay to its OMB representative. Under this automatic apportionment, funds are apportioned as \" lump -sum \" and all of the footnotes and conditions placed on prior year apportionments or last -approved apportionments remain in effect . This guidance applies strictly to all budgetary resources provided by annual full -year appropriations bills, including supplemental appropriations for the current year, and not othe r budgetary resources. For accounts that have appropriations language with permissive carveouts (\"up to\" or \"not more than\" or \"not to exceed\") for a specific amount with a different period of availability (POA) than the main appropriation, the automatic apportionment applies to the main appropriation and not to the carveout amount. Under this scenario the agency must execute a non-expenditure transfer to move the carveout amount and then process an account -specific apportionment to obligate those specific transferred resources. See Exhibit 120T for further guidance on how to prepare the apportionment in these scenarios. After a lapse in appropriations, the automatic apportionment of full -year appropriations is in effect the day the lapse occurred, not the date the President enacts the full -year appropriation. This situation only applies when a full -year appropriation follows a lapse in appropriations. If the full -year enacted appropriations are preceded by a short -term continuing resolution, see secti ons 120.60 and 120.62 for further guidance on how to reflect the previous approved column on your first written account -specific apportionment request. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 22 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) AFTER YOU HAVE RECEIVED YOUR APPROVED APPORTIONMENT 120.42 How should I execute the apportionment? You must execute your programs as apportioned and in accordance with all applicable laws. The authorization and / or appropriation language describes the purpose of the program(s) the TAFS will carry out, and may include guidance for you to follow in executing these programs. Your apportionment dictates how you must execute programs and control funds. You may only obligate funds within: budgetary resources apportioned and realized; amounts apportioned by fiscal quarter (Category A); amounts apportioned by program, project, or activity (Category B); amounts apportioned by fiscal quarters and programs, projects, or activities (Category AB); and guidance provided in OMB approved footnotes in the Application of Budgetary Resources section. 120.43 What if I think that I may have obligated more than the amounts apportioned? You may have violated the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1517(a)(1 )). See section 145. 120.44 Must I control fu nds below the apportionment level? Yes. Your agency's fund control regulations, as approved by OMB, dictate how you must control funds. S ee section 150 . 120.45 How should I allot once I receive an apportionment? The agency system of administrative con t rol of funds must be designed to keep obligations and expenditures from exceeding apportionments and allotments or from exceeding budgetary resources available for obligation, whichever is smaller, so as to avoid Antideficiency Act violations. See sectio n 150. 120.46 How do I treat anticipated budgetary resources that are apportioned in the current fiscal year but not yet realized, and do I need to reapportion them once realized? Even when anticipated budgetary resources have been apportioned in the cur rent fiscal year, you may not obligate against these resources before the resources have been realized (and, thus, you may not obligate against the resources in an amount that exceeds the amount that has been realized). For example, if OMB has apportioned anticipated budget authority from the agency's collection of user fees, you may not obligate against those user fees until you have collected them (and, thus, you may not incur obligations that exceed the amounts that have been collected). This guidance also applies to anticipated non-expenditure transfers of budgetary resources. The transferred resources cannot be obligated against until Treasury Fiscal Service has processed a non -expenditure transfer document and the resources are in the receiving accou nt. Apportioned anticipated budgetary resources, once realized, do not need to be reapportioned unless the a mount realized exceeds the conditions on the total amount apportioned (see section 120.49). However, this only applies during the current fiscal year. For instance, if you had anticipated resources apportioned SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 23 of Section 120 in the prior fiscal year for a reimbursable agreement but it was not realized, you will need to reapportion those anticipated resources in the next fiscal year. 120.47 What is the relationship between the apportionment and the Funds Control System? The agency 's system of administrative control of funds (see section 150 and Appendix H) should be designed to keep obligations from exceeding apportioned amounts, allotments, suballotments , and other administrative subdivisions of funds. This funds -control system also should be designed to keep obligations from exceeding budgetary resources that have been realized, and should be able to track obligations by program reporting categories used in the apportionment. The funds -control system must track obligations to make sure obligated levels do not exceed: budgetary resources apportioned; amounts provided by fiscal quarter in Category A; amounts provided by program in Category B; amounts provided by program in Category AB; and other restrictions placed in OMB approved footnotes in the Application of Budgetary Resources section. If the funds-control system cannot provide this control, the agency must develop other methods to per form this function, e.g., developing monitoring reports. Since footnotes are not often implemented in an agency's financial system, the agency's budget, finance, and procurement staff need to be aware of and understand the directions and restrictions provided in footnotes. Your agency 's accounting system must fully support the funds -control system (see Appendix H). CHANGES TO PREVIOUSLY APPROVED APPORTIONMENTS FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR 120.48 What types of situations could require me to request a new apportionment? Submit a reapportionment request to OMB when: Your budgetary resources have increased since your previous apportionment for the fiscal year (e.g., actual reimbursements differ significantly from estimates, newly enacted legislation provid es more resources); You want to obligate against the increased resources in the same fiscal year; The increase is not covered by the exceptions in sections 120.49 or 120.50 (if applicable); or Programmatic changes result in a need for an adjustment in the apportionment. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 24 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) In order to allow time for action by OMB, submit such requests well in advance of the time that the revised amounts, to be apportioned, are needed for obligation (an apportionment for a specific time period, such as for a specific quarter of the current fiscal year, may not be changed after the end of that period). When emergencies, such as those involving the safety of human life or the protection of property, require immediate action, you may request, and OMB may approve, a reappor tionment by e -mail or other non- web-based apportionment system methods (section 120.16). As soon thereafter as it is practical, submit apportionment requests reflecting such action. For credit program and financing TAFSs, submit an apportionment request for subsidy reestimates at the beginning of each fiscal year (starting with the fiscal year following the year in which a disbursement is made) as long as the loans are outstanding (see sections 185.17 and 185.18). Also submit an apportionment request fo r subsidy modifications when the modification is approved by OMB (see section 185.21). Credit program and financing TAFSs are also subject to the standard reapportionment requirements described above (see sections 185.14 through 185.21 for further guidance on apportioning credit accounts). Submit an apportionment request within 10 calendar days after enactment of an appropriation, substantive act providing budget authority, where such authority is enacted after the first apportionment for the year has been made (except as specified in section 120.49). We encourage you to begin preparation of apportionments and related materials as soon as the House and Senate have reached agreement on funding levels. In some cases, you will need to su bmit your first apportionment request before the unobligated balance brought forward has been precisely determined. If the unobligated balance brought forward, as shown on the latest approved apportionment schedule, is larger than the unobligated balance at the end of the preceding year, as reported on the final SF 133 for that year, and the difference is larger than the amount specified in section 120.49 , OMB must approve the apportionment request before you can obligate the additional funds. 120.49 What adjustments can I make without submitting a reapportionment request? After the first apportionment for the fiscal year, downward adjustments of any amount to budgetary resources, including anticipated amounts, do not need to be reapportioned, unless spec ifically required by OMB or, at the agency 's discretion, for funds control purposes. However, if the decrease applies to amounts apportioned in Category C, and as a result you need to increase the amounts apportioned to Category B(s) or current Cat A or A/B(s) lines, you will have to submit a reapportionment to reflect the reallocation from Category C . Apportioned anticipated budgetary resources, once realized in the current fiscal year of the apportionment , do not need to be reapportioned unless the amount realized exceeds the conditions on the total amount apportioned, as noted below. Although an apportionment is not required to execute a non-expenditure transfer out of a TAFS, for funds control purposes a reapportionment should follow shortly after suc h a transfer is executed to reflect the non - expenditure transfer and reduce the budgetary resources of the giving account accordingly. After the first apportionment for the fiscal year, unless OMB determines otherwise, you may adjust apportioned amounts upwards without submitting a reapportionment request by up to $400,000 or two percent of the amount of total budgetary resources, whichever is lower, to reflect: Upward adjustments in the amount of unobligated balances brought forward; Increases in amounts of budget authority transfers or balance transfers; or SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 25 of Section 120 Increases in amounts of actual budgetary resources that are realized above anticipated amounts. You may only adjust apportioned amounts when OMB apportions either a single program, project, or activity (Category B) or, if the total amount is apportioned, by quarter (Category A or Category AB). When amounts are apportioned by quarter, you must adjust the apportioned amounts in the quarter that is current when you record the resource. For example, if anticipated collections were apportioned in the third quarter but the increased amount above the anticipated collections (still within the lower of $400,000 or two percent) were not realized until the fourth quarter; record the resource in the fo urth quarter, not the third. This guidance is not applicable when your resources are apportioned pursuant to an automatic apportionment. In those cases you record the automatic apportionment of those resources in the quarter in which they are realized. If only the name of your apportioned account and/or bureau has changed, you do not need to submit a reapportionment to OMB. In credit financing TAFSs, additional amounts for the payment of interest to Treasury are automatically apportioned (section 185.19) if the amounts needed exceed your estimate on the most recent approved apportionment. You cannot make any upward adjustments under this section (downward adjustments are not affected) when OMB apportions funds for two or more categories on the same apportionment, such as Category A and Category B, or Category A and Category AB, or two or more Category Bs, etc. In these types of apportioned TAFSs, you must submit a reapportionment request to OMB or otherwise have prior OMB approval (e.g., through an OMB footnote in the Application of Budgetary Resources section that starts with the indicator of A) to adjust apportioned amounts upward. Apportionments are not required for transactions to send funds back to the Treasury, such as closing an account. 120.50 What other types of adjustments can I request OMB to allow me to make without submitting a new apportionment request? You may make other specific types of adjustments to apportionments without submitting a reapportionment request if specified in a footnote in the Application of Budgetary Resources section (footnote indicator starts with letter A) on the most recently approved apportionment or otherwise approved in writing by OMB. For example, OMB may include on an approved apportionment a footnote (with a corresponding YES in the Line Split column of the Adjustment Authority Provided row) which states that, to the extent provided in law, actual earned reimbursements are automatically apportioned without further OMB action. In order to facilitate OMB approval of your apportionment request, your apportionment request must indicate that you have previously received, or are requesting, OMB approval to use this authority. 120.51 What is the status of previously approved apportionments when a new apportionment is approved in the same fiscal year? Each new apportionment in a fiscal year supersedes previous apportionment action s taken earlier that year. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 26 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) APPORTIONMENTS BY TIME PERIOD 120.52 Will OMB apportion funds into future fiscal years? Yes. OMB will sometimes apportion multi- year/no -year funds into future fiscal years using a Category C . OMB cannot apportion annual funds into a future fiscal year. The Congress appropriates funds on a multi -year and no -year basis with the expectation that the funds will be obligated over more than one fiscal year. OMB will apportion these TAFSs beyond the current fiscal year where financial requirements are known in advance and it makes programmatic sense to do so. When you plan to obligate amounts appropriated in a no- year or multi -year TAFSs over more than one fiscal year, make sure that the apportionment request shows the full amount appropriated and available for obligation in the current fiscal year. The request must also include planned obligations for the current year and amounts planned for obligation in future fiscal years. Note: apportionments last no longer than one fiscal year. Funds must be apportioned at the beginning of each fiscal year in accordance with sections 120.7 and 120.56 . 120.53 When do I use lines 6180 (withheld pending rescission) or 6181 (deferred)? Do not use these lines on your apportionment without first consulting with your OMB representative. These lines are used to reflect a proposed rescission or deferral under the authority of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. If these lines are used on your apportionment, you must submit a rescission or deferral report that outlines the reasons for and the effects of the proposed action. See section 112 for further information on the use of these lines and preparing rescission and deferral reports. 120.54 Can OMB reapportion a past period? No. Apportionments are never subject to change after the period for which the apportionment was made (e.g., a prior fiscal year or a past quarter time period in the current fiscal year). For apportionments with Category A amounts, once funds are apportioned, the apportionment cannot be retroactively changed to show a different apportioned amount if that quarter has passed. For instance, if your first quarter apportioned amount was overestimated but in a subsequent quarter the realized actuals were much lower than the estimated amount, you would do the following on the reapportionment: First quarter apportioned amount remains as previously apportioned; Current quarter (i.e., second, third or fourth) reflect a negative amount so as to net to the correct total amount that needs to be reapportioned. See exhibit 120K for an example. Here are examples of where OMB is not reapportioning a past period: apportionments that simply reflect a past automatic apportionment on a subsequent account -specific apportionment, such as the initial account - specific apportionment following a continuing resolution (because the apportionment was in fact in ef fect during the past quarter time period); or where budget authority has been expressly appropriated to cover prior obligations. See section 120.41 for additional guidance about the automatic apportionment of budgetary resources when a full -year appropriations Act follows a lapse in appropriations. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 27 of Section 120 120.55 Do unobligated resources apportioned in earlier time periods of the same fiscal year remain available? Yes. When budgetary resources are apportioned for time periods of less than a fiscal year (e.g., fiscal quarters), any apportioned amounts that have not been obligated at the end of any period will remain available for obligation through the remainder of t he current fiscal year without being reapportioned, unless otherwise specified on the apportionment. However, this rule does not apply to unobligated balances apportioned during a short -term continuing resolution that is followed immediately by a lapse in appropriations (see section 123.16). 120.56 Must I request that funds apportioned in one fiscal year be apportioned in the next fiscal year if the funds were not obligated and remain available? Yes. When budgetary resources remain available (unexpired) beyond the end of a fiscal year, you must submit a new apportionment request for the upcoming fiscal year. You cannot incur obligations in any year absent an approved apportionment for that year. For instance, if OMB apportioned $1 million for a no- year TAFSs in FY 2018 and you obligated no funds, you must still submit an FY 2019 request and receive OMB approval of that request before incurring obligations in FY 2019. Until you receive an account -specific apportionment from OMB, the amount of carryover apportioned is zero dollars. In addition, apportioned anticipated or estimated resources are not available for obligation until the resources are realized. 120.57 What is the status of approved apportionments from a previous fiscal year on apportionments in the current fiscal year? New apportionment action for a fiscal year is independent of all apportionment actions of the previous year, including the apportionment of amounts under Category C in the previous fiscal year. 120.58 How does the last approv ed apportionment govern the actions a TAFS takes when the TAFS enters the expired phase? Every annual and multi -year TAFSs, as well as some no -year TAFSs, has a finite period of time to incur an obligation; this is called the unexpired phase. OMB only apportions TAFSs in the unexpired phase. When shifting to the expired phase, a TAFS can only make adjustments to obligations made in the unexpired phase. Activity in the expired phase of a TAFS is governed by the last approved apportionment, including apportioned footnotes in the OMB Action column of the Application of Budgetary Resources section . In some instances, there may be a subset of resources in a no -year TAFS that are no longer available for new obligations. This does not impact the phase (e.g.., expired or unexpired) of the entire TAFS. APPORTIONMENTS AFFECTED BY THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION (CR) 120.59 During a CR, what happens to TAFSs that were apportioned before the start of a fiscal year (e.g., no -year TAFSs)? When budgetary resources (e.g., unobligated balances, spending authority from offsetting collections, anticipated transfers) are apportioned prior to the start of a fiscal year, those apportionments remain in effect even if a CR is enacted, unless otherwise directed by OMB. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 28 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) However, you must submit a new apportionment request to OMB if: The CR changes the funding level or al ters the program mix that OMB apportioned (e.g., the Congress rescinds unobligated balances during the CR period or zero-funds a program that OMB previously apportioned); or Changes occur that affect the budgetary resources apportioned as described in sections 120.48 through 120.50 (e.g., actual reimbursements differ significantly from estimates). The automatic apportionment approved by OMB after enactment of a short -term CR (OMB CR Bulletin) covers only the budgetary resources provided by the short -term CR. Some TAFSs may receive funds provided by the CR in addition to budgetary resources provided by other acts. These TAFSs receive both the automatic apportionment for the CR funds and any budgetary resources apportioned before the start of the fiscal year (e.g., unobligated balance carried forward). If you chose to reapportion the TAFS during the CR period and you and the RMO agree not to reflect the amounts from the CR in the reapportionment, then you must include a footnote in the reapportionment to indicate that the account is also receiving apportioned resources from the CR. See section 123.17 for the footnote language. 120.60 After a CR has been replaced by a full -year enacted appropriation, what do I show in the Previous Approved column? Unless otherwise requested by your RMO, in the Previous Approved column, show all budgetary resources and apportioned amounts since the start of the fiscal year through the last da y of the CR (in accordance with the most recent OMB CR Bulletin on the \"Apportionment of the Continuing Resolution(s) for Fiscal Year 20XX\") plus the amounts automatically apportioned pursuant to section 120.41. For example, amounts on line 1100, discretionary appropriations, should show the short -term CR 's calculated rate for operations. Additionally, a footnote on line 1134 Appropriations precluded from obligation (or line 1135 for a special or trust fund TAFS), should state the following: \"Amount on line 1134 (or line 1135) has been adjusted pursuant to OMB CR Bulletin XX -XX and Circular A-11 section 120.41.\" (see exhibit 120G ). For instance, if budgetary resources such as unobligated balances were apportioned by OMB and the TAFS also received automatic ally apportioned CR funds via the OMB CR Bulletin(s) and section 120.41, you must show both types of budgetary resources on your apportionment request. If you were apportioned under the CR with a POA that was changed in the full -year enacted appropriations, see section 120. 62 for further apportionment guidance. 120.61 After a short-term CR has been replaced by a full -year enacted appropriation, what do I show in the agency request column? In the agency request column, show all budgetary resources and application of budgetary resources for the entire fiscal year, beginning from the start of the fiscal year. See section 120.54 and exhibit 120G . See Exhibit 120H if you received OMB concurrence during the short -term CR period to record your lump-sum automatic apportionment as Category A. Note that while an account is under the automatic apportionment authority in section 120.41, GTAS reporting will not show any amounts on line 1134 unlike the previously approved column of the first apportionment post -CR.

SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 29 of Section 120 120.62 What do I do if the full-year enacted appropriation changes the period of availability of funds apportioned under a short -term CR? If the POA of funds under a short -term CR was changed by the full -year enacted appropriations, you must submit two account -specific apportionments. Under the short -term CR, you were apportioned for that specific POA and all obligations were valid, however, the CR states that expenditures made pursuant to the CR shall be charged to the applicable appropriation, fund, or authorization whenever a bill in which such applicable appropriation, fund, or authorization is contained is enacted into law. In the situation where the entire POA of the TAFS changed in the final bill, you must prepare the following apportionments. In this scenario the CR POA was annual and the final enacted appropriation POA was multi-year. For the POA that was under the CR, you will r eflect \"0\" on lines 1100 discretionary appropriation and 1134 appropriation excluded from obligation (or 1135 for special and trust funds) and place the following \"A\" footnote on line 6190 total budgetary resources available in the previously approved column only: \"Under the FY 2020 short -term continuing resolution (CR) (P.L. XXX -XXX, as amended) this account was appropriated as an annual TAFS (put TAFS number here) and was apportioned by OMB Bulletin 19-XX. The full- year FY 2020 appropriation (P.L. XXX -XXX) enacted the funding within a multi -year TAFS (put TAFS number here) and was automatically apportioned via OMB Circular A-11 section 120.41. Pursuant to section XXX (check CR for actual section number, e.g., 105) of the FY 2020 CR, any obligations/outlays made with the previous annual appropriation shall now be redistributed (or recasted) to the new multi -year TAFS (put TAFS number here).\" For the POA that is enacted in the full- year bill, you will reflect the CR (lines 1100 discretionary appropriations and 1134 appropriation excluded from obligation or 1135 for special or trust funds) in the previous approved column (see section 120.60 for \"B\" footnote on line 1134 or 1135) and place the following \"A\" footnote on line 6190 total budgetary resources available: \"Under the FY 2020 short -term continuing resolution (CR) (P.L. XXX -XXX, as amended) this account was appropriated as an annual TAFS (put TAFS number here) and was apportioned by OMB Bulletin 19-XX. The full- year 2020 appropriation (P.L.

Pursuant to section XXX (check CR for actual section number, e.g., 105) of the FY 2020 CR, any obligations/outlays made with the previous annual appropriation shall now be redistributed (or recasted) to this new multi -year TAFS (put TAFS number here).\" There may be cases where the POA is only changed partially by the full -year enacted appropriations bill. If this occurs, please contact your OMB representative for guidance. SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 30 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) WHAT OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT APPORTIONMENTS? 120.63 What types of resources are apportioned by OMB? The following resources are apportioned by OMB: Budgetary resources; Non-budgetary resources (such as foreign currency, quotas, etc.); and An agency's other authority (pursuant to statutory authority) in whatever form it may take. 120.64 Are all apportionments based on authority to incur obligations? OMB usually apportions the budgetary resources of a TAFS with respect to the authority to incur new obligations. However, OMB may apportion budgetary resources on a pre-obligation basis, such as \"commitments,\" which, if used, are made before obligations are incurred. If OMB apportions on a basis other than obligations, you should continue to include your usual obligations in the GTAS system, but in addition, you must report a GTAS footnote regarding the status of the non-obligation apportioned items, i.e., footnote the amount of \"commitments\" incurred against the amount shown on the apportionment. 120.65 How do I treat extensions of the availability of unobligated balances in an apportionment? Reappropriations (see section 20.4(h) ) are recorded on lines 1105 Discretionary Reappropriation or 1204 Mandatory Reappropriation. For example, an apportionment for FY 2019 should reflect an estimate of the amount to be reappropriated from the estimated expiring FY 2018 balances. A reapportionment may be required after the actual amount of the expiring balances is known. You may wish to reflect these amounts on either lines 1134 Discretionary appropriations precluded from obligation (use for only general fund TAFS; use line 1135 for special or trust fund TAFS) or 1235 Mandatory appropriations precluded from obligation, until an appropriate time after the required reprogramming notice has been transmitted to the Congress. B alance transfer amounts from expired to unexpired funds, are reflected on line 1012 Unobligated balance transfers between expired and unexpired accounts. HANDLING DEFICIENCIES IN APPORTIONMENTS 120.66 When and how do I submit apportionments anticipating the need for the Congress to enact supplemental budget authority? Submit requests anticipating the need for the Congress to enact supplemental budget authority only under exceptional circumstances as authorized by law. The Antideficiency Act ( 31 U.S.C. 1515 ) permits apportionments to be made on such a deficient -rate basis that indicates the need for the Congress to enact supplemental budget authority only when: L aws enacted after submission to the Congress of the estimates for an appropriation that requires an expenditure beyond administrative control. Emergencies arise involving: SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONME NT PROCESS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 31 of Section 120 (1) the safety of human life ; (2) the protection of property ; or (3) the immediate welfare of individuals in cases where an appropriation that would allow the United States to pay, or contribute to, amounts required to be paid to individuals in specific amounts fixed by law or under formulas prescribed by law, is insufficient. When you submit a requested apportionment that indicates a necessity for the enactment of supplemental appropriations, include the following notation on the apportionment request: \"This apportionment request indicates a necessity for a supplemental appropriation now estimated at $_____________.\" Submit the apportionment request to OMB along with your agency head's determination of the reasons for a deficiency apportionment, as required by law ( 31 U.S.C. 1515 ). The statement of necessity will read as follows: \" I hereby determine that it is necessary to request apportionment of the appropriation '(appropriation title)' on a basis that indicates the necessity for a supplemental estimate of appropriations, because .... [cite one of the allowable reasons mentioned above].\" Usually, you will reflect the need for a supplemental appropriation in quarterly apportionments by making the request for the fourth quarter less than the amount that will be required. For apportionments by activities, verify that the amount requested for each activity provides for continuing that activity until the supplemental appropriation is expected to be enacted and become available. OMB approval of requests for a deficiency apportionment allows the agency to operate at a deficient rate of operation s, but does not authorize the agency to exceed the total amount of the existing appropriation and of the resources that OMB has apportioned within a TAFS. Fully justify the amount of any anticipated supplemental appropriation. Action on the apportionment request does not commit OMB to the amount of the supplemental appropriation that will be recommended subsequently to the President or transmitted to the Congress. A deficiency apportionment cannot be requested to provide obligational authority in the event of a lapse of appropriations. The obligational authority for such a circumstance is provided by 31 U.S.C. 1342 , a nd is automatically apportioned via section 124.5. PROGRAM REPORTING CATEGORIES 120.67 What is the purpose of program reporting categories? P rogram reporting categories show how agencies will report obligations on their SF 133 Reports on Budget Execution and Budgetary Res ources (see section 130 ). Absent program reporting categories, agencies report obligations on their SF 133 reports in accordance with their approved apportionments. For instance, if OMB uses a single Category B project on the apportionment and does not use program reporting categories, the SF 133 report will show obligations on a single line. Y ou should use program reporting categories when you want obligations reported at a more detailed and programmatically meaningful manner than the apportioned lines would otherwise result in. If program reporting categories were used in the case above, the SF 133 report would show obligations on two or (most SECTION 120 \u2014APPORTIONMENT PROCESS Page 32 of Section 120 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) likely) more lines. For instance, if a Department of the Interior account had a single Category B project b ut program categories for maintaining land resources and protecting endangered species, the SF 133 report would distinguish obligations by these categories. While program reporting categories result in more detailed reporting on obligations, they do not control what the agency can obligate for these categories. Most TAFSs do not use program reporting categories. 120.68 Do my estimates of program reporting category obligations limit the amount I can obligate? No. Program reporting categories are not used to apportion funds, and are not subject to the Antideficiency Act. 120.69 What do OMB and the agency need to do to start using program reporting categories? OMB and agencies work together to determine what program reporting categories agencies wi ll report upon. Program reporting categories should be based on elements that agencies track in their financial systems. In some cases, you may choose to report upon the same programs that appear in the Program and Financing Schedule of the President's Budget. Because the level of reporting is lower level than the apportionment categories, program reporting categories should be identified in advance of the beginning of a fiscal year if at all possible, and in advance of the time that agencies produce their first apportionment requests for the year. The reason is that agencies need time to place entries in their financial systems to allow them to track these program categories throughout the year. One reason is that large numbers of staff including tim ekeepers, procurement staff, administrative officers, and others need to document the new program reporting categories, and train program office staff on how to use the new categories. In addition, agencies may need time to update their systems to extract the data. 120.70 How do I fill in the program reporting category tab? The apportionment user's guide that appears on the support \\links tab of the apportionment system describes how to fill in the program reporting category tab. The URL for the apporti onment system is: https://apportionment.max.gov . 120.71 Why does OMB send the names of program reporting categories and Category B projects to Treasury for use in GTAS? OMB sends program reporting categories from approved apportionments to the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which operates the GTAS system that agencies use to report their SF 133 budget execution information. When reporting their obligations, GTAS provides agencies with the list of program reporting categories to report upon; these are the same program reporting categories that OMB provides from the apportionment attachments. For those TAFSs that use Category B projects but do not use program reporting categories, OMB sends Fiscal Service the list of Category B projects for use in GTAS reporting. OMB sends this information to Fiscal Service so OMB can use automated tools to align program reporting categories and Category B projects on the apportionments to the budget execution reports.

Note: you can choose to reference the CR PL number or both the CR and any appropriation laws. Scenario Category A lump-sum in 1st quarter: If you choose to record amounts automatically apportioned pursuant to the OMB Bulletin as Cat A (after consulting with your RMO during the short-term CR period as stated in the Bulletin ), you show the amounts from the Bulletin all in 1st quarter, line 6001. E.g., CR runs through January 15th (29.32% of the rate for operations is automatically apportioned). Scenario: CR gets extended in the 2nd quarter If the short -term CR gets extended, the lump-sum from the Bulletin will be shown as follows: E.g., CR is extended on January 7th (2nd quarter) and runs through March 23rd (additional 18.35% of the rate for operations is automatically apportioned in the 2nd quarter as a lump-sum). Scenario: full-year bill is enacted in the 3rd quarter, application of A-11 section 120.41: Post short-term CR: adjust line 1134 in the previous approved column to reflect the automatically apportioned amounts from both the OMB Bulletin and A-11 section 120.41 and reflect it in the manner described in scenario above. E.g., full-year bill is enacted on March 21st (third quarter) so put the amount apportioned from A-11 section 120.41 in the third quarter (lump-sum).Requirement for line 1134 (or line 1135 for special or trust funds)--see footnote language below.

Summary of Changes Adds information on OMB 's process to collect proposed anomaly information from agencies (section 123.1) . Updates link to OMB bulletin that apportioned the FY 2023 continuing resolution (sec tion 123.3). SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS Page 2 of Section 123 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 123.1 What is a continuing resolution (CR) and how does OMB collect information on proposed CR anomalies from agencies? Continuing resolutions (CRs) are joint resolutions that provide continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year or a full fiscal year. A CR that cover s only a part of a fiscal year is referred to as a \"short - term\" CR, and a CR that cover s a full fiscal year is referred to as a \"full -year\" CR. A CR is often enacted when the Congress has not yet passed new appropriations bills by October 1 or when the President has vetoed congressionally passed appropriations bills. Because of the nature of a short -term CR, each agency should operate at a minimal level until after its regular fiscal year appropriations are enacted. Short -term CRs sometimes include separate legislative provisions addressing funding or authorities for a specific TAFS or program (known as \" anomalies\"). OMB solicits information from agencies on anomalies needed for potential short -term CRs . For short term CRs at the beginning of a fiscal year , no later than three months prior to the start of the upcoming fiscal year, OMB will issue a budget data request (BDR) for anomalies that would be necessary for a CR lasting through at least December. Your OMB representative will communicate a specific due date, which may be as early as one week after the BDR is released. CRs provide funds for projects and activities. The phrase projects and activities may have two meanings: In section 101 of the CR, t he phrase usually refers to the total appropriation for the account ( i.e., the amount calculated by the formula) rather than to specific activities (when determining which Government programs are covered by the CR and the rate for operations limit). The phrase also refers to the specific activity (e.g., programs, projects , or activities) in order to determine whether the activity is a prohibited new start or not. In other words, when determining whether an activity was authorized to be carried out but was not executed or was carried out in the preceding year. Usually, CRs do not provide specific dollar amounts in the legislative language for each Treasury Appr opriation Fund Symbol ( TAFS). Rather, CRs provide formulas for calculating the amounts appropriated for continuing projects and activities during the period of the CR . For more information on calculating these amounts, see section 1 23.2. For short - term CRs, t he annual OMB CR Bulletin (\"Bulletin \") automa tically apportions a pro -rata share of funding available for most TAFSs. For more information on how the Bulletin apportions funding and how much is apportioned , see section s 123.3 and 12 3.4. There are some instances where TAFS s will not receive an automatic apportionment pursuant to the Bulletin and an account -specific apportion ment is required during the short -term CR. Some of those instances are mentioned throughout this sectio n and will be specifically addressed in the Bulletin. The Bulletin is generally released after the enactment of an initial shor t-term CR and will contain any specific information regarding the execution of that year's CR. This section of the Circular pro vides general conceptual information on the apportionment and execution of short -term CRs . The Bulletin should be regarded as the official apportionment of CR funds and will refer to this section and sectio n 120 of this Circular as necessary. Am ounts appropriated in a full -year CR are apportioned using the same processes that are used for full- year appropriations Acts. OMB does not typically issue a Bulletin for full- year CRs. Occasionally, short - term CRs will include provisions that provide a full -year appropriation for a specific TAFS. Such full - year appropriations are not automatically apportioned by the Bulletin and are not subject to the calculations discussed below. SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 123 123.2 How do I determine the rate for operations under a short -term CR? Short -term CRs routinely provide a formula for determining the rate for operations either in section 101 or in subsequent sections of the bill that may provide a particular rate for a pro gram or account (anomaly) . For over a decade, section 101 of short -term CRs has provided the same process for calculating the rate for operations formula and lists the previous fiscal year's appropriations Acts that are continued under the CR. In addition, section 101 sometimes includes an across-the -board (ATB) increase or reduction to the rate for operations. This section of the Circular provides guidance that assumes that future short -term CRs will continue with this structure; h owever, the annual Bulletin will specify the official formula based on each CR's legislative text. \"Rate for operations \" is defined as the annualized level of resources that are available only through the period of time covered by a short -term CR. The terms rate for operations and annualized level are often used interchangeably. For consistency purposes, this section of the Circular uses \" rate for operations .\" The rate for operations must be calculated at the TAFS level. The rate for operations is provided to the TAFS with the period of availability in the appropriations Acts referenced in section 101, but updated to start in the fiscal year for which the CR applies. For example, annual funds appropriated in the FY 2020 appropriations Act for TAFS 012 -3456/2020 result in a rate for operations in a n annual TAFS for FY 2021 in a FY 2021 CR (i.e., 012- 3456/2021). Follow the steps below to calculate the rate for operations for each applicab le TAFS under section 101 of the CR: a) Take the full -year amount enacted in the appropriations A cts specified in section 101 , including obligation limitations. b) Subtract any recurring account -specific rescissions, followed by agency -specific and then bill - wide reductions, if any, enacted in the appropriations Acts specified in section 101 . c) Add or subtract non-expenditure transfers mandated by the appropriations Acts referenced in section 101. See section 123.9 for the definition of mandated transfers. d) Add or subtract any ATB increase or reduction specified in section 101 (if any). For example, TA FS 012-3456 /2020 was appropriated $100 million in the FY 2020 appropriations Act referenced in section 101 of the 2021 CR. The appropriations Act referenced in section 101 also included a recurring rescission of $50 million and directed that $30 million shall be transferred to T AFS 012- 1234/2020. Assuming section 101 does not include an ATB increase or reduction, here's how the 2021 CR rate for operations for TAFS 012 -3456/2021 would be calculated following the steps above. a) $100 million (FY 2020 amount provided in Act referenced in section 101 of the CR ) b) Subtract $50 million (recurring rescission) = $50 million c) Subtract $30 million (mandated transfer to other TAFS) = $20 million Using this example, the rate for operations would be $20 million , which would be reflected on line 1100 of the apportionment and/or any Treasury reporting (SF 133, etc.) for TAFS 012-3456/2021. For Treasury reporting and apportionment purposes, the rate for operations as provided by section 101 is reflected as a single number on line 1100 , and any rescissions, mandated transfers, or ATB increases or decreases that are factored into the rate for operations as specified above are not identified on lines separate from 1100. SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS Page 4 of Section 123 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) See section 123.5 for the rate for operations for enacted CR anomalies. See section 123. 7 f or more information on recurring account -specific rescissions. 123.3 How do I determine the automatically apportioned amount during a short -term CR by the Bulletin? For a short -term CR, OMB usually issues a Bulletin to automatically apportion funds. T his automatic apportionment applies to most TAFSs , but not all. For particular TAFSs, OMB may require a separ ate account -specific apportionment. Note that an agency may not obligate funds under a short -term CR that would impinge on final funding prerogatives of Congress. CRs usually include provisions directing agencies to execute programs using the most limited funding actions permitted in order to provide for continuing projects and activities. Agencies are also directed by the CR to not execute programs that would otherwise have high initial rates of operation or complete distribution of appropriations at the beginning of the year because of distribution of funds to States, foreign countries, grantees, or others. The last Bulletin that provide d detailed guidance on how to execute the FY 2023 short -term CR can be found here: OMB Bulletin No. 22 -02 Typically, the Bulletin will not automatically apportion the full rate for operations for a TAFS. For instance, the Bulletin usually apportions the \"pro-rata share\" of the rate for operations through the period of the CR or any extension thereof . The pro-rata share is usually calculated by multiplying the rate for operations by the percentage of the year covered by the CR . Using the example in section 123.2 , the p ro-rata share automatically apportioned to TAFS 0 12-3456/2021 for a CR ending December 15 would be calculated as follows: $20 m illion (rate for operations) x 20.82 percent (76 days/365 days (use 366 for a leap year)) = $4.164 million If a full -y ear appropriations Act (including a full -year CR) is enacted before the CR period is over (e.g., December 10), the amounts automatically apportioned by the Bulletin are unaffected (see section 120.41 ). The pro-rata percentage used for the autom atic apportionment is calculated and rounded to the hundredths for each short -term CR extension when enacted . For instance, a CR is enacted from October 1st to November 3rd (34/365=9.32%). The CR then gets extended until November 27th (23/365=6.30%). The CR is then further extended until December 15th (18 days/365=4.93%). The total amount automatically apportioned (even if, like stated above, the President enacts the full -year bill on December 10th) cumulatively is 20.55% of the agency's rate for operations. This method results in a different percentage if the agency tried to calculate from October 1st to December 15th (76/365=20.82%). It ma y be determined that a TAFS should be apportioned less than the amount automatically apportioned by the Bulletin to ensure that an agency does not impinge upon the final funding prerogatives of Congress. In these cases, an account -specific apportionment (section 120.2) approved by OMB is required. SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 123 123.4 How does the Bulletin automatically apportion funding during a short -term CR? The Bulletin automatically apportions the pro-rata share as a lump -sum amount on a Category B line . To get the lump -sum amount apportioned automatically to a Category A line, an agency need s to receive concurrence from its RMO via an email . If the agency's RMO concurs, the pro- rata share automatically apportioned would only be reflected in the quarter in which the CR is enacted and/or extended and would not spread over quarters. If an agency would prefer to spread the automatically apportioned amount among more than one Category B line, the agency must request an account-specific apportionment from its RMO as soon as possible. 123.5 How can anomalies impact funding for a TAFS during a short -term CR? Because the CR usually provides the funding levels and authorities enacted in the previous fiscal year , there may be cases where a program requires additional funding or different authorities to maintain operations during the CR . In these cases, a short -term CR may include a separate legislative provision (an \"anomaly\" ) addressing funding or authorities f or a specific TAFS or program . CR anomalies can impact a program in a number of different ways including, but not limited to, changing the rate for operations to provide additional funding, allowing more than the pro-rata share to be apportioned during the period of the CR (\"spend -faster \" anomalies), adding an authority not carried forward in section 101 of the CR, or removing or modifying an authority carried forward in section 101 of the CR. This section will focus on anomalies that change the rate for operations and spend -faster anomalies. a) Anomalies that change the rate for operations . This type of an anomaly may be required if the rate for operations provided by section 101 for a TAFS is not sustainable for the period of the CR . In order to increase the rate for operations of the TAFS above what is provided by section 101, additional authority is required. Using the example in section 123.2, an anomaly that would provide a higher than $2 0 million rate for operations is below. Sec. XXX. Notwithstanding section 101, amounts are provided for \"Account 1234\" at a rate for operations of $150,000,000. The example language replaces the $100 million that is provided by section 101 of the CR with $150 million. Based on the anomaly language, the new rate for operations would be calculated using the steps below. Note that all provisos and other authorities that applied to that funding under section 101, including recurring rescissions and transfers, continue to apply to the rate for operations provided by the anomaly unless specific legislative language is included in the anomaly to alter that authority. a) Take the full -year amount specified in the anomaly . b) Subtract any recurring account -specific rescissions followed by agency -specific rescission and then bill -wide reductions , if any , as included in appropriations Acts referenced in section 101. c) Add or subtract transfers mandated by the appropriations Acts referenced in section 101 . As an example, here's how the a rate for operations for TAFS 12 -3456/ XXXX with the enacted anomaly would be calcu lated following the steps above: a) $150 million (enacted amount in anomaly) . b) Subtract $50 million (recurring rescission) = $100 million. SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS Page 6 of Section 123 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) c) Subtract $30 million (mandated transfer to other TAFS) = $70 million. The rate for operations would be $70 million under the CR , which would be reflected on line 1100 of the apportionment and/or any Treasury reporting ( e.g., SF 133). The pro -rata share automatically apportioned by the Bulletin would be calculated using the $70 million . b) Spend-faster anomalies . Sometimes it may not be necessary for a TAFS to receive a higher rate for operations, but the TAFS may need more funding apportioned than the pro-rata share automatically apportioned by the Bulletin. This could be for a number of reasons , including, but not limited to, higher obligations anticipated during the expected period of the CR. Below is example anomaly language that would allow TAFS 0 12-3456 /XXXX to be apportioned more than the pro-rata share automatically apportioned. Sec. XXX. Amounts made available by section 101 for \" Account 1234 \" may be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to maintain activities x, y, and z. With this lan guage enacted, TAFS 0 12-3456/ XXXX would still receive a rate f or operations of $20 million (see section 123.2), but the TAFS may receive an account -specific apportionment during the period of the CR for an amount greater than the automatically apportioned amount ($4.164 million) as long as the rate for operations is not exceeded . For example, instead of basing the pro-rata share calculation on 76 days for a CR starting October 1 and ending December 15, this type of anomaly c ould allow the TAFS to be apportioned a pro -rata share based on 90 days for a CR of the same duration. Accordingly, the amount apportioned for TAFS 012-3456/2021 pursuant to the spend-faster anomaly for a CR starting October 1 and ending December 15 could be calculated as follows: $20 million (rate for operations) x 24.66 percent ( 90 days/365 days (use 366 for a leap year)) = $4.932 million An account -specific apportionment must be approved by OMB before the agency may obligate at a rate higher than the pro-rata share automatically apportioned by the Bulletin pursuant to the authority provided by a spend-faster anomaly . Using the example above, the Bulletin would apportion TAFS 12-3456/ XXXX $4.164 million unless and until an account -specific apportion ment is approved by OMB. Absent an enacted spend -faster anomaly, if a TAFS requires an amount that exceeds the amount automatically apportioned by the Bulletin, an exception apportionment must be requested by the agency and approved by OMB. For more information on exception apportionments, see section 123.16 . 123.6 Am I required to submit an account -specific apportionment request while I am funded by a short -term CR ? Generally, no. OMB will typically issue a Bulletin to automatically apportion amounts made available by a CR and may provide additional guidance on the types of account -specific apportionments that may be required and other specific CR execution issues. SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 123 123.7 How do recurring rescissions impac t the rate for operations of a TAFS under a short -term CR? Rescissions or cancellations of discretionary prior -y ear balances that were included in the prior- year appropriation A cts specified in section 101 of a short -term CR continue during the CR period and are factored into the rate for operations calculation as shown in section 123.2. OMB typically includes an attachment to the Bulletin that lists rescission s or cancellations enacted in the previous fiscal year that impact the current CR. The attachment also usually includes the level at which such rescissions recur to provide the amount to use when calculating the rate for operations. For example, Attachment B of the of the OMB CR Bulletin lists rescissions by TAFS, categorizes each recu rring rescission by how it should be applied during the CR, and also indicates which rescissions do not recur and should not be factored into the rate for operations. As i ndicated in the Attachment B of the OMB CR Bulletin , some recurring rescissions wil l be applied to new budget authority provided by section 101 of the CR based on the way the appropriations language directing the rescission is written. If the rescission language is broad enough to be applied to the budget authority provided by section 101 of the CR, it will be factored into the rate for operations. If the rescission language is more restrictive and can only apply to prior -year discretionary balances in a TAFS that do es not receive a rate for operations under section 101 of the CR, an ac count -specific apportionment by OMB is required to preclude these balances from obligation during the period of the CR. The only exception to this account -specific apportionment rule for recurring rescissions of prior -year balances is if language is enacted in the CR to allow Treasury Account Symbols (TAS s) that have this type of rescission to effectuate it as a reduction i n the rate for operations of the current applicable TAFS. \"Current applicable TAFS\" refers to any of the TAFS s within a TAS for which a rate for operations is provided by section 101 of the CR. This authority was provided in section 115 of the first CR. With this authority, recurring rescissions of prior -year balances can be factored into the rate for operations calculation of the current applicable TAFS and will be automatically apportioned by the Bulletin, unless otherwise directed. Additional details and specific instructions on recurring rescissions will be included in the Bulletin. 123.8 Do recurring changes in mandatory programs impact the rate for operations under a short - term CR? Changes in mandatory programs (CHIMP s) that continue as terms and conditions under section 101 of the CR and result in the reduction of mandatory funding (rescissions/cancellations, mandated transfers to other TAFSs, obligation delays, etc.) are not factored into the rate for operations. An account -specific apportionment is required during the period of the CR to preclude applicable resources from obligation. Reductions of this kind are typically included in an attachment to the Bulletin. For example, the reductions were included in Attachment C of the OMB CR Bulletin . CHIMPs that continue as terms and conditions under section 101 of the CR and do not result in a r eduction of mandatory funding (e.g., appropriations for or mandated transfers to mandatory programs) are factored into the rate for operations calculation for those TAFS and are automatically apportioned by the Bulletin. For more information on CHIMPs, see s ection 20.3. 123.9 How is transfer authority applied during a short -term CR? Non-expenditure m andated transfers in the appropriations Acts referenced in section 101 are factored into the rate for operations of both the giving and receiving TAFSs. Therefore, agencies do not have to SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS Page 8 of Section 123 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) execute the non -expenditure transfer, report transfers in GTAS, or reflect these transfers separately in account -specific apportionments, except as a preclusion for items discussed below. For the purposes of calculating a rate for operations under a short -term CR, a mandated transfer is defined as one in which the legislative transfer authority provided in the prior fiscal year appropriations Acts referenced in section 101 provides a specific dollar amount to be transferred and does not provide any flexibility for the agency to change that dollar amount or to choose the giving and receiving TAFS s involved in the transfer. Only mandated transfers that were executed as non -expenditure transfers in the previous fiscal year factor into the rate for operations calculation. If the givi ng TAFS does not have a rate for operations under section 101 an account-specific apportionment is required during the period of the CR to preclude the applicable resources from obligation . Section 123.8 discussed the account -specific apportionment required if the giving TAFS is mandatory . If the giving TAFS is discretionary and does not have a rate for operations, a similar account - specific apportionment is required. Not all mandated transfers in the previous fiscal year's appropriations Act use the language \"shall transfer\" . For instance, the appropriations language could instead call for funds to be derived from a specific source other than the general fund of the T reasury . If such authority was executed as a non - expenditure transfer the previous fiscal year, then it is considered a mandated transfer for purposes of calculating the rate for operations. Two such examples are listed below: \"For necessary expenses of the Inspector General in carrying out the provisions of the Inspector General Act of 1978, $250,000,000, to be derived by transfer from the Postal Service Fund and expended as authorized by section 603(b)(3) of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Ac t (Public Law 109 -535).\" \"For necessary expenses of the Office of Inspector General in carrying out the provisions of the Inspector General Act of 1978, $42,982,000, to be derived from the Deposit Insurance Fund, or, only when appropriate, the FSLIC Resolution Fund.\" Mandated transfers that were executed as expenditure transfers in the previous fiscal years are not used to calculate the rate for operations of the giving and receiving TAFS s. Instead, the giving TAFS retains the rate for operations and should execute the expenditure transfer from amounts apportioned to them during the period of the CR. Permissive transfer authority does not factor into a rate for operations. For purposes of calculating a rate for operations under a short -term CR, permissive transfer authority is defined as legislative transfer authority that provides flexibility in the amount transferred and/or the giving and receiving TAFS involved in the transfer. Below are some examples of transfer authority that is considered permissive for purposes of calculating the rate for operations : \"of which not to exceed $9,000,000 may be transferred to the Working Capital Fund: \" \"up to 2 percent of funds made available for grant or reimbursement programs under such headings shall be transferre d...\" \"Provided further, That any such amounts from the fund that the Attorney General determines are necessary to pay, first, for the costs of processing and tracking civil and criminal debt collection litigation activities, and thereafter for financial sy stems and for debt -collection-related personnel, administrative, and litigation expenses, in fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, shall be transferred to other appropriations accounts in the Department of Justice for paying the costs of such activities, SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 123 and sh all be in addition to any amounts otherwise made available for such purposes in those appropriations accounts: \" I n addition, any transfer authority provided in legislation outside of the appropriations Acts referenced in section 101 (i.e., authorized transfer authority) does not factor into the rate for operations. A n agency may utilize permissive or authorized transfer authority from within the amounts apportioned to it during the CR. The agency would need to request an account-specific apportionment for both the giving and receiving TAFS s in order to obligate against the transferred resources. If an agency is executing general transfer authority that has a percentage limit on the amount that can be given or received (e.g., not more than five percent may be transferred or not more than ten percent may be received), that percentage limitation is calculated against the rate for operations of the applicable TAFS. However, as stated above, the actual amounts that may be transferred are limited to the amounts apportioned to the giving TAFS. I n some cases, p erm issive transfer authority is provided to move funding be tween TAFS s within the same TAS . For example, for a TAS that has a $10 million appropriation with a one -year period of availability (POA) and a permissive carve-out (\"up to, \" \"not more than, \" or \"not to exceed\") of $2 million with a multi-year POA, the rate for operations for the account would be $10 million in the one -year TAFS. The agency would then have to execute a non-expenditure transfer to the multi -year POA to move amounts from within the amounts apportioned in the one -year TAFS for the period of the CR . The agency may transfer up to the $2 million statutory cap , as long as that amount is within the amounts apportioned. The agency would need to request an account-specific apportionment for both the giving and receiving TAFS s in order to obligate against the transferred resources. See section 120.41 for similar guidance for automatic apportionment authority for the full -year enacted appropriation. 123.10 How is sp ending authority from offsetting collections or offsetting receipts that is provided in annual appropriation A cts apportioned during a short -term CR? I n order to determine how apportionment of spending authority from offsetting collections or offsetting receipts that is provided in annual appropriations Acts is effectuated under a CR, it is imperative to first determine if the authority is under the rate for operations formula or is a term and condition of the CR and therefore not funded within the rate for operations. In general, if the previous fiscal year's appropriations Act appr opriated a specific dollar amount to an account - all or some of which would be derived from offsetting collections or offsetting receipts - then that dollar amount is a rate for operations. If the CR provides additional authority to spend what is collect ed (i.e., not a specific dollar amount), then such authority is a term and condition and not a rate for operation, so it requires a separate account-specific apportionment. In some cases, an agency may have a blanket apportionment to cover all spending authority provided as a term and condition of a short -term CR. F or example, in the following language below, the $8.0 million is the rate for operations and therefore is pro-rated under the automatic apportionment provided by the Bulletin. However, the aut hority in the second proviso to spend additional funds collected above $8.0 million is a term and condition. A separate account -specific apportionment is required to obligate pursuant to the authority provided in the second proviso. \"For necessary expenses to carry out section 3024 of the Solid Waste Dispo sal Act (42 U.S.C. 6939g), including the d evelopment, operation, mainten ance, and upgrading of the hazardous waste electronic manifest s ystem established b y such section, $ 8,000,000, t o remain available until expended: P rovid ed, That t he sum herein appropriated from t he ge neral f und shall be reduced as of fsetting collections un der such section 3024 are r eceived during fisca l year 2 019, SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS Page 10 of Section 123 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) which shall remain available until expended and be used for necessary expenses in this appropriation, so as to result in a final fiscal year 2019 appropriation from the general fund estimated at not more than $0: Provided further, That to the extent such offsetting collections received in fiscal year 2019 exceed $8,000,000, those excess amounts shall remain available until expended and be used for necessary expenses in this appropriation.\" In the second example below, the authority to collect and spend fees does not specify a dollar amount and therefore not part of the rate for operations. This spending authority is not automatically apportioned by the Bulletin and therefore requires a separate account -specific apportionment. \"The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is authorized to collect and obligate pesticide registration service fees in accordance with section 33 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended by Public Law 112-177, the P esticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2012.\" 123.11 How are appropriated entitlement or other mandatory payments and activities under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 apportioned during a short -term CR? Typically , the short -term CR contain s a provision that states that for appropriated entitlements and other mandatory payments whose budget authority was provided in the previous fiscal year's appropriations Acts referenced in section 101 , and for mandatory payments and activities under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, activities shall continue at the rate necessary to maintain program levels under current law and under the authority and conditions of the previous fiscal year's appropriations Act . In other words, these programs operate as normal . Additionally, the provision of the CR typically provides an additional 30 days of obligational authority and funding beyond the end date of the short -term CR, including any government shutdowns. The Bulletin typically apportions such sums as are necessary to maintain program levels as specified above. These programs are not limited to a pro-rata share or to a funding total provided in the previous fiscal year's fiscal appropriations Acts referenced in section 101. The programs provi ded this authority are within the accounts identified in the joint explanatory statement of managers accompanying the conference report on the Balanced Budget Act of 1977 ( House Report 105-217 , see page 1014 ), o r accounts with legislatively enacted directed scoring making otherwise discretionary appropriations mandatory. 123.12 Are earmarks or programs, projects, and activities (PPAs) in a TAFS apportioned on a pr o- rata basis by the Bulletin during a short -term CR ? No. The Bulletin automatically apportions the pro-rata share for each TAFS based on the rate for operations for the entire TAFS without regard to any earmarks or PPAs within the TAFS, and without a requirement that such earmarked amounts or PPAs also be pro-rated. Legislative e armark provisions continue as terms and conditions of the CR, and as such, they continue to remain in effect during the period of the CR. As in the case with other terms and conditions continuing in effect under a CR, agencies must comply with and not breach earmark provisions over the course of the fiscal year , including during the period of a CR. 123.13 What is apportioned during a short -term CR to a TAFS that receives no funding in the House or Senate bill? If either the House or Senate has reported out of committee or passed an appropriations bill that provides no funding for a whole TAFS (as opposed to merely providing no funding for a project, program or SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 123 activity within a TAFS) at the time the CR is enacted, that TAFS is automatically apportioned zero, even if that TAFS receives a rate for operations under section 101 . An agency must submit an account -specific apportionment request to OMB i f the agency want funds apportioned for that TAFS during the period of the CR, including any extensions of the CR. Agencies must also submit a written justification for any such request. This restrictive funding action is to ensure that an agency does no t impinge on final funding prerogatives of the Congress. However, if subsequently either the House or Senate does take action during the short -term CR to either report out of committee or pass an appropriations bill that provides funding for an account the TAFS, then the TAFS would be under the automatic apportionment as provided by the Bulletin. 123.14 Do the amounts provided as a rate for operations remain available after a short -term CR expires? It depends on the legislative action that follows the short -term CR or the absence of legislation that follows the CR (e.g., a lapse in appropriations). Generally, CRs make amounts available for obligation only until a time specified by the CR or until the enactment of regular fiscal year appropriations, whichever occurs first . A CR normally provides temporary funding and may specify any period of time (e.g., one day, a few days, a few weeks, or a month). It is generally understood that the normal appropriations process will eventually produce appropriation Acts to replace or terminate the CR , and it is also generally assumed that the full- year enacted level will be close to the level provided by the CR's rate for operations . An agency must consult its RMO if its full-year enacted level is much lower than the amounts apportioned against the CR's rate for operations. If a full -year CR follows a short -term CR, agencies must submit a reapportionment request for the full -year appropriations (see section 123. 20). This rule does not apply to unobligated funds from a rate for operations provided by a short -term CR if that CR is followed immediately by a lapse in appropriations (see section s 120.56 , 12 3. 23). 123.15 Do short -term CRs limit the purposes for which funds may be obligated? Generally, yes. A CR makes amounts available subject to the same terms and conditions specified in the en acted appropriations acts from the prior fiscal year unless otherwise stated in the statutory text . Normally, an agency is not permitted to start new PPAs for which authority did not exist in the previous fiscal year. 123.16 W hen may I request that OMB issue an exception apportionment during a short -term CR ? If an agency seeks an amount for a TAFS that is more than the pro -rata share automatically apportioned by the Bulletin, and the short -term CR does not provide that TAFS a spend -faster anomaly, then the agency may request an exception apportionment from OMB. Each request for an exception apportionment must be accompanied by a written justification that includes the legal basis for the request. OMB grants exception apportionment requests only in extraordinary circumstances. This is different from an account -specific apportionment for a spend -faster anomaly provided in the CR itself. An exception apportionment may be requested on the following bases: Seasonality . This basis will be considered only if the program experiences reg ular and predictable changes in the rate of obligations throughout the year due to programmatic requirements, using historical data from SF 133s or OMB approved account -specific apportionments. For example, a history of apportionment shows that the Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program has an established pattern of a higher rate of obligations in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year, when the temperatures are colder. Another example is funding for the protection of Presidential SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS Page 12 of Section 123 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) candidates and increased security at inaugurations every four years. Seasonality apportionment requests will not be approved simply because an agency prefers to sign full- year contracts at the beginning of the fiscal year, or if doing so would be business as usual under a full -year enacted appropriation. Annualizing a new program . This basis involves situations where a new program began late in the previous fiscal year and the partial year funding level for the previous fiscal year would not be sufficient to fund a full year's rate for operations this year. Safety of human life or protection of Federal property . This basis involves situations where the obligations could legally be incurred under the Antideficiency Act during a Government -wide lapse of appropria tions. 123.17 If I am funded by a short -term CR and have received an account -specific apportionment, will I have to submit account -specific reapportionment requests for each extension of the CR? No. In the case of TAFS that receive an account-specific apportionment at any time during a short -term CR period (exclusions noted below ), the automatic apportionment provided by the Bulletin will apply to such TAFSs under any subsequent extensions of the CR, provided that the total amount apportioned during the short -term CR period does not exceed the rate for operations provided by the CR . However, any footnotes on the account -specific apportionment continue to apply to the TAFS when subsequently operating under the automatic apportionment. Agencies must, however, submit account -specific apportionments for each extension of the CR for TAFS with zero -funding or utilizing a spend-faster anomaly. For TAFS with zero funding, account -specific apportionments must be submitted for each CR extension\u2014there i s no automatic apportionment . If an agency has already been apportioned a spend -faster anomaly or account -specific apportionment, then for subsequent extensions of the CR an agency will be only automatically apportioned an additional pro -rata share of the rate for operations. If an agency seeks to utilize the spend -faster CR anomaly for any CR extension, the agency must once again submit an account -specific apportionment. A full -year CR is not considered an extension of a short -term CR. The Bulletin typi cally does not apportion additional funding for a full -year CR. If a full -year CR is enacted, an agency must request a reapportionment within 10 calendar days of the enactment of the full- year CR (see section 123.20). If an agency need s a reapportionment of carryover balances o r any other budgetary resource not provided by the CR, after the Bulletin is in effect, and the agency's RMO does not require the agency to show the CR budget ary resources on the reapportion ment, then the agency must footnote the reapportionment as follows (\"A\" footnote on line 6190 total budgetary resources): \"In addition to the amounts apportioned above, this account is also receiving funds pursuant to Public Law XXX-XX X as automatically apportioned via OMB Bulletin XX -XX.\" If the CR is extended (e.g., a subsequent law amends the CR to extend the date of its applicability), then add \"as amended\" after \"Public Law XXX- XXX\" in the above footnote. 123.18 Are my credit programs funded under a short-term CR? Yes. Appropriations for subsidy cost amounts associated with direct and guaranteed loan activities that were conducted in the prior fiscal year are provided as a rate for operations in the same manner as other appropriations . Normally, the CR allows agencies to make new direct loans and new commitments to guarantee loans within the limitations on credit activity levels and subject to the terms and conditions SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 123 specified in the prior fiscal year appropriations A ct(s). If there is an enacted credit limitation (i.e., a limitation on loan principal or commitment level) in the previous fiscal year, the automatic apportionment is the pro -rata share of the credit limitation or rate for operations , whichever is more restrictive . In the two examples below, the appropriations Act specified in section 101 appropriates $5 million for subsidy costs and $200 million in loan limitation for direct loans. Assume the CR covers the first quarter of the fiscal year (92 days) , which results in a pro -rata share of roughly 25% , and that the prior fiscal year's subsidy rate was 5.00%. The current subsidy rate differs in each example. The examples show that along with other factors, the current subsidy rate impacts the amounts apportioned by the Bulletin for credit programs. To determine the amounts apportioned during a CR for Example 1, with a current subsidy rate of 8.00%: Step 1 - Calculate the pro -rata share of last year's enacted credit limitation: 25 % x $200 million = $50 million. The pro-rata share of the credit limitation would support a loan level of $50 million. Step 2 - Calculate the pro -rata share of the subsidy appropriation: 25% x $ 5 million = $1.25 million. Step 2A - Calculate the loan level that $1.25 million would support: To calculate the loan level, take budget authorit y and divide by the current subsidy rate (pro - rata share/subsidy rate = loan level). $1.25 million /.0800 = $15.625 million. The pro-rat a share would support a loan level of $15.625 million. Step 3 - Determine the lesser of the pro -rata share of the credit limitation or the budget authority: Compare the results of steps 1 and 2A. Since the pro -rata share of the subsidy provides for a lower loan level ($15.625 million < $50 million), the pro-rata share of the subsidy is the amount automati cally apportioned by the Bulletin . Under the CR, this direct loan program may obligate up to $1.25 million for subsidy costs , which may support a loan level of $15.625 million. Example 1: Current subsidy rate = 8.00% Pro-rata share (25%) Pro-rata loan level Amounts available under CR Credit limitation 200,000,000 50,000,000 50,000,000 1,250,000 in subsidy to support a loan level of 15,625,000 BA 5,000,000 1,250,000 15,625,000 SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS Page 14 of Section 123 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Example 2: Current subsidy rate = 1.00% Pro-rata share (25%) Pro-rata loan level Amounts available under CR Credit limitation 200,000,000 50,000,000 50,000,000 50,000,000 loan level which requires BA 5,000,000 1,250,000 125,000,000 500,000 in BA for subsidy cost See section 185.24 f or further information regarding the subsidy rates to be used for loans or loan guarantees at execution. 123.19 Do I have to request a warrant from Treasury for funds provided by a short -term CR? Generally, no. Treasury will not issue a warrant under a short -term CR unless an agency explicitly requests one (see Treasury Financial Manual I TFM2 -2000 , section 2025.20). Exceptions may be m ade on a case-by -case basis if the short -term CR extends beyond the second quarter of the fiscal year. Further Fiscal Service Treasury guidance may be found on the USSGL website (https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/ussgl/resources-implementation.html#budgetary ). 123.20 Do I need to request a reapportionment after my full -year appropriation is enacted? Yes. Agencies m ust request a reapportionment within 10 calendar days of the enactment of an agency's full-year appropriations Act (including a full- year CR) , even if the period covered by the CR has not expired. In the Previous Approved column, include the amounts apportioned under the short -term CR (includin g automatic apportionment amounts as provided by the Bulletin and section 120.41 . See exhibit 120H and section 120.61 ). The total amount subject to reapportionment will equal the total amount made available for the fiscal year in the regular appropriatio n. See below for further information on the following: Instructions on the apportionment process/format (see section 120 ) Detailed instructions fo r each line on the apportionment (see A ppendix F ) Until OMB approves an agency's first apportionment request for the fiscal year, and unless other wise determined by the agency's OMB representative, the agency will be under an automatic apportionment as specified in section 120.41 . 123.21 Will my full-year enacted appropriations cover obligations made during the CR? Yes. Normally , an agency's full- year enacted appropriations will cover all obligations made during the CR. However, there could be exceptions. See section 123.14 f or an example of an exception. Additionally, if the en acted full- year appropriations provides funds in a TAS that is a different period of availability (i.e., a different TAFS) than was provided under the short-ter m CR, see section 120.63. SECTION 123 \u2014APPORTIONMENTS UNDER CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 15 of Section 123 123.22 What if the full -year enacted appropriations subsequently provided less budget authority than obligations incurred under the short -term CR? Any agency must do everything possible to reduce the amount of its existing oblig ations so that the agency's obligations do not exceed the amounts provided in the full -year enacted appropriations. The agency must reduce obligations to the maximum extent possible \u2014returning purchases received for a refund, canceling purchases of goods a nd services ordered but not yet received, and canceling grants. For example, consider the following situation: (1) There was no indication that the Congress would enact a regular annual appropriation less than the amount available under the CR; (2) T he amount obligated was available under the CR; (3) The full -year enacted appropriation was subsequently less than the obligations incurred under the CR; and (4) The agency reduced obligations to the maximum extent possible (e.g., returned purchases received for a refund, cancelled purchases of goods and services ordered but not yet received, canceled grants, and transferred funds to the extent possible to cove r obligations made during the period of the CR). In this circumstance, it is expected that an agency will normally be able to reduce its CR -incurred obligations by a sufficient amount so that the agency's obligations during that fiscal year will not exc eed the level of the full- year enacted appropriation (and, thus, all of these obligations will be charged to the full-year enacted appropriation). However, in a case in which an agency is not able (after having de- obligated funds to the maximum extent pos sible or used existing transfer authority to cover obligations made during the period of the CR) to reduce its CR -period obligations to the level of the full -year enacted appropriation, then the amount by which the full -year enacted appropriation has been exceeded will be charged to the CR. If an agency's full -year enacted appropriations provided less budget authority than the obligations the agency incurred under the CR, the agency must contact its OMB examiner and request an apportionment (if the agency is subject to apportionment) that specifically footnotes that all of the requirements of this section have been met. For any supplemental warrant, the agency must also provide to its Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service contact an OMB -approved apportio nment stating that the conditions of this section have been met. 123.23 What happens to my apportioned, unobligated short -term CR funding if the short -term CR is followed by a lapse in appropriations? During a lapse in appropriations, any unobligated funding from a rate for operations that was provided by the CR and apportioned by OMB is not available for obligation . This includes unobligated funds from rate for operations for to multi- year and no -year TAFSs by the CR. This also includes any apportionments related to the authority provided as term and condition of the CR to be able to retain and spend collections. If the short -term CR includes a provision that provides a full -year appropriation to a sp ecific TAFS, amounts apportioned from that specific appropriation remain available during a lapse in appropriations.

Summary of Changes Reminds agencies to submit their updated lapse plans (section 124.2). 124.1 What types of actions may my agency conduct during a lapse in appro priations? (a) Background. The Attorney General issued two opinions in the early 1980s holding that the language and legislative history of the Antideficiency Act unambiguously prohibit agency officials from incurring obligations in the absence of appropriations (\"Applicability of the Antideficiency Act Upon a Lapse in an Agency's Appropriations\" (1980) and \"Authority for the Continuance of Government Functions During a Temporary Lapse in Appropriations\" (1981)). The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion dated August 16, 1995 that reaffirms and updates the 1981 opinion. (b) Policies . This section provides policy guidance and instructions for actions to be taken by Executive Branch agencies when the Congress fails to enact regular appropriations, a continuing resolution, or needed supplemental appropriations, resulting in a lapse of appropriations. This section does not apply to specific appropriations action by the Congress to deny program funding. When the Congress fails to act on program supplementals and the result is partial funding interruptions, special procedures beyond those outlined in this section may be warranted. In such cases, you should consult your OMB representative. Within the guidance established by the opinions issued by the Department of Justice and this Circular, agency heads, in consultation with their general counsels, must decide what agency activities are excepted or otherwise legally authorized to continue during a lapse in appropriations. Agencies should address questions to OMB, including questions about the interpretation of the Anti deficiency Act. OMB will engage with the agency and the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, as necessary and appropriate. SECTION 124 \u2014AGENCY OPERATIONS IN THE ABSENCE OF APPROPRIATIONS Page 2 of Section 124 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 124.2 What plans should my agency make in anticipation of a lapse in appropriations? Agency heads, in consultation with their general counsels, must develop and maintain plans for an orderly shutdown in the event of a lapse in appropriations. Up-to -date plans must be on file with OMB. Whenever there is a change in the source of funding for an agency program or any si gnificant modification, expansion, or reduction in agency program activities, the agency must submit an updated plan to OMB for review that reflects this change. In updating their plans, agencies also should note any changes made to their plans in light of their experiences during any recent lapse in appropriations. At a minimum, agencies should submit updated plans to OMB for review every two years, in the odd- numbered years, on August 1. P lans should be updated in 2023. Plans should be submitted to your OMB examiner and with a copy to the following email address: Section124Plans@omb.eop.gov. Agencies may also contact this email address with questions. Given that the duration of a lapse in appropriations is inherently uncertain, your plan should describe agency actions to be taken during a short -term lapse (1 -5 days). It also should identify anticipated changes if the lapse extends beyond that time period. Your plan should also designate personnel responsible for implementing and adjusting the plan to respond to the length of the lapse in appropriations and changes in external circumstances. Include the following at the beginning of your plan, using the template below : Lapse Plan Summary Overview Estimated time (to nearest half day) required to complete shutdown activities: # days Total number of agency employees expected to be on board before implementation of the plan: # employees Total number of agency employees expected to be furloughed under the plan (unduplicated count) : # employees Total number of employees to be retained under the plan for each of the following categories (may include duplicated counts) : Compensation is financed by a resource other than annual appropriations: # employees Necessary to perform activities expressly authorized by law: # employees Necessary to perform activities necessarily implied by law: # employees Necessary to the discharge of the President's constitutional duties and powers: # employees Necessary to protect life and property: # employees Brief summary of significant agency activities that will continue during a lapse: Brief summary of significant agency activities that will cease during a lapse: SECTION 124 \u2014AGENCY OPERATIONS IN THE ABSENCE OF APPROPRIATIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 124 The plan should then proceed to describe in detail, for each component within your agency, the following: To the extent that specific shutdown activities will not be completed within one -half day, specify the nature of each such activity, together with the time and the number of empl oyees necessary to complete the activity; The total number of employees in the component to be on-board before implementation of the plan; The total number of employees in the component expected to be furloughed under the plan; The total number of empl oyees to be retained in the component under the plan for each of the categories listed above (i.e., the employees ' compensation is financed by carryover funds or an appropriation provided by permanent law , they are necessary to perform activities expressly authorized by law, they are necessary to perform activities necessarily implied by law, they are necessary to the discharge of the President's constitutional duties and powers, or they are necessary to protect life and property) . If an employee fits in m ore than one category, they may be reflected in the count for all applicable categories (i.e., count may be duplicated), in order to ensure the best estimate of the number of employees within each category ; and The agency's legal basis for each of its determinations to retain categories of employees, including a description of the nature of the agency activities in which these employees will be engaged. To the extent that any of the information described above is expected to change should a lapse in appropriations extend for a prolonged period of time (i.e., longer than 5 days), the plan should explicitly describe these changes. In particular, the plan should indicate any points in time when the furlough statu s of employees may change, how many employees would be affected, and the legal basis for such changes. Agencies should consult with an OMB representative at such points in time during a lapse in appropriations to make OMB aware of any such changes. In ad dition, during a lapse in appropriations agencies should make an OMB representative aware of any instances where actions deviate from what is set forth in the plan. Agency plans should also describe the actions that will be necessary to resume orderly operations once appropriations are restored, including: Methods for notifying employees that the shutdown furlough has ended and that they are to return to work on a specified day (normally the employee's next scheduled workday after the furlough has ended); Flexibilities available to supervisors if employees have problems returning to work on the day specified by the agency, including the use of accrued annual leave, compensatory time off, or credit hours; Procedures for resuming program activities, includ ing steps to ensure appropriate oversight and disbursement of funds. At the time employees are given furlough notices, agencies should provide them as much information as possible regarding how the agency will go about resuming operations after the furlough has ended . SECTION 124 \u2014AGENCY OPERATIONS IN THE ABSENCE OF APPROPRIATIONS Page 4 of Section 124 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) 124.3 When should my agency's shutdown plans be implemented? OMB will monitor the status of congressional actions on appropriations bills and will notify agencies if shutdown plans are to be implemented. Whenever it appears that a lapse in appropriations might occur, you should review your shutdown plans, and, if revisions are required, promptly submit the revised plan to OMB and post the revised plan on your agency website . When agencies submit their plans to OMB , they should provide OMB with information on the agency personnel that would serve as a point of contact in the event of a lapse. While agencies are ultimately responsible for preparing and implementing orderly shutdown plans, all changes to the plans must be submitted to OMB for review in advance of implementing the plan. One week prior to the expiration of appropriations bills, regardless of whether the enactment of appropriations appears imminent, OMB will communicate with agency senior officials to remind agencies of their re sponsibilities to review and update orderly shutdown plans, and will share a draft communication template to notify employees of the status of appropriations. OMB will hold follow -up communications on a periodic basis until such time as appropriations are enacted or a lapse in appropriations occurs. Approximately t wo business days before a potential lapse in appropriations, in coordination with OMB, agencies should notify employees of the status of funding using the OMB -provided employee notification. OMB will notify agencies when they should begin to inform employees of their individual status (e.g., furloughed or not) under a lapse. After OMB has communicated that appropriations have lapsed , OMB will provide guidance to agencies directing the initiation of orderly shutdown activities. Each agency head must determine the specific actions that will be taken; however, all actions must contribute to an orderly shutdown of the agency. All individual employees should have been notified of their status under a lapse by this time. Agency heads will notify OMB immediately once shutdown activities are initiated. During a lapse in appropriations, agencies should only engage in activities consistent with their shutdown plan. Agencies must take necessary perso nnel actions to release employees in accordance with applicable law and regulations of the Office of Personnel Management. You must prepare employee furlough notices and process personnel and pay records in connection with shutdown furlough actions. You should plan for these functions to be performed by employees who are retained for orderly termination of agency activities as long as those employees are available. Agencies should also establish clear protocols for how employees will be provided with fur lough notices, contacted to be recalled to work following the end of the lapse in appropriations or should their furlough status change in accordance with the ir agency 's plan, and informed of pertinent pay and leave information during the lapse. Where appropriate, agencies should seek to utilize available technology to allow employees maximum flexibility in returning to work. OMB will notify you once the lapse in appropriations has ended so that you can begin implementing your plan to orderly resume agency activities. 124.4 How may my agency receive lapse communications updates from OMB? Executive Branch agencies may receive updates on the status of appropriations at the OMB Communications Regarding a Lapse in Appropriations page. Addi tional resources are provided on this page and all agencies are encouraged to visit the page one week prior to the expiration of annual appropriations Acts, regardless of whether the enactment of appropriations appear s imminent. SECTION 124 \u2014AGENCY OPERATIONS IN THE ABSENCE OF APPROPRIATIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Section 124 To receiv e lapse updates via email, agency employees must join the group by following instructions on the page . Receiving email updates is optional ; all updates will be provided on the OMB Com munications Regarding a Lapse in Appropriations page . 124.5 Am I automatically apportioned obligational authority for agency operations that are authorized by law to continue in the absence of appropriations ? Yes. You are automatically apportioned the am ounts necessary to carry out your agency 's shutdown plan as required by this section. This automatic apportionment provides authority to incur obligations, but does not provide any authority to liquidate such obligations. This automatic apportionment does not affect previously approved current -year apportionments for non- continuing resolution (CR) funds, such as multi -year and permanent law appropriations. See sections 120.55 and 123.23 for what happens to apportioned CR funds if the lapse in appropria tions follows a CR.

O VERVIEW 130.1 What is the purpose of the SF 133 and how is it organized? T he SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources: Fulfills the requirement in 31 U.S.C. 1511 -1514 t hat the President review Federal expenditures at least four times a year.SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 4 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Fulfills the requirement in 31 U.S.C. 1554 to report on unliquidated obligations, unobligated balances, canceled balances, and adjustments made to appropriation accounts during the completed fiscal year. Allows the monitoring of the status of funds that were apportioned on the SF 132 Apportionment and Reapportionment schedule and funds that were not apportio ned. Provides a consistent presentation of information across programs within each agency, and across agencies, which helps program, budget, and accounting staffs to communicate. Provides historical reference that can be used to help prepare the President 's Budget, program operating plans, and outlay rate estimates. Provides a basis to determine obligation patterns when programs are required to operate under a continuing resolution. Ties an agency 's financial statements to its budget execution. The compilation of an agency 's SF 133s should generally agree with an agency 's Statement of Budgetary Resources. The few differences are explained in section 130.18(e). The SF 133 consists of the following sections: Section... shows whether.... and is described in: Budgetary resources budgetary resources are available for obligation or not Appendix F, Budgetary resources Status of budgetary resources budgetary resources have been obligated or not Appendix F, Status of budgetary resources Change in obligated balance obligated balances changed Appendix F, Change in obligated balance Budget authority and outlays, net obligated amounts have been outlayed or not Appendix F, Budget authority and outlays, net 130.2 What are the general requirements for submitting SF 133s? (a) What accounts should I report? Unless otherwise specified by OMB, all Executive Branch agencies must electronically submit SF 133 information each quarter for each open Treasury appropriation fund symbol (TAFS). Do submit SF 133 reports for: Unexpired (i.e. current) TAFSs; Expired TAFSs (including TAFSs about to be closed and annual TAFSs that are older than five years that have legally authorized extended disbursing authority); Both apportioned TAFSs and those that have not been apportioned; and Credit program, financing, and liquidating TAFSs (see section 185 for detailed information). SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 130 Do not submit SF 133 reports for: Deposit fund accounts; Receipt accounts (including clearing accounts and suspense accounts); and Closed TAFSs (i.e. TAFSs with canceled balances) unless required by OMB. (b) What level of detail should I report? Submit SF 133s for each expired and unexpired TAFS. Report amounts as cumulative from the beginning of the fiscal year to the end of the p eriod. Because one of the main purposes of the SF 133 is to monitor the use of the funds planned on the SF 132 Apportionment; in general, your SF 133 should contain the same level of detail as your SF 132 Apportionment. (c) How do I submit an SF 133? You must submit SF 133 budget execution information electronically through the Treasury 's Government - wide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS). This facilitates analysis and ensures consistent presentation of budget execution information so that Government -wide totals are meaningful. Electronic submission of the information also allows the SF 133 to be presented on the MAX Budget Community pages at https://community.max.gov/x/cwM to f acilitate communication among accounting, budget, and audit staff. Those outside of the MAX Budget Community can access the budget execution information through OMB 's public site , which shares the same reports as the MAX Budget Community. You can find out more about GTAS at https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/gtas/ . GTAS does not replace the SF 133, but rather replaces previous systems used to collect SF 133 information. (d) Who can approve an SF 133 submission? SF 133 information submitted for each independent agency, departmental bureau, or similar subdivision will be certified by an officer duly authorized by the head of the agency to be responsible for the integrity of the submission. Typically, one group within your agency (for example, the accounting office) repor ts amounts to Treasury while another group (for example, the budget office) prepares budget schedules (see section 82.12). Before the accounting office submits its actuals to Treasury in GTAS, you must ensure that the amounts you are going to report are c onceptually and numerically consistent with the amounts that your budget office is going to report in MAX A- 11 DE. In addition, GAO requires your auditors to determine whether controls exist to ensure that the amounts in your systems and the amounts submi tted via GTAS agree. See GAO- 02-126G \" Guide for Auditing the Statement of Budgetary Resources \" (see section 82.12). (e) When do I submit an SF 133? You must submit SF 133 budget execution information at the end of November, July, August, and each quarte r. However, submitting information on expired TAFSs is optional for the additional monthly reporting for November, July, and August. You can find out the reporting deadlines at https://www.fiscal.treas ury.gov/gtas/ . The GTAS window opens approximately one week after the close of reporting month or each quarter. You must revise any material errors in previously reported information SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 6 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) through GTAS at this time as well. You also must be able to produce a monthly SF 133 when required by OMB. (f) What other budget execution reporting requirements must I meet? You must submit a copy of the SF 133 for November, July, August, and each quarter directly to the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives. To the extent practicable, you should submit all the reports for each independent agency, departmental bureau, or similar subdivision together and numbered consecutively. You may use printouts of SF 133s from GTAS. You may also encourage or make arrangements with the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives to electronically retrieve the information through OMB 's public site , which shares the same reports as the MAX Budget Community. You should periodically compare the estimates of anticipated amounts (e.g., contained on SF 132 lines results to improve future estimates. See Appendix F . DETAILED GUIDANCE 130.3 How do I report budgetary resources? To use the entries in this section of the SF 133, see Appendix F, Budgetary resources . The Appendix F includes specific instructions for unexpired TAFSs, expired TAFSs, and expired TAFSs being closed. \"Expir ed TAFSs being closed \" refers to the final September 30 SF 133 that is submitted for a TAFS (e.g., the September 30 report for an annual TAFS that has been expired for five years). For unobligated balance brought forward, do not include any amounts for ( 1) indefinite appropriations, except special and trust fund receipts; (2) indefinite borrowing authority; or indefinite contract authority. For adjustments to indefinite budget authority, refer to lines 1100, 1101, 1102, 1200, 1201, 1202, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600 of Appendix F as well as http://www.fms.treas.gov/ussgl for the appropriate USSGL . 130.4 How do I report the status of budgetary resources? To use the entries in this section of the SF 133, see Appendix F, Status of budgetary resources. 130.5 How do I report obligations, and how are obligations shown on SF 133 reports? Agencies need to use the same descriptive stubs for Category B (by project) and Category AB (combination of fiscal quarters and projects) obligations as appear on their approved apportionment. For Category A, Category B, and Category AB obligations that use program reporting categories, agencies need to use the same stub description used on the apportionment. OMB sends a list of program reporting category stubs, as well as Category B and AB stubs, from approved apportionments to the Department of the Treasury 's Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) for use in GTAS budget execution reporting. See sections 120.68 through 120.71 for additional information. When reporting your obligations, GTAS will present you with a list of program reporting categories, Category B projects and Category AB fiscal quarters/projects to report upon; these Category B projects, Category AB fiscal quarters/projects, and reporting categories are taken from OMB 's automated apportionment system. OMB sends this information to Fiscal Service so OMB can use automated tools to align program report categories, Category B projects, and Category AB fiscal quarters/projects on the approved apportionments to the SF 133 reports. Prior to this change, OMB was unable to create automated reports that compare apportioned amounts (from the SF 132) and obligations (from the SF 133) by Category B project. The SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 130 reaso n is that the SF 132s and SF 133s used different names for the Category B projects, so it was impossible to use a computer program to line up the projects by name. When reporting your obligations to GTAS, you must first report the same categories as used in the apportionment. If necessary, you may then add new Category B project, Category AB fiscal quarters/projects, and/or Categories A, B, or AB program reporting category stubs. Here are some reasons why you may need to add new Category B projects, Category AB fiscal quarters/projects, and/or Categories A, B, or AB program reporting categories: First, you must report all obligations that took place during the reporting period. You must add Category B projects, Category AB fiscal quarters/projects, and/ or Categories A, B, or AB program reporting categories if GTAS does not provide you with a comprehensive list of Category A, B, or AB program reporting categories and/or Category B projects or Category AB fiscal quarters/projects to report all your obligat ions. Second, if you are aware that OMB has apportioned funds using Category B projects or Category AB fiscal quarters/projects that are not presented in GTAS, then you should add the missing Category B projects or Category AB fiscal quarters/projects name s, and report your obligations for those projects. Third, if you are aware that OMB has used Category A, B, or AB program reporting categories that are not presented in GTAS, then you should add the missing program reporting category names, and report your obligations for those categories. The apportioned amounts submitted to GTAS are presented in three ways on the SF 133 reports produced by GTAS and OMB. First, obligations are summarized into the following categories: (1) Direct, Category A; (2) Direct, All Category B projects; (3) Direct, exempt from apportionment; (4) Reimbursable, Category A; (5) Reimbursable, All Category B projects; and (6) Reimbursable, exempt from apportionment. Second, the SF 133s show obligations by Apportionment Category (A, B, or AB), and then by Category B project (for Category B, only), Category AB fiscal quarters/projects (for Category AB, only) or program reporting category (Category A, Category B, and Category AB). Third, the SF 133s show funds apportioned for future fiscal years on line 2202. Exhibit 130C shows how the obligations are reported for one TAFS. 130.6 How do I report the change in obligated balances? To use the entries in this section of the SF 133, see Appendix F, Change in obligated balances. Lines 3000 through 3200 are required for all quarters. 130.7 How do I report budget authority and outlays, net? To use the entries in this section of the SF 133, see Appendix F, Budget authority and outlays, net . Lines 4180 and 4190 are required for all quarters. SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 8 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 130.8 What should I report during the expired phase? Budget execution reporting procedures. Obligated and unobligated balances must be reported on the SF 133 for each expired TAFS that has not been canceled. September 30 SF 133 reports for annual TAF Ss and the last year of multi -year TAFSs that expire at midnight on September 30 should report these TAFSs as unexpired. Expired unobligated balances. At the beginning of the first expired year, place the expired unobligated balance on line 1000, \" Unob Bal: Brought forward, October 1. \" This amount should equal the sum of the lines in the unobligated balances section of the final report of budget execution for the unexpired phase, i.e., the sum of lines 2201 through 2303, \" Unob Bal: Bal: Unapportioned. \" These unobligated balances are now expired budgetary resources. They are available for obligation only for valid upward adjustments of obligations that were properly incurred against the TAFS during the unexpired phase. Since the expired resources are no longer available for new obligations, place the amounts not used for valid adjustments on line 2403, \"Unob Bal: Unapportioned: Other. \" In each succeeding expired year, the amount on line 1000, \"Unob Bal: Brought forward, October 1, \" should be the same as the amount on line 2403, Unob Bal: Unapportioned: Other, \" of the final report of budget execution for the prior year. 130.9 How do I report adjustments to expired TAFSs? Downward adjustments. Place downward adjustments of unpaid obligations previously incurred on line 1021, \"Unob Bal: Recov of prior year unpaid obligations. \" The amount should be included as a positive number because it increases the expired resources available only f or future adjustments. Downward adjustments do not include previously paid obligations which require a refund. These refunds will be recorded on line 1033, \"Recoveries of prior year paid obligations \" or line 1700 or 1800, \"Collected \" (in limited cases) (see Appendix F ), when received. Upward adjustments . Place upward adjustments of obligations previously incurred on detailed lines 2001 through 2103, \" New Obligations and upward adjustments. \" Upward adjustments of obligations reduce unobligated balances. Subtract upward adjustments from the expired unobligated balances on line 2403, \"Unob Bal: Unapportioned: Other \" The amount should represent the upward adjustments made during the fiscal year for which the report is submitted. Upward adjustments made during previous fiscal years should not be included because the amounts on line 2403, \"Unob Bal: Unapportioned: Other ,\" have already been adjusted downward. Upward adjustments are limited in at least two ways: Upward adjustments are limited by the amount available for adjustments on line 2403, \"Unob Bal: Unapportioned: Other, \" of the expired TAFS. No new obligations may be shown in the expired TAFS columns. Only upward adjustments of obligations that were incurred in the year in which the amount was available for obligation are valid, i.e., recording obligations that were incurred previously but reported in a different amount or erroneously not reported. Obligation adjustments for contract changes. Upward adjustments to obligations in expired TAFSs, caused by \"contract changes\" that exceed certain cumulative thresholds, are subject to additional reporting and approval requirements as shown in the following table. A \" contract change\" means an order relating to an SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 130 existing contract under which a contractor is required to perform additional work. A contract change does not include adjustments related to an escalation clause. For the Department of Defense, obligational increases for contract changes are cumulative at the program, project, and activity level. For civilian agencies, such increases are cumulative at the appropriation level. If the contract change will cause cumulative obligational increases to an appropriation to exceed... Then the agency head... $4 million during a fiscal year (or a designated officer in his immediate office) must approve the contract change. $25 million during a fiscal year must report the contract change in writing to the appropriate authorizing committees in Congress and to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations before the obligation is made. Include a description of the legal basis and policy reasons for the proposed obligation. Do not make or record the obligation in your accounting records until 30 days after submitting the report. 130.10 What must I do when I have extended disbursement authority? The length of the expired phase of TAFSs may only be changed by law. You must prepare budget execution reports in accordance with Appendix F. Also, you must report such authority to Treasury 's Bureau of the Fiscal Service to prevent premature, automatic cancellation of the TAFS. The unobligated balance for TAFSs with extended disbursing authority will not be canceled at the end of the fifth expired year. The unobligated balance will remain in the expired phase until the TAFS is closed. For further guidance, you should consult the Treasury Financial Manual. Normally, payment of canceled balances will not be eligible for funding from Treasury 's general claims fund. 130.11 How do I report expired TAFSs that are being closed? Expired obligated and unobligated balances must be reported as canceled on the final, September 30 SF 133 before you close the TAFS. Once an amount is reported as canceled, it should not be reported again. Note: Technically, TAFSs are \" closed, \" while appropriations and balances are \" canceled. \" Cancellations of unobligated balances. On the final, September 30 SF 133 before a TAFS will be closed, you must present all unobligated balances as canceled, i.e., as a negative ( -) on line 1029, \" Unob Bal: Other balances withdrawn. \" On all SF 133s, other than the final, September 30 SF 133 before a TAFS will be closed, you should show recoveries of prior year unpaid obligations on line 1021, \" Unob Bal: Recov of prior year unpaid obligations,\" as an expired resource. You should add any part of a recovery that is not used to adjust obligations to the expired unobligated balance shown on line 2403, \"Unob Bal: Unapportioned: Other. \" Cancellations of obligated balances. When a TAFS is required to be closed, you must present any remaining obligated balance as canceled by doing the following: SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 10 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Include it as a cancellation (a positive number) on line 1021, \" Unob Bal: Recov of prior year unpaid obligations; \" Include it as a writeoff (a negative number) on line 1029, \" Unob Bal: Other balances withdrawn;\" and Reduce the payments, line 3090, \" Ob Bal: EOY: Uncoll cust payments from Fed srcs, EOY\" to zero. In addition to cancellations of unobligated and obligated balances, you must also address the cancellations of prepaid/advanced obligations. Because these amounts were previously reflected as disbursements, the amounts are not reflected in either of the unobligated and obligated balances. 130.12 What disbursements can I make during the canceled phase? Legitima tely incurred obligations that have not been disbursed (i.e., paid) at the time a TAFS is canceled cannot be disbursed from the canceled obligated or unobligated balances of the canceled TAFS. After a TAFS is canceled, any obligations or adjustments to obligations that would have been properly chargeable to that TAFS may be disbursed from an unexpired TAFS that is available for obligation for the same purpose as the closed TAFS, provided that: The obligation or adjustment is not already chargeable to a nother unexpired TAFS. Payment of obligations against canceled TAFSs from unexpired TAFSs are limited to one percent of the appropriation in the unexpired TAFS. No more than one percent of an unexpired TAFS may be used to pay any combination of canceled obligations. This is a single, cumulative limit. It applies to one percent of the annual appropriation (not total budgetary resources) for annual TAFSs and to unexpired appropriations for multi -year TAFSs. For example, assume there is a multi-year TAF S with an appropriation of $10 million that covers fiscal years 2023 through 2025 that was enacted in fiscal year 2023. In fiscal year 2023, the one- percent limitation is equal to $100,000. At the end of fiscal year 2023, $90,000 was used. In fiscal year 2024, the unused, unexpired portion ($10,000) of the limitation is available for upward adjustment and disbursement of an obligation from a canceled predecessor TAFS. Antideficiency Act provisions continue to apply to canceled TAFSs. The authority to pay obligations against closed TAFSs from one percent of unexpired TAFSs cannot be used to exceed the original appropriation. When you cancel obligations under the provisions of Public Law 101- 510 ( 31 U.S.C. 1551 -1557 ), a tracking process should be mai ntained. You must maintain proper U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) controls for obligations pertaining to canceled appropriations to prevent overpayment. Therefore, you must maintain accurate records of balances and control of adjustments for canceled TAFSs that (1) affect the appropriation of the unexpired TAFS or (2) do not affect the appropriation of the unexpired TAFS due to offsets between/among canceled TAFSs. The Treasury 's Bureau of the Fiscal Service provides USSGL accounting instructions. See http://www.fms.treas.gov/ussgl for further information.

Agencies must comply with 31 U.S.C. 1551 -1557, as added by section 1405 of Public Law 101- 510 (1990). Refer to section 130.13 . SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS 130.14 How do I submit non-standard reports? You must submit additional monthly budget execution reports when required by OMB. Submit these directly to your OMB representative. Use the SF 133 format and lines described in Appendix F. Provide a separate column of information for each unexpired and expired TAFS. The columns should be formatted in the following order: unexpired, expired, and total. Report amounts in whole dollars. The submission of a monthly report does not relieve you of providing an electronic submission through GTAS each quarter. OMB 's policy is to use existing agency internal reports to the greatest extent feasible to support required reports. When existing agency internal reports do not include the information necessary to provide complete information on the progress and status of p rograms, projects, or activities, supporting information may be required by OMB. See section 20 on definitions, concepts, and terminology for additional guidance related to preparation of the SF 133. SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 130 130.15 How do I report lower levels of detail? You can report lower levels of detail on the SF 133 in a variety of ways as follows: Method Description Category A If your SF 132 apportions funds on lines 6001 through 6004 \"Category A \" and provides the Program Reporting Category codes within the apportionment, then you must provide the same level of detail on the lines 2001 and/or 2101. Category B If your SF 132 apportions funds on lines 6011 through 6169 \"Category B \" at a certain level, then you must provide the same level of detail on the lines 2002 and/or 2102. Treasury Sub -account You may need to report certain SF 133s by Treasury sub -account. OMB and you may decide that a Treasury sub -account be established to identify a certain level of detail not only on the SF 133 but also on other reports submitted to the Treasury. The establishment of a Treasury sub -account for an account may affect Treasury reporting requirements (such as the SF 224 Statement of Transactions). Footnotes For information that is integral to understanding the content of the SF 133 but cannot be reported in one of the more standardized methods described above, you may footnote any amount reported on the SF 133. If your OMB representative requires a footnote, then it must be provided. Consult with your OMB representative to determine the best method for your situation. 130.16 How do I submit an SF 133 for allocation accounts? The parent agency must ensure that a separate SF 133 is submitted for each allocation transfer account through GTAS. When allocation transfers are made from a parent account to allocation accounts, then an SF 133 will be submitted for each allocation account to report its activities. The parent agency will determine who will submit th e information through GTAS and how. Regardless of who submits the information through GTAS, the activity of both the parent account and the allocation accounts will be reported on the parent agency 's Statement of Budgetary Resources. The parent agency may choose to: (a) gather information from all of the agencies that have allocation accounts and enter the information into GTAS, or (b) require each agency with an allocation account to enter information into GTAS and provide a copy to the parent agency. Agencies reporting these allocation accounts will furnish information to the other agency or agencies involved in the allocation in a timely manner. Receiving agencies with allocation accounts must submit the information required to the parent agency no later than 12 calendar days following the end of the reporting period or a date required by the parent to meet its reporting and auditing deadlines, whichever comes first. 130.17 How do I submit an SF 133 for credit TAFSs? You should submit SF 133s for c redit TAFSs at the TAFS level during quarters one through three, but at the cohort level in the fourth quarter. To determine the SF 133 aggregation of credit TAFS reporting that is required for your agency, consult your OMB representative. For additional instructions for preparing the SF 133 for credit programs, see section 185. SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 14 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 130.18 How do I ensure that my actuals are consistent? Amounts reported on the fourth quarter SF 133 must be consistent with information reported to Treasury as part of year-end closing procedures and must be based on actual accounting information pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3512 . Actuals submitted to OMB for inclusion in the President 's annual budget, which is submitted to the Congress, should agree with those submitted to Treasury and those submitted on the fourth quarter SF 133. If one group within your agency (for example, accounting) reports amounts to Treasury while another group (for example, the budget office) prepares budget schedules, then you must take action to ensure that the amounts reported are conceptually and numerically consistent. It may be advisable to allow the budget office to review your SF 133 information before it is submitted. (a) What reports of actuals should generally be the same? September 30 SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources. Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) (if required). Budget Program and Financing Schedule (PY actual column). Treasury Combined Statement. CTA: Classification Transactions and Accountability (used to generate Treasury Combined Statement). FS 1219 Statement of Accountability (used to generate Treasury Combined Statement). FS 1220 Statement of Transactions (According to Appropriations, Funds and Receipt Accounts) (used to generate Treasury Combined State ment). Your agency 's accounting system. (b) What guidance is available to help me ensure that my actuals are reported consistently? See section 82.12. Treasury Financial Manual U.S. Government Standard General Ledger Supplement, which contains crossw alks from the USSGL to the SF 133/SBR, and Program and Financing schedule. It is available at http://www.fms.treas.gov/ussgl . (c) What differences should I expect between the September 30 SF 133 and the Budget Appendix? The SF 133 is displayed at the TAFS level, while the Appendix presents consolidated information covering all TAFSs (annual, multiple -year, and no- year) with the same account title. Also, an account in the Appendix may contain multiple TAFSs with different titles. OMB Circular A- 11 requires that allocation transfer accounts be consolidated and reported by the parent account for budget formulation purposes. OMB Circular A -11 requires that allocation accounts be reported separately for budget execution purposes (see section 130.16). The sum of the information on all the SF 133s with the same account title should be the same as the information required for the Appendix . The SF 133 is reported in dollars, while the Program and Financing schedule is in millions of dollars. (d) What differences should I expect among the September 30 SF 133, the Budget Appendix, and Treasury Combined Statement? For trust or special funds where budget authority is limited by law, unobligated balances at the en d of the fiscal year reported in the Treasury Combined Statement (column 6) may not agree with the unobligated SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 15 of Section 130 balances reported on the SF 133 (lines 2201 through 2403) and the actual column of the Budget Program and Financing schedule. The difference in the two amounts will represent the total end of year balance on the Appendix 's schedule on special and trust fund receipts (schedule N). (e) What differences should I expect between the September 30 SF 133 and the Statement of Budgetary Resources? The SF 133 is displayed at the TAFS level, while the Statement of Budgetary Resources is displayed at the agency level. The Statement of Budgetary Resources is displayed as a principal statement for the agency as a whole, and must be displayed as required supplementary information for major TAFSs. The Statement of Budgetary Resources includes a separate column for credit financing TAFSs because they are non -budgetary. The Statement of Budgetary Resources includes separate lines for offsetting receipts and net outlays in order to derive the net outlays for the agency. 130.19 What is the hierarchy of spending \" mixed \" funding? Where multiple types of funding are provided to a single TAFS, agencies must apply obligations, outlays, and reductions against budgetary resources in the following order: 1. Against amounts derived from special and trust fund receipts. 2. Against amounts derived from certain offsetting collections (including asset sales, interest on Federal securities, interest on uninvested funds, compulsory collections from the public or intragovernmental expenditure transfers with no benefit). 3. Against amounts derived from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. The hierarchy would not apply when a law requires that specific resources be spent for specific pu rposes. It would also not apply to the following types of offsetting collections since the resources are generally provided for a specific purpose and are not fungible with the other resources in the account: Received in returns for goods or services pro vided, including Reimbursements under the IPA and Voluntary insurance premiums. From other Federal government accounts where collections are for a jointly funded grant or project. This does not include intragovernmental expenditure transfers with no benefit. Your accounting office will find the guidance related to the hierarchy of \"mixed \" funding in OMB Circular No. A- 136 \"Financial Reporting Requirements \" section II.4.5.3. SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 16 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) GUIDANCE ON USE OF O THER AUTHORITIES 130.20 What do I need to know about accounting adjustments under 31 U.S.C. 1534? When an appropriation is available to an agency to pay a cost that benefits another appropriation that is also available to pay the cost, 31 U.S.C. 1534 permits the first appropriation to be charged initially, as long as the benefitted appropriation is commensurately charged during the fiscal year in which the charge to the first appropriation occurred. The first appropriation must be appropriately credited. Do not report the initial charge and succeeding adjustment. 130.21 How is reimbursable work wit h Federal agencies under the Economy Act shown on SF 133 reports? (a) How is reimbursable work with Federal agencies in different TAFSs shown on SF 133 reports? When you anticipate but have not yet received an order, whether or not you received an advance, e nter the amount on line 1740 or 1840 of Antic colls, reimbs, other.\" When you receive the order, it moves the amount of the order from line 1740 or 1840 to line 1701 or 1801, auth: Chng uncoll pay mt Fed src. \" If the order is accompanied or preceded by an advance payment, move the advance payment (up to the amount of the order) to line 1700 or 1800, \"Collected. \" If you do not record valid obligations to cover all or part of an order before the pe riod of availability to make obligations of the ordering account expires, then you may not fill that part of the order. You must send back any cash advances not covered by obligations back to the ordering account. If you are the ordering agency, deobliga te funds not covered by obligations by the performing account and record the corresponding adjustments. Use line 1021 \"Unob Bal: Recov of prior year unpaid obligations, \" for obligations incurred in prior fiscal years. For obligations incurred in the curr ent fiscal year, net the amount against the appropriate detailed lines 2001 through 2103, \"New Obligations and upward adjustments. \" If a cash advance accompanied the order, use line 1700 or 1800 when you collect the refund. These will be start of year unobligated balances available for adjustments but not new obligations in the expired years. When you fill the order, move the amounts earned and collected to line 1700 or 1800, \" Collected.\" Move the amounts earned but not collected to line 1701 or 1801, \"BA: Disc: Spending auth: Chng uncoll paymt Fed src. \" If you receive payment for a filled order after the period of obligational authority of the performing appropriation has expired, credit the payment to the expired appropriation, unless the law expressly prescribes other procedures. If you receive payment after your performing account has been canceled, you must send the amounts to miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury. If the period of disbursement for your account is canceled before you reimburse the appropriation that performed the work, you can only make the repayment from an unexpired appropriation that is available for th e same purpose as the closed account. When the performing and ordering agency accounts have different periods of availability, the performing account may need to establish new TAFS, as described in the following table: SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 17 of Section 130 ECONOMY ACT ACTIVITI ES BETWEEN FEDERAL ENTITIES IN DIFFERENT TAFSS [ASSUMES EXECUTING I N FY 2023] If the ordering agency account has...

In this case, the amount will become part of line 1000 in the next fiscal year; otherwise, no. The Economy Act requires that a performing agency be able to provide or obtain by contract the work requested by the ordering agency. Reimbursements or advances made to the performing agency should be credited to the TAFS that was or will be used to carry out the work performed pursuant to the agreement. As of September 30th, the performing agency account and ordering agency account must have corresponding budgetary entries recorded in their agency financial systems. As of September 30th, any unfilled customer order with or without an advance in a performing agency annual or last year of a multi - year TAFS that is unobligated (which is unearned) must be reduced to zero as well as the corresponding unpaid obligation in the paying agency account which must also be reduced by the same amount. (b) How is reimbursable work within a Federal agency with the same TAFS shown on SF 133 reports? In situations where there are two organizational units in the same Federal agency that are the ordering and performing entities for an Economy Act transaction, your agency general counsel must identify whether these units meet the legal standard of \" major organizational units within the same agency \" pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1535. SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 20 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) If your general counsel has made such a determination, your agency is required to report the financial activity in the following manner: ECONOMY ACT ACTIVITI ES BETWEEN FEDERAL M AJOR ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS WITHIN THE SAME TAFS Ordering major organizational unit ... Performing major organizational unit ... Internal Reporting (e.g. Internal System)? External Reporting (e.g. GTAS, CARS)? Undelivered Order, Unpaid Obligation (Direct) Unfilled Customer Order without an Advance (Reimbursable) Yes No Undelivered Order, Unpaid Obligation (Reimbursable) Yes Yes, but as Direct Undelivered Order, Unpaid Obligation Delivered Order, Unpaid Obligation (Reimbursable) (i.e., Account Payable) Yes Yes, but as Direct Delivered Order, Unpaid Obligation (i.e., Account Payable) Delivered Orders, Unpaid Obligation (Direct) (i.e., Account Payable) Account Receivable (Reimbursable) Yes No Delivered Or ders, Paid Obligation (Direct) (i.e., Outlay) Offsetting Collections - Collected (Reimbursable) Yes No Delivered Order, Paid Obligation (Reimbursable) (i.e., Outlay) Yes Yes, but as Direct Delivered Order, Paid Obligation (i.e., Outlay) 130.22 What should I know about recording reimbursable work with non-Federal entities on SF 133 reports? There must be a specific law that authorizes reimbursable work with non -Federal entities. The Economy Act cannot be cited as the statutory authority to perform wo rk for non-Federal customer orders with or without an advance. A law must specifically allow you to incur obligations against customer orders received from non-Federal sources with an advance. Customer orders with advances from non-Federal sources are credited to a TAFS that is legally available for the work performed. Customer orders with advances from non-Federal sources are credited to a TAFS where the period of availability of the performing Federal agency TAFS is determined by your general counsel. AGREEMENTS UNDER THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961 130.23 What reporting guidance does OMB provide for agreements under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961? The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), allows agencies whose activities fall within the scope of the FAA to enter into interagency agreements to carry out the FAA. The following sections clarify SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 21 of Section 130 the interactions between the authorities as p rovided by section 632(a) and (b) and section 635(h) of the FAA, as well as the general provision historically found at section 7011 in the annual Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations act. OMB and the Department of Treasury Fiscal Service have established the following guidelines within this section to determine when to establish new Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbols (TAFSs) associated with expenditure transfers carried out pursuant to the FAA authorities. The perf orming agency is required to return unspent funds back to the ordering agency at the end of the performance period. Adherence to the following guidelines is crucial to ensure that funds are properly accounted for and returned on time. Through various exam ple scenarios, the section covers when the performing agency may need to establish new TAFSs, especially when the existing reimbursable agreement is amended by the ordering agency. 130.24 What terms should I know related to Foreign Assistance Act transfers? Legislative Authorities: These are the short hand and references used throughout this section: Section 632(a) - 22 U.S.C. 2392(a) provides the ability for agencies to whose activities fall within the scope of the FAA to enter into agreements with other agencies to carry out the FAA through non-expenditure transfers; Section 632(b) - 22 U.S.C. 2392(b) provides the ability for agencies to whose activities fall within the scope of the FAA to enter into agreements with other agencies to carry out the FAA through expenditure transfers; 1 Section 7011 - Refers to language historically provided under section 7011 in the general provisions of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Relat ed Programs appropriations act that, for certain appropriated amounts, upon initial obligation, extends the period of availability by an additional four years; Section 635(h) - 22 U.S.C. 2395(h) provides the ability for agencies to extend the time period o f agreements and/or contracts, under certain conditions, for not more than five years. See Exhibit 130 O for more details on the relevant authorities cited above. Period of performance (POP) - Interagency agreements will specify the period of performance, which is the period of time within which, by agreement of the parties, the requirements of the interagency agreement will be fulfilled. The period of performance informs the TAFS that will be established by Treasury Fiscal Service. Treasury Appropriatio n Fund Symbol (TAFS) - The separate Treasury accounts for each appropriation account based on the availability of the resources in the account. The TAFS is a combination of Federal agency, account symbol, and availability code (e.g., multi -year or no -year). See section 20.4(c) . Development Objective Agreement (DOAG) / Strategic Objective Agreement (SOAG) - An international agreement with a recipient government through which an agency may subsequently expend or disburse 1 As with interagency agreements entered into under the Economy Act, the entering into of an interagency agreement pursuant to section 632(b) is sufficient to obligate the ordering agency 's appropriations. The performing agency then must incur its own obligations to fulfill the order for the ordering agency. Importantly, interagency agreements entered into pursuant to section 632(b) are not subject to the requirement found in the Economy Act at 31 U.S.C. 1535(d) that funds must be deobligated at the end of their POA to the extent the performing agency has not performed or itself incurred valid obligations as part of its performance. Under a section 632(b) agreement, a performing agency can continue to incur valid obligations as part of its performance afte r the ordering agency 's obligated funds enter into the expired phase, provided that the performing agency does so within a reasonable amount of time and the underlying agreement is otherwise properly established. The performing agency must complete its pe rformance prior to the closure of the appropriation the ordering agency used for its obligation. SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 22 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) previously obligated funds directly to third -party grantees and contractors such as another U.S. Federal government agency in order to execute the agreement. Expenditure transfer - means to transfer funding to another account through an obligation and outlay. Non-expenditure transfer - means to transfer without an obligation and outlay by the ordering agency. Allocation transfer - occurs via non -expenditure transfer and involves both a \" parent \" appropriation and a \"child \" recipient of budgetary resources (see section 20.4(l) ). Expenditure Transfers 130.25 What TAFS do I request for a new (or initial) agreement pursuant to section 632(b) of the FAA with funds subject to section 7011? When an agency enters into a 632(b) agreement utilizing funds that fall within the scope of section 7011, the funds are obligated, and the period of availability of the funds is simultaneously extended by four years. The ordering agency, citing the relevant legal authorities, will request Treasury Fiscal Service to extend the period of availability o f the TAFS associated with the obligated funds by an additional four years. The performing agency will request Treasury Fiscal Service to establish a new TAFS where the beginning FY matches the beginning FY of the ordering agency 's obligated funding and the ending FY matches the end of the period of performance as cited in the table below. For example, assume that in FY 2024, a Federal agency was appropriated two -year funding that falls within section 7011, and the agency is entering into an agreement under section 632(b) with another Federal agency for work to be performed by September 30, 2026. In this case, the extension of the legal period of availability (POA) of the obligated funds occurs by operation of law (specifically, operation of section 7011) at the moment of obligation. The funds that were appropriated with a period of availability from FY 2024/2025 become FY 2024/2029. However, due to the fact that the period of performance (POP) of the agreement is limited to run through the end of FY 2026, the performing agency must utilize a TAFS that reflects the FY associated with the end of the POP so as to signal to the performing agency that any remaining funds must be returned to the ordering agency by the end of the POP. The performing agency must ask Treasury Fiscal Service to establish a 2024/2026 TAFS to match the end of the POP unless the TAFS already exists at the performing agency. The legal POA of the funds, as extended by section 7011, should be noted on all documents so as to make clear to all parties that the legal POA of the funds extends beyond the POP reflected in the performing agency 's TAFS. In another example, the period of performance may extend the performing agency' s TAFS beyond the period of availability of the ordering agency. If the period of performance of the 632(b) agreement goes beyond the unexpired phase of the ordering agency 's appropriated funds (FY 2024/2025 that becomes FY 2024/2029 after the initial obligation), and the POP for the performing agency is through FY 2030, then the performing agency needs to request a FY 2024/2030 TAFS. In this case, the performing agency will return any remaining unused funds at the end of the POP back to the correct ordering agency TAFS.

Section 635(h) has no bearing on the legal period of availability of funds and pertains solely to the period of performance of an agreement. Specifically, section 635(h) permits the POP of the agreement to be extended for not more than five years, regardless of the period of availability of the underlying appropriation. For example, the POP of the section 632(b) agreement initially reflects one period, but then the agencies, consistent with the authority provided by section 635(h), agree to amend the existing agreement to extend the POP by up to five years. Notably, the legal POA of the funds at issue does not change when the section 632(b) agreement is extended pursuant to section 635(h). Consistent with the amended section 632(b) agreement, the performing agency has until the end of the amended POP to carry out the wor k ordered. In the example in the table below, the ordering and performing agencies previously entered into a section 632(b) agreement, and the legal POA of the obligated funds that are subject to section 7011 extended by operation of law at the moment o f obligation for four years from the date at which the funds would otherwise have expired.

In cases where the period of performance of an existing 632(b) agreement is modified and extended, and the amended POP is still within the period of availability of the appropriated funds obligated by the ordering agency, the performi ng agency can request a new TAFS and must use a non -expenditure transfer (NET) to transfer both the obligated and unobligated balances to the new TAFS. SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 26 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) For example, assume the ordering agency in the previous agreement (before the modification) stated the period of availability as FY 2024/2029 and the performing agency used FY 2024/2026 TAFS to match the original agreement POP. Subsequently, the period of performance is modified to run through FY 2029. In this case, the performing agency will request a FY 2024/2029 TAFS and will utilize a non -expenditure transfer (NET) to transfer both the obligated and unobligated balances to the new extended FY 2024/2029 from the FY 2024/2026 TAFS. The performing agency will submit a copy of the modification to Treasury Fiscal Service as the supporting document for the NET. AMENDING AN EXISTING 632(B) AGREEMENT AN D THE AMENDMENT CITES THE SAME TAFS FROM THE ORDERING AGENCY AS THE PREVIO US EXISTING AGREEMEN T: Does the modification agreement from the ordering agency cite the same funding source ... And is the POP extended ... And does the performing agency TAFS cover the extended POP... And the legal citations on the agreement are ... Then the performing agency account must... Yes Multi -year FY 2024/2029 Yes 09/30/202 9 previously POP the State/Foreign Operations appropriations act Request FY 2024/202 9 TAFS and use non-expenditure transfer to move obligated/unobligated balances to the new (extended) TAFS 130.28 What do I do when a modification to an existing 632(b) agreement cites a TAFS with a different period of availability than the TAFS cited in the original agreement by the ordering agency? If the modification to an existing 632(b) agreement cites a TAFS with a different period of availability than the TAFS cited in the original agreement by the ordering a gency, then the performing agency must execute the modification as if it is a new agreement (note, this does not result in the ordering agency utilizing a new agreement, only modifying an existing agreement). The performing agency must ask Treasury Fiscal Service to establish a new TAFS to match the beginning FY of the TAFS of the ordering agency and matching the period of performance of the modification. Why? Because the change in TAFS cited by the ordering agency for the funds to be utilized for the modification signifies that a different appropriation is funding the reimbursable agreement, as modified. The performing agency must update their TAFS to reflect that funding change so that at the end of the period of performance any remaining unused funds wi ll be sent back to the correct TAFS from the ordering agency. For example, assume a Federal agency whose funds are subject to section 7011 is modifying a previous 632(b) agreement with another Federal agency for work to be performed by September 30, 2029, and the original POP was through FY 2028. The modification also includes reference to a new TAFS with a different period of availability for the ordering agency of FY 2025/2026. In the original agreement, the ordering agency cited a FY 2024/2025 TAFS. SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUD GETARY RESOURCES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 27 of Section 130 In this case, the performing agency must ask Treasury Fiscal Service to establish a new TAFS where the beginning FY matches the beginning FY of the ordering agency 's obligated funding, which is FY 2025. The funding for the agreement has changed, so the beginning FY of the TAFS used for the agreement must reflect that change. The ending FY of the performing agency TAFS is the same as the end of the period of performance, which is FY 2029. The new TAFS the performing agency must ask Treasury Fiscal Service to create will be FY 2025/2029. You cannot ask Treasury Fiscal Service to create a FY 2024/2029 TAFS, because the beginning FY of the obligated funding must match between the ordering and performing agencies so as to ensure that when the performing agency returns any remaining unused funds to the ordering agency, the funds can be returned to the correct TAFS at the ordering agency. AMENDING AN EXISTING 632(B) AGREEMENT BUT THE AMENDMENT CITES A TAFS FROM THE ORDERING AG ENCY DIFFERENT FROM EXISTING AGREEMENT : Does the modification agreement from the ordering agency cite a different TAFS And is the performance period extended ... And does the performing agency account for the extended new POP ... And the legal citations on the agreement are ... Then the performing agency must... Yes Previously implemented agreement was from a FY 2024/2029 TAFS and the modification to the agreement now cites a FY 2025/2030 TAFS Yes New POP is 09/30/202 9 previously No Has 7011 of the relevant State/Foreign Operations appropriations act Request a new TAFS for modification and execute modification in this newly established TAFS (e.g., FY 2025/2029) 130.29 What do I do when my 632 (b) agreement is related to either a Development Objective Agreement (DOAG) or a Strategic Objective Agreement (SOAG)? When a 632(b) agreement involves executing either a DOAG or SOAG, the 632(b) agreement pertains to an international agreement with a recipient government through which USAID and/or State may subsequently expend or disburse obligated funds directly to third parties, such as grantees, contractors, or another U.S. Federal government agency, in order to carry out the agreement. The colloquial term used by USAID and State for the obligation/disbursement to the performing agency under a DOAG or SOAG is \"sub-obligation\" . Because of the unique nature of this scenario, the 632(b) agreement must state that it involves a DOAG/SOAG. The performing ag ency must provide a copy of the actual DOAG/SOAG to (1) Treasury Fiscal Service in order to request establishment of a new TAFS; and (2) the RMO when requesting an apportionment of the newly established TAFS. As in all 632(b) agreements, both the ordering agency and performing agency TAFSs will close at the same time in the Treasury. See table below for an example involving a DOAG/SOAG and the corresponding guidance on establishment of the performing agency 's TAFS. SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 28 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 632(B) AGREEMENT UNDER EITH ER A DEVELOPMENT OBJ ECTIVE AGREEMENT (DO AG) OR STRATEGIC OBJECTI VE AGREEMENT (SOAG): Is the ordering agency using a 632(b) for work under a DOAG/SOAG ... And does the performing agency have a TAFS that matches the POP ... And does the performing agency have TAFS that matches the POA of the order... And the legal citations and other notifications on the agreement are ... Then the performing agency account must... Yes POA from the ordering agency is FY 2015/2020 No The POP is through FY 2025 No Has multi -year TAFS but the period of availability does not match the beginning/ ending period of availability of the period of performance of the agreement/contract 22 U.S.C. 2392 (b) as well as statement that this agreement is in accordance w/either a DOAG or SOAG Request a new TAFS FY 2015/2025 TAFS Non-Expenditure Transfers 130.30 What TAFS do I request for an agreement pursuant to section 632(a) of the FAA with funds subject to section 7011? Once a 632(a) agreement is signed, the funds are transferred to the performing agency via a non -expenditure transfer. Funds transferred retain the original period of availability of the appropriation (e.g., if the original POA was 2024/2025, the transferred funding rem ains 2024/2025, even if the funding falls under section 7011). To the extent the transferred funds fall within the scope of the section 7011 authority, by operation of law, the performing agency 's obligation of the transferred funds will cause the extensi on of the period of availability of the transferred funds by an additional four years. For example, assume that in FY 2024, a Federal agency is appropriated two -year funding (FY 2024/2025) that falls within section 7011, and the agency is entering into an agreement under section 632(a) with another Federal agency for work to be performed by September 30, 2026. In this scenario, the transferred funds, which originally had a period of availability of FY 2024/2025, become FY 2024/2029 upon the obligation of the funds by the performing agency. Performing agencies are required to place the obli gated balances in this extended TAFS. Additionally, best practice is for the ordering agencies to create an extended TAFS at the time the performing agency obligates the transferred funds. This simultaneous creation of an extended TAFS by the ordering agency will facilitate the return of any unexpended funds at the conclusion of the period of performance (POP) of the agreement. Please note that agencies are bound by the POP of the agreement. Even if the transferred funds have been obligated and are in the extended TAFS (e.g., FY 2024/2029), the performing agency only has the authority to deobligate and reobligate the transferred funds through the period of performance of the agreement. For instance, if the POP states that agreement is through September 30, 2026, then the funds are only available for obligation by the performing agency through FY 2026. SECTION 130 \u2014SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUD GETARY RESOURCES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 29 of Section 130 130.31 For a child account, what TAFS do I request for an agreement pursuant to section 632(a) of the FAA with funds subject to section 7011? Once the 6 32(a) agreement is signed, the funds are transferred to the child account via a non -expenditure transfer. Funds transferred retain the original period of availability of the appropriation (e.g., FY 2024/2025 TAFS). To the extent the transferred funds fal l within the scope of the section 7011 authority, by operation of law, the performing (child) agency 's obligation of the transferred funds extends the period of availability of the transferred funds by an additional four years (e.g., FY 2024/2025 funds now become FY 2024/2029) without regard to the period of performance of the 632(a) agreement. For example, assume that in FY 2024, a parent account (72 -1037) receives appropriated two -year funding that falls within section 7011, and the parent account is e ntering into an agreement under section 632(a) with a child account (19-72 -1037). That means the 72-24/25-1037 funds used in a 632(a) agreement are sent to a 19 -72-24/25-1037 TAFS via a non-expenditure transfer. Once the performing (child) agency makes an obligation in the account (19- 72-24/25- 1037), pursuant to section 7011, the obligated funds are now extended to 19-72-24/29- 1037, and the performing (child) agency will have to transfer those obligated balances to the extended TAFS. At the same time, the ordering (parent) agency will then have to request the Bureau of Fiscal Service to create the extended TAFS 72 -24/29-1037. Please note again that agencies are bound by the period of performance (POP) of the agreement. Even if the transferred funds have been obligated and are in the extended TAFS (e.g., 72- 24/29-1037), the performing agency only has the authority to deobligate and reobligate the transferred funds through the period of performance of the agreement. For instance, if the POP states that agreement is through September 30, 2026, then the funds are only available for obligation by the performing agency through FY 2026.EXHIBIT 130A SF 133, REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES Page 30 of Section 130 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) SF 133 REPORT ON BUDGET EXECUTION AND BUDGETARY RESOURCES AGENCY: Department of Government BUREAU: Office of the 2018 Unexpired Expired Expired Expired Expired Expired Total Account Account Account Account Account Account 1000 Unob Bal: Brought forward, Oct 1..................................................... 487,000 1021 Unob Bal: 3,500 3,500 1029 Unob Bal: 205,000 75,000 87,000 2,500 obligations: Category A (by quarter)....................................... ... 7,601,315 2,500 7,810,815 2201 end year ........................................................................ ... 200,685 30,000 60,000 470,685 2500 Total resources............................................................ ... 7,802,000 110,000 205,000 75,000 87,000 2,500 8,281,500 CHANGE IN OBLIGATED BALANCE 3000 Ob Bal: SOY: Unpaid obs brought forwd, Oct 1 ................................... 2,000 Obligated balance, start of year........................................................ ... 100,000 365,000 40,000 7,000 5,000 517,000 3200 Obligated balance, end of year......................................................... 124,465 50,000 280,000 20,000 2,000 476,465 BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS, NET 4000 Disc: Budget authority, gross......................................................... ... 7,802,000 Disc: Outlays from 32,000 4,000 371,000 4030 Disc: 7,073,850 100,000 170,000 65,000 32,000 4,000 7,444,850 4180 Budget authority, net (disc. and mand.).............................................

SYMBO L 080X8000 Payment of benefits DESCRIPTION Dec. 31 SF 133 Jun. 30 SF 133 Sept. 30 SF 133 General Principles: Under scoring rules established under the Balance Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), collections made available pursuant to law are shown as appropriations (line 1201 of the SF 132 and the SF 133). Amounts not needed to cover obligations are subtracted on line 1235. For the September 30 SF 133, prior year collections are not shown unless current year collections are less than amounts needed to incur obligations. This will assure that the actual column in the Budget, derived from the same data as the SF 133, will reflect the scoring required by the BBEDCA. Assumptions for this example: Total annual benefit payments are $120 thousand ($10 thousand each month).Total annual revenue is $160 thousand. $40 thousand is received in December, March, June, and September. Pursuant to law, obligations may be made only for payment of benefits. Accumulated, unused collections from prior years equal $750 thousand on October 1st of the fiscal year.To save space, this exhibit does not display lines that do not contain amounts.Includes $40 thousand to be collected in March, June, and September.Includes $30 thousand apportioned (see exhibit 121P) of prior year collections plus $40 thousand collected in December.Includes only new collections. Prior year collections are not needed to incur obligations and therefore are not shown as an appropriation.No anticipated amounts are shown on line 1250. Total budgetary resources equal obligations on line 2001-2104.Excess of new collections over obligations. Include amounts of budgetary resources in excess of apportioned amounts on line 2403. If the account is exempt from apportionment, include amounts in excess of obligations on line 2301. Generally applies to indefinite appropriations. If your agency has a Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol with a definite appropriation, contact your OMB representative.

The amount appropriated 65,000,000 is reduced by the amount of actual offsetting collections 61,000,000 received during the fiscal year so as to result in a final fiscal year appropriation of 4,000,000. The amount derived from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury 65,000,000 should be reduced by the amount of actual offsetting collections 61,000,000 received during the fiscal year on the September 30 SF 133. The amount appropriated is reduced by an amount of collections whether credited to an expenditure account or deposited to a receipt account. For the first three quarters, use line 1153 to reduce the total budgetary resources by the anticipated amount of collections whether credited to the expenditure account or deposited to a receipt account. Since the amount appropriated 65,000,000 is initially derived from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, this mechanism is necessary in order to avoid double counting the total budgetary resources.An amount would show on line 1137 if offsetting collections were credited or offsetting receipts were transferred to the Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol but the agency was waiting for the Treasury appropriation warrant to reduce the amount derived from the general fund of the US Treasaury.

Updates list of agencies/programs that are required to submit plans (exhibit 135 ). 135.1 What is the purpose of these procedures? Cabinet departments and certain agencies submit reports on Federal outlays to assist in monitoring spending and to improve Treasury Department forecasts of the Government' s daily cash operating balances, borrowing requirements, and debt subject to legal limits, including trust and special fund investment activity. Realistic estimates, particularly for the immediate six -month period, enable Treasury to borrow only amounts needed to finance Government activities, thus reducing interest costs. OMB needs reports on Federal outlays to monitor the deficit/surplus and to assess the reliability of each agency 's financial management system. Reports are also used by Treasury for its monthly review of \"Statement of Transactions \" reporting, prior to publication of the Monthly Treasury Statemen t of Receipts and Outlays of the U.S. Government (Monthly Treasury Statement or MTS), and for periodic evaluations of the accuracy of the reports. These plans must be as accurate as possible \u2014an inability to forecast spending with reasonable accuracy can be a weakness in program and financial management. Problems of this nature need the attention of OMB and the agencies alike. 135.2 Who is required to submit a plan? If your department or agency is listed in exhibit 135, prepare a monthly outlay plan for t he current and budget years as required by OMB and Treasury and submit periodic reports on and revisions to that plan. Coverage of the reports should be identical to the coverage in the annual budget documents and should include outlay information for all appropriations and funds administered by your department or agency. OMB and/or Treasury may require a forecast of deposit fund activity for specific agencies and will notify you of this requirement. SECTION 135 \u2014PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING FEDERAL OUTLAYS Page 2 of Section 135 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) The OMB and Treasury web -based system for collecting monthly outlay plan information can be found at https://mop.max.gov . Instructions for using this system and other reference information are available at https://community.max.gov/x/SgCDAw . The system will preload and display actual outlays reported in the MTS and full fiscal year estimates from the most recent Budget or Mid-Session Review (MSR). Please reconcile any discrepancies between the data in the system and the data you expect with your OMB contact. Agencies should then enter estimates of expected outlays for months where actual outlays are not yet available. The historical database of outlay plan information th at results from this effort can improve outlay forecasting abilities government -wide. 135.3 What are the general reporting requirements? Agencies must report their updated monthly outlay plans on a quarterly basis. Base estimates on your most realistic e stimates of the amount to be spent by month in the period(s) covered by the report. Use the President 's most recent annual Budget or MSR estimates as a base, but update those estimates to reflect subsequent Congressional or administrative actions, including both completed actions and those that are almost certain to be completed. Plans should also reflect the latest economic trends and other expected events on a realistic basis. Budget and MSR estimates serve as reference points only, not as targeted fiscal year totals. Do not force estimated monthly totals to conform to the Budget or MSR totals if those totals are not consistent with your best, most recent information at the time the forecast is prepared. If realistic estimates yield differences between agency and official estimates, then knowing this difference is critical to Treasury 's general financing requirements and medium and long-term planning. The format for agency reports includes columns for \" Budget estimates\" (or \" MSR estimates\" ) and \"Diffe rences\" that will highlight changes from the most recent official estimates. For further information on the reporting format , see the MAX Community page at: https://community.max.gov/x/SgCDAw . Between submission dates, you should provide updated plans to OMB and Treasury whenever there are significant changes in agency outlay totals ($500 million or more), large transactions ($50 million or more; see Treasury Financial Manual (TFM), Volume 1, Part 6, Cha pter 8500), or patterns (such as those that may be associated with an unanticipated increase in claims for an entitlement program or a change in the timing or amount of upward or downward credit reestimates between budgetary program and non-budgetary finan cing accounts). You should also cooperate with OMB and Treasury by providing additional details as requested. You must submit with each outlay plan a brief summary explaining the assumptions used in developing the plan and any unusual or special circumstances affecting the plan. The summary is instrumental in Treasury 's assessment of the reliability of the estimates and must be included with all outlay report submissions. The summary will, for example, enumerate expected congressional actions that will raise or lower estimates, discuss any other events that have caused or are expected to cause significant fluctuations in the normal outlay pattern, and specify whether they have been included or excluded from the plan. Summaries are to be uploaded as attachments in the web -based system. A comment added to the plan in the system can be used in place of the summary in cases where the estimates are exclusively based on historical patterns and not on economic/legislative assumptions. 135.4 What are the reporting requirements for large transactions? In order to improve Treasury 's ability to manage the Government 's daily cash position and to make more informed financing decisions, all agency financial officers are required to provide advance notice of all SECTION 135 \u2014PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING FEDERAL OUTLAYS OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 135 large deposits and withdrawals. \" Large transaction \" refers to a single payment or deposit or a group of paymen ts or deposits of $50 million or more of a similar nature that occur, typically, on one day. You must identify large cash and non -cash payment and deposit transactions. (See TFM, Volume 1, Part 6, Chapter 8500.) Large transactions may be recurring, i.e. , monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual. Cash transactions result in a decrease or increase in Treasury 's operating cash balance. Non -cash transactions are typically transfers between general fund and trust fund, deposit fund, or financing accounts. The amount of advance notice varies from two to five business days or more prior to the transaction date, depending on the size of the transaction. CASH TRACK Web (CTW) is currently the predominant mechanism for reporting large transactions to Treasury. Please contact the Cash Forecasting Division (Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury (202) 874-9790), to set up your account on CTW, for large dollar notification reporting and for further information regarding TFM Chapter 8500. Additionally, projec tions of all non-recurring transactions in excess of $1 billion that have a high probability of occurrence beyond the five -day window must be sent to Treasury 's Office of the Fiscal Assistant Secretary (OFAS), Office of Fiscal Projections (OFP) as soon as they are identified. This would include transactions that may occur up to a year in advance (for example, large non-recurring expenditures or a planned large asset sale). Communication with other Treasury offices does not replace the requirement of separ ate notification to OFP by the Federal agencies ( outlays@treasury.gov ). The CTW user access will allow a Federal agency to add, update, delete, search, list, and view reported large dollar notifications. For an example of the CTW format for reporting large transactions , see the MAX Community page at https://community.max.gov/x/SgCDAw . The older large transaction reporting format (Form F MS-187) also remains available as a format for reporting large transactions. The point of contact for a large transaction should be the individual who is responsible for ensuring that Treasury is informed between submission dates of revisions to dollar amount, transaction date, or any special circumstances related to the transaction. This individual is typically in your program and/or finance office. Selected examples of large transactions: Department of Agriculture: Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Fund Premium collections and disbursements Commodity Credit Corporation payments and receipts Department of Defense \u2014Military Programs: International Restoration payments and receipts Defense Vendor payments Tricare payments Military Active Duty payments Defense Security Cooperati on Agency: Payments to Security Assistance Department of the Interior: Bureau of Land Management: Oregon and California Grant Lands payments Office of the Secretary: Payments in lieu of taxes Department of the Treasury: Resolution Funding Corporation collections and disbursements Comptroller of the Currency Assessment collections SECTION 135 \u2014PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING FEDERAL OUTLAYS Page 4 of Section 135 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) International Assistance Programs: Agency for International Development: Economic Support Fund payments Economic Assistance loans and repayments Federal Communications Commis sion spectrum auction activity 135.5 What are the requirements for investment account reporting? Departments that administer major investment accounts are required to submit reports of investment account income and outgo. These reports enable Treasury to forecast the effect of investment transactions on debt subject to statutory limit. An example of the investment account reporting format is available at https://community.max.gov/x/SgCDAw . Reports are r equired for the following investment accounts: Department of Health and Human Services: Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund Department of Housing and Urban Development: FHA-Mutual Mortgage and Cooperative Housing Insurance Fund Liquidating Account Department of Labor: Unemployment Trust Fund Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Fund Department of State: Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund Department of Transportation: Highway Trust Fund Airport and Airway Trust Fund Environmental Protection Agency: Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund Office of Personnel Management: Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund Federal Employees Life Insurance Fund Federal Employees and Retired Employees Health Benefits Funds Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund Social Security Administration: Federal Old -Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund Other Defense\u2014Civil Programs: Military Retirement Fund Department of Defense Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund SECTION 135 \u2014PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING FEDERAL OUTLAYS OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Section 135 Other Independent Agencies: Railroad Retirement Board: Rail Industry Pension Fund National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust Railroad Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account Postal Service Deposit Insurance Fund Thrift Savings Plan 135.6 What are the requirements for credit financing account reporting? All departments and agencies that administer credit financing accounts are required to report estimated and actual monthly net disbursements for all accounts as an attachment to the monthly outlay plan application. These reports: Improve Treasury' s cash forecasting by identifying non-cash transactions and ensuring consistent treatment on both sides of the transaction, i.e., the same amount and timing for both budgetary and non-budgetary credit account entries. Ensure the integrity of the MTS, the Federal Government' s monthly budget report. Treasury will use financing account reports to review and monitor the agency \" Statement of Transactions, \" prior to publication of the MTS. The following agencies also are required to submit detailed financing account reports: Department of Agriculture Department of Education Department of Energy Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of the Treasury Department of Veterans Affairs Small Business Administration International Assistance Programs Other Independent Agencies: Export -Import Bank of the United States Reporting format . Show both financing accounts and corresponding program and/or liquidating accounts on the report. Include significant activities as shown in the Budget Appendix Program and Financing schedules in your detailed financing account reports (see section 185.10 for a description of the requirements for program accounts and section 185.11 for a description of the requirements for financing accounts). SECTION 135 \u2014PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING FEDERAL OUTLAYS Page 6 of Section 135 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Estimate monthly totals for non -budgetary cash transactions such as: Loan disbursements Collections for loan repayments Net proceeds of asset sales Forecast all non -cash transactions between credit financing accounts and budgetary accounts such as credit program, liquidating, receipt, and Treasury interest accounts. Specify whether the timi ng for such transactions is monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual. Include the best available estimate of the dollar amount in the month or months during which you expect the transaction to be processed. For an example of the financing account report ing format, see https://community.max.gov/x/SgCDAw . Actual data for credit financing accounts . As discussed in section 135.9 below, the Monthly Treasury Statement is the source of actual data for outlay plans. However, the MTS reports and the \" Statement of Transactions\" may not provide the activity detail necessary for detailed financing account forecasting. Agency budget and accounting areas are expected to devel op internal agency procedures that will produce the detail required for the plans. Sales of loans . In general, cash proceeds from sales of loans are credited to non -budgetary financing accounts (although proceeds may be credited to budgetary liquidating accounts, if applicable) . Detailed reporting for individual asset sales is required by Treasury offices under asset sale reporting (section 135.7 ) below. Forecasting methodology . For financing account reports: Non-cash transactions between financing accounts and (1) program or liquidating accounts, or (2) Treasury interest accounts must reflect the best available dollar amount estimate, and timing must be based on actual due dates or past experience with the timing of the payments. If actual experience supports the method, you may estimate monthly amounts for some categories, such as loan disbursements and repayments, by pro -rating the estimated fiscal year total, based on recent monthly patterns. 135.7 What are the requirements for asset sale reportin g? Asset sales are a category of large transactions with additional reporting requirements due to their impact on financing needs. Departments and agencies that conduct asset sales must submit forecast reports for each sale included in the agency report on outlays or financing account report. These forecasts must be submitted in addition to the large transactions reporting requirements specified in section 135.4. Examples of asset sale, financing account, outlay, and large transaction reporting formats are available on the MAX Community at https://community.max.gov/x/SgCDAw . Between submissions, the original report for each individual sale is to be updated by the agency and provided to Treasury offices as soon as new estimated and/or actual information is available, until the sale has been completed. Agency and OMB estimates provided for Treasury 's budget, cash, and debt forecasting purposes are considered highly confidential and for internal Treasury use only. If unusual circumstances call for disclosure of additional detail, the estimates are characterized as Treasury Department estimates and not attributed to OMB or the agency. SECTION 135 \u2014PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING FEDERAL OUTLAYS OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 135 Departments and agencies that currently must submit detailed asset sale reports are listed below: Department of Housing and Urban Development: Federal Housing Administration Department of the Interior: Minerals Management Service Small Business Administration Department of Veterans Affairs Other Independent Agencies: Federal Communications Commission Other departments or agencies should be prepared to provide asset sale reports and timely, on -going updates if asset sale transactions are assumed in official estimates. 135.8 What are the responsibilities of OMB and the Treasury Department? Both OMB and Treasury will review the agency outlay plans for reasonableness in the light of experience, consistency with the President' s policies and objectives, enacted appropriations and other legislation, and other factors. When circumstances warrant, OMB and/or Treasury may require you to make revisions in the outlay plans. 135.9 When do I submit reports? Reports are due to OMB and to Treasury through the automated collection application as shown in the accompanying table. From time to time, it may be necessary for Treasury to request the reports in advance of this timeline in order to meet its internal cash and debt forecasting requirements. Submit the initial report package to OMB and Treasury Office of the Fiscal Assistant Secretary/Office of Fiscal Projections in the appropriate format s. Further details on the r eporting formats are available on the MAX Community at https://community.max.gov/x/SgCDAw . Plans are due throughout the year, and require monthly outlay estimates for the current and subsequent budget year as shown below. The automated collection application ( https://mop.max.gov) will load actual data as reported by the MTS for all months available. The published MTS is subject to prior -month revisions for back-dated transactions. Such revisions will affect both the prior month (or months) and the published \" Current Fiscal Year to Date\" amounts shown in MTS Table 5. It is imperative that actual data reflect amounts reported by the agency and recorded in the MTS. Differences between actual data in the application and actual data reported in the MTS should be reconciled with your OMB contact. The actual data should be followed by updated monthly outlay estimates for the balance of the period(s).

Agencies should enter MTS data that become available after the system opens for a gency use. When the plans are due before MTS data become available, agencies should enter the best possible estimate of actual outlays. 2 The current year totals should be compared to the latest public estimate, either in the most recent President 's Budge t or MSR. Reconcile significant differences between previously reported estimated outlays and revised estimates or actual outlays and explain these changes in the accompanying statements. Additional updated reports may be requested at other times to bett er accommodate and support Treasury 's quarterly borrowing announcements.

Ex-145A Antideficiency Act Violation Sample Letter to the Director Ex-145B Antideficiency Act Violation Sample Letter to the President 145.1 What is the Antideficiency Act? The Antideficiency Act consists of provisions of law that were passed by the Congress (beginning in the nineteenth century and later codified in Title 31 of the United States Code) to prevent departments and agencies from spending their entire appropriations during the firs t few months of the year. The Act prohibits you and any other Federal employee from: Entering into contracts that exceed the enacted appropriations for the year. Purchasing services and merchandise before appropriations are enacted. The Act: Requires that OMB apportion the appropriations, that is, approve a plan that spreads out spending over the fiscal period for which the funds were made available. Requires, subject to the approval of OMB, the head of each executive agency to prescribe by regulation a system of administrative control of funds (31 U.S.C. 1514(a) ). Restricts deficiency apportionments to amounts approved by the agency heads only for \"extraordinary emergency or unusua l circumstances.\" Establishes penalties for Antideficiency Act violations . Violations are obligations or expenditures in excess of the lower of the amount in the affected account, the amount apportioned, or any administrative subdivision of funds specified in your agency' s fund control regulations as being subject to the Antid eficiency Act. As specified in Appendix H, agency fund control regulations must specify that violations of allotments and suballotments are also violations of the Antideficiency Act. If the agency chooses to and OMB approves, the agency may also make allowances and allocations subject to the Antideficiency Act. In this case, obligations and expenditures that exceed allowances and allocations are violations of the Antideficiency Act . Requires the agency head to report any Antideficiency Act violations to the President, through the OMB Director ; the Congress ; and the Comptroller General . SECTION 145 \u2014REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING ANTIDEFICIENCY ACT VIOLATIONS Page 2 of Section 145 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Under the Act, if you obligate or expend more than the amount in the Treasury Account Fund Symbol (TAFS) or the amount apportioned or the amount in any other subdivision of funds that are identified in your agenc y fund control regulations as being subject to the Antideficiency Act , you will be subject to appropriate administrative discipline, including \u2014when circumstances warrant \u2014a written reprimand, suspension from duty without pay, or removal from office. In addition, if you are convicted of willfully and knowingly overobligating or overexpending the amount, then you shall be fined not more than $5,000, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both. In 1982, the Congress reworded and reorganized the language of the Antideficiency Act along with the rest of Title 31 of the United States Code. The intent of the Congress was to modernize the language of the Act, without changing its meaning. You will find a cr osswalk between the provisions of law that made up the Antideficiency Act before it was modernized and the current language in A ppendix G . 145.2 What violations must I report? All Antideficiency Act violations must be reported. Here are some common examples: If you . . . The amount . . report a violation of . . . Authorize or make an obligation exceeding In an appropriation or fund. This may include obligations for purchases of goods or items that are prohibited by statute. 31 U.S.C. 1341(a) In an apportionment or reapportionment (a type of administrative subdivision of funds), such as a category B apportionment. This also includes incorporated footnotes. 31 U.S.C. 1517(a)(1) In an allotment or a suballotment (a type of administrative subdivision of funds, see Appendix H, section 4). 31 U.S.C. 1517(a)(2) In any other administrative subdivision of funds, if the overobligation results in the overobligation of one of the previous amounts. 31 U. S.C. 1517(a)(2) Authorize or make a disbursement exceeding In an appropriation or fund. 31 U.S.C. 1341(a) In an apportionment or reapportionment (a type of administrative subdivision of funds). Includes the overobligation of a category B apportionment. This also includes incorporated footnotes. 31 U.S.C. 1517(a)(1) In an allotment or a suballotment (a type of administrative subdivision of funds, see Appendix H, section 4). 31 U.S.C. 1517(a)(2) In any other administrative subdivision of funds if the overexpenditure results in the overexpenditure of one of the previous amounts. 31 U.S.C. 1517(a)(2) Obligate or expend Funds required to be U.S.C. 1341(a) SECTION 145 \u2014REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING ANTIDEFICIENCY ACT VIOLATIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 145 If you . . .

Involve the Government in a contract or obligation Before you receive the appropriation, unless such contract or obligation is authorized by law. 31 U.S.C. 1341(a) Sign a contract that obligates the Government to indemnify parties against losses (\"open - ended indemnification\" clause) Indeterminate. 31 U.S.C. 1341(a) Accept voluntary service In excess of that authorized by law. 31 U.S.C. 1342 Consult your OMB representative if your violation involves the Purpose Statute (31 U.S.C. 1301) or a funding restriction in an Act other than an appropriations Act, and refer to the Memorandum for the General Counsel of the Environmental Protection Agency from C. Kevin Marshall , Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Use of Appropriated Funds to Provide Light Refreshments to Non-Federal Participants at EPA Conferences (April 5, 2007), available at https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2015/05/29/op -olc-v031- p0054.pdf . 145.3 How do the requirements for reporting violations differ for credit programs? In addition to the violations specified in section 145.2 , report overobligation or overexpenditure of: The subsidy \u2014where an officer or employee of the United States has made or authorized a direct loan obligation or loan guarantee commitment that requires a subsidy cost obligation or expenditure in excess of amounts appropriated and/or apportioned for such purposes. Modifications of direct loans or loan guarantees (or of direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments), as defined in section 185, that result in obligations or expenditure in excess of apportioned unobligated balances of subsidy amounts are violations (31 U.S.C. 1341(a), 31 U.S.C. 1517(a)). The credit level supportable by the enacted subsidy\u2014where an officer or employee of the United States has made or authorized a direct loan obligation or loan guarantee commitment, that is in excess of the level specified by law. This includes, for example, obligations or expenditures that exceed a limitation on direct loan obligations or guaranteed loan commitments (31 U.S.C. 1341(a)) . The amount appropriated for administrative expenses \u2014where an officer or employee of the United States has made or authorized an expenditure or created or authorized an obligation that is in excess of the amount appr opriat ed for administrative expenses (31 U.S.C. 1341(a)) . The expired unobligated balance of the subsidy\u2014where an officer or employee of the United States has made or authorized an expenditure or created or authorized an obligation, including a commitment, against unobligated subsidy balances after the period of obligational authority has expired. Correction of mathematical or data input errors up to the amount of the expired unobligated balance of the subsidy are not violations. Corrections of these erro rs in excess of the amount of the expired unobligated balance of the subsidy are violations (31 U.S.C. 1341(a)) . The apportioned borrowing authority in a financing account. Section 505( c) of the Federal Credit Reform Act subjects financing accounts to ap portionment: \"All of the transactions provided in this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 15 of title 31, United States Code.\" SECTION 145 \u2014REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING ANTIDEFICIENCY ACT VIOLATIONS Page 4 of Section 145 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) 145.4 Do the requirements for reporting violations differ for revolving funds? No. The incurring of obligations in excess of apportioned budgetary resources in a revolving fund is a violation of the Antideficiency Act, whether or not a fund has unapportioned budgetary resources or non-budgetary assets greater than the amount apportioned. 145.5 Do the requirements for reporting violations differ for closed and expired accounts? No. You are requi red to report violations when obligations and expenditures or adjustments to obligations and expenditures exceed the original appropriations in expired accounts as well as closed accounts. This also includes o bligations and expenditures or adjustments to obligations and expenditures made before the account expired that exceed amount s apportioned or amounts in any other subdivision of funds tha t are identified in your agency' s fund control regulations as being subject to the Antideficiency Act . 145.6 How do I treat anticipated budgetary resources? You may not obligate against a nticipated budgetary resources b efore they are realized even though the anticipated budgetary resour ces have been apportioned (see section 120.46). Generally, i f you incur an obligation against an anticipated budgetary resource, such as anticipated spending authority from offsetting collections , then you will have a viol ation of the Antideficiency Act. However, if you are authorized to incur obligations against a customer ord er from another Federal account , then incurring such an obligation will not result in a violation of the Antideficiency Act. 145.7 How do I report a violation ? In preparing your report on a violation, please consult your OMB representative. The report package shall contain (1) a transmittal letter to the Director of OMB; (2) a letter to the President; (3) letters to the House of Representatives and the Senate; and (4) a letter to the Comptroller General. Below are the requirements for such a report package. This package must be cleared through OMB prior to submitting the letters to the recipients. Transmittal letter to the Director of OMB. You will transmit the letter from your agency head to the President through the Director of OMB. A s ample transmittal letter is provided in exhibit 145A that shows the format that must be followed . Agencies must state whether or not their agency received a clean audit opinion during the fiscal year(s) in which the violation occurred. If it is suspected that the violation was knowing and willful, the letter must state the agency has submitted information to the Department of Justice. If the agency has determined that a violation was not knowing and willful, agencies must state this determination in the letter. Letter to the President . You will report a violation of the Antideficiency Act in the form of a letter from your agency head to the President. A sample letter is provided in ex hibit 145B that shows the format that must be followed. The letter will set forth all of the following information : The title and Treasury symbol (including the fiscal year) of the appropriation or fund account, the amount involved for each violation, and the date on which the violation occurred. The position of the officer(s) or employee(s) responsible for the violation. A responsible officer or employee is an individual who took, or failed to take, an action that was a proximate cause of the violation. For an individual to be a responsible official, there s hould be a direct, identifiable nexus SECTION 145 \u2014REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING ANTIDEFICIENCY ACT VIOLATIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 145 between the action (or inaction) of the individual and the corrective measures taken by the agency to prevent future violations . All facts pertaining to the violation, including the type of violation (for example, overobligation of an appropriation, overobligation of an apportionment, overobligation of any subdivision of funds, including an allotment or suballotment, identified in your agenc y's fund control regulations ), the primary reason or cause, any statement from the responsible officer(s) or employee(s) with respect to any circumstances believed to be extenuating, and any germane report by the agency's Inspector Gener al and/or the agency's counsel. A statement of the administrative discipline imposed and any furthe r action(s) taken with respect to the officer(s) or employe e(s) involved in the violation. In the case where an officer or employee is suspected of knowingly and willfully violating the Antideficiency Act, confirm that all information has been submitted to the Department of Justice for determination of whether further action is needed. If the agency has determined that a violation was not knowing and willful, agencies must state this determination in the letter. A statement regarding the adequacy of the system of administrative control prescribed by the head of the agency and approved by OMB, if such approval has been given. If the head of the agency determines a need for changes in the regulations, or your system of administrative controls has never been approved by OMB, such proposals will be submitted as provided in section 150.7. A statement of any additional action taken by, or at the direction of, the head of the agency, including any new safeguards provided to prevent recurrence of the same type of violation. If another agency is involved, a statement concerning the steps taken to coordinate the report with the other agency. Identical reports will be submitted to the presiding officer of each House of Congress and the Comptroller General. If identical to the report to the President, so state. Letters to the Congress. You will report identical letters to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. Letter to the Comptroller General. You will report to the Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office. Agencies may electronically send PDF (portable document format) copies of these reports to AntideficiencyActRep@gao.gov (for further infor mation see OMB Memorandum M -05-09 dated March 11, 2005). If the letters to the Congress and the Comptroller General are identical to the letter to the President, include a statement to this effect in the letter to the President. If the letters to the Congress and the Comptroller General are not identical to the letter to the President, you will submit a copy of the letter s to the Congress and the Comptroller General with your letter to the President and, moreover, you will submit to the Congress and the Comptroller General a copy of your letter to the President . Additionally, agenc ies are required to ensure that the entire violation package maintains consistency with regard to the type of Antideficiency Act violation that has occurred. If there is an inconsistency in the package, agencie s are required to submit an explanation for the record (emails are acceptable). 145.8 What if the GAO finds a violation? Under the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, a legal opinion by a Legislative Branch agency cannot bind the Executive Branch. Nevertheless, if the Government Accountability Office (GAO) finds an agency has committed an ADA violation, the agency must report such violation to the President, the Congress, and the Comptroller General in accordance with 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 or \u00a7 1517(b). The report to the President must contain an explanation as to why the violation was not discovered and previously reported by the agency. SECTION 145 \u2014REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING ANTIDEFICIENCY ACT VIOLATIONS Page 6 of Section 145 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) If GAO finds that an agency has committed an ADA violation and the agency, in consultation with OMB, does not agree with GAO that a violation has occurred, the agency must still report, and provide a report to the President, the Congress, and the Comptroller General that explains the agency's position. 145.9 What if OMB suspects a violation? Whenever OMB determines that a violation of the Antideficiency Act may have occurred, OMB may request that an investigation or audit be undertaken or conducted by the agency. In such cases, a report describing the results of the inv estigation or audit will be submitted to OMB through the head of the agency. If the report indicates that no violation of the Antideficiency Act has occurred, the agency head will so inform OMB and forward a copy of the report to OMB. If the report indic ates that a violation of the Antideficiency Act has occurred, the agency head will report to the President , the Congress , and the Comptroller General in accordance with section 145. 7 as soon as possible. If the agency head does not agree that a violation has occurred, the report to the President , the Congress , and Comptroller General will explain the agency's position. 145.10 When do I need to request (and obtain) an appropriation in order to liquidate an obligation that was a violation of the Antideficiency Act? The Antideficiency Act applies to expenditures as well as obligations, and thus an expenditure is a separate violation of the Antideficiency Act. Accordingly, if you think that you may have obligated funds in violation of the Antideficiency Act that you have yet to expend, you should i mmediately contact your counsel' s office and budget office to discuss the situation and appropriate next steps, i ncluding contact ing your agency' s OMB representative with budget responsibility for the account. In most cases, you will not need to request (and obtain) an appropriation in order to liquidate an obligation that was incurred in violation of the Antideficiency Act. (Such an appropriation is referred to as a \"deficiency appropriation.\") When an obligation that was a violation of the Antideficiency Act has already been liquidated, a deficiency appropriation is not necessary. A deficiency appropriation is also not necessary when other resources are available to liquidate the obligation. For instance, the agency may be able to liquidate the obligation by: (1) using unobligated balances that can be made available through a re-allotment, a revised apportionment, a reprogramming, or a transfer from another account (if the agency has transfer authority); (2) deobligating funds; or (3) if the account has been closed, exercising the authority to use current -year funds under 31 U.S.C. 1553. A deficiency appropriation is only necessary wh ere there is not existing budget authority that is available to liquidate the obligation. Appropriations to liquidate obligations that violated the Antidefiency Act (i.e., deficiency appropriations) are subtracted from total budgetary resources available for obligation. As a result, the appropriation is still SECTION 145 \u2014REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING ANTIDEFICIENCY ACT VIOLATIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 7 of Section 145 recognized in the budget authority totals as a current cost, but the appropriation is unavailable to be used for any purpose except to liquidate the obligation (s ee sections 20.4(b) and 82.18 ). Regardless of whether a deficiency appropriation is needed, all Antideficiency Act violations involving either obligations or expenditures must be reported to the President, the Congress, and the Government Accountability Office in accordance with this section . This discussion does not address those situations in which an appropriation is needed in order to liquidate obligations that are lawfully incurred, such as obligations incurred for excepted activities pursuant to the Antideficiency Act (see section 124).

SECTION 150 \u2014ADMINISTRATI VE CONTROL OF FUNDS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 1 of Section 150 SECTION 150 \u2014ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL OF FUNDS Table of Contents 150.1 Why must my agency have a fund s control system? 150.2 What is the purpose of my agency's funds control system? 150.3 What is the relationship between my agency 's internal controls and its funds controls? 150.4 What is the relationship between my agency 's financial management system and its fund s control system? 150.5 What is the U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) and how does it relate to my agency' s financial management system? 150.6 What are Federal Financial Management Systems requirements and how are they related to my agency 's funds control systems? 150.7 When and how should I get OMB approval of my agency 's funds control regulations (including updates)? 150.1 Why must my agency have a funds control system? The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1514) requires that your agency head prescribe, by regulation, a system of administrative control of funds . The system is also called the funds control system and the regulations are called funds control regulations . 150.2 What is the purpose of my agency 's funds control system? The purpose of your agency' s funds control system is to: Restrict both obligations and expenditures (also known as outlays or disbursements) from each appropriation or fund account to the lower of the amount apportioned by OMB or the amount available for obligation or expenditure in the appropriation or fund account. Enable the head of your agency to identify the person responsible for any obligation or expenditure exceeding the amount available in the appropriation or fund account, the OMB apportionment or reapportionment, the allotment or suballotments made by your agency, any statutory limitations, and any other administrative subdivision of funds made by your agency. 150.3 What is the relationship between my agency 's internal controls and its funds controls? Your agency' s internal controls are the organization, policies, and procedures that your agency uses to reasonably ensure that: Programs achieve their intended results. Resources used are consistent with agency mission. Programs and resources are protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Laws and regulations are followed. Reliable and timely information is obtained, maintained, reported and used for decision making. SECTION 150 \u2014ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL OF FUNDS Page 2 of Section 150 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Your agency' s internal controls should include objectives specific to compliance with the Antideficiency Act, ensuring that: Expenditures and obligations do not exceed the amounts available in the appropriation, apportionment, allotment, suballotment, and/or other administrative subdivisions or limitations of funds. Obligations do not occur before an appropriation is made or otherwise authorized by law. Staff are adequately trained and knowledgeable about the current status of funds, including the current year' s appropriation, apportionment, allotment, suballotment, and other administrative subdivisions or limitations of funds. Approving and certifying officials have adequate and current training in appropriations law and the budget process, OMB Circular A -123 , and budget execution practices that may prevent violations of the Antideficiency Act. Commitment and obligation tracking can be monitored in real time with comparisons to the apportionment, allotment and suballotment, on a fiscal year and quarterly basis. For further guidance on your agency' s internal controls, see OMB Circular A -123, Management 's Responsibility for Enterprise R isk Management and Internal Control, last updated July 2016. Agencies should consult the updated circular as appropriate. Internal control requirements are one of the overarching requirements. This means that they apply to all financial management system s, including your agency' s funds control system. 150.4 What is the relationship between my agency 's financial management system and its funds control system? Your agency 's financial management system must support the preparation and execution of your agency 's budget, among other things. Your agency' s funds control system is part of your agency 's budget execution process. Therefore, your agency 's financial management system must support your agency 's funds control system. The policies and standards your agency must follow in developing, operating, evaluating, and reporting on financial management systems are in Appendix D to OMB Circular A -123, Management of Financial Management Systems - Risk and Compliance . For policies related to information technology that pertain to financial management systems, see OMB Circular A -130, Managing Federal Information as a Strategic Resource. 150.5 What is the U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) and how does it relate to my agency 's financial management system? The USSGL includes a chart of accounts and technical guidance established to support the consistent recording of financial events as well as the preparation of standard external reports that are required by the central agencies, such as OMB and Treasury. The Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) USSGL Supplement provides: A list of the accounts (i.e., the chart of accounts). Descriptions of each account. A listing of transactions processed by Federal agencies. The posting models, including debit and credit pairs, for each type of transaction. The USSGL attributes that are an integral part of the USSGL. SECTION 150 \u2014ADMINISTRATI VE CONTROL OF FUNDS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Section 150 Crosswalks from the USSGL to various external reports, such as the SF 133 and the prior year column of the Program and Financing S chedule in the President 's Budget. An electronic version of the TFM USSGL Supplement is available at: https://tfm.fiscal.treasury.gov/v1/supplements.html . The OMB policies regarding the USSGL are in OMB Circular A -123, Appendix D, Management of Financial Management Systems - Risk and Compliance . Specifically, Circular A -123, Appendix D requires that agencies record financial events throughout the financial management system using the USSGL at the transaction level. This is a legal requirement. 150.6 What are Federal Financia l Management Systems requirements and how are they related to my agency' s funds control system? As defined in OMB Circular A -123, Appendix D, agencies must make the best use of financial systems to initiate, record, process and report transactions to support agency missions in making business decisions and to provide transparency to the public. These systems help agencies ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability of financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Specific non- core financial system requirements, previously published by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) and known as the JFMIP Federal Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR) series, should be regarded as guidance when defining system requirements for acquisition. Please refer to the Federal Financial System Requirements (FFSR) document for the app licable core financial system requirements for funds control. 150.7 When and how should I get OMB approval of my agency' s funds control regulations (including updates)? Use the checklist in Appendix H to prepare draft funds control regulations. Send your proposed draft (or updates to existing OMB -approved regulations) to OMB for approval. Approved funds control regulations shall be posted on the agency 's website. For newly established agencies, submit the proposed funds control regulations to the Director of OMB within 90 days after the agency is established. The Director of OMB will respond within 90 days after receiving the draft regulations. Agency funds control regulations are in effect only to the extent approved by OMB. To revise regulations previously approved by OMB, submit the draft revised regulations to the Director of OMB for review and approval. You should review your funds control regulations periodically to determine whether improvements should be made. At a minimum, review the system whenever: OMB issues revised guidance on budget execution. Your agency is reorganized. Staff from your agency has violated the Antideficiency Act. CIRCULAR NO.

Clarifies the description of budget authority for risk categories with both positive and negative subsidy loans. Eliminates the imprecise term \"volume reestimate\" without affecting the meaning of the section (section 185.10 ). Clarifies that an updated apportionment is not required for additional borrowing authority when insufficient resources are available to pay interest owed to Treasury. Similarly, if the account has sufficient resources and must simply shift uses from one Cat B to another, no updated apportionment is necessary (section 185.19). SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 4 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 185.1 Does this section apply to me? These instructions apply to all programs that provide direct loans or loan guarantees (see sections 185.3(e) and 185.3( n) f or definitions of these terms) to non-Federal entities and are subject to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, as amended ( FCRA ). Even though section 506 of the FCRA exempts certain programs from credit r eform budgeting, these programs are still required to report data in schedules G and H (see section 185.11) and follow other instructions contained in this Circular. This section answers frequently asked questions, defines credit terms and concepts, and illustrates how budget formulation, apportionment, and budget execution forms should be prepared. This section supplements other instructions in this Circular and should be used in conjunction with credit program guidance in OMB Circular No. A -129, Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non -T ax Receivables. Section 504(b) of the FCRA provides that new direct loan obligations and new loan guarantee commitments may be made only to the extent that: Ne w budget authority to cover their costs is provided in advance in an appropriations act; A limitation on the use of funds otherwise available for the cost of a direct loan or loan guarantee program is provided in advance in an appropriations act; or Authority is otherwise provided in an appropriations act. These requirements also apply to modifications of direct loans (or direct loan obligations) or loan guarantees (or loan guarantee commitments) that increase the cost to Government, including modifications of pre - 1992 direct loans and loan guarantees. OMB will specify exemptions from these requirements for mandatory programs pursuant to section 504(c) of the FCRA . Unless otherwise specified by law, budget authority is available to liquidate obligation s ( i.e., outlays) for only five fiscal years after the authority expires. For credit subsidies financed by annual or multi -year budget authority, you must ensure that the budget authority obligated for the subsidy cost will remain available for disbursement over the full period in which loans will be disbursed. If you expect the disbursement period will be longer than five fiscal years after the budget authority expires, you must include a special provision in the appropriations language (see section 95). 185.2 What background information must I know? (a) Overview The FCRA changed the budgetary measurement of cost for direct loans and loan guarantees from the cash flows into or out of the Treasury at the time such cash flows occurred, to the estimated long -term cost to the Government on a present value basis. By focusing on the long-term costs of the program, credit budgeting meets the most fundamental goal of budgetary cost measurem ent: it provides decision makers with the information and the incentive to allocate resources efficiently. Unlike most budgetary transactions, the cash disbursements for a credit program are a poor measure of cost. Counting outlays for loan disbursements without taking into account the contractual obligation for repayments overstates the cost of direct loans. Loan guarantees appear costless initially because payments of guarantee claims generally occur several years after the decision to extend credit has been made. Credit budgeting places the cost of credit programs on a budgetary basis equivalent to other forms of Federal spending, allowing for more transparent comparison of cost between direct loan and loan guarantee programs, and between credit and o ther programs. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 185 (b) Subsidy Cost Only the unreimbursed costs of making or guaranteeing new loans (the subsidy cost, on a present value basis, and administrative expenses, on a cash basis) are included in the budget. Agencies must receive appropriations for the subsidy cost before they can enter into direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments. The actual cash flows are recorded as a means of financing (see section 20.7(h) ) and are not included in the budget totals. The subsidy cost is the estimated present value of the cash flows from the Government (excluding administrative expenses) less the estimated present value of the cash flows to the Government resulting from a direct loan or loan guarantee, discounted to the time when the loan is disbursed. The contractual cash flows are adjusted for expected deviations from the contract terms (delinquencies, defaults, prepayments, and other factors). Present values must be calculated using the online Credit Subsidy Calculator ( the Calculator). The Calculator discounts the cash flow that is estimated for each time period using the interest rate on a marketable zero-coupon Treasury security with the same maturity as that cash flow from th e date of disbursement. A positive subsidy value means that the Government incurs a cost for extending a subsidy to borrowers; a negative subsidy value means that the credit program generates a positive return to the Government, excluding administrative c osts. Appropriations for the subsidy cost are made to the program account and are recorded as budget authority. Obligations for the subsidy cost are recorded when the Government enters into a loan obligation or guarantee commitment. Outlays are recorded when the direct loan or guaranteed loan is disbursed to the public and simultaneously the subsidy is paid from the program account to the financing account. The program account also receives appropriations for the direct costs of administering the credit program. Agencies are required to periodically reestimate the subsidy cost throughout the life of each cohort of direct loans or loan guarantees (see section 185.6 below) . These reestimates represent additional costs or savings to the Government and are recorded in the budget. Reestimates that indicate an increase in the subsidy cost are financed by permanent indefinite authority. There are two types of reestimates. Interest rate reestimates adjust for the effect on the subsidy of differences between actual interest rates and the discount rates assumed when estimates were made for budget formulation and obligation (the same discount rate assumptions must be used at formulation and obligation) . Technical reestimates adjust for revised assumptions about loan performance, such as differences between assumed and actual default rates or new projections of prepayments. Technical reestimates must be made after the close of each fiscal year, unless an alternative plan has been approved by OMB. Modifications of a direct loan or loan guarantee also change the subsidy cost. A modification is any Government action different from the baseline assumptions that affects the subsidy cost, such as a change in the terms of the loan contract or legislation that provides new collection tools. The cost of a modification is the difference between the present value of the remaining cash flows before and after the modification. Before a direct loan or a loan guarantee can be modified, agencies must have budget authority available to cover the cost of a modification that increases the subsidy cost. (c) Financing and Liquidating Accounts The actual cash flows to and from the Government (e.g., loan disbursements, collections of principal and interest payments, and payment of guarantee claims) are recorded in separate financing accounts. There is at least one financing account associated with each program account. Separate financing accounts are required for direct loan cash flows and for loan guarantee cash flows. The transactions of the financing accounts are displayed in the Budget Appendix for informational and analytical purposes, together with the related program accounts, but are excluded from the budget totals because the net cash flows do not represent a cost to the Government. The direct loan financing account combines the subsidy payment from the program account with borrowing from Treasury to finance direct loans , and repays Treasury over time SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 6 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (with interest) using payments from the borrower. The loan guarantee f inancing account holds the subsidy payment from the program account as a reserve against default claims on loan guarantees. The reserve, together with interest earnings on this reserve from Treasury, is used to pay default claims over the life of the loan s. All cash flows resulting from direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments made prior to the effective date of the FCRA ( in FY 1991 or previous years) are recorded in liquidating accounts. These accounts are recorded on a cash basis and are included in the budget totals. Liquidating account collections are available to pay obligations of the account, but they are not available to finance new direct loans or loan guarantees. If the collections are insufficient, the FCRA pr ovides liquidating accounts with permanent indefinite authority to pay for losses and to repay debt owed to Treasury or to other sources. (d ) Non-Federal Borrowers As noted above, the FCRA applies to credit programs that provide direct loans and loan guarantees to non- federal entities. The budgetary treatment outlined in the FCRA does not apply to Federal entities or activities to avoid distorting the comparison between credit programs and all other Federal spending programs. Applying the FCRA budgetary treatment to a Federal entity or activity would misstate the budgetary cost of such activities relative to all other Federal spending, as all other Federal spending is recorded in full at the time obligations are made, consistent with an agency 's responsibility to comply with the recording statute and the Antideficiency Act. In limited cases it may not be immediately clear whether an entity or activity is Federal or non -Federal. Making this determination requires a close examination, on a case-by -case basis, of that entity or activity 's structure, financing, and liabilities. Below is an illustrative list of the types of consideratio ns that must be weighed when reviewing eligibility for proposed direct loans or loan guarantees: The degree to which the Federal Government comprises the user base; The degree to which the Federal Government uses its sovereign power to benefit the entit y or activity, or without which the entity could not proceed (e.g., an Act of Congress); Whether an asset is constructed or acquired for the special purpose or use by the Federal Government; The degree to which the Federal Government directs contracting fo r and governance of the project (e.g., selection of management, project oversight, step -in rights, etc.); Whether the entity is dependent on financial or in-kind contributions by the Federal Government (e.g., grants, leases, land, real estate, rights-of -way, etc.) and, as applicable, the extent to which private market participants assume Federal support (e.g., in investment ratings letters) ; The degree to which the Federal Government will bear funding or operational liabilities not otherwise appropriated by Congress or captured in the loan subsidy cost estimate, including unforeseen costs such as environmental impacts, natural disasters, or cost overruns. If you have questions about whether a borrower , entity, or activity is eligible for FCRA treatment, co ntact your OMB representative. 185.3 What special terms must I know? The following are key terms used in credit budgeting. In these definitions, the term \" post-1991\" means direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments made on or after October 1 , 1991, and the resulting direct loans or loan guarantees. The term \"pre- 1992\" means direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments made prior to October 1, 1991, and the resulting direct loans or loan guarantees. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 185 (a) Administrative expenses mean all costs that are directly related to credit program operations, including payments to contractors. The FCRA g enerally requires that administrative expenses for both pre- 1992 and post-1991 direct loans and loan guarantees be included in program accounts. Administrative expenses are included in the liquidating accounts only if (1) those accounts would have been available for administrative expenses under a provision of law in effect prior to October 1, 1991, and (2) no direct loan obligation, loan guarantee commitment , or modification of any pre-1992 direct loan or loan guarantee has been made since September 30, 1991. A dministrative expenses that are tangentially related to the credit program should not be included in the program account. As an illustration, the cost of auditing credit programs that is financed in the accounts for Inspectors General should not be included. Administrative expenses include: The appropriate proportion of administrative expenses that are shared with non-credit programs; The cost of operating separate offices or units that make policy decisions for credit programs; The cost of l oan systems development and maintenance, including information technology systems costs (under no circumstances should such costs be paid out of financing accounts); The cost of monitoring credit programs and private lenders for compliance with laws and regulations; The cost of all activities related to credit extension, loan servicing, writeoff, and close out; and The cost of collecting delinquent or defaulted loans . While the cost of collecting delinquent or defaulted loans are typically treated as administrative expenses, the capitalized costs of foreclosing, managing, and selling collateral that add or maintain value to property prior to sale are excluded from the definition of administrative expenses . These costs are part of the cash flows that must be taken into account in calculating the subsidy cost. They are financed by the subsidy cost payment from the program account to the financing account and paid out of the financing account. The cost of managing these functions must be paid from administrative expense appropriations in the program account. Finally , the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 provides agencies with certain authorities for managing delinquent or defaulted loans that are uncollateralized. The authorizing statutes of some agencies may provide additional or alternative instructions on how to manage delinquent or defaulted debt. In cases where the application of the Circular and these authorities are unclear, please contact your OMB representative. Administrative expenses m ay be expended directly from the program account or, if authorized by appropriation language (see section 95), used to reimburse a salaries and expenses account or the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). If administrative appropriations are transferred to a salaries and expenses account or the FFB, record the transfer as an expenditure transfer. Record an obligation and outlay in the program account and an offsetting collection in the salaries and expenses account. In the salaries and expenses account, obligations for administrative expenses may be recorded without necessarily identifying them as credit program expenses. Ad ministrative expenses are almost always provided by annual appropriations acts and, therefore, are discretionary spending. If such expenses are included in a program account that subsidizes a mandatory program, the account will be split between mandatory and discretionary spending. (b) Claim payment means a payment made to private lenders when a guaranteed loan defaults. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 8 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (c) Cohort refers to the fiscal year of obligation for direct loan obligations, or loan guarantee commitments of a program (except as provided below for pre -1992 direct loans and loan guarantees that are modified). Even if the direct loans or guaranteed loans are funded in supplemental appropriations acts, or disbursed in subsequent years, the cohort is defined by the fiscal year of obligation. Cohort accounting applies to post -1991 direct loans and loan guarantees and pre -1992 direct loans and loan guarantees that have been modified. Post -1991 direct loans or loan guarantees remain with their original cohort throughout the life of the loans, even if they are modified. Modified pre -1992 direct and guaranteed loans are assigned to a single cohort defined by the year of modification, program, and credit instrument, regardless of the fiscal year of the appropriation. For purposes of budget presentation, cohorts will be aggregated. However, accounting and other records must be maintained separately for each cohort. (d) Credit Subsidy Calculator means the discounting tool issued by OMB for agencies to calculate credit subsidy costs and financing account interest for post -1991 direct loans and loan guarantees. Subsidy rates and reestimates, and actual interest income or expense for financing accounts, must be calculated with the online Credit Subsidy Calculator . (e) Direct loan means a disbursement of funds by the Government to a non- Federal borrower under a contract that requires repayment of such funds with or without interest. The term includes: The purchase of, or participation in, a loan made by another lender; Financing arrangements that defer payment for more than 90 days, including the sale of a Government asset on credit terms; and Loans financed by the Federal Financing Bank (FFB) pursuant to agency loan guarantee authority. The term does not include the acquisition of federally -guaranteed loans in satisfaction of default or other guarantee claims or the price support loans of the Commodity Credit Corporation. Pre-1992 loans made by the FFB on behalf of any agency continue to be recorded as direct loans of the agency . Agency guarantees of post -1991 loans that are financed by the FFB are treated as direct loans in the budget, but the intrabudgetary cash flows reflect elements of direct loans and loan guarantees insofar as the direct loan financing account for these loans will collect and hold the subsidy payment from the program account as a reserve to cover losses. This balance, together with interest earnings, will be available to pay the FFB in the event of default by the non -Federal borrower. All other intragovernmental transactions, including financing account interest income and expense, are treated as any other direct loan. Agencies with programs financed by the FFB should consult with the OMB representative with primary responsibility for the program to ensur e correct treatment of these loans. (f) Direct loan obligation means a binding agreement by a Federal agency to make a direct loan when specified conditions are fulfilled by the borrower. (g) Direct loan subsidy cost means the estimated long -term cost to the Government of a direct loan, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative expenses (see \" Administrative expenses\") . Specifically, the cost of a direct loan is the net present value, at the time when the direct loan is disbursed from the financing account, of the following estimated cash flows: Loan disbursements; Repayments of principal; Payments of interest; Recoveries or proceeds of asset sales; and SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 185 Other payments by or to the Government over the life of the loan, excluding those toward administrative expenses. These estimated cash flows include the effects of estimated defaults, prepayments, non-administrative fees, penalties, and expected actions by the Government and the borrower within the terms of the loan contract, such as the exercise by the borrower of an option included in the loan contract. Obligations for the subsidy cost will be recorded against budget authority in the program account when the direct loan obligation is incurred. Accounts payable (to the direct loan financing account) will be recorded in the amount of the estimated obligation. The subsidy will be paid to the financing account for each disbursement when the loan is disbursed. (See section 185.5 and the online Credit Subsidy Calculator a nd accompanying documentation for information about estimating the subsidy.) (h ) Discount rates mean the collection of Treasury interest rates that are used to calculate the present value of the cash flows that are estimated over a period of years. The budget assumption discount rates are part of the economic assumptions for the budget year of obli gation. Actual discount rates for substantially disbursed cohorts (i.e., at least 90 percent disbursed) are provided roughly 10 days before the end of the fiscal year. For direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments, and modifications made in or after 2001, the cash flow estimated for each year (or other time period) is discounted using the interest rate on a marketable zero -coupon Treasury security with the same maturity from the date of disbursement (or point of modification) as that cash flo w. The discount rates for the budget are provided by OMB in the online Credit Subsidy Calculator . For subsidy rate estimates beyond the budget year, please consult your OMB representative regarding the appropriate discount rates. The discount rates for technical reestimates, and at which interest will be paid on the amounts borrowed or held as an uninvested balance by a financing account for a particular cohort is a disbursement -weighted average discount rate (for cohorts before 2001) or single effective rate (for cohorts 2001 and after) derived from this collection of interest rates. (i ) Economi c assumptions include the interest rates used for discounting cash flows, the rate of inflation, and may include other assumptions as applicable to a particular program. They also include the interest rate charged to the borrower on the loan, if the rate is tied to a variable benchmark, such as the rate on specified Treasury securities. Agencies must use the appropriate President 's Budget economic assumptions for credit subsidy calculations. (j) Financing account means a non -budgetary account (i.e., its transactions are excluded from the budget totals) that records all of the cash flows resulting from post -1991 direct loans or loan guarantees. It disburses loans, collects repayments and fees, makes claim payments, holds balances, borrows from Treasury, earns or pays interest, and receives the subsidy cost payment from the credit program account. There is at least one financing account associated with each program account. Separate financing accounts are required for direct loan cash flows and for loan guarantee cash flows. Financing account schedules are printed in the Budget Appendix together with the program account. (k) Forecast assumptions are factors that affect the expected cash flows of the direct loan or loan guarantee. They are factors which are estimated, but not actually observable, at the time of loan origination or modification. Forecast assumptions include: default rates, timing of defaults, delinquency rates, late fees, proceeds from the sale of collateral or acquired defaulted loans, i ncome from (and costs of managing) foreclosed collateral and acquired defaulted guaranteed loans, reschedulings, prepayments, loan asset sales proceeds and costs, and disbursement rates. Additional information about properly describing the timing, type, a nd magnitude of forecast assumptions can be found in the online Credit Subsidy Calculator and accompanying documentation. (l) Liquidating account means a budget account that records all cash flows to and from the Government resulting from pre -1992 direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments (unless they have been SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 10 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) modified and transferred to a financing account). Liquidating account collections in any year are available only for obligations incurred during that year or to repay debt. In general , all liquidating account transactions are classified as mandatory. Collections credited to a liquidating account include: Interest; Loan repayments and prepayments; Payments from financing accounts when required for modifications; Proceeds from the sales of loans; and Fees. These collections are available only for: Interest payments and repayment of debt; Disbursements of loans; Default and other guarantee claim payments; Interest supplement payments; Cost of foreclosing, managing, and selling collateral that is capitalized or routinely deducted from the proceeds of sales; Payments to financing accounts when required for modifications; Administrative expenses, but only if (1) amounts credited to the liquidating accounts would have been available for adm inistrative expenses under a provision of law in effect prior to October 1, 1991, and (2) no direct loan obligations ,loan guarantee commitments, or modification of a ny pre -1992 direct loan or loan guarantee has been made since September 30, 1991; and Other payments that are necessary for the liquidation of pre-1992 direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments. Amounts credited to liquidating accounts in any year are only available for obligations that are incurred in that year (the outlay may occur in a subsequent year) and for repayment of debt. Any remaining unobligated balances at the end of the fiscal year are unavailable for obligation in subsequent fiscal years and must be transferred to the general fund at the end of the fiscal year unless an extension has been approved by OMB (see section 51.14). The FCRA pr ovides permanent indefinite authority to cover obligations and commitments in the event that funds in liquidating ac counts are otherwise insufficient. If the liquidating account 's obligations will exceed its collections during the year, the agency must request an apportionment and warrant of permanent indefinite authority estimated to be needed for the fiscal year, bef ore the beginning of the current fiscal year. T he liquidating account status of direct and/or guaranteed loans schedule reflects disbursements and repayments of pre- 1992 loans. Therefore, in the liquidating account status of direct and/or guaranteed loans: There will be no post -1991 direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments; Direct and guaranteed loan disbursements will be shown only for pre -1992 direct loans or loan guarantees; and Repayments and prepayments will reflect only pre -1992 direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments. (m) Loan asset sale means a sale of one or more loans to a non -Federal buyer, individually, pooled, packaged, securitized, or as a joint venture, at a single point in time, subject to parties fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Government 's offer. Loan assets consist of direct loans and loan receivables resulting from defaulted guaranteed loans. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 185 (n) Loan guarantee means any guarantee, insurance, or other pledge by the Government with respect to the payment of all or a part of the principal or interest on any debt obl igation of a non-Federal borrower to a non-Federal lender, including insurance of contractual payments of princip al and interest, except for the insurance of deposits, shares, or other withdrawable accounts in financial institutions. Loan guarantees do not include 100 percent guaranteed loans that are financed by the FFB pursuant to agency loan guarantee authority; these are treated as direct loans rather than loan guarantees. (o) Loan guarantee commitment means a binding agreement by a Federal agency to make a loan guarantee when specified conditions are fulfilled by the borrower, the lender, or any other party to the guarantee agreement. (p) Loan guarantee subsidy cost means the estimated long -term cost to the Government of a loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative expenses (see \" Administartive expenses\") . Specifically, the cost of a loan guarantee is the net present value, at the time when the guaranteed loan is disbursed by the lender, of the following estimat ed cash flows: Payments by the Government to cover defaults and delinquencies, interest subsidies, and other requirements; and Payments to the Government, including origination and other non-administrative fees, penalties, and recoveries. These estimated cash flows include the effects of expected Government actions and the exercise by the guaranteed lender or the borrower of an option included in the loan guarantee contract. Obligations for the subsidy cost are recorded against budget authority in the program account, and loan guarantee commitment authority is recorded in the guaranteed loan financing account, when the loan guarantee commitment is made. The subsidy for each disbursement is paid to the guaranteed loan financing account when the loan is disbursed by the private lender. (See section 185.5 and the online Credit Subsidy Calculator and accompanying documentation for information about estimating the subsidy.) (q) Loan terms are those terms made explicit in the contract between the Government and the borrower or in the federally -guaranteed contract between a private lender and the borrower. These assumptions are forecast in the formulation subsidy cost estimate but are known at the time of loan origination. They may include: the interest rate charged on loans, the extent of a guarantee, fees, repayment terms, collateral held, grace periods, options, and other terms and conditions. (r) Methodological assumptions are the technical practices used to develop subsidy cost estimates and loan modification cost estimates. These assumptions include methods and models or cash flow estimation, discounting methodology, and mathematical equations used in subsidy cost estima tion. Agencies are required to use the same version of the online Credit Subsidy Calculator w ithin risk categories and cohorts. (s) Modification means a Government action that (1) differs from actions assumed in the baseline estimate of cash flows and (2) changes the estimated cost of an outstanding direct loan (or direct loan obligation) or an outstanding loan guarantee (or loan guarantee commitment). The modification may be for a single loan or loan guarantee as well as a group; it may be any size; and it may affect pre- 1992 direct loans and loan guarantees or post -1991 direct loans or loan guarantees. New legislation that alters the baseline cash flow estimate for a loan or group of loans always results in a modifi cation. A Government action may change the cost directly by altering the terms of existing contracts, selling loan assets (with or without recourse), converting guaranteed loans to direct loans by purchasing them from a private lender , or inducing prepayment of an outstanding loan in order to offer a new loan at more favorable terms or interest rates. It also may change the cost indirectly by legislatively changing the way in which a SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 12 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) portfolio of direct loans or guaranteed loans is administered. E xamples of changes in the terms of existing loan contracts are forgiveness, forbearance, interest rate reductions, extensions of maturity, and prepayments without penalty. Examples of changes in loan administration are new methods of debt collection, such as using tax refunds to repay loans and restrictions on debt collections. If the baseline cost estimate does not assume an action, and the cost would be increased or decreased as a result of that action, the action is a modification. Modifications do not include a Government action that is assumed in the baseline cost estimate, as long as the assumption is documented and has been approved by OMB. For example, modifications would not include routine administrative work-outs (see section 185.3(ac) ) of tro ubled loans or loans in imminent default. They also would not include a borrower 's or the Government 's exercise of an option that is permitted within the terms of an existing contract, such as a borrower prepaying the loan. The baseline subsidy estimate must include all anticipated actions by the Government, lenders, and borrowers that are permissible under current law and that affect the cash flow. Subsequently, if the cost estimate of an action by the borrower, lender, or the Government differs from wh at is anticipated in the documented baseline subsidy estimate, then the difference in cost is included in a reestimate. Assumptions underlying the subsidy estimates must be documented to assist in determining whether an action is a modification or a reestimate. Unless noted otherwise in an agency 's model submission, the following (non- exhaustive) Government actions are assumed to be in the baseline: Taking all permitted actions to maximize recoveries in the event a borrower defaults Disbursements less th an the maximum direct loan obligation or loan guarantee commitment amount that would not directly impact the viability of the other loan amounts (see next paragraph for further discussion) The exercise of options (prepayments, forbearance, loss mitigation actions, etc.) permitted within the terms of an existing contract , provided that the option(s) have been contemplated in the agency 's model submission or other model documentation Modifications do not include additional disbursements to borrowers that inc rease the amount of an outstanding direct loan or an outstanding loan guarantee. These are treated as new direct loans or loan guarantees in the amount of the additional disbursement. Disbursements less than the maximum direct loan obligation or loan gua rantee commitment amount are not modifications unless otherwise explicitl y documented or would directly impact the viability of the loan amounts already outstanding. See Appendix F for the treatment of recoveries of unpaid obligations. When executing deobligations of subsidy budget authority in such cases, contact your OMB representative to verify that you are using the correct original subsidy rate for these calculations. There are situations where it is not clear whether a Government action constitutes a modification or a n action captured by a reestimate. These situations should be judged on a case-by -case basis by OMB in consultation with the agency. They could include actions by the Government that are not addressed in existing contracts, management changes that are within an agency 's existing specific authority for the loan program, and broad changes in agency policy (e.g., a new loan sale policy). In general, if the possibility of the action was explicitly included in the cash flows for the baseline subsidy estimate, and this can be documented, it would most likely be a reestimate. If not, it would most likely be a modification. When it is unclear whether a Government action is a modification or a work -out, please contact your OMB representative in a timely manner. Modifications produce a one -time change in the subsidy cost of outstanding direct loans (or direct loan obligations) and loan guarantees (or loan guarantee commitments). The effect of the Government action on the subsidy cost of new direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments made after the date of SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 185 the modification, if there is any effect, is not a modification. Instead, the effects are incorporated in the initial cost estimates for subsequent direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments. (t) Modification cost means the difference between the estimate of the net present value of the remaining cash flows assumed for the direct loan or loan guarantee contract before and after the modification. The estimate of the remaining cash flows before the modification must be the same as assumed in the baseline for the most recent President 's Budget. The estimate of the remaining cash flows after the modification must be the pre- modification cash flows adjusted solely to reflect the effects of the modification. An outstanding direct loan (or direct loan obligation) or loan guarantee (or loan guarantee commitment) cannot be modified in a manner that increases its cost, unless budget authority for the additional cost has been p rovided in advance in an appropriations act. Should a modification result in a savings, the amount of the savings are recorded as negative subsidy receipts, and paid to the appropriate negative subsidy receipt account. (See section 185.3(w) ) Budget authority, an obligation, and an outlay will be recorded in the year in which the legislation is enacted or the administrative discretion is exercised, or in the case of appropriations acts enacted before the fiscal year to which they apply, the year for whi ch appropriations are provided. See section 185.7 for guidance on calculating modification costs. (u) Modification adjustment transfer means an adjusting entry to correct for differences between current discount rates and cohort discount rates . When a post -1991 direct loan or loan guarantee is modified, a modification adjustment transfer must be made between the financing account and the general fund. The modification adjustment transfer adjusts for the disconnect between the discount rate used to calculate the cost of the modification and the interest rate at which the cohort pays or earns interest. These calculations and the budgetary treatment are explained in section 185.7. (v) Negative subsidies mean subsidy costs that are less than zero. They occur if the present value of cash inflows to the Government exceeds the present value of cash outflows. In such cases, appropriations bills must still provide specific authority before direct loans or loan guarantees can be made, generally in the form of a loan limitation. When a direct loan obligation or loan guarantee commitment is made that has a negative subsidy, an amount equal to the negative subsidy will be obligated in the financing account. When the loan is disbursed, the financing account will pay the negative subsidy to the negative subsidy receipt account. The collections are recorded as offsetting receipts, and they offset the agency 's budget authority and outlays. The accounting for negative subsidies is discussed in section 185.3( w) below. (w) Negative subsidy receipt accounts mean budget accounts for the receipt of amounts paid from the financing account when there is a negative subsidy for the original estimate or where a modification results in a savings (see sections 185.3(v) and 185.3(t) ). The receipt account is a general fund receipt account and amounts are not earmarked for the credit program. They are available for appropriation only in the sense that all general fund receipts are available for appropriation. Separate downward reestimate receipt accounts are used to record amounts paid from the financing account for downward reestimates (see section 185.3(z) ). At the discretion of the OMB representative with primary responsibility for the program, a special fund receipt account may instead be established for the purpose of earmarking the receipts for appropriation to the program (in which case a special fund expenditure account also will be established and merged with the program account). If the program is a discretiona ry program, these receipts are available for obligation only to the extent provided in annual appropriations acts. For mandatory programs, the receipts usually are available for administrative expenses only to the extent provided in annual appropriations acts. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 14 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Obligations may not be incurred against the negative subsidy receipts until they have been credited to the receipt account and appropriated. Because negative subsidy receipts are not credited to the receipt account until the underlying direct loan or guaranteed loan is disbursed, they might not become available in time to fund expenditures in a timely manner. Such situations might require an appropriation from the general fund to permit obligations to be made until receipts are available for obligat ion. (x) Net proceeds, when used in the context of loan asset sales, mean the amounts paid by the purchasers less all seller transaction costs (such as underwriting, rating agency, legal, financial advisory, and due diligence fees) that are paid out of the gross sales proceeds rather than paid as direct obligations by the agency. The net proceeds from the sale of an equity partnership are the same as defined above plus an estimate of the net present value of future cash inflows to the Government from the sale. (y) Program account means a budget account that receives and obligates appropriations to cover the subsidy cost of a direct loan or loan guarantee and disburses the subsidy cost to the financing account. Program accounts usually receive a separate appropriation for administrative expenses. (z) R eestimates mean revisions of the subsidy cost estimate of a cohort (or risk category) based on information about the actual performance and/or estimated changes in future cash flows of the cohort. Reestimat es must be made immediately after the end of each fiscal year, as long as any loans in the cohort are outstanding, unless a different plan is approved by OMB (see section 185.6). An upward reestimate indicates that insufficient funds had been paid to the financing account, so the increase (plus interest on reestimates) is paid from the program account to the financing account to make it whole. Permanent indefinite budget authority is available for this purpose pursuant to section 504(f) of the FCRA . A downward reestimate indicates that too much subsidy had been paid to the financing account. The excess (plus interest) is disbursed to a downward reestimate receipt account. See section 185.6 for guidance on calculating reestimates. ( aa) Risk categories mean subdivisions of a cohort of direct loans or loan guarantees into groups that are relatively homogeneous in cost, given the facts known at the time of obligation or commitment . They are developed by agencies in consultation with the OMB representative with primary budget responsibility for the credit account. The number will depend on the size of the difference in subsidy cost between categories and the ability to predict it statistically based on facts known at origination. Risk categories will group all direct loans or loan guarantees within a cohort that share characteristics predictive of defaults and other costs. They may be defined by characteristics or combinations of characteristics of the loan, the project financed, and/or the borrower. Examples of characteristics or indicators that may predict cost include: The loan -to-value ratio; The relationship between the loan interest rate and relevant market rates; Type of school attended for education loans; Country risk categories for international loans; Various asset or income ratios; and Major contract terms. Statistical evidence must be presented, based on historical analysis of program data or comparable credit data, concerning the likely costs of defaults, other deviations from contract, or other costs that are expected to be associated with the loans in that category. Some risk categories will be executed on a portfolio average basis, whereas other risk categories will be executed on a loan-by -loan basis. When risk categories are executed on a portfolio average basis, agencies should work with their OMB representative to establish thresholds for which OMB notification or review is required when individual loans are statistically SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 15 of Section 185 heterogen eous from the rest of the portfolio and may not have been contemplated in the original subsidy estimate for the President 's Budget. (ab) Sub sidy estimates mean estimates of budget authority and outlays for direct loan and loan guarantee subsidy costs for a cohort or risk category of direct loans or loan guarantees. Like budget estimates for non-credit programs, the budget includes both Presidential policy subsidy estimates and baseline subsidy estimates. Baseline subsidy estimates project the current year (CY) levels of subsidy costs into the outyears based on laws already enacted. Presidential policy subsidy estimates reflect the effect on subsidy costs of policies included in the budget, including any proposed legislation t hat would affect subsidy costs. See section 185.5 for guidance on calculating subsidy estimates. (ac) Work -outs mean plans that offer options short of default or foreclosure for resolving troubled loans or loans in imminent default, such as deferring or forgiving principal or interest, reducing the borrower 's interest rate, extending the loan maturity, or postponing collection action. Work-outs are expected to minimize the cost to the Government of resolving troubled loans or loans in imminent default. They should only be utilized if it is likely that the borrower will be able to repay under the terms of the work -out and if the cost of the work -out is less than the cost of default or foreclosure. For post -1991 direct loans and loan guarantees, the expected effects of work -outs on cash flow are included in the original estimate of the subsidy cost. If the effects of the work -out on the cash flow are the same as originally estimated, the subsidy cost does not change. However, if the effects of the work -out result in cash flows that are higher or lower than originally estimated, the difference in cost is included in reestimates, and is not considered a modification. 185.4 Are there special requirements for reporting Antideficiency Act violations? Yes. The s pecial requirements for credit programs are provided in section 145.3. 185.5 How do I calculate the subsidy estimate? (a) General You must provide subsidy estimates for both Presidential policy and the baseline for all budget accounts that have post -1991 direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments or that have modifications of pre-1992 direct loan or loan guarantee contracts. You must make subsidy estimates for each risk category. Under section 503(a) of the FCRA , OMB has the final responsibility for determining subsidy estimates, in consultation with the agencies. Use t he online Credit Subsidy Calculator ( the Calculator) to discount all agency -generated estimates of cash flows to and from the Government. The Calculator and documentation provide explanation and examples of the discounting method and how the subsidy rate is calculated. All agencies must use the Calculator and associated discount rates to ensure government -wide comparability and uniformity of discounting. It can be obtained from the OMB representative with primary budget responsibility for the credit account. Direct loan and loan guarantee subsidy costs are defined in sections 185.3(g) a nd 185.3(p) . The subsidy cost is the estimated long-term cost to the Government of direct loans or loan guarantees calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative expenses (see section 185.3(a) ). For budget formulation (and execution), subsidy estimates are to be based on the economic and technical assumptions underlying the President 's Budget that is submitted for the fiscal year in which the funds will be obligated. For CY, this means using the economic and technical assumptions underlying the BY subsidy estimates contained in the President' s Budget for the previous year (adjusted for changes in terms of the contract or legislation enacted since the budget was transmitted; see section 185.24). For BY through BY+9, this means using the economic and technical assumptions in the President 's Budget that will be submitted for BY. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 16 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) For loans made, guaranteed, or modified in FY 2001 and thereafter, the cash flow that is estimated for each year (or other time period) is discounted using the interest rate on a marketable zero -coupon Treasury security with the same maturity from the date of disbursement as that cash flow. For example, a cash flow expected to occur one y ear after the date of disbursement will be discounted at the one- year zero -coupon Treasury rate. The discount rate assumptions for the budget will be provided by OMB in a file for use with the Calculator. For estimates of credit subsidy cost in BY+1 thro ugh BY+9, please contact the OMB representative with primary responsibility for the account regarding the appropriate discount rates for these estimates. For consistency between the projected cash flows and economic assumption discount rates in cost estim ates for direct loan programs where the borrower interest rate is tied to Treasury rates at the time the loan is made, agencies must use the appropriate economic assumption interest rates derived from the Calculator discount rates underlying the President 's Budget for the fiscal year of obligation, incorporating any relevant contractual terms associated with the borrower 's interest rate. A tool for deriving interest rate assumptions is available through the OMB representative with primary responsibility fo r the account. For purposes of calculating loan guarantee subsidy estimates, the loan guarantee commitment is the full principal amount of the loan that is guaranteed, not just the portion guaranteed by the Government. For revolving loan guarantee credi t facilities, i.e., where a borrower may draw and repay a private lender multiple times under the same contract, agencies may record loan guarantee commitments reflecting the maximum face value that may be outstanding per the contract. Agency credit subsi dy cost models for these programs must reflect all other cash flows associated with the anticipated commitments over the life of the cohort. For revolving loan guarantee credit facilities, or other non-standard terms, please contact your primary OMB repre sentative for further guidance. (b) Presidential policy subsidy estimates Make separate subsidy estimates for all programs (discretionary and mandatory) for CY and BY. The steps for calculating the Presidential policy estimates of subsidy budget authori ty and outlays (including negative subsidies) for a cohort (or risk category) of direct loans and loan guarantees are as follows: Step 1. Estimate the cash flows to and from the Government for the cohort of direct loans or loan guarantees obligated or committed in that year, for that year and each subsequent year for the life of the direct or guaranteed loan. If you have not finalized the requested amount of obligations or commitments, you may use any amount to calculate the subsidy estimate as long as the cash flows you have developed are based on that same amount. Discount these cash flows to the point of loan disbursement using the Cal culator. The difference between the present value of the Government cash outflows and inflows is the total subsidy (i.e., the subsidy cost) for the obligations or commitments made in that year. For calculations of subsidy cost in BY+1 through BY+9, agenc ies with separate credit subsidy cost estimates for each cohort should contact their OMB representative for the appropriate discount rates. Step 2. (Performed automatically by the Calculator.) Calculate the subsidy rate for the cohort by dividing the su bsidy cost by the direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments made in that year. Step 3. (Performed automatically by the MAX A-11 DE) When the requested amount of direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments has been finalized, multiply the subsidy rate by the direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments to calculate budget authority (or offsetting receipts, in the case of negative subsidies) for the subsidy cost. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 17 of Section 185 Step 4. Subsidy outlays for each fiscal year are equal to the subsidy cost for all loans disbursed in that year, whether the loans or guarantees were obligated or committed in that year or in prior years. (c) Baseline subsidy estimates The steps for calculating the baseline estimates of subsidy budget authority and outlays (including negative subsidies) for a cohort (or risk category) of direct loans and loan guarantees are as follows: Step 1. For discretionary programs, inflate the subsidy budget authority enacted for CY (the base year) to calculate the subsid y budget authority for BY through BY+9. The inflator is the annual adjustment factor for non-pay costs (the gross domestic product chain -type price index) provided in the economic assumptions for the President 's Budget that will be submitted for BY. Step 2. For mandatory programs, first calculate the subsidy rate as described above under \"Presidential policy estimates,\" excluding the effects of any legislative proposals. For cohorts BY+1 through BY+9, cash flows should be discounted using the appropriate outyear discount rates for each cohort. For each cohort year, multiply the subsidy rate by the baseline estimate of demand for loans to calculate the subsidy BA for that cohort. Step 3. For any programs with negative subsidies, first calculate the subsidy rate as described above under \" Presidential policy estimates,\" excluding the effects of any legislative proposals. Then multiply the subsidy rate by the baseline estimate of demand for loans, constrained by the estimated limitation, to calculate the amount of offsetting receipts. The limitation should be estimated by inflating the CY enacted limitation using the annual adjustment factor for non- pay costs (the gross domestic product chain -type price index) provided in the economic assumptions for the President 's Budget that will be submitted for BY. Step 4. Subsidy outlays for each fiscal year are equal to the subsidy cost for all loans disbursed in that year, whether the loans or guarantees were obligated or committed in that year or in prior years. For CY only, the total also includes outlays for reestimates and interest on reestimates. First calculate outlays expected from disbursements of loans obligated or committed in prior fiscal years; for example, the subsidy cost of a direct loan obligated in CY that disburses equally over 2 years will outlay 50 percent in the first year (CY) and 50 percent in the second year (BY). Then add outlays from disbursements of loans obligated or committed in that year. For CY only, you should also add outlays for reestimates and (although it is not part of the subsidy as such) add outlays for interest on reestimates. 185.6 How do I calculate reestimates? (a) General Subsidy reestimates are made on direct loans and loan guarantees that have been disbursed. They are recorded in the current year column of the budget. (For example, the subsidy for direct or guaranteed loans disbur sed during 2013 would be reestimated during 2014 and would be recorded in the 2014 column of the FY 2015 Budget.) A closing reestimate should be made once all the loans in the cohort have been repaid or written off. Please see section 18 5.6(g) for more in formation about closing reestimates. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 18 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Two different types of reestimates are made: Interest rate reestimates, for differences between discount rate assumptions at the time of formulation (the same assumption is used at the time of obligation or commitment) and the actual interest rate(s) for the year(s) of disbursement; and Technical reestimates, for changes in technical assumptions. Interest rate reestimates of the subsidy cost of a cohort of direct loans or loan guarantees must be made when a cohort has substantially disbursed (i.e., the first fiscal year when the direct loans or guaranteed loans are at least 90 percent disbursed). The computation should be made after the close of the fiscal year in which this criterion is met, unless a later time within the same fiscal year is approved by the OMB representative with primary budget responsibility for the credit account. You may calculate interest rate reestimates more frequently than under this requirement, including a final interest rate reestimate when the cohort has fully disbursed. You may also perform an interest rate reestimate if a cohort is not yet 90 percent disbursed and no further disbursements are possible. If you decide to do so, consult with the OMB representative with primary r esponsibility for the account. An interest rate reestimate will be made to adjust the subsidy estimate for the difference between the discount rates estimated at the time of formulation (the same assumptions are used at the time of obligation or commitmen t) and the actual interest rate(s) prevailing during the year(s) of disbursement. To calculate the size of this effect, all other assumptions (disbursement rates, default rates, etc.) must be identical to those used to calculate the original subsidy estim ate. For those programs with variable interest rate supplements to the lender or with variable interest rates charged to the borrower, the original cash flow projections are adjusted to incorporate the actual interest rate(s) prevailing during the year(s) of disbursement and are subsequently adjusted after the end of each year so long as the loans are outstanding. Agencies are not required to update borrower interest rate (BIR) when an interest rate reestimate is calculated, as changing the BIR could affe ct other variables in econometric models. Please contact the OMB representative with primary responsibility for the account for further guidance. Those programs that benchmark to Treasury rates for borrower 's interest rates or interest subsidies to lenders will also update cash flow assumptions for the actual Treasury interest rates. Technical reestimates of the subsidy cost of a cohort of direct loans or loan guarantees must be made after the close of each fiscal year as long as the loans are outstandi ng, unless a different plan is approved by the OMB representative with primary budget responsibility for the credit account. The different plan might be with regard to the time when reestimates are made within the year or the frequency of reestimates. If the plan allows reestimates to be made less frequently than every year, it should require reestimates to be made for any year when any one of the following five conditions is met: (1) When required based on periodic schedules established in coordination with OMB, consistent with the unique attributes of each program (e.g., initially every two years after the cohort has been substantially disbursed, then every five years); (2) When a major change in actual versus projected activity is detected (e.g., a loan that is large relative to the size of the portfolio goes into default or prepays substantially earlier than expected); (3) When a material difference is detected through monitoring triggers developed in coordination with OMB. The triggers would focus on major dat a elements (e.g., total projected versus total actual cohort collections) rather than in-depth individual cohort analysis. Agencies should focus on a few major loan elements recognizing there are different key elements applicable to each program and diffe rent reporting problems; SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 19 of Section 185 (4) When a cohort reaches 90 percent disbursement. The final cohort interest rate is established from the first technical reestimate following the interest rate reestimate (see 185.36 below); and (5) When a cohort is being closed out. Technical reestimates are made for all changes in assumptions other than interest rates. This type of reestimate compares the subsidy estimate that already includes any reestimate for actual interest rates with a reestimated subsidy using updated technical information (for defaults, fees, recoveries, etc.) as well as actual interest rates. The purpose of technical reestimates is to adjust the subsidy estimate for differences between the original projection of cash flows (as estimated at obligation) and the amount and timing of cash flows that are expected based on actual experience, new forecasts about future economic conditions, and other events and improvements in the methods used to estimate future cash flows. Because actual cash flows are experienced every year and the ability to forecast future years also changes, this reestimate must be done after the end of every fiscal year as long as any loans are outstanding (except as provided above). Reestimates must be made separately for each cohort. If a cohort is divided into risk categories, each risk category within a cohort must be reestimated separately. The reestimate will then be compared with the previous estimate. For this purpose, all details of the previous subsidy estimates by risk categor y should be retained in program records. The requirements for recording reestimates in the budget and the financial statements are not identical . For both interest rate and technical reestimates, you should record reestimates in the budget whenever they have been made for the financial statements even if they are not otherwise required for the budget under the criteria of this chapter (e.g., if interest rate reestimates are made before the cohort is substantially disbursed, or if technical reestimates are made more often than under a plan OMB has approved). You should also be sure to record reestimates in the budget whenever they are required for the budget under the criteria of this section, even if they are not required for the financial statements (e.g., if reestimates are not material for the financial statements). Whenever reestimates are made less frequently than every year, the reestimate should cover cumulatively the entire period since the last reestimate. Once approved, execute the reestimates by May 15 th. See 185.17 and 185.18 below for further details. (b) Calculating interest rate reestimates Use the following procedures to calculate interest rate reestimates, unless an alternative method has been approved by OMB. For further details, see the instructions accompanying the online Credit Subsidy Calculator (t he Calculator), available from the OMB representative with primary budget responsibility for the credit account. Step 1. Start with the original cash flows used to estimate the subsidy at obligation (on a risk category basis), updated only for actual interest rate(s) as outlined above. Step 2. Reestimate the subsidy rate using the Calculator. The Calculator will use the actual average annual interest rates for the year in which the loans were disbursed. For programs that disburse over more than one yea r, the Calculator will determine a disbursement-weighted average discount rate (for cohorts before 2001) or single effective rate (for cohorts 2001 and after) based on actual average annual interest rates for each year in which loans have disbursed using t he original disbursement assumptions. The Calculator will calculate a revised subsidy rate for the entire cohort. This is the interest rate reestimated subsidy rate. Step 3. Calculate the percentage point difference between this revised subsidy rate an d the subsidy rate estimated at the time of obligation. For example, if the subsidy rate estimated at SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 20 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) the time of obligation is 7 percent and the revised subsidy rate is 9 percent, then this difference is 2 percentage points. The Calculator can automatic ally perform this calculation when performing technical reestimates, please see accompanying documentation for the Calculator for more information. Step 4. Multiply the dollar value of actual loan disbursements to date by the percentage point difference in the subsidy rates. For example, using the case in step 3, if $100 million in loans have been disbursed, then this amount would be $2 million ($100 million multiplied by 2 percentage points). The product is the cumulative interest rate reestimate. Step 5. To derive the additional interest rate subsidy reestimate for the current year, deduct previous interest rate reestimates, if any (see 185.6 (d) below). (c) Calculating technical reestimates There are two methods for calculating technical reestimates: the traditional approach and the balances approach. The Calculator uses the balances approach to produce the official technical reestimate used in the President 's Budget. Under the balances approach, reestimates are performed by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows to the balance in the financing account. Balance approach reestimates can be calculated using reported balances , as entered by the user, or calculated balances , as computed by the Calculator based on the su m of historical cash flows entered by the user. In most circumstances, calculated balances should equal reported balances. The traditional approach for computing technical reestimates requires historical and projected cash flows to and from the Government . The technical reestimate using the traditional approach is computed by the Credit Subsidy Calculator during technical reestimates as a check against the technical reestimate generated using the balances approach, which is generally the amount that shoul d be executed. Agencies are required to use the Calculator for reestimate submissions for the President 's Budget. The Calculator is available from the OMB representative with primary budget responsibility for the credit account to assist with these calcu lations. For further details, see the documentation accompanying the Calculator. (d) Calculating interest on reestimates Interest on reestimates is the amount of interest that would have been earned or paid by each cohort on the subsidy reestimate, if the reestimated subsidy had been included as part of the original subsidy estimate. It is paid on the amount of the reestimate by the program account (for upward reestimates) or the financing account (for downward reestimates). The purpose is to put the financing account in the same position as if the subsidy cost had been estimated in the first place using the information that is incorporated in the reestimate. The interest rate to calculate the interest on reestimates is the same rate that is used to discount cash flows for the cohort. Interest on reestimates is calculated automatically by the Calculator. (e) Financing account interest adjustments The financing account interest adjustment corrects for the difference between the interest that should have been earned or paid on the financing account debt and cash balances, and the actual net financing account interest executed for the cohort. This allows agencies to correct for the period where interest was earned or paid using budget assumption inte rest rates before the actual rates were available. Financing account interest adjustments are included in the interest on reestimate for reporting purposes. The Calculator can automatically calculate the financing account interest adjustment for cohorts with SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 21 of Section 185 historical data. This approach reduces the number of transactions required to adjust for changes in the financing account interest calculation, a non -budgetary transaction. Please see the documentation accompanying the Calculator. (f) Reestimate i ncreases/decreases In cases where agencies execute a risk category on a loan -by-loan basis, increases or decreases in subsidy cost for different loans within the same cohort and risk category will be netted against each other; that is, loans which require increased subsidies may first draw on the excess from any risk categories within the cohort where the reestimate shows a subsidy decrease. No such netting may occur between cohorts or risk categories. OMB may provide permission in writing to allow netting between risk categories within the same cohort. If the reestimate indicates a net increase in the subsidy cost of the cohort as a whole since the last estimate or reestimate, an obligation in the amount of the net increase (plus interest) must be recorded against permanent indefinite budget authority available to the program account for this purpose. The obligation must be recorded separately in the program and financing schedule as \" reestimates of direct loan subsidy \" or as \" reestimates of loan guarantee subsidy \" (and as \" interest on reestimates of direct loan subsidy \" or as \"interest on reestimates of loan guarantee subsidy \"), so that it can be distinguished from obligations for the subsidy cost of new loans and loan guarantees. An equal amount of outlays from the program account to the financing account will be recorded when the reestimate is made. The interest rate to calculate the interest on upward reestimates is the same rate that is used to discount cash flows for the cohort. When outlays for reestimates are recorded in the credit program account, an equal amount of offsetting collections will be recorded in the appropriate risk categories in the financing account. In the case of direct loans, the offsetting collections from the program account, together with repayments from borrowers, will be used to pay interest and repay principal on borrowing from Treasury and for other expenses. In the case of loan guarantees, the offsetting collections will be retained as unobligated balances, together with the unobligated balances of the original subsidy payment, fees, and interest, until needed to pay default claims and other expenses. Any unused balances of collections due to the reestimate will earn interest at the same rate as is paid on other funds held by the financing account for the same cohort. If the reestimate indicates a net decrease in the subsidy cost of the cohort as a whole since the last estimate or reestimate, there is a downward reestimate. To keep the correct amount of balances in t he financing account, an obligation and a financing disbursement in the amount of the net decrease (plus interest on reestimate) must be recorded in the financing account. In the case of direct loans, the obligation will typically be financed with authority to borrow from the Treasury. In the case of loan guarantees, the obligation will typically be financed with unobligated balances. The obligation will be recorded in the program and financing schedule as \"payment of downward reestimates\" (and as \" interest on downward reestimates\" ). The interest rate to calculate the interest on downward reestimates is the same rate that is used to discount cash flows for the cohort. As a general rule, the financing disbursement for a downward reestimate (plus interest on reestimate) will be made from the financing account to a general fund downward reestimate receipt account established for each credit program. The receipts will be recorded as offsetting receipts, which will offset the total budget authority and outla ys of the agency and the budget subfunction of the program. However, at the discretion of the OMB representative with primary responsibility for the program, a special fund receipt account may instead be established. If a special fund receipt account is used for the credit program and already exists, the downward reestimates and interest on reestimates will be recorded in a subaccount rather than a new special fund receipt account. Schedule N is required for these special funds (see section 86.4). When a special fund receipt account is used, the receipts from downward reestimates and interest on reestimates, like those from negative SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 22 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) subsidies, are only available for obligation to the extent provided in advance in appr opriations acts (except for mandatory programs, where they are immediately available for obligation). The normal provisions still apply: discretionary appropriations are required for discretionary subsidy costs, modifications, and administrative costs; mandatory appropriations are available for upward reestimates and mandatory programs. (g) Closing reestimates Agencies will make a closing technical reestimate once all of the loans in a cohort have been either repaid or written off and closed -out following guidance in OMB Circular No. A- 129 Se ction V.E. Closing reestimates may not be performed if further cash flows to and from the government are possible, for example if an agency writes off a loan as currently not collectable but future collections are possible (even if they are unlikely). I n order to close a cohort, agencies must follow the same procedures outlined in this section for a typical technical reestimate, but should use the \" reported balances\" purpose, ensuring that reported cash and debt balances are based on actual accounting data. The C redit Subsidy Calculator documentation provides detailed instructions on how to performing a closing reestimate. Agencies must notify OMB when closing reestimates are performed. Closing entries will be ma de in the accounting records. 185.7 How do I calculate and record modifications? When a direct loan or loan guarantee is modified, the subsidy cost of the modification must be calculated. The subsidy cost calculation will indicate whether the Government action changes the subsidy cost. If there is no change in cost, there will be no budgetary effect, and nothing needs to be recorded in the Budget. If the modification will increase or decrease the cost, the budgetary effect must be recorded as described under modification cost increases/decreases below. Additional transfers to or from the financing account will be required, with the type of transfer depending on whether the modification affects pre -1992 or post -1991 direct loans and loan guarantees. These additional transfers are described in a separate subsection below. The subsidy cost of the modification is the difference between the estimate of the net present value of the remaining cash flows for the direct loan or loan guarantee before and after t he modification. The estimate of remaining cash flows before modification must be the same as assumed in the baseline for the most recent President' s Budget. The estimate of remaining cash flows after modification must be the pre - modification cash flows adjusted solely to reflect the effects of the modification. There may be times when an agency calculates a modification cost that is a significant dollar figure but, due to the overall size of the program, the modification cost rounds to less than the 0.01% level that can be shown in the Budget database. While agencies should maintain consistency to the degree to which they round calculations for Budget execution, agencies with greater than $10 billion in loan assets should consult with their OMB examiner as to the proper degree of precision for cost estimates, especially for modifications. (a) Estimating the modification subsidy cost The modification subsidy cost is calculated using the steps below (where cash flows to the Government have positive signs and cash flows from the Government have negative signs). Note: If you are using cash flows prepared for the online Credit Subsidy Calculator , you may need to adjust the signs on some cash flows for the following modi fication calculation.). These steps must be followed for each cohort affected by the modifying action. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 23 of Section 185 Step 1. Calculate the net present value of remaining pre-modification cash flows . Use the reestimated cash flows from the most recent President 's Budget. If applicable, exclude prior year cash flow data; calculations should be made using only the estimated flows for the current and future years. Discount these cash flows using the discount rates assumed in formulating the subsidy estimates in the President 's Budget for the year in which the modification takes place. For example, if the modification will occur in 2015, then the discount rates used to discount the cash flows will be the interest rates used to formulate the 2015 President 's Budget. Step 2. Calculate the net present value of remaining post -modification cash flows . Use the same cash flows used in step 1 above, modified only to reflect the effect of the modification. Do not alter the cash flows to reflect any other changes that may have occurred between the most recent President's Budget and the time of the modification. Use the same discount rates as in step 1 above to discount these post -modification cash flows. If a loan asset is sold, in most cases the post -modification cash flows will be the net proceeds expected from the sale (see section 185.8) and no discounting is necessary. Contact your OMB representative with questions on calculations for loan asset sales. Step 3 . Compute the cost of the modification. This is equal to step 1 minus step 2. The results of this calculation will be positive, negative, or zero. A positive estimate indicates that the Government will incur an additional subsidy cost because of the modification. A negative estimate indicates that the Government is achieving savings. (1) Cost increases. Modifications may be made only to the extent that budget authority for the additional cost has been provided in advance and is available in the program account. At the time that a modification is made, record an obligation in the amount of the estimated increase in subsidy cost against budget authority in the program account. At the same time, record an outlay in the amount of the increase in the subsidy cost from the program account to the appropriate direct loan or guaranteed loan financing account. Simultaneously, record an equal amount of offsetting collections in the financing account. In the case of direct loans, the offsetting collections in the financing account will be credited to the cohort and risk category of the modified loan and will be used to pay interest and to repay debt owed to Treasury and for other expenses. In the case of loan guarantees, the offsetting collections will be credited to the cohort and risk category of the modified loan guarantee and will be retained as unobligated balances until needed to pay default claims and other expenses. The additional balances due to the modification will earn interest at the same rate as is paid on other funds held by the financing account for the same cohort. (2) Cost decreases. At the time that a modification is made, record an obligation in the amount of the estimated decrease in subsidy cost in the fin ancing account. In the case of a direct loan modification, record the obligation against authority to borrow from the Treasury. In the case of a loan guarantee, record the obligation against unobligated balances for the cohort, or if unobligated balances are insufficient, against authority to borrow. At the same time, record in the financing account an equal disbursement to the negative subsidy receipt account established for each credit program. See sections 185.10, 185.11, and 185.30 for additional information on recording these transactions for budget formulation and execution. (b) Estimating the modification adjustment transfer The above calculation is the cost of the modification. However, for post -1991 direct loans or loan guarantees, an additional calculation must be accomplished to account for the difference between the discount rate used to calculate the cost of the modific ation and the interest rate at which the cohort pays or earns interest. If the only transfer made between the financing account and the general fund was for the SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 24 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) change in the subsidy cost, the resources of the financing account would be out of balance bec ause of this difference. This imbalance is corrected by a modification adjustment transfer between the financing account and the general fund. The transfer is not an outlay or an offsetting collection because it does not represent a cost to the Governmen t of the loan or the guarantee. Instead, it is a facilitating adjustment to balance the present value of the assets and liabilities held by the financing account. To compute the modification adjustment transfer, one needs to follow the following steps: Step 4 . Calculate the net present value of remaining pre -modification cash flows using cohort interest rates. Take the pre-modification cash flows from step 1 and compute the net present value of these cash flows using the applicable cohort interest rate (as opposed to the President 's Budget formulation discount rates used in step 1). Step 5 . Calculate the net present value of remaining post -modification cash flows using cohort interest rates. Take the post -modification cash flows from step 2 and compute the net present value of these cash flows using the applicable cohort interest rate (as opposed to the President 's Budget formulation discount rates used in step 2). Step 6. Compute the difference between step 4 and step 5. This is equal to step 4 minus step 5. Step 7. Compute the modification adjustment transfer (MAT) . This is equal to step 6 minus step 3. If the MAT is negative, then the MAT should be transferred from the financing account to the general fund. If the MAT is positive, then the MAT should be transferred from the general fund to the financing account. If the financing account makes a modification adjustment transfer to the general fund, this transfer is recorded on lines 1022 (capital transfers from unobligated balances (-)), and /or line 1820 (capital transfer from offsetting collections to general fund ( -)). If there is not enough cash from these sources, the financing fund would exercise borrowing authority to pay the MAT. This would be recorded on line 1424 (capital transfer o f borrowing authority to general fund ( -)). Exhibits 185N through 185Z are a simplified presentation highlighting the budget execution dynamics for interrelated credit accounts. Note that the apportionment for a modification adjustment transfer to the general fund may utilize line 1842 ( anticipated capital transfer). The transfer and the modification subsidy cost together produce the following transactions with Treasury. All transactions noted below are recorded on the program and financing schedule. If a loan guarantee is modified, the financing account 's offsetting collection for the modification cost increases the unobligated balance brought forward into the following fiscal year (line 1000 in the following fiscal year). The capital transfer to the general fund reduces the amount by which the unobligat ed balance is increased. (The amount of the increase shown on line 1000 is net of the capital transfer.) Subsequent interest earnings on the addition to the balance are lower than they would have been without the capital transfer. If a direct loan is m odified, the financing account 's offsetting collection for the modification cost is used to reduce debt owed to Treasury (line 1825, Spending authority from offsetting collections applied to repay debt). The capital transfer reduces the amount by which the debt is reduced. (The amount of the increase shown on line 1825 is net of the capital transfer.) Subsequent interest paid to Treasury is higher than it would have been without the capital transfer. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 25 of Section 185 For modification adjustment transfers to the general fund, the general fund will collect the modification adjustment transfer in a non-budgetary capital transfer receipt account. Treasury receipt account 2814 should be used to collect the modification adjustment transfers from all financing accounts. For more information about this acc ount, see the Treasury Federal Account Symbols and Titles (FAST Book), available at https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/fastBook/fastbook_home.htm . If the financing account receives a modification adjustment transfer from the general fund, this is recorded in the financing account as a permanent appropriation (line 1200, Appropriation). Cite the Federal Credit Reform Act ( FCRA ), title V of P ublic Law 93-344, as amended, as the law providing budget authority for the modification adjustment transfer. The transfer and the modification subsidy cost together produce the following transactions w ith Treasury. All transactions noted below are recorded on the program and financing schedule. I f a loan guarantee is modified, the financing account 's offsetting collection for the modification cost increases the unobligated balance brought forward into the following fiscal year (line 1000). The modification adjustment transfer also increases the unobligated balance (line 1000). Subsequent interest on uninvested funds is higher than it would have been without the modification adjustment transfer. If a direct loan is modified, the offsetting collection for the modification cost is used to reduce debt owed to Treasury (line 1825, Spending authority from offsetting collections applied to repay debt). The modification adjustment transfer is also used to reduce debt owed to Treasury (line 1236, Appropriations applied to repay debt). Subsequent interest paid to Treasury is lower than it would have been without the modification adjustment transfer. (c) Additional financing account transfers for modificati ons of pre -1992 direct loans and loan guarantees When modifications are made to pre -1992 direct loans and loan guarantees, the immediately following approach (#1) should be used, unless the OMB representative for the credit program approves using the alternative approach (described in #2 below). 1) Transfer of asset or liability to financing account . Pre -1992 direct loans and loan guarantees are held in liquidating accounts until they are modified. When they are modified, they are \" purchased \" from the liquidating account by the financing account. The direct loan asset or loan guarantee liability will be transferred from the liquidating account to the financing account, and a one -time adjusting payment will be made between the two accounts. The adjusting payment will equal the estimated net present value of the pre-modification cash flows. At the same time, the cost (or savings) of the modification will flow to or from the financing account. When the transaction is complete, the newly modified loan or guarantee will reside in the financing account. This process is accomplished by the following steps: Step 1 . Calculate the net present value of remaining pre -modification cash flows . Calculations should be made using only the baseline estimated net cash flows in the liquidating account from the most recent President's Budget for the current and future years. Discount these cash flows using the discount rates assumed in formulating the subsidy estimates in the President 's Budget for the year in which t he modification takes place. For example, if the modification will occur in 2015, then the discount rates used to discount the cash flows will be those used to formulate the 2015 President 's Budget. Step 2 . Calculate the net present value of remaining post -modification cash flows . Use the same cash flows as in step 1 above, modified only to reflect the effect of the modification. Do not alter the cash flows to reflect any other changes that may have occurred between the SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 26 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) most recent President's Budget and the time of the modification. Use the same discount rates as in step 1 above to discount these post -modification cash flows. If a loan asset is sold, in most cases the post -modification cash flows will be the net proceeds expected from the sale (see s ection 185.8) and no discounting is necessary. Contact your OMB representative with questions on calculations for loan asset sales. Step 3. Compute the adjusting payment. If the net present value computed in step 1 above is positive (representing future collections to the Government), then the adjusting payment for the purchase of the loan or guarantee will flow from the financing account to the liquidating account to compensate the liquidating account for this loss of expected inflow. An obligation and a disbursement will be recorded in the financing account in the amount of the adjusting payment. The liquidating account will record offsetting collections equal to the adjusting payment, which it will use to repay debt owed to Treasury or to transfer t o the general fund as a capital transfer. If the net present value computed in step 1 above is negative (representing future claims on the Government), then the adjusting payment will flow from the liquidating account to the financing account to compensate the financing account for its new burden of expected outflows. Unobligated balances and permanent indefinite appropriations to the liquidating account will be used to make the payment. Outlays will be recorded in the liquidating account in the amount of the payment when it is made. The financing account will record an equal amount of offsetting collections. Step 4. Compute the cost of modification. This is equal to step 1 minus step 2. The results of this calculation will be positive, negative or zero. If the cost is positive, this amount should be outlayed from the program account to the financing account. If the cost is negative (a savings), t hen this amount should be paid from the financing account to the negative receipt account. For information on recording these transactions, see section 185.7(a) . The adjusting payment computed in step 3 and the modification cost/savings computed in step 4 are moved simultaneously on the same governing apportionment. Either an adjusting payment or a modification savings (or both) may require the financing account to borrow funds from Treasury in order to accomplish the outflowing payment. If this occurs , collections from the assets purchased by the financing account will be used to pay interest and repay debt owed to Treasury. 2) Assets retained by liquidating account. Subject to the approval of the OMB representative for the credit program, some loans or guarantees may remain in the liquidating account after modification. This method might be used if a modification affects a large number of direct loans or loan guarantees and it would be less complicated for the liquidating account to retain the assets or liabilities. In these cases, the modification process is accomplished by the following steps: Step 1. See step 1 in (c)(1) above. Step 2. See step 2 in (c)(1) above. Step 3. Compute the cost of modification. This is equal to step 1 minus step 2. The result of this calculation will be positive, negative or zero. If the cost is positive, this amount should be outlayed from the program account to the financing account. The financing account will then obligate and disburse the same amount to the liquidating account to compensate it for the reduced asset or increased liability. The liquidating account will record offsetting collections, which it will use to pay current obligations or to repay debt. If the cost is negative (a savings), the liquidating account will use permanent indefinite authority to make a payment to the SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 27 of Section 185 financing account equal to the modification savings. The financing account will consequently record offsetting collections, which it will pay to the negative subsidy receipt account for the credit program. Because both modification costs and savings result in equalizing flows among the program, financing, liquidating, and negative subsidy receipt accounts (as applicable), neither a modification cost nor savings directly causes a net change in the surplus or deficit. However, interest, repayments, default claims, and other loan cash flows may change both in that year and in future years. See section 185.31 for specific guidance on reporting these transactions for budget executi on. (d) Single cohort for modifications of pre -1992 direct loans or loan guarantees All modifications of pre -1992 direct loans and loan guarantees for a given program will be accounted for in a single direct loan cohort or a single loan guarantee cohort . 185.8 What must I know about the sale of loan assets? (a) General Under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, credit agencies with over $100 million in loan assets are expected to sell delinquent or defaulted loan assets that meet the criteri a described in (b). This applies to loan assets held by both liquidating and financing accounts. The cash flows used to calculate the baseline subsidy rates for existing cohorts should be adjusted to reflect this policy, as should the cash flows used to estimate the subsidy rates for future cohorts. Modifications of this policy that increase the cost will have to be covered by appropriations of subsidy budget authority. Differences between the estimated and actual sale proceeds due to market conditions will be treated as reestimates. Agencies are also encouraged to explore selling performing loan assets to the extent such sales would benefit the Government. In such cases, the procedures, analysis, and methods for selling performing assets are the same for selling delinquent or defaulted loan assets. (b) Loan asset sale criteria Loan assets that are more than one year delinquent should be sold, except for the following categories of loans: Loans to foreign countries or entities ; Loans in structured forbearance, when conversion to repayment status is expected within 12 months or after statutory requirements are met; Loans that are written off as unenforceable due to death, disability, or bankruptcy; Loans that have been submitted to Treasury for offset and are expected to be extinguished within three years; and Loans in adjudication or foreclosure. Performing loan assets may be sold as well, either alone or in conjunction with delinquent or defaulted loan assets, to the extent that such sales provide benefits to either the program or the Government as a whole. Agencies should consult the OMB representative with primary responsibility for the account to determine which loan assets meet these criteria. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 28 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) (c) Justification for non-compliance If an agency can demonstrate that the present value of cash flows associated with continued Government ownership of the loan assets would exceed the expected sale proceeds, the agency may not be required to sell the loan assets. Also, if there is a serious conflict between selling loan assets and Administration policy for the program, and the agency can justify to the satisfaction of their OMB representative that the sale policy cannot be reconciled with the program policy, the agency may not be required to sell the loan assets. Agencies should consult with the OMB representative with primary responsibility for the program if they believe either of these tests would be met. (d) Cost of loan asset sales If the cash flows for existing loans do not incorporate an explicit assumption about the sale of loan assets, the sale is a modification, whether the loan assets are held by financing accounts or liquidating accounts. Otherwise, the sale is part of the subsidy estimates for Presidential policy and the baseline, and differences between the estimated and actual sale proceeds are a reestimate. If the sale is a modification, the cost would equal the difference between the net sale proceeds and the estimated value to the Government, on a present value basis, of continuing to own the loan asset (the \" hold value \"). The method for calculating the hold value is the same as for calculating the net present value of cash flows before modification, as outlined in section 185.7(a) . The modification cost of multiple sales with closing dates in the same fiscal year is the sum of the cost or saving calculated for each sale of loans within the same cohort or risk category. The closing date of a sale is the date on which the seller and the buyer(s) close the transaction and title of the assets legally transfers to the buyer(s). Therefore, for loans within the same cohort or risk category, a modification cost for one sale can be offset by a modification saving for a different sale within the same fiscal year. For sales that include loans from more than one cohort or risk category, a single modification cost or savings is first calculated for all of the loans sold, and the cost or savings is subdivided among each of the cohorts or risk categories. Loan assets that are sold with recourse are treated as a combination of a sale without recourse and a new loan guarantee. The cost of the provision for recourse is estimated separately from the cost of the loan asset sale, and the subsidy for its cost, as well as the cost of the implicit loan sale without recourse, must be appropriated in advance of the sale. Sales with recourse are not permitted except where they are specifically authorized by statute. If the Government takes an equity stake (or participation) in the cash flow of the sold assets, such as a joint venture or equity -held sale, the net sale proceeds equal the actual cash proceeds plus an estimate of the present value of the proceeds from the Government 's equity position, net of any transaction costs. You may pay certain dire ct costs of loan asset sales from the gross proceeds of those sales. In general, the guidelines for whether an expense should be paid from the administrative expense appropriation or from asset sale proceeds are similar to those for determining whether an expense should be paid from the administrative expense appropriation to the program account or from the financing account (see section 185.3(a) ). Generally, costs that may be paid from proceeds include: Underwriting; Rating agency; Due diligence; Legal; and Transaction financial advisory fees. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 29 of Section 185 These costs are part of the cash flows used to calculate net sale proceeds to determine the modification cost of the sale (if the sale constitutes a modification) or to reestimate the subsidy cost on a cohort in wh ich loan assets have been sold (if the sale is not a modification). The costs of Government personnel, travel, computer systems, etc., associated with the development and execution of a loan asset sales program, as well as the cost of any contracts for asset sale program financial advisory services, should be paid from the agency 's administrative expense appropriation. Questions about whether a specific cost should be paid from the administrative expense appropriation or sale proceeds should be directed t o OMB. (e) OMB review of sales No sale may occur without the approval of the OMB representative. After identifying loans that meet the criteria described in (b), agencies must develop a plan for selling these loans in consultation with their OMB representative. In addition, at least 30 calendar days prior to the scheduled final bid day (the last date on which a buyer may submit a bid to the seller), the agency must submit for approval to the OMB representative with primary responsibility for the program the following information: The expected date of sale; A description of the loans to be sold (including balances, business program under which the loans were originated, and current payment status); The estimated hold value, with relevant supporting documents and analysis; The estimated net sale proceeds, with relevant supporting documents and analysis; The estimated modification cost, whether positive, negative, or zero; and An evaluation of relevant previous asset sales, including the hold values, n et sale proceeds, and positive/negative subsidy generated from each, if applicable. Three weeks after the sale, an agency must advise the OMB representative of the actual amount of the proceeds realized from the sale and the actual amount of the transaction costs that were paid from the proceeds. 185.9 What are the budget formulation reporting requirements for credit accounts? Each program making or having outstanding post -1991 direct loans or loan guarantees will have at least two and as many as six types of accounts, even if the Administration is proposing to terminate the program or the program has been previously terminated. The accounts are: A program account. A financing account for direct loan obligations, if any. A financing account for loan guarantee commitments, if any. A negative subsidy receipt account for negative subsidies, if any. A downward reestimate receipt account for downward reestimates, if any. A liquidating account for pre -1992 direct loans and loan guarantees, if any. Generally, the print materials and schedules required for credit program, financing, liquidating, and negative subsidy receipt accounts are listed below. References to applicable sections are also provided. SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 30 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Requirement Program Financing Liquidating Receipt Appropriations language (section 95 ) Narrative statement (section 95) Schedule P (PY- BY) (section 82 ) Schedule O (PY -BY) (section 83 ) Schedule -BY) (section 86 ) Schedule U (PY -BY) (section 185) Schedule A (PY -BY+9) (section 81) Schedule S (CY- BY+9) (section 81) Schedule C (PY- BY) (section 84 ) Schedule G (PY -BY+4) (section 185) Schedule H (PY -BY+4) (section 185) Schedule R (PY- BY+9) (section 81) Schedule K (PY -BY+9) (section 81) Schedule Y (PY -BY+9) (section 185) Schedule F (PY-1- PY) (section 86) Separate schedules are required for supplemental requests and proposed legislation items for all credit acco unts (see sections 79.2 and 82.10). These schedules show the effect of the supplemental request or proposed legislation on the information presented in the regular schedules for the program. For post -1991 credit programs, amounts reflected in related credit program accounts, financing accounts, and receipt accounts must agree. Character classification for credit program accounts and receipt accounts must also agree (see sectio n 84). Cross -account edit checks and other credit-account edit checks are included in the MAX Edit Checks report on the Budget Season Reports pa ge . A written justification is required for all new credit programs or for reauthorizing, expanding, or significantly increasing funding for existing credit programs. The justification must address the Federal credit policies and guidelines contained in OMB Circular No. A-129. For more information on required budget justification materials, see section 51. 185.10 What do I report for program accounts? Program accounts are required for post -1991 direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments and for modifications of pre -1992 direct loans and loan guarantees. They record budget authority, obligations, and outlays for subsidy costs and the admin istrative expenses of a credit program (including administrative expenses for pre-1992 direct loans and loan guarantees). In most cases, current, definite budget authority SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 31 of Section 185 is provided in appropriation acts for subsidy payments and administrative expenses. Permanent indefinite authority is available for reestimates and interest on reestimates. (a) Program and financing schedule (schedule P) Use the following line number scheme in the \" obligations by program activity \" section of the program and financing s chedule (see exhibit 185A ): SELECTED P&F ENTRIES IN PROGRAM ACCOUNTS Line number Description OBLIGATIONS BY PROGRAM ACTIVITY: 0701 Direct loan subsidy 0702 Loan guarantee subsidy 0703 Subsidy for modifications of direct loans 0704 Subsidy for modifications of loan guarantees 0705 Reestimates of direct loan subsidy 0706 Interest on reestimates of direct loan subsidy 0707 Reestimates of loan guarantee subsidy 0708 Interest on reestimates of loan guarantee subsidy 0709 Administrative expenses The data for the lines 0705, 0706, 0707, and 0708 is automatically generated from the Credit Supplement Report (CSR) exercise. (b) Object classification (schedule O) Record all direct expenses in the appropriate object class. To record subsidy obligations, use object class 41, Grants, subsidies, and contributions. For administrative expenses transferred to a salaries and expenses account, use object class 25.3, Other purchases of goods and services from Federal sources. In the salaries and expenses account receiving the transfer, record reimbursable obligations for administrative expenses using a \"2\" as the first digit of the line number. (See section 83 for more in formation about the classification of reimbursable programs in the object class schedule.) (c) Character classification (schedule C) Record positive subsidy outlays, downward reestimates receipts, and negative subsidy receipts in the appropriate character class (see section 84). For investme nt-related credit programs (i.e., physical assets or for the conduct of education and training) use the appropriate investment line number (i.e., 13XX or 1512). Otherwise, use line 2004 -xx for offsetting receipts. Note that downward reestimates and negative subsidy receipt accounts do not contain a separate Schedule C. (d) Loan levels and subsidy (schedule U) Prepare a schedule of loan levels (see exhibit 185B ), subsidy budget authority, subsidy rate, subsidy outlays, and reestimates for each program account. These data are displayed by program or by program and risk category. The titles of the stub entries should be tailored to identify the program to which each entry belongs. To add, delete, or modify a risk category, please contact your primary OMB representative. Note that in each column, some entries are reported by cohort while others (reestimates) are reported for combined cohorts. Although no outyear data are collected in schedule U, you may be required to provide outyear data by your OMB representative. Schedule U data is identified by a four -digit line number and a SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 32 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) two-digit suffix. The four -digit number identifies data by category (e.g., direct loan subsidy budget authority). The two-digit suffix differentiates between the various risk categories reported in the schedule unless the line is a total line. Subsidy rates and reestimates for direct loan and guaranteed loan programs entered into MAX A-11 DE are controlled by edit -checks based on calculations that have been reviewed and approved by OMB (see sections 185.5 and 185.6 ). If you have questions about the approved values, please contact your primary OMB representative. MAX A-11 DE will automatically generate the summary data for line entries indicated in boldface below. DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHEDULE U Entry Description Direct loan levels supportable by subsidy budget authority : 1150xx Direct loan levels Equals the amount of direct loans that can be obligated with the subsidy budget authority requested or available in that year, except in cases where loan volume limitations would prevent the full obligation of available budget authority. In those cases enter the maximum amount that can be obligated under enacted and anticipated limitations. For revolving loans, include the cumulative anticipated face value drawn under the facilities. The loan volume should match schedule G in the financing account. For PY, enter the actual level of loans obligated, which may include limitation fro m carry forward or may be less than the full limitation appropriated. For CY and BY, enter the expected level of loans to be obligated, including the unused portion of multi -year loan limitations that are carried forward. In the PY and CY, loan levels may be less than enacted loan limitations, as the Congress may enact limitations that are not achievable with the subsidy budget authority provided. However, in the BY, loan levels supportable by the subsidy requested must equal the direct loan limitation. These data are required even if the subsidy rate is zero or negative. 115999 Total direct loan levels The sum of all lines 1150. Direct loan subsidy (in percent): 1320xx Subsidy rate (+ or -) The 1320 data line series presents data in percentages on the subsidy costs inherent in making a cohort of direct loans. The data for this line is automatically generated from the Credit Supplement Report (CSR) exercise. In the PY column, the rate should be the actual execution rate. In the CY column use the budget execution rate. Note that the subsidy rate (in percent) must be rounded to the nearest hundredth of one percent and entered into MAX A-11 DE with decimal points. For example, enter 10.503 pe rcent as 10.50; 5.05 percent as 5.05; and 0.5 percent as 0.50. Amounts should be shown, even if zero or negative. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 33 of Section 185 Entry Description 132999 Weighted average subsidy rate The disbursement weighted average sum of all lines 1320 above is automatically calculated by multiplyi ng each subsidy rate detail line (lines 1320) by a weighting factor. The weighting factor is calculated by dividing the corresponding direct loan level (lines 1150) by the total direct loan level (line 1159). A weighted average subsidy rate should not be zero when a positive or negative subsidy program is included in the calculation. For non-zero transmittal codes, this is the change to the subsidy rates reported under transmittal code zero, not the new rates. Direct loan subsidy budget authority: 1330xx Subsidy budget authority (+ or -) The 1330 data line series presents data in dollars on the subsidy costs inherent in making direct loans. For positive subsidy programs, amounts reflect the budget authority obligated in the program account. For negative subsidy programs, amounts reflect financing authority obligated in the financing account \u2014amounts must be reported even if the subsidy is negative. In the PY column, the amount is equal to subsidy obligated. In the CY column, the amount will equa l the amount appropriated for subsidies plus unobligated balances eligible to be carried forward. The BY column will show the requested subsidy amount and must agree with amounts in appropriations language. Note that for programs with both positive and ne gative subsidy loans in the same risk category, the net amount of budget authority should be shown. 133999 Total subsidy budget authority The sum of all lines 1330 above. Direct loan subsidy outlays: 1340xx Net subsidy outlays The 1340 data line series presents data on the amount of subsidy outlays and negative subsidy receipts in a given year for new direct loans. An outlay or negative subsidy receipt is recorded at the time of disbursement of the loan to the borrower. This l ine shows the sum of lines 1341xx and 1342xx. 1341xx Negative subsidy outlays Report negative subsidy receipts from both new budget authority and from balances on this line. Also, report modification savings on this line. Data on this line are used t o calculate net subsidy outlays in line 1340. 1342xx Positive subsidy outlays Report positive subsidy outlays from both new budget authority and from balances on this line. Also, report modification costs on this line. Data on this line are used to calculate net subsidy outlays in line 1340. 134999 Total subsidy outlays The sum of all lines 1340 above. Direct loan reestimate: 1350xx Net reestimate (+ or -) The 1350 data line series presents data on the net amount of reestimate executed by the program and financing accounts in a given year, including interest on reestimate. Report amounts in PY and CY only. 1351xx Upward reestimate The 1351 data line series presents data on the amount of upward reestimate paid to the financing account in any g iven year, including upward interest on reestimate.

Report downward reestimates for all outstanding fiscal year cohorts for which downward r eestimates will be paid out of the financing account. Report amounts in PY and CY only. 135999 Total direct loan reestimates The sum of all lines 1350 above. Guaranteed loan levels supportable by subsidy budget authority: 2150xx Loan guarantee levels Equals the full principal amount, not just the portion guaranteed by the Government, of guaranteed loans that can be supported by the amount of subsidy budget authority requested or available in that year, except in cases wher e loan volume limitations would prevent the full obligation of available budget authority. In those cases enter the maximum amount that can be obligated under enacted and anticipated limitations. Include loan volume reestimates, if any, in PY. The loan volume should match schedule H in the financing account. For PY and CY, the level of guaranteed loan commitments may include limitation from carryforward or may be less than the full limitation appropriated. In the PY and CY, loan levels may be less than enacted loan guarantee limitations, as the Congress may enact limitations that are not achievable with the subsidy budget authority provided. However, in the BY, loan levels supportable by the subsidy must equal the guaranteed loan limitation. These dat a are required even if the subsidy rate is zero or negative. 215999 Total loan guarantee levels The sum of all lines 2150. Guaranteed loan subsidy (in percent): 2320xx Subsidy rate (+ or -) The 2320 data line series presents data on the subsidy costs inherent in making a cohort of loan guarantees. The data for this line is automatically generated from the Credit Supplement Report (CSR) exercise. In the PY, the rate should be the actual execution rate. In the CY column use the budget execution rate. Note that the subsidy rate (in percent) must be rounded to the nearest hundredth of one percent and entered into MAX A-11 DE with decimal points. For example, 50.503 percent will be entered as 10.50; 1.05 percent as 5.05; and 0.5 percent as 0.50. Amounts should be shown, even if zero or negative. 232999 Weighted average subsidy rate The disbursement weighted average of all lines 2320 above is automatically calculated by multiplying each subsidy rate detail line (lines 2320) by a weighting factor. The weighting factor is calculated by dividing the corresponding guaranteed loan level (lines 2150) by the total guaranteed loan level (line 2159). For non-zero transmittal codes, enter the change to the subsidy rates reported under transmittal code zero due to legislation in schedule U, not the new subsidy rates.

For positive subsidy programs, amounts reflect the budget author ity obligated in the program account. For negative subsidy programs, amounts reflect financing authority obligated in the financing account \u2014 amounts must be reported even if the subsidy is negative. For PY only, budget authority should reflect both new and carry forward used. In the CY column, the amount will equal the amount appropriated for subsidies plus unobligated balances eligible to be carried forward.

Financing accounts record the cash flows associated with post -1991 direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments and for modifications of all direct loans and loan guarantees. These cash flows include loan disbursements, payments for guarantee claims, principal repayments, interest received from borrowers, interest paid on borrowing, interest earned on uninvested funds, interest supplements, fees and premiums received, and recoveries on defaults. Separate financing accounts are used for direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments. As for all other accounts, changes due to legislative proposals should be reflected in the appropriate transmittal code (see sections 79.2 and 82). (a) Program and financing schedules (schedule P) Use the fo llowing line number scheme in the \" obligations by program activity \" section of the program and financing schedule for financing accounts (see exhibits 185C and 185F ).

Note: MAX A-11 DE automatically modifies financing account line stubs from budget authority and outlays to financing authority and financing disbursements, respectively. Financing accounts do not have discretionary amounts, and therefore do not use lines 4010 through 4101. Further, schedule P line 4142, Offsetting collections credited to expired accounts, is not valid in financing accounts. All cash collections are used to repay Treasury debt, pay obligations of the financing account, or execute downward reestimates. Do not use lines 1700 through 1742. Financing authority from offsetting collections in financing accounts must be recorded as mandatory, regardless of whether the authority for subsidy in the program account is mandat ory or discretionary.

(d) Agency debt held by the FFB and net financing disbursements (schedules Y, G, and H) Baseline data on deb t owed to the FFB must be reported by all financing and liquidating accounts and by programs that are not covered by the FCRA , such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (which assumed the responsibilities of the Resolution Trust Corporation). All FFB transactions are treated as means of financing to the agencies. In order to track old and new transactions, the lines should be coded with a two-digit suffix as follows, to identify the transactions: .0 1 FFB loan originations. .02 Sale of loan assets to the FFB. .03 Sale of debt securities to the FFB. Report this data on the 3300 data line series in schedule Y (PY through BY+9). No policy estimates ar e required. Baseline and policy data on net financing disbursements must be reported for all financing accounts. \" Net financing disbursements \" are analogous to net outlays reported on line 4170 in schedule P of the program SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 43 of Section 185 account and consist of total fi nancing disbursements (gross) less total offsetting collections in the financing account. Net financing disbursements are calculated by subtracting total cash inflows to the financing account from total cash outflows from the financing account. Cash infl ows include subsidy and reestimate collections from the program account, borrower principal and interest payments, recoveries, fees, interest received from Treasury, and other inflows. Cash outflows include loan disbursements, default claim payments, negative subsidy and downward reestimate payments to the receipt account, interest paid to Treasury, and other outflows. In PY through BY, these amounts should equal the amount reported on line 4170 in schedule P of the financing account. These data are needed to estimate Federal borrowing and interest on the public debt. Report this data in schedule Y for both baseline and policy estimates. DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHEDULE Y Entry Description Agency debt held by the FFB Provide lines 3310 -3390 for liquidating and direct and guaranteed loan financing accounts.

Should equal line 6200 above unless there is a policy proposal that would affect the numbers in Y. Note: Lines 3310- 3390 do not print in the Budget Appendix . These da ta are used by OMB for reporting and analysis. 185.12 What do I report for liquidating accounts? Reporting requirements for liquidating accounts are discussed in sections 185.9, 185.11(b) , 185.11(c) , and 185.11(d) . An illustration of a typical liquidating account program and financing schedule can be found at exhibit 185I. Illustrations of typical liquidating account status of direct and guaranteed loans schedules can be found at exhibits 185J and 185K . 185.13 What do I report for receipt accounts? Negative subsidy and downward reestimate receipt accounts record receipts of amounts paid from the financing account when there is a negative subsidy or downward reestimate. Usually, they are general fund receipt ac counts, but with the permission of the OMB representative for the account, they can be special fund receipt accounts. If the program is discretionary, report negative subsidies as \" discretionary. \" If the program is mandatory, report negative subsidies as \" mandatory. \" Report downward reestimates for all credit programs as \" mandatory, authorizing committee \" in schedules R and K (see section 81). For SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 44 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) investment -related credit programs, use the appropriate character classification line (i.e., 13XX or 1512). Otherwise use line 2004 (see s ection 84). 185.14 Must credit accounts be apportioned? Yes. The Antideficiency Act requires that all appropriation and fund accounts, including credit program accounts, financing accounts, and liquidating accounts, be apportioned unless exempted by OMB or a specific statute. OMB may grant exemptions from apportionment in the form of a letter to the head of the department or establishment. 185.15 When do I submit an apportionment request (SF 132)? If budgetary resources... For example ... Then ... Result from current action by Congress The annual appropriation in the program account for the: direct loan subsidy cost, loan guarantee subsidy cost, administrative expenses, or modifications. Submit the initial apportionment requests by August 21 or within 10 calendar days after the approval of the act providing the new budgetary resource, whichever is later. Apportionments for both the program and financing account must be submitted and approved prior t o incurring direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments. Submit reapportionment requests whenever circumstances change. For example, if the subsidy cost appropriation was apportioned solely to make new loans, then you must submit a reapportionm ent request for both the program and financing accounts before you make a modification that will increase the cost. Do not result from current action by the Congress The unobligated balances in the financing accounts. Permanent indefinite appropriation in the program account to cover an upward reestimate. Submit the initial apportionment request by August 21 before the beginning of the fiscal year. Submit the request for anticipated reestimates with the initial apportionment. When the exact amount is calc ulated, submit a reapportionment to cover any increase over your initial approved amount. Permanent indefinite appropriation in the liquidating account. Submit the initial apportionment request by August 21 before the beginning of the fiscal year. Submit reapportionments as needed. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 45 of Section 185 185.16 How do I fill out the apportionment request (SF 132)? Section 1 20 of this Circular provide general apportionment guidance, including terminology, line descriptions, timing, and apportionment categories. As with other programs, you will need to locate and review the enacted appropriations language for your credit program. In som e cases, you may also need to locate and review other authority in authorizing or substantive acts. An example of standard appropriations language for credit programs is provided in section 95.7, and illustrated in exhibit 185M . Standard appropriations language for credit programs consists of the following parts: A ppropriation for the subsidy cost of the direct loan or guarantee program; Limitation on the loan program; and Appropriation for administrative expenses. You need the appropriations language to verify that: For discretionary and mandatory programs: o S ubsidy cost amounts and administrative expenses are shown correctly on your program account apportionment request (see exhibit 185N ); o Amounts apportioned to reimburse your salaries and expenses account, if any, are correct; and o P rogram level portion for the guaranteed loan financing account apportionment request (see exhibit 185P ) agrees with the limitation set in the appropriations language. For programs with subsidy budget authority but without an enacted loan limitation, reflect the program volume as the apportioned budget authority divided by the OMB -approved subsidy rate. F or mandatory programs with indefinite subsidy budget authority, the program level will equal the amount of loan guarantees anticipated to be committed. Instructions for filling out the apportionment request for liquidating accounts can be found in section 120 . Exhibits 185N through 185Z are a simplified presentation highlighting the budget execution dynamics for interrelated credit accounts. The scenario begins with the program account receiving an appropriation for both direct loans and loan guarantees and concludes with preparing the last quarterly budget execution report for each account. Exhibits for modifications and reestimates are also provided. For this example, assume that this is a new credit program; 25 percent of the amounts appropriated for subsidy cost are obligated each quarter but only 80 percent is disbursed each quarter (with the remainder in the ne xt quarter); 25 percent of the amount appropriated for administrative expenses is obligated and outlayed each quarter; no borrower fees are charged; and simplified interest and repayments calculations are used. 185.17 Do amounts for an upward reestimate (and interest on reestimate) need to be apportioned? Yes. An upward reestimate indicates that insufficient funds were paid to the financing account. The reestimate amount (plus interest on reestimate) must be obligated and outlayed from the program account to the financing account to make sure it has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities. Before recording this obligation, ensure you have adequate resources apportioned. Section 504(f) of the FCRA pr ovides permanent indefinite budget authority for this purpose. If you were unable to include the reestimate in your program account 's initial apportionment or you requested too little, submit a reapportionment request for the additional p ermanent indefinite appropriation the program account needs to pay to the financing account. See exhibit 185R for a sample reapportionment for an upward reestimate of a program account. You must make a reestimate immediately after the end of each fiscal year as long as any loans are outstanding and submit a corresponding apportionment at the beginning of the following fiscal year, unless SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 46 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) a different plan is approved by OMB. Note that reestimates should only be executed once they are approved by OMB, and that reapportionments should be submitted in the event there is a change in the originally calculated reestimate and the OMB -approved reestimate. Once approved, execute the reestimates by May 15 th. 185.18 Do amounts for a downward reestimate (and the interest on reestimate) need to be apportioned? Yes. A downward reestimate indicates that the subsidy cost payment to the financing account by the program account was too large so that its assets exceed its liabilities. The reestimate amount (plus interest on reestimate) must be obligated and disbursed from the financing account. Before recording the obligation, ensure you have adequate resources apportioned. Once approved, execute the reestimates by May 15 th. For direct loans only, if the downward reestimate is due to increased actual collections, use these amounts to cover the obligation. To the extent the reestimate is due to projected increased collections, request borrowing authority to cover the obligation. For loan guarantees only, to the extent the reestimate is due to lower default payments than initially estimated, either actual or projected, use your uninvested balance with Treasury to cover the obligation. In cases where amounts less than $1 need to be returned, do not include the amount on the face of the apportionment (Category B lines 6011-6111). Instead, place a footnote on Line 6190 that discusses the return of the amount. For both discretionary and mandatory programs, disburse the excess (plus interest on reestimate) to a downward reestimate receipt account (see exhibit 185S ). 185.19 Do amounts for interest payments to Treasury need to be apportioned? Yes. For financing and liquidating accounts, FCRA provides permanent and indefinite authority to increase the total amount of budgetar y resources to make interest payments; those additional amounts of budgetary resources are automatically apportioned , without further action by OMB, so long as interest was included on the ini tial apportionment or most recent approved apportionment. Similarly, if the account has sufficient amounts on the Budgetary Resources section of the apportionment, but the amount shown on the Category B line of the Application for Budgetary Resources section of the apportionment for interest payments is too low, you can reallocate amounts apportioned amongst the Category B lines without further action by OMB. Please contact your OMB representative if you have questions regarding what interest payments are automatically apportioned. 185.20 Do amounts for transfers of unobligated balances to the general fund or debt repayments to Treasury need to be apportioned? No. Capital transfers, including transfers of unobligated balances in liquidating accounts to the general fund (i.e., liquidating account sweeps), and red emption of debt are not obligations and therefore do not need to be apportioned on lines 6001-6173. However, you do need to plan for such transfers or repayments and show your estimated debt repayments as a negative amount on line 1236 or 1252 (if anticipated) when you submit your apportionment request. 185.21 How do I handle modifications? Before you modify a direct loan or loan guarantee, you should take the following steps: Step 1. Estimate the cost of the modification (see section 185.7); Step 2. Request an apportionment, if necessary; Step 3. Receive an approved apportionment from OMB, if necessary; Step 4. Modify the direct loan or loan guarantee; and SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 47 of Section 185 Step 5. Record the obligation (see sections 185.30 and 185.31 ). To determine whether you need a reapportionment: If ... Then ... The current apportionment allows the apportioned resources to be used for modifications and the cost of the modification is equal to or lower than the amount apportioned less any amounts already obligated. No reapportionment is required. The current apportionment does not allow the apportioned resources to be used for modifications. Yes. See exhibit 185Q for a sample reapportionment for a modification. If the cost of the modification is higher than the amount apportioned less amounts already obligated. Yes. See exhibit 185Q for a sample reapportionment for a modification. 185.22 Am I required to submit budget execution reports (SF 133)? Yes. Submit SF 133s on a quarterly basis for all accounts, including those that OMB has exempted from apportionment. The OMB representative with primary budget responsibility for the credit account may require budget execution reports more frequently, such as monthly. For credit financing accounts, submit the final SF 133 on a cohort basis unless OMB has approved reporting on a combined basis. 185.23 How do I fill out the SF 133? Section 1 30 and Appendix F of this Circular provide general budget execution reporting guidance, including terminology, line descriptions, and timing. You prepare the SF 133 to show the extent that resources controlled by the apportionment request and other resources have been consumed. The relationship between program and financing accounts is dynamic, affecting different en tries of the apportionment request and SF 133 at different stages of the process as transactions occur throughout the year. Exhibits 185U through 185W illustrate the individual SF 133s for the program, direct loan financing, and guaranteed loan financing accounts, respectively, for the first quarter. Exhibits 185X through 185Z illustrate the individual SF 133s for the program, direct loan financing, and guaranteed loan financing accounts, respectively, for the fourth quarter. Because program accounts typically receive one- y ear budget authority, the SF 133 will have an unexpired account column as well as five expired account columns. Financing and liquidating accounts, however, have no- year authority so their SF 133s will have only an unexpired column (se e section 20.4(c) for a discussion of period of availability). 185.24 H ow do I calculate the initial subsidy cost estimate for execution? You are required to use the online Credit Subsidy Calculator t o calculate subsidy cost estimates. The Calculator and accompanying documentation are available from the OMB representative with primary responsibility for the credit account. I n most cases, you will use the same subsidy rate for execution as you calculated earlier for th e Budget policy subsidy rate. However, if the loan contract terms have changed for any reason, then you must update the subsidy rate to reflect the actual terms at the time the loan contract is signed. For programs that calculate separate subsidy rates f or each loan or loan guarantee, if the borrower 's interest rate is benchmarked to a Treasury interest rate, then the borrower interest rate assumption should be consistent with the economic assumptions for that cohort. The default expectation associated with the risk rating is a forecast assumption SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 48 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) and should match the President 's Budget for the year of obligation. Please see your OMB contact for more information. Do not change the forecast technical assumptions or the methodological assumptions. For ma ndatory programs in the Mid-Session Review (MSR), consistent with MSR guidance you should update estimates of subsidy budget authority, outlays, receipts, and net financing disbursements for volume updates reflecting MSR economic assumptions. Do not updat e the execution subsidy rate for MSR economic assumptions. 185.25 What transactions do I report when the Government incurs direct loan obligations or makes loan guarantee commitments? For the program account (see exhibit 185U ): Include the estimated subsidy cost obligations on lines 2001-2102, Obligations incurred. If resources for the subsidy cost were apportioned in Category A, include the amount on line 2001. If the resources were apportioned in Category B, include the amount on lines 2002 in the appropriate category; and Include the amount on lines 3010, Obligations incurred: unexpired accounts and 3050, Unpaid obligations, end of year, since the amount is not yet outlayed to the financing account. For the direct loan financing account (see exhibit 185V ): Include the subsidy cost payment obligated in the program account but not yet paid on line 1801, Change in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources (mand.) (+ or - ); and Include the amount on lines 3070, Change in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources: Unexpired accounts (+ or -) (with the opposite sign as line 1801) and 3090, Uncollected customer payments from Federal sources, end of year ( -), since the amounts have not been received from the program account. To show the borrowing component: Before signing the contract, verify that OMB has apportioned enough borrowing authority on line 1400 to cover the part of the direct loan obligation not covered by the subsidy cost paym ent and upfront fees; After you sign the contract, include the obligation on line 2101- 2102, Obligations incurred. If the direct loan was apportioned in Category A, include the amount on line 2101. If the direct loan was apportioned in Category B, include it on line 2102 in the appropriate category; and Include the amount on lines 3010 Obligations incurred: unexpired accounts and 3050, Unpaid obligations, end of year. Record the face value of the direct loan obligation on line 1200 of schedule G, Total outstanding direct loan obligations EOY. For the loan guarantee financing account (see exhibit 185W ): Include the subsidy payment obligated in the program account but not yet paid on line 1801, Change in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources (mand.) (+ or - ); and SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 49 of Section 185 Include the amount on lines 3070, Change in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources: Unexpired accounts (+ or -) (with the opposite sign as line 1801) and 3090, Uncollected customer payments from Federal sources, end of year ( -), since the amounts have not been received from the program account. Include the uncollected subsidy amount (as a negative amount) on line 3200, Obligated balance EOY until the amount is transferred from the program account via an expenditure t ransfer. Record the face value of the loan guarantee commitment on line 2200 of schedule H, Total outstanding loan guarantee commitments EOY. It is conceptually possible that the line 1801 entries may result in a negative end of year obligated balance (line 3200), particularly for programs that disburse slowly. The transactions are similar for a negative subsidy program except that the financing account will make a transaction with the negative subsidy receipt account rather than the program account (see section 185.3(v) ). 185.26 What transactions do I report when the Government disburses a direct loan or a private lender disburses a guaranteed loan? For the program account (see exhibit 185U ), just before a loan is disbursed from the financing account: Pay the financing account and include the subsidy cost payment on lines 3020, Outlays (gross) (-) and 4010, Outlays from new discretionary autho rity. If the loan will be disbursed in multiple payments, transfer only the subsidy amount proportional to the amount of the disbursement; and Reduce line 3050, Unpaid obligations, end of year by the same amount. For direct loan financing accounts: Whe n the subsidy cost payment is received from the program account, reduce lines 1801, Change in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources (mand.) (+ or - ), and 3070, Change in uncollected customer payments from Fed sources: Unexpired accounts (+ or -). Also, increase line 1800, Spending authority from offsetting collections (mand.): Collected, and line 4120, Offsetting collections from: Federal sources (mand.); and Once the loan is actually disbursed (see exhibit 185V ), include the loan disbursement on lines 3020, Financing disbursements (gross) ( -) and 4110 Total financing disbursements, gross (mand.), and reduce the amount of loans payable from line 3050, Unpaid obligations, end of year. For loan guarantee financing accounts: When the subsidy cost payment is received from the program account, reduce lines 1801, Change in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources (mand.) (+ or - ), and 3070, Change in uncollected customer payments from Federal sources: unexpired accounts (+ or - ). Also, increase line 1800, Spending authority from offsetting collections (mand.): collected, and line 4120, Offsetting collections from Federal sources (mand.); Do not report any loan disbursement because the private lender disbursed the loan, not the Federal Government (see exhibit 185V ). Include the budget authority on line 4000 or 4090, SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 50 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Budget authority (gross). The subsidy cost payment collected by the financing account is held as an uninvested balance that earns interest from Treasury until it is used, for example, to pay default claims; interest supplements; the capitalized costs of foreclosing, managing, and selling collateral assets acquired as a result o f defaults; and the costs routinely deducted from the proceeds of sales. Until these resources are needed for such obligations and they are apportioned, include them on line 6182, Unapportioned\u2014other. 185.27 How do I handle non-subsidy cost collections? Report all collections of direct loan principal, interest on direct loans, fees, proceeds from the liquidation of collateral assets, as well as any other collections, to the appropriate cohort and risk category in the financing or liquidating account, as appropriate. Place the amount you anticipate collecting on line 1840, Anticipated collections, reimbursements, and other income (mand.). As collections are actually received throughout the year, report them on line 1800, Spending authority from offsetting collections (mand.): Collected with a corresponding reduction on line 1840, Anticipated offsetting collections and a negative amount on line 4120, Offsetting collections from Federal sources (mand.). Because these amounts in financing accounts earn interest, include them in the interest income calculations (see section 185.34). In financing accounts, non-subsidy cost collections may be used only for the cohort that generated the collection. Except for fees collected, these amounts are not available to make new loans. These amounts are available to: Fund a portion of the direct loan, if the collection is a fee paid by the borrower; Pay the capitalized costs of foreclosing, managing, and selling collateral assets acquired as the result of defaults on direct or guaranteed loans and costs that are routinely deducted from the proceeds of sales (see section 185.8 for items that qualify); Make annual payments of interest to Treasury; and Make repayments of principal on amounts borrowed from Treasury using any remaining amounts. Non-subsidy cost collections in guaranteed loan financing accounts are available to: Pay the capitalized costs of foreclosing, managing, and selling collateral assets acquired as the result of defaults on direct or guaranteed loans and costs that are routinely deducted from the proceeds of sales; Maintain an unobligated balance to pay such capitalized costs or routinely deducted costs, if any; Pay default claims and interest supplements on guaranteed loans; Make annual payments of interest to Treasury; Make repayments of principal on amounts borrowed from Treasury; and Add to the unobligated balance. To the extent that there are insufficient collections to make timely payment of interest or principal on Treasury borrowings, the financing account must borrow to make such payments. If the cohort 's expected future cash flows will not be sufficient to fully repay this additional borrowing plus the cohort 's other expected obligations, you must calculate a reestimate and use the subsidy cost collections from this reestimate to repay the additional borrowing, with interest. In liquidating accounts, these amounts may be used for similar expenses (see section 185.3(l) ) without regard to cohort. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 51 of Section 185 185.28 What transactions do I report when a guaran teed loan defaults? Loan guarantee default claims are recorded in financing and liquidating accounts. When you receive a loan guarantee default claim: Verify that the amount of the default claim is apportioned; Include the obligation to pay the claim on line 2101- 2102, Obligations incurred (reimbursable) for the financing accounts and lines 2001-2002 for liquidating accounts (direct obligations). If defaults were apportioned in Category A, place the amount on line 2101 for financing accounts and 2001 for liquidating accounts. If defaults were apportioned in Category B, place it on lines 2102 for financing accounts and 2002 for liquidating accounts in the appropriate category; and Include the amount as payable to the private lender on lines 3010, Obligat ions incurred: unexpired accounts and 3050, Unpaid obligations, EOY. When you disburse a payment for a loan guarantee default claim: Include the payment on lines 3020, Financing disbursements (gross) ( -), and 4110, Total financing disbursements, gross (m and.); and Reduce the amounts payable on line 3050 by the amount reported on lines 3020 and 4110. 185.29 What should I do with unobligated balances in the liquidating account? You must transfer any unobligated balance remaining at the end of the fiscal year to the general fund unless OMB has approved an extension. Include this transfer on line 1022, Capital transfer of unobligated balances to general fund ( -) and line 1820, Capital transfer of spending authority from offsetting collections to general fu nd (mand.) ( -). Additionally, unobligated balances may be applied to repay debt using line 1023, Unobligated balances applied to repay debt ( -) and line 1825, Spending authority from offsetting collections applied to repay debt (mand.) ( -). Amounts credi ted to liquidating accounts in any year are available only for obligations that are incurred in that year and repaying debt owed to the Treasury (including the FFB ). 185.30 How do I report modifications of post -1991 direct loans and loan guarantees? A mod ification results in a subsidy cost increase or decrease which must be recorded on the SF 133 as follows: If Modification... Then... Increases cost In the program account, include: The increase on lines 2001 -2002 and 3010, Obligations incurred; Unexpired accounts. If the resources for subsidy cost were apportioned in Category A, include the amount on line 2001. If the resources were apportioned in Category B, include the amount on lines 2002 in the appropriate category; and The payment to the financing account on lines 3020, Outlays (gross) ( -) and 4020, Total outlays, gross (disc.). Note: You cannot incur subsidy cost obligations for modifications unless budgetary resources are available in the program account and have been apportioned for modifications. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 52 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) If Modification... Then... In the financing account, include: The collection from the program account on lines 1800, Spending authority from offsetting collections (mand.): Collected and 4120, Offsetting collections from Federal sources (mand.). Credit this amount to the cohort and risk category of the modified loan. Decrease the estimated collection on line 1840, Anticipated collections, if appropriate; For a direct loan modification, use these amounts to pay interest and other expenses and to repay debt owed to Treasury; and For a loan guarantee modification, use these amounts as needed to pay default claims and other expenses. Remaining balances will be held as uninvested balances with Treasury and will earn interest at the same rate as is paid on other funds held by the financing account for the same cohort. Decreases cost In the financing account include: The estimated decrease on lines 2001 -2002, Obligations incurred and 3010, Obligations incurred: unexpired accounts. If the resources for the subsidy cos t were apportioned in Category A, include the amount on line 2001. If the resources were apportioned in Category B, include the amount on line 2002 in the appropriate category); and The payment of the amount transferred to the appropriate account on line s 3020, Financing disbursements (gross) ( -) and 4110, Total financing disbursements, gross (mand.). Include the collection in a negative subsidy receipt account. For additional transactions, see section 185.7(b) . 185.31 How do I report modifications of pre- 1992 direct loans and loan guarantees? You estimate and account for the increase or decrease in cost in the same way as modifications of post - 1991 loans. In addition to the steps enumerated in section 185.30, normally you must transfer the direct loan assets or loan guarantee liabilities to be modified from the liquidating account to the financing account. As part of the transfer, you must make a payment from the financing account to the liquidating account, in the case of direct loans, or from th e liquidating account to the financing account, in the case of loan guarantees. In exceptional cases, subject to the approval of the OMB representative with responsibility for the credit program, the modified loans may be retained in the liquidating account. In each case, fill out the budget execution report as follows: If Asset or Liability will be... Then... Transferred to the financing account For direct loans, report an obligation in the financing account that is equal to the payment amount on lines 3010, Obligations incurred: Unexpired accounts and 2102, Reimbursable obligations, Category B , and a disbursement in the same amount on line 3020, Financing disbursements (gross) ( -) and 4010/4011, Financing disbursements from new discretionary autho rity / Financing disbursements from discretionary balances . Include the receipt of the payment in the liquidating account on line 1800, Spending authority from offsetting collections, collected (mand) and 4033, Offsetting collections from non -Federal sour ces. For loan guarantees, include the obligation and outlay in the liquidating account and the offsetting collection in the financing account. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 53 of Section 185 If Asset or Liability will be... Then... Retained by the liquidating account Where the modification increases the cost: For the program account, report an obligation for the appropriate subsidy cost amount on lines 3010, Obligations incurred: unexpired accounts and 2102, Obligations incurred, Category B, Modifications and an outlay in the same amount on lines 3020, Outlays (gross) (- ) and 4010/4011, Outlays from new discretionary authority / Outlays from discretionary balances. For the financing account, include the corresponding transaction on lines 1800, Spending authority from offsetting collections (mand.): Collected, 4 120, Offsetting collections from: Federal sources (mand.) and obligation on lines 2000 and 3010, and a disbursement on lines 3020 and 4110. For the liquidating account, include the payment on lines 1800, Spending authority from offsetting collections (man d.): collected and 4120, Offsetting collections from Federal sources (mand.). This payment compensates this account for the reduction in its assets (direct loan) or its increased liability (loan guarantee). Where the modification decreases the cost: For the liquidating account, include permanent indefinite authority to make the payment to the financing account on line 1200, Appropriation (mand.). For the financing account, include this receipt on lines 1800, Collected (mand.) and 4120, Offsetting collecti ons from: Federal sources (mand.) and include the subsequent payment to the negative subsidy receipt account on lines 3020, Financing disbursements (gross) ( -) and 4110, Total financing disbursements, gross (mand.). See section 185.7 for additional discussion about modification transactions. 185.32 Why do financing accounts borrow from Treasury? The FCRA pr ovides indefinite borrowing authority to financing accounts to fund the unsubsidized portion of direct loans and to satisfy obligations in the event the financing account 's resources are insufficient. For direct loan financing accounts, each loan disbursement is financed by the subsidy cost payment from t he program account, fees where applicable, and borrowing from Treasury. The financing account makes a single borrowing from Treasury at the beginning of each fiscal year for each cohort based on the estimated net loan disbursements for the cohort in that fiscal year. For loans financed through the FFB (FFB -financed loans), the financing account effectively borrows the full face value of the loans made to the public. For loan guarantees, the financing account may borrow from Treasury when balances in the financing account are insufficient to pay claims. These borrowings generally occur on an as-needed basis. If a direct loan or loan guarantee program or risk category generates negative subsidy cost, the financing account must borrow from Treasury to cover the paym ent to the negative subsidy receipt account. For FFB-financed loans with negative subsidy costs, borrowing for negative subsidy or other obligations in excess of financing account resources is through the Fiscal Service, as with any other direct loans or loan guarantees. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT Page 54 of Section 185 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) For intragovernmental transactions, all borrowing, including amounts treated as financing account lending by the FFB, but excluding amounts borrowed for financing account interest, is dated October 1 regardless of whether it is the origin al amount borrowed at the beginning of the year or a supplementary amount borrowed later in the year. As a result of treating the entire amount as a single borrowing, net interest expense is not affected by whether all borrowed funds were disbursed or whether the original borrowing had to be supplemented later in the year (see 185.33). You may only carry forward obligated indefinite borrowing authority into the next fiscal year. At the end of each fiscal year, you must return unobligated indefinite borrowing authority or make an adjustment during the GTAS year -end preliminary or revision windows. Specifically, if the indefinite borrowing authority is apportioned and exercised in a given fiscal year, the indefinite borrowing authority must be recorded as borrowing authority applied to repay debt if cash resulting from exercise of the borrowing authority is unobligated as of September 30 th in the same fiscal year. If the exercised but unobligated indefinite borrowing authority is not recorded as borrowing authority applied to repay debt as of September 30 th in the same fiscal year, then show the amount as a negative amount on line 1020, Adjustment to unobligated balance brought forward, October 1 (+ or -) in the subsequent fiscal year. If the indefinite borrowing authority is apportioned and is not exercised in a given fiscal year, the indefinite borrowing authority must be recorded as decrease to the borrowing authority if it is unobligated as of September 30 th in the same fiscal year. If the indefinite b orrowing authority is not recorded as an adjustment to borrowing authority as of September 30th in the same fiscal year, then show the amount as a negative amount on line 1020, Adjustment to unobligated balance brought forward, October 1 (+ or -) in the subsequent fiscal year. 185.33 Why do financing accounts earn interest? The basic purpose of a guaranteed loan financing account is to accumulate funds to finance future default costs. Subsidy cost payments to the account, fees collected, and other collections are retained in the financing account as an uninvested balance and earn interest at the same rate as the discount rate used to calculate the subsidy cost. The subsidy cost payments, fees, other collections, and interest earnings will be sufficient to finance the net default costs if the initial estimate of subsidy cost is correct. In direct loan financing accounts, undisbursed Treasury borrowings, including amounts treated as financing account lending by the FFB, earn interest at the same rate as the financing account pays on its debt owed to Treasury so that borrowing from Treasury for subsequent disbursements during the year does not have any effect on the results of operations or net financial position of the financing account. 185.34 Who calculate s interest expense and income? You do, using the guidance and the online Credit Subsidy Calculator p rovided by OMB. Staff at the Fiscal Service may also perform the calculations to ensure agreement between Treasury and your agency. For amounts treated as financing account lending by the FFB, please contact the OMB representative with primary responsibility for the program to ensure correct treatment of interest expense and income. 185.35 W hen do I calculate interest expense and income? You must make the calculations to provide an estimate for the initial apportionment request. You also will make these calculations again at the end of the year based on actual data to determine the payment amounts. Financing account interest adjustments are calculated by the online Credit Subsidy Calculator w ith the reestimate and interest on reestimate. SECTION 185 \u2014FEDERAL CREDIT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 55 of Section 185 185.36 What interest rate do I use to calculate interest expense and income? The FCRA r equires that the rates for discounting cash flows, financing account borro wing (including amounts treated as financing account lending by the FFB), and financing account interest earnings be identical and based on the Treasury rates in effect during the period of loan disbursement. The correct discount rates for generating the cohort interest rate are provided for you in the online Credit Subsidy Calculator (the Calculator), available from the OMB representative with the primary responsibility for the account. For cohorts before 2001, the Ca lculator will generate a disbursement -weighted average discount rate (DWADR). For cohorts 2001 and after, the Calculator will generate a single effective rate (SER). The cohort interest rate (whether DWADR or SER) is used for both technical reestimates and calculating financing account interest expense and income. Cohort interest rates reflect budget estimate discount rates, until the final cohort rate is established from the first technical reestimate following the interest rate reestimate. 185.37 What are the interest expense requirements for amounts treated as lending to financing accounts by the Federal Financing Bank? The requirements are the same as any other financing account borrowing, and have no impacts on the terms and conditions of the loan with the public, including the borrower 's interest rate. Regardless of whether the FFB collects borrower payments, or the credit agency processes payments and separately repays principal and interest owed on financing account borrowing to the FFB, the FF B can only be credited with interest on amounts treated as financing account lending at the appropriate cohort discount rate and under the same terms as any other financing account borrowing. Likewise, to finance amounts treated as lending to financing accounts, the FFB must keep a matched book, borrowing the full principal amount from Fiscal Service on the same terms and conditions as the financing account borrowing from the FFB, including the cohort interest rate. This makes sure that all amounts collected from the public are appropriately credited to the financing account and reflected in the credit subsidy cost as required under the FCRA , and that the FFB bears no risk on the amounts treated as lending to financing accounts.

L ike all h igh- performing private and public sector organizations , the Federal Government has developed a set of management routines to drive a results-oriented culture to help organizations deliver prioritized, transparent outcomes while ensur ing every dollar spent delivers results for the American people. Since 2010, the Executive Branch of the Federal Government has worked to apply effective routines for organizational performance management within and across agencies. Leaders have established clear roles and responsibilities, set ambitious goals that define success through strategic planning and priority goal - setting , personally conduct regular reviews of progress, and take action based on evidence and on opportunities to coordinate across silos while reporting results transparently . To further advance these efforts and deliver results for the American people, OMB has worked closely with agency Performance Improvement Officers and other senior agency management officials to develop this guidance for implementing the Federal Performance Framework . Originally authorized by Congress in 1993 with the Government Performance and Results (GPRA) Act and updated in 2010 with the GPRA Modernization Act, th e Federal Performance F ramework provides the foundation of routines and processes by which a multi-disciplinary array of management functions and skillsets supporting decision-making capabilities can be coordinated - and work in concert together - as part of an integrated, synchronized management system at the enterprise level for improving the organizational health and organizational performance and program service delivery of Federal agencies. Federal agencies will use the Framework and its practices and routines to shift the Government 's focus from programs to people; from the means of Government to its ends; and from rules to values. Importantly , this systems-focused approach allows the Federal Government to align its budget and resources to its performance frameworks , operat ing concurrently and helping to ensure that agencies ' organizational goals and objectives are resourced efficiently, effectively, and with accountability. Importantly, a s new policies and management initiatives have been introduced, the Federal Performance Framework has expanded to accommodate a more integrated and coordinated government -wide management approach aimed at advancing organizational performance improvement and management efforts at agencies, including: PART 6 \u2014EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Page 2 of the Executive Summary OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Enterprise Risk Management i n 2016 ; Program and Project Management and Customer Experience i n 2018; Evaluation and Evidence -building , Sharing Quality Services, and Category Management i n 2019; Modernizing the Federal grants management process for award-making agencies in 2020 by updating the regulations that provide uniform guidance on Federal awards (2 C.F.R. part 200) to improve the balance between compliance requirements a nd performance outcomes and results; and Incorporating considerations of organizational health in concert with organizational performance by developing Frameworks for M easuring, Monitoring, and Improving Organizational Health and Organizational Performance in the Context of E volving Agency Work Environments (OMB Memorandum M -23-15 ) in 2023. Clarifying Key Roles and Responsibilities Perhaps the most important aspect of any effective performance management system is ensuring active leadership engagement. Leadership engagement fosters a high -performance culture that empowers employees at all levels within a n Agency or Department and enables the organization to work across silos to solve problems. In particular, Agency leaders are responsible not just for establishing goals and priorities but also for conducting data -driven reviews that are critical for creating a results -oriented culture that emphasizes learning, where leaders and staff debate questions that help them find, sustain, and spread promising practices and policies. This guidance describes key roles and responsibilities in organizational health, organizational performance, program , and enterprise risk management for the Agency Head, Chief Operating Officer (COO), Performance Improvement Officer (PIO), Program Management Improvement Officer (PMIO), Goal Leaders, Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Evaluation Officer, the Performance Improvement Council (PIC ), and Program Management Policy Council (PMP C). These roles and responsibilities importantly are disperse d across and down within ag encies to bureaus and components. Agency COOs, who must be the Deputy Secretar y or equivalent, provide organizational leadership to improve the organizational health and organizational performance of the agency . Agency PIOs, who must report directly to the COO, are responsible for supporting the agency head and COO in leading efforts to set goals, make results transparent, review progress and make course corrections where needed. PIOs also have responsibility for regularly co nvening the Implementation Leads of their major operating units , in coordination with other officials , to review Organizational Health and Organizational Performance Frameworks within the agency , diagnosing issues and implementing identified reforms to optimize operations supporting those Frameworks and strengthening mission delivery. Agency PMIOs, who must report directly to the COO or other equivalent senior agency official responsible for agency program performance, and are responsible for leading efforts to enhance the role and practice of program and project management (P/PM). Agency CRO s, or a senior agency official leading an equivalent function, who champion agency - wide efforts to manage risk within the agency and advise senior leaders on the strategically -aligned portfolio view of risks at the agency. Goal Leaders are officials named by the agency head or COO who are held accountable for leading implementation efforts to achieve a goal. This role includes laying out strategies to achieve the goal, managing execution, regularly reviewing performance, engaging others as needed and correcting course as appropriate. PART 6 \u2014EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of the Executive Summary Agency Chief Financial Officer s (CFO) , who report s directly to the head of the agency, oversees all financial management activities relating to the programs and operations of the agency , and serves as a resource for the agency 's performance management and improvements , planning, reviewing, and reporting. Agency CXOs are the Chief Executives who lead an array of agency management functions, such as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) identified above , as well as the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO), Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), and Chief Data Officer (CDO) . Executives leading these management functions work closely with the PIO, agency head , COO, as well as cross-functionally, to ensure that mission support resources are effectively and efficiently aligned and deployed to achieve the agency mission. This inc ludes such activities as routinely leading efforts to set goals, make results transparent, review progress, and make course corrections as needed to ensure that the agency 's management functions are effective in supporting agency goals and objectives. Evaluation Officers, who play a leading role in overseeing the agency 's evaluation activities and capacity assessments, learning agenda, and information reported to OMB on evidence, as well as collaborating with, shaping, and making contributions to other evidence -building functions within the agency. Implementation Leads of Major Operating Units oversee the development of frameworks for measuring and monitoring the organizational health and organizational performance of the ir organizational unit s, lead ongoing routines for the assessment of those framework s to improve organizational health and performance, inform decision- making related to future work environments within the organization , and strengthen mission delivery . The Performance Improvement Council (PIC) is comprised of agency PIOs and OMB and advises on the development of G overnment -wide policies designed to strengthen agency management and facilitate cross-agency learning and cooperation. The PIC is supported by the General Service Administration 's (GSA) Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement (OSSPI) which works with agencies to develop solutions to matters that affect mission activity, management functions and performance , as well as support OMB and Goal Leaders in analyzin g progress on Priority Goals . The Program Management Policy Council (PMPC) is comprised of agency PMIOs and OMB and advises on the development and implementation of polic ies and strategies for strengthening program and project management within the Federal Government by faci litating cross -agency learning, cooperation, and sharing best practices identified by agencies and private industry. Delivery partners, the organizatio ns or entities outside a Federal agency that help a Federal agency accomplish its objectives, and are consulted and engaged to support objectives and mission execution . Engaging Leaders in Goal -Setting and Sharpening Focus on Priorities across Organizational Health and Organizational Performance Outcomes The Administration expects agencies to set a limited number of ambitious goals that encourage innovation and adoption of evidence -based strategies. Agency leaders at all levels of the organization are accountable for choosing goals and indicators wisely and for setting ambitious, yet realistic targets. Wise selection of goals and indicators reflects careful analysis of the characteristics of the problems and opportunities an PART 6 \u2014EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Page 4 of the Executive Summary OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) agency seeks to in fluence to advance its objectives across its dimensions of organizational health, organizational performance, and work environments . The Director of OMB sets long -term Cross-Agency Priority Goals every 4 years with annual and quarterly targets. Agency heads develop Strategic Plans with long -term goals and objectives every 4 years, Agency Priority Goals (APGs) every two years, and performance goals at least annually. Promoting Increased Use of Performance Information and Other Evidence through Regular Review s Frequent data-driven performance reviews give agency leaders a mechanism for focusing an agency on priorities, diagnosing problems, and finding opportunities. Successful reviews include analyzing disaggregated data, learning from past experience, identifying risks that could affect the agency 's ability to reach objectives, and deciding next steps to increase performance and productivity. Annual assessments of agency progr ess on strategic objectives can also improve program outcomes and inform longer -term decision making. The OMB Director and Performance Improvement Council run quarterly reviews on Cross-Agency Priority Goals. Agency heads and OMB conduct annual strategic reviews of progress on outcomes and cross- cutting efforts, considering the entire body of both qualitative and quantitative evidence and guided by the agency 's Learning Agenda which describes their plan for building evidence to address agency priority questions . These reviews integrate evidence and evaluation across silos including enterprise risk management and program and project management. Agency COOs, along with key personnel from components or other agencies, run at least quarterly data-driven reviews of Agency Priority Goals, to better understand challenges, factors affecting change, and the costs of delivery. Agency leaders and CXOs run frequent data-driven reviews focusing on the health of the workforce (HRStat) and other management functions (e.g., AcqStat, TechStat, PortfolioStat, Evaluation Capacity Assessments) to drive improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of agency management, and in a manner that complements Agency COO reviews to drive progress on achieving agency goals and objectives while advancing the organizational health and organizational performance of both the agency and its individual major operating units to strengthen mission delivery . Implementation Leads of Major Operating Units coordinate ongoing, regular routines for monitoring and assessing the organizational health and organizational performance frameworks of the major operating unit and us e the results of those assessments to inform decisions related to future work environment s that improve organizational health and organizational performance . Building and Using Evidence to Support Continuous Learning and Improvement for Programs and Operations Evidence -building activities and planning requirements established by the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018 ( \"Evidence Act \") serve to complement and strengthen agency performance improvement initiatives and implementation strategies to achieve goals and objectives reflected in agency PART 6 \u2014EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of the Executive Summary Strategic and Performance Plans. Included in agency Strategic Plans, Learning Agendas are developed to outline the agency 's systematic approach to addressing the most pressing policy, programmatic, and regulatory questions related to the agency 's long -term goals and objectives. Capacity Assessments, also part of agency Strategic Plans, require agencies to look at the coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence of the agency 's statistics, evaluation, research and analysis efforts. This information can help agencies assess whether they have the capacity to meet the agency 's key priorities identified in the Strategic Plan. Finally, Annual Evaluation Plans describe the significant evaluations the agency plans to conduct related to its Learning Agenda and other priority evaluati on activities . Improving U tility of Program Information through Transparent Reporting A central website, Performance.gov , m akes finding and consuming performance information easier for the public, the Congress, delivery partners, agency employees, and other stakeholders. The site improve s transparency about what Federal programs do and how they relate to budget, performance, and other information requirements . Performance.gov is the central website that serves as the public window to Federal goals and performance in key areas of focus that reflect Administration and agency policy objectives and management priorities. Reporting on performance in these areas include: Desc riptions of Cross-Agency Priority Goals established to drive progress in implementing the President 's Management Agenda (PMA), including associated indicators, targets, action plans, goal leaders, and contributing programs. OMB and agencies ' quarterly updates of progress on Priority Goals. Agency Strategic Plans, Evidence -Building Plans (i.e., Learning Agenda), Annual Performance Plans, Annual Evaluation Plans, and Annual Performance Reports. Other key management priorities and initiatives of the Administration. The Performance Management Cycle As important as it is to sustain a strong performance culture through the practices and routines described in this guidance, it is equally important to have reliable and effective processes which support continuous improvement , organizational learning, and opportunities for capacity building. The Framework 's major policy provisions create a cycle of management routines that govern organizational planning and goal - setting, data -driven reviews of progress against those goals, and reporting for a gencies to use to drive organizational performance and management improvements. Importantly, i ts construction across four-year, annual, and quarterly update cycles provides a key mechanism for incorporating the organizational learning that stems from the m anagement routines of data -driven reviews. Agencies have the opportunity to revise implementation strategies and programmatic operations using evidence in order to address and overcome any identified barriers or challenges to delivering on its mission . The description below gives an overview of the Federal Performance Management Cycle. Pla nning. Strategic Plans present the long -term objectives an agency hopes to accomplish at the beginning of each new term of an Administration, describing the strategic di rection and vision as expressed through the general and long -term goals the agency aims to achieve, what actions the agency will take in coordinating resources to realize those goals, and how the agency will address challenges or risks that hinder progress . Agencies translate the longer -term strategic goals and objectives in their Strategic Plans to programmatic performance goals, including Agency Priority Goals, in the Agency 's annual Performance Plan. Complementing the Strategic Plan, Agency Performance Plans have a two -year coverage period that is r eviewed and updated annually . The PART 6 \u2014EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Page 6 of the Executive Summary OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Agency Performance Plans communicate the agency 's strategic objectives and performance goals with other elements of the agency 's budget request, detailing how goals will be ac hieved, identifying priorities among the goals, and explaining actions to monitor progress. Agencies identify objectives in the three areas below, along with accompanying implementation strategies for effective goal achievement. W hile the types of objectives are presented separately for discussion , in practice objectives (and their associated indicators ) for strengthening mission delivery often overlap across dimensions of the organization . o Mission Focused . The core functions and activities of Federal agencies that are reflected in statutory requirements or leadership priorities and which serve to drive their efforts in addressing pressing and relevant national problems, needs, and challenges. o Service F ocused . The activities that reflect the interaction(s) between individual citizens or businesses and Federal agencies in providing a direct service on behalf of the Federal Government, and which is core to the mission of the agency. o Mission Support and Management -Focused . The activities that c ommunicate improvement priorities for management functions which support organizational health and organizational performance , such as strategic human capital management, acquisition, information technology, cybersecurity , or financial management. Evidence, Evaluation, Analysis, and Review. From the strategic goals and objectives in the Strategic Plan, as well as the longer -term research questions agencie s seek to answer as part of their Learning Agendas, agencies establish internal management processes to set and monitor the performance of strategic objectives, portfolios of programs, Agency Priority Goals, and performance goals that are focused on mission, service, and mission support outcomes , and appropriate performance indicators that can be used to assess progress in those areas. Incorporating a range of quantitative and qualitative evidence, these regular reviews provide a mechanism for agency leaders to review the organization 's performance an d bring together the people, resources, and analysis needed to drive progress on agency priorities, both mission focused and management goals. Frequent data -driven performance reviews on both a quarterly and annual cadence identified below reinforce the agency 's priorities and establish an agency culture of continuous learning and improvement, sending a signal throughout the organization that agency leaders are focused on effective and efficient implementation to improve the delivery of results. o Agencies use quarterly data -driven reviews as a tool for management to focus on targeted, short -term progress to make changes to implementation strategies as needed to advance goal accomplishment. o Agencies use annual strategic reviews, which incorporate portfolio reviews of programs and updates to ERM risk profiles along with evaluation and evidence -building activitie s, as a tool for management to assess progress toward longer -term objectives and ensure major programs are being manage d effectively . o Major Operating Units establish frameworks for measuring and monitoring organizational health and organizational performance and ongoing routines for assessment in order to inform decision-making related to its organizational health, organizational perform ance, and future work environment.

SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 2 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) 200.1 To which agencies does Part 6 of OMB Circular No. A- 11 apply? In Part 6 of this Circular, agency is defined by section 306(f) of title 5, which includes executive departments, government corporations, and independent establishments but does not include the Central Intelligence Agency, the Government Accountability Office, the United States Postal Service, and the Postal Regulatory Commission. The Legislative Branch and the Judiciary are not subject to these requirements. In cases where sections of Part 6 guidance are applicable only to a subset of executive departments, government corporations, and independent establishments, the section will specify to which subset of agencies the guidance applies. Except for statutory exemption, all agencies are required to submit Strategic Plans, Annual Performance Plans, Annual Performance Reports, and Annual Evaluation Plans to the President, the Congress and OMB in accordance with these instructions. OMB may exempt independent agencies with $20 million or less in annual outlays from the requirements for a Strategic Plan, Annual Performance Plan, and Annual Performance Report. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA; Public Law 111 -352) does not authorize any exemption of a component of a department or independent agency, such as a b ureau or office that annually spends $20 million or less. Organizational components of agencies are not considered independent establishments or separate from executive departments, rather are a part of them. Therefore, agency components are not defined as an agency in the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 or in this guidance. Agencies subject to this guidance should work with their components to implement GPRAMA in a manner that is most useful to the whole organization. Agencies are expected to work with their components to identify priorities, goals, performance indicators, and other indicators relative to the mission and strategic objectives of the agency . Other sections of this guidance address specific agency applicability as it relates to those individual sections. 200.2 What other laws or policies are relevant to Part 6 of OMB Circular No. A-11? Aside from the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103 -62) and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, several other laws and policies affect the agency requirements and organizational performance management and improvement efforts addressed in Part 6 of OMB Circular No. A-11. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 (Public Law 101 -576) requires the head of each of the 24 executive agencies (31 U.S.C. 901) to prepare and submit to the Director of OMB audited financial statements. 31 U.S.C. 902(a)(6). And t he list of agencies in the CFO Act is used to identify agencies that must develop Agency Priority Goals under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 or as otherwise determined by the Director of OMB. 31 U.S.C. 1120(b). A discussion of other related laws and policies is provided below. Most recently, O MB Memorandum M -23-15 o utline d steps for executive departments and agencies (agencies) to take to ensure that agency decisions regarding work environments continue to improve organizational health and organizational performance . The memorandum directs agencies and the major operating units of agencies to establish organizational health and organizational performance frameworks and approaches that support delivery of the agency 's statutory missions; and routines to assess, monitor progress on, and diagnos e issues related to their organizational health and organizational performance frameworks on an ongoing basis . Effective organizational health and organizational performance frameworks can inform agency decisions regarding a variety of factors, including empowering agency leaders and managers to make, monitor, and assess changes in the organization 's work environment . SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 200 In 2020 OMB added a provision on program planning and design to its Uniform Guidance on Grants and Awards (2 C.F.R. 200.202) . This section requires Federal awarding agencies to design programs and create Assistance Listings before announcing a Notice of Funding Opportunity. It directs that p rograms must be designed with clear goals and objectives that facilitate the delivery of meaningful results and be align ed with the strategic goals and objectives within the Federal awarding agency 's strategic and performance plans in order to support the Federal awarding agency 's perfor mance measurement, management, and reporting activities . The Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (\"E vidence Act \") was enacted in January 2019. Recognizing data and evidence are key inputs to prioritizing agency efforts to support civic engagement, deliver on mission, service, and stewardship objectives, and support decision -making, the Evidence Act emphasizes collaboration and coordination to make better use of existing Federal data by statutorily mandating federal evidence -building activities, open government data, and confidential information protection and statistical efficiency. Importantly, s ection 290 was established to discuss the relationship of evaluation and evidence -building activities required by the Evidence Act to the performance improvement efforts advanced by the Federal Performance Framework. S pecific to the area of foreign assistance, t he Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act of 2016 (FATAA) a nd subsequent guidance in OMB Memorandum M -18-04 cr eated guidelines related to monitoring and evaluation for U.S. Departments and a gencies that invest foreign -assistance resources. FATAA further strengthens the existing requirement for them to publish quarterly financial and descriptive data on their programs, to create transparency on where they are directing funds and if programs are meeting their goals . E nacted in December 2016, the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (PMIAA) further strengthened the performance of the Federal Government through improved program and project management that is based on data-driven decision-making. Specifically, the law required the development of practices and standards for effective program management. It also established an interagency c ouncil to provide an interagency forum for improving agency practices related to program management while overseeing implementation efforts. The Act required agency heads to designate a senior executive to serve as the Program Management Improvement Officer (PMIO), with responsibility for implementing program management policies and developing strategies for enhancing the role of program and pr oject managers at agencies. Additionally, agencies must conduct annual portfolio reviews of programs in coordination with OMB to ensure programs are being managed effectively and efficiently. Section 270 of this Circular provides information and guidance for agencies on implementing this legislation as a complement to the Federal performance framework. I n July 2016, OMB released an update to O MB Circular No. A- 123, Management 's Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control. The update strengthened Federal agency management by ensuring all agencies implement an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) capability coordinated with the strategic planning and strategic review process established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, and the internal control processes required by the Federal Managers ' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA ) (Public Law 97 -255) and the Government Accountabilit y Office (GAO) 's Green Book . T his integrated governance structure improve d mission delivery, reduced costs, and focused corrective actions towards key risks. While OMB Circular No. A-123 is traditionally owned by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) community, effective implementation of the current policy will engage all agency management and require leadership from the agency C hief Operating O fficer (COO), Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or eq uivalent, and Performance Improvement Officer (PIO) working in close collaboration across all agency mission and mission -support functions when considering the full spectrum of risks to the successful execution of an agency 's strategic goals and objectives. Section 260 of this Circular describes the relationship between key parts of the Enterprise Risk Management framework in OMB Circular No. A-123 and its integration with the federal SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 4 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) performance framework established by the GPRAMA, including the consideration of enterprise risks during the development of agency Strategic Plans and strategies to mitigate risks as part of the annual strategic review assessments. The Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 tasked each Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) with \"a ligning the agency 's human resources policies and programs with organization mission, strategic goals, and performance outcomes. \" See section 200.14 for the role of the CHCO. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 reinforced the CHC Os' role in agency performance planning. As one means of implementing these expectations, the Senior Executive Service performance appraisal policy r equires that every SES clearly identify the goals and objectives in the agency Strategic Plan, Annual Performance Plan, or other organizational planning documents for which the SES has full or partial leadership responsibility. Agency strategic objectives must have individuals clearly responsible for their implementation, at SES or other levels of manager or team leader. See s ection 200.15 for guidance on the role of a goal leader. Additionally, Office of Personnel Management regulations (5 C.F.R. 250 Subpart B ) require agencies to align their strategic human capital management practices with agency performance and strategic planning processes under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. A s a part of the capital planning process, pursuant to the Clinger -Cohen Act (Public Law 104 -106), agency heads under the direction of OMB must \" analyze the missions of the executive agency and, based on the analysis, revise the executive agency 's mission -related processes and administrative processes, as appropriate, before making significant investments in information technology to be used in support of those missions. \" Additionally, a gency plans for capital acquisitions, including plans for information technology supported by OMB' s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OFCIO), should align with and support advancement of the goals identified in agency s trategic information resource management plans per the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA ; Public Law 113-291 ), and following guidance provided in OMB Circular No. A-130. Such planning requires coordination across documents to ensure agency strategic information resources management plans support with and align to goals and outcomes identified in Agency Strategic and An nual Performance Plans, including Agency Priority Goals. The Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106 -531) allows smaller, non -CFO-Act -designated agencies, at the discretion of the Director of OMB, to consolidate the publication of their financial (Agency Financial Report) and performance (Agency Performance Report) information as a Performance and Accountability Report (PAR). See OMB Circular No. A-1 36. A few small agencies use this option and may continue use it for meeting the performance reporting requirements of the Annual Performance Report. Pursuant to the GPRA Modernization Act, the annual Agency Performance Report (APR) is the primary document for comprehensive organizational performance reporting, and in light of the GPRA Modernization Act 's performance reporting to a central website, CFO-Act agencies must provide their agency 's Annual Performance Report with the agency 's Annual Performance Plan. See section 240 on Annual Performance Reporting. 200.3 O ur agency is subject to special laws or other governing regulations related to our agency 's performance planning , reporting , or management reviews. How does this guidance relate ? The guidance related to the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requirements accompanies the agency 's existing requirements established by other government laws or policies. For example, where agencies are authorized to keep information secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, pursuant to applicable policies and laws, agencies should continue to follow those existing laws or policies in their performance planning and reporting. Further, in cases where it is appropriate and feasible, agencies can meet the requirements of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 and other statutory requirements in a single report or management review, such as National Defense Authorization Act requirements placed on the Department of Defense 's National Defense Strategy, which could serve as the agency 's Strategic Plan SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 200 provided it meets the appropriate goal -setting and review requirements of associated laws. If agencies find that GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requirements conflict with or comp lement other requirements, the agency COO should consult OMB to discuss how related and overlapping requirements from separate statutes can be integrated in order to resolve the issue. 200.4 Overview of the GPRA Modernization Act of 201 0 The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 was en acted in January 2011. The Act modernized the Federal Government 's performance management framework, retaining and amplifying some aspe cts of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA 1993) while also addressing some of its weaknesses. GPRA 1993 established strategic planning, performance planning and performance reporting for agencies to communicate progress in achieving their missions. The GPRA Modernization Act established some important changes to existing requirements. Building on lessons agencies have learned in setting goals and reporting performance, a heightened emphasis is placed on priority-setting, cross-organi zational collaboration to achieve shared goals, and the use and analysis of goals and measurement to improve outcomes. The GPRA Modernization Act serves as a foundation for engaging leaders in performance improvement and creating a culture where data and empirical evidence play a greater role in policy, budget and management decisions. T he purposes of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 are to: Improve the confidence of the American people in the capability of the Federal Government, by systematically h olding Federal agencies accountable for achieving program results; Improve program performance by requiring agencies to set goals, measure performance against those goals and report publicly on progress; Improve Federal program effectiveness and public accountability by promoting a focus on results, service quality and customer satisfaction; Help Federal managers improve service delivery, by requiring that they plan for meeting program goals and by providing them with information about program results and service quality; Improve congressional decision- making by providing information on achieving statutory objectives and on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of Federal programs and spending; Improve internal management of the Federal Government; and Improve usefulness of performance and program information by modernizing public reporting. Progress continues to be made in implementing the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, 1 and the framework has proven effective at establishing management process and routines at agencies that reinforce data-driven decision -making .2 1 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).

SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 6 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) 200.5 What are agencies, their managers and their employees accountable for with regard to their performance goals and measurement of organizational perform ance? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires agencies to set long -term goals and objectives as well as specific, near -term performance goals. Agency leaders at all levels of the organization are accountable for choosing goals and indicators wisely and for setting ambitious, yet realistic targets. Wise selection of goals and indicators should reflect careful analysis of the characteristics of the problems and opportunities an agency seeks to influence to advance its mission, factors affecting those outcomes, agency capacity and priorities. Agency leaders are expected to consider the best available evidence, including any available evaluation results, when conducting this analysis. As appropriate, such analysis should consider whether the goals and indicators have been validated through research to be well correlated with ultimate outcomes, implications of available research on the appropriateness of the measure, and whether the available research indica tes that the use of the measure may encourage negative unintended consequences. To successfully deliver services to the public in a cost -effective way, agencies strive to maintain a performance culture where both leaders and staff constantly ask and try to answer, using the most rigorous methods feasible and appropriate, questions that help them find, sustain, and spread proven or pr omising practices and policies. Agencies are expected to set ambitious goals in a limited number of areas that push them to achieve significant performance improvements beyond current levels. In pursuing these ambitious goals, agencies are encouraged to expand the adoption of strategies that are based on rigorous evidence of effectiveness, where feasible and appropriate, and innovate strategies that show promise to be more effective, efficient, or cost -effective than current practice and evaluate their results. OMB generally expects agencies to make progress on all of their ambitious goals and achieve most of them, but at the s ame time will work with an agency that consistently meets a very high percentage of its ambitious goals to assure it is setting sufficiently ambitious goals. It will also work with agencies to develop performance improvement plans to support progress on the more challenging goals and objectives. Agencies are accountable for constantly striving to achieve meaningful progress and find lower -cost ways to achieve positive results. 200.6 How does OMB Memorandum M-23-15 and its requirements to establish and as sess Organizational Health and Organizational Performance Frameworks relate to the GPRA Modernization Act and affect the roles and responsibilities of leadership at the agency ? OMB Memorandum M -23-15, M easuring, Monitoring, and Improving Organizational Health and Organizational Performance in the Context of Evolving Agency Work Environments , provides guidance to help ensure that agency decisions regar ding their work environments are aimed to continually improve their organization' s health and organizational performance. The guidance establishes a common and consistent approach for heads of departments and agencies to regularly take stock of the organizational health a nd organizational performance (with particular focus at the component -level) of operating units, and use those insights to make decisions on agency work environments. The policies and guidance outlined in M -23-15 reinforce that organizational health and or ganizational performance should be the foundation for agency operational decisions, ensuring managers give close attention to strong, sustainable organizational health and culture over time while applying learning and evidence to sustain high-performing or ganizations. Agencies ' and their major operating units ' organizational health and organizational performance frameworks and approaches must support delivery of the agency 's statutory missions. Wh ile the historic Federal Performance Framework, outlined in Part 6 of this Circular and guided by GPRAMA, establishes routines of organizational goal setting, progress review, and reporting policies for agencies, it did not necessarily establish mechanisms and routines to develop and monitor an organization' s capacity to perform or resiliency to respond to evolving missions, priorities, and external factors, including within dynamic working environments. Moreover, the Federal Performance Framework only require d these routines at the agency level as the primary organ izational unit of analysis. OMB 's guidance in Memorandum SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023 ) Page 7 of Section 200 M-23-15 requires the Major Operating Units to establish frameworks for measuring, monitoring, and improving the organizational health and organizational performance of such units. It builds routines to assess those frameworks, diagnosing issues and making course corrections to strengthen mission delivery at a more granular level than the historic routines at the agency level . Agency Deputy Secretaries or equivalents (supported by the PIO) are accoun table for ensuring that senior Federal Government leaders and managers monitor and assess the organizational health and organizational performance frameworks developed by the individual major operating units within an agency. This action includes creating new or applying existing routines for engaging managers and staff within each such operating unit to pursue improved performance in concert with increased organizational health. Agencies ' approaches to implementing memorandum M-23-15, and frameworks for organizational health and organizational performance, should align to and integrate with existing agency -level and component -level strategic-planning, performance -management, and risk- management processes outlined in the applicable sections to Part 6 of this Circular, including the agency 's annual strategic review, human capital planning, FEVS action planning, and enterprise risk management efforts . Such routines and frameworks should also build on existing indicators and data collection efforts, while considering the development of new metrics where needed . 200.7 How does the GPRA Modernization Act affect the roles and responsibilities of leadership at the agency ? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 builds upon a performance management leadership structure that begins with the agency head, the Chief Operating Officer (COO), the Performance Improvement Officer (PIO), and the goal leaders. The Act 's performance framework must translate across and cascade down the organization to all agency managers and team leaders throughout the Department and its component bureaus . The three primary responsibilities of agency performance leaders are: 1. Goal -setting. Leaders at all levels of the organization, starting with the agency head, are responsible for choosing and communicating near -term and long-term goals, distinguishing those that are the highest priority and for driving progress on those priorities. 2. Assuring timely, actionable performance information is available to decision-makers at all levels of the organization. COOs, PIOs, Evaluation Officers, and senior program managers, along with agency CXOs (e.g., CIO, CFO, CHCO, CAO, PMIO, CDO, CRO, etc.), should make sure that the agency gathers and analyzes performance and other evidence, including evaluations and other research as needed, to better understand the problems they are trying to tackle, the effectiveness of past efforts to address problems, fact ors affecting change, and the costs of delivery. 3. Conducting frequent data -driven reviews that guide decisions and actions to improve organizational health and organizational performance outcomes, manage risk, and reduce costs. Each agency head and/or COO, with the support of the PIO, must run data -driven progress reviews that include key personnel and management officials from headquarters offices, other components, programs, or agencies, which contribute to the accomplishment of the goals reviewed. At a minimum, t hese reviews must include Agency Priority Goals, which take into account strategic workforce planning and human capital data analysis to ensure core mission and program delivery . However, t he agency head or COO may choose to expand these rev iews to encompass other performance goals and objectives as appropriate . As the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 is implemented, increased use of performance information should spread throughout the organization and to program delivery partners . The emphasis by GPRAMA and the Federal Performance Framework on data -driven and evidence -based decision -making by agencies is SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 8 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) complemented by the Evidence Act, and its focus on the data and evidence-building functions and activities of Federal agencies. 200.8 How does the agency designate the COO and PIO , and notify OMB of the designations ? COO and PIO Designations. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires all agency heads to designate a COO, who is the deputy head of the agency or equivalent. Agency heads, in consultation with the COO, will designate a senior executive as the agency PIO. The PIO must report directly to the COO or agency head . Agencies naming a political appointee senior executive or other individual with a limited -term appointment as PIO should name a career senior executive as the Deputy PIO. For the purposes of assigning a PIO, agencies have flexibility to name a senior executive, depending on the organizational needs and structure of the agency. For agencies with 500 or more full -time -equivalent employees (FTEs), a senior executive should be at the Executive Schedule, Senior Executive Service or equivalent level. For agencies with less than 500 FTEs, a senior executive should be a senior -level manager or leader within the organization. If necessary, and within available resources, agencies subject to the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 may submit to the Office of Personnel Management a request for consideration of an SES allocation adjustment for the PIO position. How to Not ify OMB of COO Designations. The head of each agency with more than 500 FTEs must notify OMB of the name of the agency COO. This should be done by emailing the OMB Deputy Director for Management/Chief Performance Officer and the OMB Associate Director for Performance and Personnel Management the name of the COO, copying performance@omb.eop.gov a nd PICStaff@gsa.gov . How to Notify OMB of PIO / Deputy PIO Designations. The COO must notify OMB of the name of the PIO (and Deputy PIO) by emailing the Associate Director for Performance and Personnel Management and copying performance@omb.eop.gov and PICStaff@gsa.gov . Ag encies that have fewer than 500 FTEs are encouraged, but not required, to notify OMB of the name of the agency COO and PIO (and Deputy PIO if named). The agency head or COO, as appropriate, must update the designations as th ey change. It is critical agencies notify OMB of c hanges to COO, PIO, and Deputy PIO designations as they occur. Doing so ensure s OMB, in collaboration with GSA, is able to maintain the accuracy of email ListServs that are used to facilitate the communication of key performance and management information, policies, guidance and initiatives to agencies. 200.9 Does an agency have to name an acting COO or acting PIO if the position is vacant ? Yes. If the COO or PIO position is likely to remain vacant for more than one month, the agency head or the COO should notify OMB of the name of the acting COO or acting PIO by emailing notifications to the Associate Director for Performance and Personnel Management, copying performance@omb.eop.gov . The Deputy PIO will be presumed to serve as the acting PIO unless the COO names another person to serve as the acting PIO . 200.10 Are t he PIO designations available to the public? Yes. The names of PIOs are available to the public on the Performance Improvement Council 's pa ge on the Performance.gov website for the 24 CFO Act agencies. SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 200 200.11 What is the role of the Chief Operating Officer (COO) ? Critical to the success of agency efforts to improve results and reduce costs is leadership engagement at all levels - led by the COO. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 states that the COO \"shall provide overall organization management to improve agency performance and achieve the mission and goals of the agency through the use of strategic and performance planning, measurement, analysis, regular assessment of progress, and use of performance information t o improve the results achieved. \" The law charges the COO with advising and assisting the head of the agency in these efforts, with support from the PIO. COOs, assisted by PIOs, are expected to assume the following roles and responsibilities for deliverin g an efficient, effective, and accountable government: 1. Set clear and ambitious goals to improve results and reduce costs. COOs will advise and assist the agency heads in selecting and communicating near - and long-term goals for their agencies that accelerate performance on Administration priorities and agency missions, save money, and enhance agency responsiveness to customers and citizens. 2. Assign and empower senior accountable officials to lead. Agency heads or COOs will designate a goal leader resp onsible for driving progress for each strategic objective and Agency Priority Goal , and at the agency -identified major operating unit level, a lead(s) responsible for the development and assessment of Frameworks for Organizational Health and Organizational Performance COOs will ensure these senior accountable officials have the tools and authority needed to manage both within and across organization boundaries to deliver better results in the most cost -effective way. 3. Conduct frequent reviews to accelerate progress. At least every quarter, the COOs will conduct data-driven reviews to speed performance and efficiency improvements on priority and other goals, including savings and management goals, coordinating with agencies that contribute to shared goals. Quarterly performance reviews on Agency Priority Goals are required both by Executive Order 13576 an d the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. COOs are responsible for ensuring these reviews are implemented in a way that is useful to the organization and for strengthening the agency 's analytic capacity to support data-driven progress reviews. 4. Identify and implement actions that improve results, enhance efficiency, manage risk and reduce waste. The COOs, working with component managers, program managers, risk managers, research and evaluation offices, PIOs, Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), Chief Acquisition Officers (CAOs) , Chief Information Officers (CIOs) , Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO), Program Management Improvement Officers (PMIOs), Chief Risk Officers or equivalent, Evaluation Officers, and other management function leaders, will actively engage in deliver ing results on agency goals in more effective and efficient ways, including re-directing budget and staffing resources and expanding the use of strategies that have been shown to be effective based on rigorous evidence. In general, these types of decision s should take into consideration the portfolio of available evidence on the topic, and high- stakes decisions should, in particular and when available, be based on a preponderance of evidence developed using rigorous methods. The COOs will also work with t he CFOs and other agency leaders to ensure that managers and employees continually look for and act on opportunities to cut waste and increase productivity. As part of this effort, COOs will ensure that other leaders within the agency such as program managers, information technology managers and acquisition leaders are working closely with the CFOs to meet goals for reducing unnecessary spending and to increase agency participation in Government -wide savings initiatives, such as strategic sourcing. COOs will also ensure that an agency 's leadership team reviews the program improvement and cost saving recommendations identified in the Government Accountability Office' s (GAO) annual report on program duplication, overlap, and fragmentation, SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 10 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023 ) as well as areas GAO has identified as high -risk, and that the agency has a plan in place that addresses the recommendations. 5. Ensure transparency of performance information that increases accountability, results, and cost-effectiveness. COOs are responsible for making sur e that performance information is regularly updated to inform agency and OMB performance reviews. In addition, COOs, with assistance from the PIO and PMIO, will make sure that program managers regularly communicate actionable performance metrics and analy ses to those in the field, other parts of the Federal Government and delivery partners so they can improve performance and reduce costs. Also, on an annual basis, COOs are responsible for assuring that each agency identifies opportunities for eliminating or modifying duplicative or outdated congressionally -required plans and reports. 6. Instill a performance and efficiency culture that inspires continuous improvement , strengthening organizational health and organizational performance . COOs, supported by PIOs, CHCOs, PMIOs, in addition to research and evaluation offices, Evaluation Officers, and officials leading other management -focused offices, are responsible for establishing a performance, program management, and evidence culture within the agency that sets priorities and challenges for managers and employees at all levels of the organization to focus on better outcomes and lower - cost ways to operate. They should work to establish a culture of continual learning where staff identif y critical questions and search for, test, and expand the use of effective practices, as well as one of risk awareness where the proactive identification and management of risk to agency objectives or programs is incentivized and embraced . They are also r esponsible for using the annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey to identify areas of personnel strength and areas of weakness needing attention. Further, COOs are responsible for assuring that SES performance expectations support progress on agency stra tegic objectives, performance goals, and indicators. 200.12 Why is COO leadership engagement important to performance management ? Engagement of agency leadership in performance management is critical for several purposes. COOs need to: Provide organizational leadership to improve performance relative to mission and management functions. Importantly, this requires careful consideration be given to the agency 's organizational structure and management proc esses when designating officials to serve i n key agency management positions such as the CXOs (PIO, PMIO, CIO, CFO, CHCO, CRO, etc.). Agency heads and COOs must balance statutory provisions that govern the designation and reporting of these officials along with agency -specific organizational structure s, processes, and lines of accountability or authority that will enable officials to effectively perform their roles and responsibilities throughout the agency. Bring together other leaders and staff within the agency, including component managers, program managers, research and evaluation experts, and other leaders of key management functions such as the CIO, CFO, CHCO, CAO, Chief Data Officer, PMIO, Evaluation Officer, in addition to the PIO, to solve problems and pursue opportunities that help the agency operate more effectively and efficiently. This collaboration includes identification of critical questions that, when answered, will help the agency operate more effectively or efficiently, and the development of a plan to answer those questions in the most rigorous method feasible and appropriate. Make timely and consequential decisions, including program, budget, and staffing decisions, to drive performance results in more effective and cost -effective ways. SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023 ) Page 11 of Section 200 Maintain or shift focus of other leaders and staff to the priorities that advance Administration and agency mission. Convene and chair data -driven performance reviews with appropriate representatives from components, key management functions, other offices, and other agencies, if needed, challenging those involved in the review to identify opportunities for improvement and decide next steps. Promote adoption of performance improvement practices across the whole organization, fostering a high-performance culture that empow ers and engages managers and employees at all levels. Examples include creating demand for useful performance information and other evidence during data-driven reviews, holding managers accountable for knowing what works that is worth continuing, knowing what does not and that needs to be fixed, and following up on actions assigned during the performance reviews . 200.13 What is the role of the Performance Improvement Officer? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires agency heads, in consultation with the COO, to name a PIO who is a senior executive reporting directly to the COO. Agency PIOs are expected to advise and assist the agency leadership to ensure that the mission and goals of the agency are achieved through strategic and performance planning, measurement, analysis, regular assessment of progress, and use of high -quality performance information and other evidence to improve results. This includes driving performance improvement efforts across the organization by using goal -setting, measurement , analysis, evaluation and other research, data-driven performance reviews on progress, cross -agency collaboration, and personnel performance appraisals aligned with organizational priorities. The PIOs are expected to support the head of the agency and COO functions by playing the following roles within their agencies: 1. Support the agency head and COO in leading agency efforts to set goals, make results transparent, review progress and make course corrections by: advising and assisting all organizatio nal components in strategic and performance planning to advance the agency 's mission , and development of Organizational Health and Organizational Performance Frameworks that strengthen mission delivery by agency -designated major operating units ; supportin g frequent data -driven reviews, at least quarterly, to learn from experience, descriptive research, descriptive and predictive analyses, evaluations, and work in coordination with agency managers to decide next steps to improve program performance; and communicating goals, progress, problems, and improvement plans, including quarterly reporting of progress on agency priorities and Annual Performance Reports, to those who need the information to make better decisions . 2. Reach out to other offices to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency by: assisting other agency managers, including component and program office managers, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Human Capital Officer, Chief Acquisition Officer/Senior Pr ocurement Executive, Chief Information Officer, Program Management Improvement Officer, Chief Data Officer, Statistical Official, Chief Risk Officer or equivalent , risk managers, research and SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 12 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023 ) evaluation offices and Evaluation Officer , and legislative and communication offices, in efforts to improve and communicate organizational performance; working with the Chief Human Capital Officer and other agency managers to effectively align strategic human capital management planning and practices (see 5 C.F.R. 250 Subpart B), including personnel performance objectives, feedback, appraisals, recognition, and incentive structures to advance agency goals and priorities; working with CIOs and CAOs to ensure agency capital investments advance organizational goals set forth in strategic and annual plans; and assisting the COO, in collaboration with the CFO, in evaluating the efficient stewardship of resources across all agency activities, incorporating the use of performance information and other evidence, particularly high-quality evidence identified in partnership with research and evaluation offices, in budget preparation and execution; working with PMIOs to ensure program and project management practices are strengthened across the agency and applied to achieve improved program performance as well as strengthen ed agency capabilities, collaboration, and knowledge -sharing for managing programs more effectively and efficiently ; working with the Evaluation Officer to strengthen the integration of evaluati on and evidence - building activities with performance management to advance progress towards the agency 's goals and outcome objectives; working with the agency 's Data Governance Body to help ensure that priorities for managing data assets support the agency 's mission, including its strategic plan and other high- level priorities; working with Chief Data Officers in identifying and using data to carry out various functions delegated to PIOs; promoting the application of enterprise risk management practices in strategic planning, strategic reviews as well as other budget and performance activities; supporting the application of clear program design principles before Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs) are developed ; regularly coordinat ing and conven ing with agency leadership, operating unit lead, and other officials (including but not limited to Chief Human Capital Officer, Chief Data Officer, Evaluation Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Experience Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Acquisition Officer, the Statistical Official, and High Impact Service Provider leads) to continually review progress of and improve the agency 's organizational health and organizational performance processes and frameworks . 3. Help components, program office leaders, goal leaders, and CXOs to identify and promote adoption of effective practices to improve impact of program outcomes, responsiveness , and efficiency by supporting them in: SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 200 selecting meaningful and appropriate goals and indicators, designating goal leaders, collecting and analyzing data in ways that inform targeting, identifying and promoting adoption of increasingly effective practices, and securing evaluations and other research as needed; preparing for data -driven reviews; communicating performance goals, indicators and related analyses; managing risks to performance goals and objectives; running effective data -driven performance reviews and tri ggering focused follow -up questions that inform future action and research; and creating a network for learning and knowledge sharing about successful outcome -focused, data-driven performance improvement methods across all levels of the organization and with delivery partners. 200.14 Who supports the work of the PIO? Agencies may create a dedicated PIO staff and/or identify a cross-agency team that supports the PIO to assist the COO in strengthening the performance improvement culture and practices that improve outcomes and cost -effectiveness. COOs should identify organizational resources, staff or units with analytic and evaluation capacity to work with the PIOs to support the data -driven reviews. C lose collaboration between the performance improvement and measurement functions overseen by the PIO and the evaluation functions overseen by the agency Evaluation Officer is critical to ensuring an evidence-based deci sion-making approach is exercised by agency management officials. Finally, close coordination between the PIO and Chief Data Officer is also needed to ensure that the agency identifies and uses the app ropriate data necessary - to include human capital analysis from the CHCO - to achieve the agency 's broader goals, objectives, and outcomes . 200.15 What is the role of the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) ? The agency CHCO plays an important role in supporting agency strategic planning and performance improvement efforts, including specific responsibilities identified by statute in the GPRA Modernization Act, and further detailed in the Federal regulations for Strategic Human Capital Management, 5 C .F.R. 250 Subpart B (refer to section 250.201, Coverage and Purpose f or agency applicability). The CHCO supports the agency head, COO, and PIO by ensuring human capital plans, strategies, and investments advance organizational goals set forth in the agency 's strategic and annual plans by: w orking with agency l eaders to identify and establish the human capital goals and strategies needed to achieve the strategic goals and objectives in the Agency Strategic Plan; partnering with the PIO to include relevant human capital performance goals and indicators in the agency Annual Performance Plan; establishing the agency Human Capital Operating Plan (HCOP), and updating it annually, as an implementing document that describes how an agency will execute the human capital elements stated within the Agency Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plan; SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 14 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023 ) updating the agency HCOP on the same annual cycle as the agency Annual Performance Plan in order to identify and focus on the human capital goals and measures that need to be implemented each year to achieve the strategic goals set forth in the Agency Strategic Plan; and conducting quarterly data -driven HRStat reviews, in collaboration with the PIO, to monitor the progress of HCOP implementation. To further support agency strategic and annual performance planning, the CHCO i s responsible for identifying and promoting relevant human capital programs and policies by providing information about: future workforce challenges that will affect the organization 's ability to meet its mission objectives (e.g., pipeline challenges) and continuously conducting environmental scans to identify future human capital issues; workforce analysis profiles, to include information about current and future staffing and competency requirements; human capital programs and initiatives established to support the agency 's mission, such as the agency 's plan to maintain an agile and well -equipped workforce; human capital policies, programs, initiatives and training solutions that can mitigate risks identified; and requests for positions, training and programs, especially to support the Chief Financial Officer and agency budget decisions. To align agency human capital management practices with the Human Capital Framework (HCF), pursuant to 5 C.F.R. 250 (B), and to identify and achieve agency -specific and government -wide strategic human capital goals and priorities, the CHCO should: oversee forward -thinking workforce planning and analysis within fiscal restraints, including identifying and continuously working to close skill gaps in mission critical occupations and managerial and executive positions using effective hiring and workforce development strategies; collaborate with the PIO and other senior leaders to emphasize and develop plans to improve and sustain meaningful employee engagement efforts; in collaboration with the COO and PIO, use their HRStat quarterly review sessions to measure progress and identify actions to enhance organizational culture and employee engagement, including tracking employee engagement metrics and targets; work with t he PIO and senior leaders and managers across agency components and programs in developing aggressive, results -based individual performance plans that are aligned to and support agency goals and priorities, and in providing effective employee feedback, appraisals, recognition, and incentive structures to recognize excellence; recommend effective human capital solutions that can mitigate identified risks; and collaborate with other executive department CHCOs through the CHCO Council to share best practices and develop and support cross -cutting HC initiatives. SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 15 of Section 200 For more information about the CHCO role in agency performance management see the April 26 , 2013 memorandum from OPM to CHCOs. 200.16 What is the role of a goal leader ? A goal leader is an official named by the agency head or COO who will be held accountable for leading implementation efforts to achieve a goal. A goal leader will lay out strategies to achieve the goal, manage execution, regularly review performance, engage others as needed and make course corrections as appropriate. Agency goal leaders will be individual(s) authorized to coordinate across an agency or program to achieve progress on a goal. Certain goals may require two goal leaders or co -goal leaders who share accountability for progress. 200.17 Do all agencies need to assign a goal leader for every goal ? Agencies responsible for Priority Goals must identify to OMB the goal leader for each Agency Priority Goal , and goal lead(s) or lead office(s) for each strategic objective that was included in the agency 's Strategic Plan or updated in the most recent annual Agency Performance Plan. Unless otherwise noted, the goal leader or lead office(s) for each strategic objective also has responsibility for driving progress on the individual performance goals supporting that strategic objective and managing associated risks. OMB will work across the Administration to identify goal leaders for Cross-Agency Priority Goals. OMB expects that Chief Human Capital Officers and PIOs to work together to ensure that every Agency Priority Goal and strategic objective has an official clearly responsible for it. 200.18 What is a Deputy Goal Leader? Where a goal leader is assigned, agencies should identify a deputy goal leader to support the goal leader. If the goal leader identified is a political appointee, then the deputy goal leader designated to assist the goal leader should be a career F ederal employee . 200.19 What is the relationship between the individual performance plans of Goal Leaders and Deputy Goal Leaders and the organizational performance goals they lead ? Agencies are required to establish performance management systems that hold senior executives accountable for individual and organizational performance . Individual performance plans of goal and deputy goal leaders should be aligned with the results and outcome oriented organizational performance goals required by the GPRA Modernization Act or other agency or Administration performance and management initiatives. Additional information can be found on OPM 's Performance Management web site outlining individual performance management system requirements and their relationship to organizational performance goals and objectives. 200.20 Wh at is the role of the agency -identified Major Operating Unit lead(s) responsible for developing and assessing frameworks for organizational health and organizational performance ? Agencies are required to identify the major operating units within their agencies in which OMB Memorandum M -23-15' s requirements for frameworks for organizational health and organizational performance will be applied. For each major operating unit identified by agencie s, a lead (s) will be designated for overseeing the development and assessment of those frameworks. The lead should serve in a senior position that has the ability to direct and coordinate implementation of performance and workforce policies throughout the organization. Major operating unit lead(s) will be responsible for reviewing and SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 16 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023 ) analyzing their organizational health and organizational performance data and processes, identify ing areas where existing indicators are not available and identify ing gaps (e.g., areas w here new data streams or inclusion in the learning agenda would be helpful) to ensure the best -available organizational health and organizational performance indicators will be available for future reviews. 200.21 What is the role of the Performance Improv ement Council (PIC) ? The GPRA Modernization Act establishes the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) in statute. The PIC assists agencies, the Director of OMB, and the Deputy Director for Management of OMB in improving the performance of the Federal Government. The PIC 's primary focus is to help make performance management and improvement policies and principles operational in an applied, experiential setting at agencies. The Deputy Director for Management of OMB, or designee, shall act as chairperson of the PIC and preside at the meetings of the PIC, determine its agenda, direct its work and establish and direct subgroups of the PIC, as appropriate, to deal with particular subject matters. The PIC shall: Assist the Director of OMB in improving the performance of the Federal Government and achieving the Federal Government Cross-Agency Priority Goals and in implementing the planning, reporting and use of performance information requirements related to the Cross -Agency Priority Goals; Analyze and advise how to resolve specific Government -wide or cross-cutting issues; Facilitate the exchange of useful practices within specific programs or across agencies; Coordinate with other interagency management councils; Consider the performance management and improvement experience of others (private sector, other governments and other levels of government, nonprofit sector, public sector unions, customers of government services, etc.); Receive assistance, information, and advice from agencies; Develop an d submit recommendations to streamline and improve performance management policies and requirements and, when appropriate, leads implementation of them; and Develop tips, tools, training, and other capacity -building mechanisms to strengthen agency perform ance management and facilitate cross-agency learning and cooperation, especially by considering the performance improvement experiences of entities both within and outside the Federal Government . 200.22 Who m akes up the PIC ? The Performance Improvement Council is chaired by the Deputy Director for Management (DDM) of OMB and is supported by a number of full -time staff from the General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement (OSSPI) . The membership of the PIC includes Performance Improvement Officers (PIO), Deputy PIOs, and associated staff and other individuals from SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 17 of Section 200 Federal agencies as determined by the chair. The PIC may create working groups, task forces, and subcommittees made up of other agency officials to carry out the work of the Council and support efforts to improve the performance of the Federal Government . 200.23 What is the PIC' s relationship with agencies ? The PIC is made up of agency representatives and serves agencies on matters of organizational performance management and improvement and other related disciplines. Agency staff, managers, and executives can engage PIC resources, such as dedicated staff and detailees reporting to the PIC, working groups, and online collaboration opportunities provided by the PIC, to solicit solutions to matters that impact mission activity, management functions and performance management. As provided by law, the heads of agencies with Performance Improvement Officers serving on the PIC shall provide, at the request of the chairperson of the PIC, up to 2 personnel authorizations to serve at the direction of the chairperson. Additionally, the PIC sponsors the PERFORMANCE@LISTSERV.GSA.GOV i n order to promote and facilitate learning across the performance management community. Managed by GSA' s Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement (OSSPI) in collaboration with OMB , the PERFORMANCE listserv is open to Federal employees or contractors with a valid .gov email address and provides for a private, semi -moderated discussion list for federal employees regarding organizational performance management and related issues and disciplines. Members may post messages by sending an email to performance@listserv.gsa.gov . Messages typically r ange from learning and development opportunities, to performance- related events, to USAjobs vacancy announcements. In order to subscribe to th e PERFORMANCE Lists erv, Federal employees or eligible contractors must send their office address and contact information to GSA 's OSSPI at picstaff@gsa.gov . 200.24 Definitions Administrative Data. Data collected by government entities for program administration, regulatory, or law enforcement purposes. Examples include: data on employment and earnings collected through the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, data on medical conditions and payments collected through Medicare and Medicaid, data on local pollution levels collected to administer the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, and criminal histories maintained as part of police records or arrests. Such data are usually collected on the universe of individuals, businesses, or communities affected by a particular program, in contrast to survey data that are collected for samples of broader populations, typically for research evaluation, or other statistical purposes. Actionable Information/ Data of Significant Value. Data or other evidence that is sufficiently accurate, t imely and relevant to affect a decision, behavior, or outcome by those who have authority to take action. For information to be actionable, it must be prepared in a format appropri ate for the user. (See section 240 .) Agency. OMB Circular No. A-11 Part 6 uses the same definition of agency as the GPRA Modernization Act in section 306(f) of title 5. This definition of agency includes executive departments, government corporations and independent establishments but does not include the Central Intelligence Agency, the Government Accountability Office, the United States Postal Service, and the Postal Regulatory Commission. Agency Financial Report (AFR). A report on the agency end of f iscal year financial position that includes, but is not limited to, financial statements, notes on the financial statements and a report of the independent auditors. The report also includes a performance summary. (See section 240 on Annual Performance Reporting). SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 18 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Annual Agency Performance Plan (APP). Under the GPRA Modernization Act, an Agency 's Annual Performance Plan defines the level of performance to be achieved during the fiscal year in which the plan is submitted and the next fiscal year. The APP may be used to structure the agency 's budget submission or be a separate document that accompanies the agency 's budget submission. An Annual Agency Performance Plan must cover each program activity of the agency set forth in the budget. (See sect ion 240 on Annual Performance Planning). Annual Agency Performance Report (APR). A report on the agency performance that provides information on the agency 's progress achieving the goals and objectives described in the agency 's Strategic Plan and Annua l Agency Performance Plan, including progress on the Agency Priority Goals. The report is delivered to the Congress every February with an agency 's Congressional Budget Justification or, alternatively, the APR may be delivered as a performance section of the Performance and Accountability Report that is published by agencies in November. (See section 240 on Annual Performance Reporting). Component (of an agency). Used to describe major organizational units, such as a bureau, administration, or office, w ithin a department or agency. See 20.3 of this Circular. Crosscutting. Across organizational boundaries within an agency or across multiple agencies. Customer Experience (CX). As defined by Executive Order 14058, the term Customer Experience (CX) means the public 's perceptions of and overall satisfaction with interactions with an agency, product, or service. Building on this definition and applied in the broader context of this guidance, Federal Government CX refers to a combination of factors that result from touchpoints between an individual, business, or organization and the Federal Government over the duration of an interaction and relationship. These factors can include ease/simplicity, efficiency/speed, equity/transparency of the process, effectiveness/perceived value of the service itself, and the interaction with any employees. Perceived responsiveness to individual needs and feedback is also important. Similar to their application in the private sector, these factors can drive the overall satisfaction and confidence or trust with the program, agency, and the government at large. A customer 's experience interacting with the Federal government directly contributes to their trust in government itself. (See section 280 on Managing Customer Experi ence and Improving Service Delivery .) Data -Driven Review. Routine and periodic assessment s led by agency leaders that incorporate a broad range of qualitative and quantitative inputs and indicators to review the organization' s performance. Data - Driven Reviews bring together the people, resources, and analyses needed to drive progress and performance improvement on agency priorities, both mission-focused and stewardship -focused goals. While performance management often leverages data -driven reviews to track results on the implementation of agency goals, e valuations are carried out periodically and use rigorous designs and methodologies, particularly to estimate impacts and determine causality. (See section 260 on Performance and Strategic Reviews.) Delivery Partner. Organizations or entities outside a Federal agency that provide support or assistance in helping a Federal agency accomplish its objectives (e.g., state and local governments, grantees, non -profits, associations, other agencies, contractors). Efficiency. For the purposes of A- 11 Part 6, efficiency gains may be described as maintaining a level of performance at a lower cost, improving performance levels at a lower cost, improving performance levels at the same cost, or improving performance levels to a greater degree than costs are increased . Efficiency may be applied to the management of programs and their supporting activities as well as performance goals and objectives. SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 19 of Section 200 Effectiveness. For the purposes of A -11 Part 6 , effectiveness can be described as an empirical approach to assess whether a goal, program , or policy is achieving its intended, desired results. Measuring effectiveness requires systematic analysis and takes into account c onsiderations such as timeliness, quality, and the intended outcomes. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). A d iscipline that deals with identifying, assessing, and managing an organization' s risks to achieving its goals and objectives. Agencies should coordinate the implementation of their ERM capability that assesses and manages risks as part of their strategic planning and review process (section 260). For a complete description of management 's responsibilities for Enterprise Risk Management and internal control within the Federal Government see OMB Circular No. A- 1 23. Evaluation. As defined by 5 U.S.C. 311(3) , \"ev aluation \" means an assessment using systematic dat a collection and analysis of one or more programs, policies, and organizations intended to assess their effectiveness and efficiency. Evaluations can provide critical information to inform decisions about current and future programming, policies, and organizational operations. Evaluation can look beyond the program, policy, or organizational level to include assessment of particular projects or interventions within a program, for example, or particular aspects of a policy of functions or units within an organization. Evaluations may address questions related to the implementation of a program, policy, or organization; the effectiveness of specific strategies related to or used by a program, policy, or organization; and/or factors that relate to variability in the effec tiveness of a program, policy, or organization or strategies of these. Evaluations can also examine questions related to understanding the contextual factors surrounding a program, as well as how to effectively target specific populations or groups for a particular intervention. Evaluations can and should be used be used for learning and improvement purposes, as well as accountability purposes . See OMB Memorandum M - 20-12 . While evaluation can provide information on a program 's performance (i.e., its activities, outputs, and outcomes), its overall goals and approach are different from performance measurement. A princip al focus of performance measurement is assessing progress toward organizational goals and established targets in helping determine whether an implementation strategy is achieving its stated output or outcome objectives. In contrast, evaluation, as defined above, is a systematic effort to understand effectiveness. However, both evaluation and performance measurement generate information that falls along the continuum of evidence, serve as methods for systematic assessment, and aim to facilitate learning about and improve results of government activities. Evaluation a nd performance measurement should be aligned and complementary, where appropriate. Evaluation Activities include the planning, implementation, management, and reporting of activities overseen or coordinated by evaluators and related staff within a Federal agency. This includes, but is not limited to: developing and coordinating multi -year Learning Agendas, establishing Annual Evaluation Plans, planning and managing or conducting specific evaluations, summarizing evaluation findings for particular programs or policies, supporting other offices within an agency to interpret evaluation findings, and bringing evaluation-related evidence to bear in decision- making. See OMB Memoran dum M -20-12 . Importantly, there are different types of evaluation, each of which addresses different questions, including: Impact Evaluation: This type of evaluation assesses the causal impact of a program, policy, or organization, or aspect of them on outcomes, relative to a counterfactual. In other words, this type of evaluation estimates and compares outcomes with and without the program, policy, or organization, or aspect thereof. Impact evaluation s include both experimental (i.e., randomized controlled trials) and quasi -experimental designs. An impact evaluation can help answer the question, \"does it work ,\" or \"did the intervention lead to the observed outcomes? \" SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 20 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Outcome Evaluation : This type of evaluation measures the extent to which a program, policy, or organization has achieved its intended outcome(s), and focuses on outputs and outcomes to assess effectiveness. Unlike impact evaluation above, it cannot discern causal attribution but is compleme ntary to performance measurement, as noted above. An outcome evaluation can help answer the question, \" were the intended outcomes of the program, policy, or organization achieved ?\" Process or Implementation Evaluation: This type of evaluation assesses how the program or service is delivered relative to its intended theory of change, and often includes information on content, quantity, quality, and structure of services provided. These evaluations can help answer the question, \"was the program, policy, or organization implemented as intended? \" or \" how is the program, policy, or organization operating in practice? \" Formative Evaluation: This type of evaluation is typically conducted to assess whether a program, policy, or organizational approach - or some aspect of these - is feasible, appropriate, and acceptable before it is fully implemented. It may include process and/or outcome measures . However, unlike outcome and impact evaluations, which seek to answer whether or not the program, policy, or organization met its intended goals or had the intended impacts, a formative evaluation focuses on learning and improvement and does not answer questions of overall effectiveness. Descriptive Studies: These studies can be quantitative or qualitative in nature, and seek to describe a program, policy, organization, or population without inferring causality or measuring effectiveness. While not all descriptive studies are evaluations, some may be used for various evaluation purposes, such as to understand relationships between program activities and participant outcomes, measure relationships between policies and particular outcomes, describe program participants or components, and identify trends or patterns in data . As described in OMB Memorandum M -20-12 , all evaluations must adhere to program evaluation standards, and t he questions to be answered must drive the research methods (and not vice versa) . Federal evaluations must address questions of importance and serve the information needs of stakeholders in order to be useful resources (Relevance and Utility) . All evaluations, regardless of method (i.e. , qualitative, quantitative, or mixed) must adhere to widely accepted scien tific principles and employ methods most appropriate for the evaluation 's objectives, within constraints of timeline, feasibility, and available resources (Rigor) . Evaluators should strive for objectivity in the planning and conduct of evaluations and in the interpretation and dissemination of findings, avoiding conflicts of interest, bias, and other partiality (Independence and Objectivity) . Federal evaluation must be transparent in the planning, implementation, and reporting phases to enable accountabili ty and help ensure that aspects of an evaluation are not tailored to generate specific findings (transparency). Evaluations should be equitable, fair, and just, and should take into account cultural and contextual factors that could influence the findings or their use (ethics). OMB Memorandum M-20-12 Appendix B i ncludes a more detailed explanation of the standards and describes practices that can facilitate meetin g the standards. T he Program Evaluation St andards , outlined in OMB Memorandum M -20-12, a re designed to improve the quality and use of evaluation across Federal agencies, while recognizing that agencies must build policies, evaluation offices, and infrastructure that meet their distinct evaluation needs and responsibilities. These standards inform both specific evaluations and the broader set of evaluation activities. As such, these standards and practices apply not just to Federal evaluation offices, but also have applicability to other Federal units that carry out or sponsor evaluation and to individual evaluators, including Federal evaluation staff, outside partners, and recipients of Federal awards that are performing work on behalf of the agency . SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 21 of Section 200 Evaluation.gov. Web -based system that includes information on the evidence and program evaluation initiatives of the Executive Branch designed to support evidence -based pol icymaking across the Federal Government . It is home to the required deliverables under Title I of the Evidence Act , including Learning Agendas, Annual Evaluation Plans, Capacity Assessments, and Evaluation Policies. Evidence. As defined by 44 U .S .C. 3561(6) , \"ev idence\" means information produced as a resu lt of statistical activities for a statistical purpose. However, evidence, as applied in the context of the Federal Performance Framework for improving organizational and agency performance , is viewed more broadly as the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid. As such, evidence can be quantitative or qualitative and may come from a variety of sources, including foundational fact finding (e.g., aggregate indicators, exploratory studies, descriptive statistics, and other research), performance measurement, policy analysis, and program evaluation (see OMB Memorandum M - 19-23 ). Evidence has varying degrees of credibility, and the strongest evidence generally comes from a portfolio of high-quality, credible sources rather than a single study. T he credible use of evidence in decision -making requires an understanding of what conclusions can be drawn from the info rmation and, equally important, what conclusions cannot be drawn. For example, multiple impact and implementation evaluations may provide strong evidence that a particular intervention is effective in a particular setting or with a particular population. H owever, they may be less definitive on how effective that intervention would be in other settings or with different populations. Quasi -experimental evidence from large, diverse samples of administrative data may address concerns about generalizability , but could lack definitive evidence on causality or be silent on important outcomes not captured in the administrative data. Descriptive analyses from Federal statistical series provide context to examine societal, economic, and environmental trends over time but do not speak to program outcomes or impacts. Qualitative and quantitative implementation studies can complement other evidence on outcomes and impacts by providing insight into how programs and practices can be successfully implemented in particular settings and with particular populations. Similarly, high -quality performance metrics that are valid, reliable, and strongly correlated with outcomes can be valuable to understand agency progress toward achieving a desired outcome. In sum, using evidence credibly means being able to assess the quality and methodological rigor of the information and align the resulting insights with their appropriate use . External Factors. Economic, demographic, social, environmental, or other influences that are not of the agency 's own making but can affect the goals or outcomes an agency seeks to influence. Some external factors, such as safety practices, can be influenced by agency action, while others are more difficult to affect. Foresight. In the context of a strategic planning best practice, foresight is generally characterized as i nsight into how and why the future might be different from the present. Foresight practices include environmental scanning, trend analysis, and scenario-based planning, and other methods to engage individuals in thinkin g about the long-range future. While f oresight is often considered as the \"act of looking forward\" so as to plan for the future, in strategic planning it is not the same as forecasting, which seeks to make statements or assertions about future events based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and modeling. Through incorporating foresight into strategic planning, an agency can develop an appropriate strategic posture by analyzing and preparing for multiple possible futures. Goal. A statement of the result or achievement toward which effort is directed. Goals can be long or short - term and may be expressed specifically or broadly. Progress against goals should be monitored using a suite of supporting indicators. F or the purpose of this guidance, there are Cross -Agency Priority Goals, strategic goals, strategic objectives, Agency Priority Goals and performance goals, all of which have uniquely defined properties. SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 22 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023 ) Goal, Cross-Agency Priority (CAP Goals) (referred to as Federal Priority Goal in GPRA Modernization Act). A statement of the long -term level of desired performance improvement for Government -wide goals set or revised at least every four years. These include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas and management goals addressing financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management. Goal, Strategic. A statem ent of aim or purpose that is included in a Strategic Plan. Strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission and address relevant national problems, needs, challenges and opportunities. These outcome -oriented strategic goals and supporting activities should further the agency 's mission. Objective, Strategic. Strategic objectives reflect the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve and generally include the agency 's role. Included in a Strategic Plan, e ach objective is tracked through a suite of performance goals and other indicators. Strategic objectives and performance goals should facilitate prioritization and assessment for planning, management, reporting, and evaluation purpos es. Agencies should use strategic objectives to help decide which indicators are most valuable to provide leading and lagging information, monitor agency operations, show how employees contribute to the organization' s mission, determine program evaluation s needed, communicate agency progress, and consider the impact of external factors on the agency 's progress. The set of all agency strategic objectives together should be comprehensive of all agency activity. Objectives are usually outcome-oriented to reflect core mission and service related functions; however, stewardship and other objectives may be established to communicate the breadth of agency efforts. Strategic objectives may be described in strategic plans and on Performance.gov as: Mission / Service Focused. A type of strategic objective that expresses more specifically the path an agency plans to follow to achieve or make progress on a single strategic goal. Mission focused strategic objectives typically reflect the core functions and act ivities of the agency based on statute or leadership priorities, and which serve to drive their efforts in addressing pressing relevant national problems, needs, and challenges. For programs which deliver direct services to customers, this may also include the objective of providing a good experience for customers, and is therefore Service Focused. Service Focused objectives should be considered as those activities that reflect the interaction(s) between individual citizens or businesses and Federal agencies in providing a direct service on behalf of the Federal Government, and which is core to the mission of the agency . Mission / Service Focused (Crosscutting/Other). A type of strategic objective that is not directly tied to a single strategic goal, but may be tied to several or none. In some circumstances agencies perform statutory or crosscutting activities which are not closely tied to a single strategic goal. Mission Support / Management- Focused. A type of strategic objective that communicates and reflect s the agenc y's improvement priorities for management functions which support organizational health and organizational performance, such as strategic human capi tal management, acquisition, information technology, cybersecurity, or financial management . Agency activities and responsibilities around stewardship to provide appropriate safeguards in executing mission and service related activities effectively and ef ficiently, including minimizing instances of waste, fraud, and abuse, may also be conveyed . Management objectives often support more than one strategic goal. Goal, Agency Priority (APG). A limited number of goals, usually 2- 8, identified by CFO Act agencies or as directed by OMB. An APG advances progress toward longer -term, outcome -focused goals in the SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 23 of Section 200 agency 's Strategic Plan, near -term outcomes, improvements in customer responsiveness, or efficiencies. An APG is a near -term result or achievement that leadership wants to accomplish within approximately 24 months that relies predominantly on agency implementation (as opposed to budget or legislative accomplishments). APGs reflect the top near-term performance improvement priorities of agency leadership, not the full scope of the agency mission. (See section 250 for Agency Priority Goals.) Goal, Performance. A statement of the level of performance to be accomplished within a timeframe, expressed as a tangible, measurable objective or as a quantitative standard, value, or rate. For the purposes of this guidance and implementation of the GPRA Modernization Act, a performance goal includes a performance indicator, a target, and a time period. The GPRA Modernization Act requires performance goals to be expressed in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form unless agencies in consultation with OMB determine that it is not feasible. In such cases an \" alternative form \" performance goal may be used. The requirement for OMB approval of an alternative form goal applies to performance goals only. Milestones are often used as the basis of an alternative form performance goal. Performance goals specified in alternative form must be described in a way that makes it possible to discern if progress is being made toward the goal. Example Performance Goal: R educe the number of homeless veterans on any given night to 35,000 by June 2012. P erformance Indicator: Number of homeless veterans on any g iven night Target: 35,000 Time period: June 2012 Example \"Al ternative Form \" Performance Goal: Obtain an unmodified audit opinion on the agency 's financial statements at the by the end of FY 2017. P erformance Indicator: Audit opinion on the agency financial statements Target: Unmodified Time period: By the end of FY 2017 Goal Leader. The person designated by the agency head or COO to lead, oversee and be accountable for the implementation of an agency goal. A goal leader will lay out strategies to achieve the goal, manage execution, regularly review performance and make course corrections when needed. The agency 's goal leaders should be empowered to coordinate across the agency to improve performance. Government Corporation. A corporation owned or controlled by the Federal Government, as defined in section 103 of title 5, United States Code. GPRA. Refers to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. Note that the GPRA Modernization Act refers to the update of the law in 2010 . Human Capital Evaluation Framework. Underlies the three human capital evaluation mechanisms (e.g., HRStat, Audits, and Human Capital Strategic Reviews) to create a central evaluation framework that integrates the outcomes from each to provide OPM and agencies wi th an understanding of how human capital policies and programs are supporting missions. More information can be found at OPM 's website for Human Capital Management . Human Capital Operating Plan (HCOP). An agency 's human capital implementation document, which describes how an agency will execute the human capital elements stated within the Agency Strategic Plan (SP) and Annual Performance Plan (APP). The Chief Human Capital Officer establishes the HCOP and updates it annually, in collaboration with the agency 's senior management team. The HCOP operates on the same annual cycle as the agency APP in order to identify and focus on the human capital goals and measures SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 24 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) that need to be implemented each year to achieve the strategic goals set forth over the course of the SP. Effective April 11, 2017, pursuant to revised Federal regulations (5 C.F.R. 250 Subpart B), each agency must develop and update the HCOP in alignment with GPRAMA strategic and performance planning timelines. Indicator. A measurable value that indicates the state or level of something. Categories of Indicators: For the purposes of this guidance and the Performance.gov data standards, two categories of indicators are distinguished, performance indicators and other indicators. 1. Performance Indicator. The indicator for a performance goal or within an Agency Priority Goal statement that will be used to track progress toward a goal or target within a timeframe. By definition, the indicators for which agencies set targets with timeframes are performance indicators. 2. Other Indicator. Indicators not used in a performance goal or Agency Priority Goal statement but are used to interpret agency progress or identify external factors that might affect that progress. By definition, indicators that do not require targets and timeframes are other indicators. Types of Indicators: Various types of indicators (e.g. outcome, output, customer service, process, efficiency) may be used as either performance indicators or other indicators. Agencies are encouraged to use outcome indicators as performance indicators where feasible and appropriate. Agencies also are encouraged to consider whether indicators have been validated through research conducted to be well correlated with what they are intended to measure. Some examples of types of indicators in alphabetical order include, but are not limited to: Indicator, Contextual. Data that provides situational information for the purpose of understanding trends or other information related to a goal or a program. Examples could include data about warning signals, unwanted side effects, external factors the government can influen ce, or external factors where the government may have a limited effect. Indicator, Customer Experience. A type of measure that indicates or informs the improvement of government 's interaction with those it serves or regulates. Indicator, Efficiency. A type of measure, specifically, a ratio of program activity inputs (such as costs or hours worked by employees) to its outputs or outcomes. Efficiency indicators reflect the resources used to achieve outcomes or produce outputs. Measuring the cost per unit of outcome or output tends to be most useful for similar, repeated practices. In other circumstances, it tends to be more useful to find effective practices and then look for lower cost ways of delivering them. Indicator, Input. A type of measure that indicates the consumption of resources, especially time and/or money, used. Indicator, Intermediate Outcome. A type of measure that indicates progress against an intermediate outcome that contributes to an ultimate outcome, such as the percentage of schools adopting effective literacy programs, compliance levels, or the rate of adoption of safety practices. Intermediate outcome indicators are especially helpful if they are based on strong SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 25 of Section 200 theory and have been validated through research to have a strong positive correlation with the ultimate outcome desired. Indicator, Process. A type of measure that indicates how well a procedure, process or operation is working, (e.g., timeliness, accuracy, fidelity or completeness). Indicator, Outcome. A type of measure that indicates progress against achieving the intended result of a program. Indicates changes in conditions that the government is trying to influence. Indicator, Output. A type of measure, specifically the tabulation, calculation, or recordi ng of activity or effort, usually expressed quantitatively. Outputs describe the level of product or activity that will be provided over a period of time. While output indicators can be useful, there must be a reasonable connection, and preferably a stro ng positive correlation, between outputs used as performance indicators and outcomes. Agencies should select output indicators based on evidence supporting the relationship between outputs and outcomes, or in the absence of available evidence, based on a clearly established argument for the logic of the relationship. Inherently Governmental. An inherently governmental function, as defined in section 5 of the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act, Public Law 105 -270, means a function that is so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by Federal Government employees. Additional guidance is available at Performance of Inherently Governme ntal and Critical Functions . The application of the term inherently governmental for functions described in the legislation does not change from the 1993 GPRA legislation to the 2010 GPRA Modernization Act. The preparation of agency Strategic Plans, Annual Performance Plans, and Annual Performance Reports is considered an inherently governmental function. COOs, PIOs, and Deputy PIOs must be Government employees, but contractors may provide support to these officials in executing their functions. I ntende d Use. The concept implied by 'intended use' of data in the GPRA Modernization Act allows agencies to set expectations for data accuracy levels appropriate to the specific purpose for which the information will be used. Agencies should consider the intended use of data, and potential value of reusing the data for statistical purposes, to determine the level of accuracy needed and to manage data collection costs. Agencies can calibrate the accuracy of the data to the intended use of the data and the cost of improving data quality. At the same time, agencies should consider how data limitations can lead to inaccurate performance assessments. Examples of data limitations include 1) imprecise measurement and recordings, 2) incomplete data, 3) inconsistencies in data collection procedures and 4) data that are too infrequently collected to allow for adjustments of agency action in an effective way. The ' intended use ' of evidence concept implies that high -stakes decisions should be based on a preponderance of evidence developed using sound methods when feasible. For example, when making a decision about approving a drug, the agency will need a high level of credibility and precision in the portfolio of evidence on which they are basing the decision. This may require multiple randomized controlled trials assessing the effectiveness and safety of the drug within the portfolio of evidence. However, decisions about how to improve the outreach of a given program may not require the same level of precision or as large of a portfolio of evidence. Machine Readable Format. Format in a standard computer language (not English text) that can be read automatically by a web browser or computer system. (e.g., xml). Traditional word processing documents, hypertext markup la nguage (HTML) and portable document format (PDF) files are easily read by humans but typically are difficult for machines to interpret. Other formats such as extensible markup language (XML), (JSON), or spreadsheets with header columns that can be exported as comma separated values (CSV) are machine readable formats. It is possible to make traditional word processing documents and other formats machine readable but the documents must include enhanced structural elements. SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 26 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Management Function. Describes offices or activities within agencies that support the agency divisions delivering programs that more directly advance mission. These functions tend to be common across agencies (e.g., financial, human capital, acquisition, information technology, perform ance management, risk management, legal, communication, intergovernmental). Major Management Challenge. Programmatic or management functions, within or across agencies, that have greater vulnerability to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement (such as issues the Government Accountability Office identifies as high risk or issues that an Inspector General identifies) where a failure to perform well could seriously affect the ability of an agency or the Federal Government to achieve its mission or goals. Major Operating Unit. The organizational unit of an agency or department at which F rameworks for Organizational Health and Organizational Performance will be developed and applied in implementing the requirements outlined in OMB Memorandum M -23-15 , M easuring, Monitoring, and Improving Organizational Health and Organizational Performance in the Context of Evolving Agency Work Environments. The designation of major operating units for implementing Organizational Health and Organizational Performance Framework requirements s hould be done by agencies as a reflection of their distinctive missions and unique histories and organizational structures . For example, as the principal subordinate organizational unit, a bureau, or component office of an agency may be designated as a major operating unit for the development of an Organizational Health and Organizational Performance framework. M easure. See indicator. Milestone. A scheduled event signifying the completion of a major deliverable or a phase of work that, when completed, significantly contributes to the goal 's overall achievement . Milestones are generally used to convey progress towards goal accomplishment qualitatively. Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO). A formal announcement of the availability of Federal funding through a financial assistance program from a Federal awarding agency that provides information on the award, who is eligible to apply, the evaluation criteria for selection of an awardee, required components of an appl ication, and how to submit the application . Objective. See goal. Organizational Health. A n organization' s ability to drive performance results collectively in support of its mission, deliver programs and services, and meet stakeholder needs and priorit ies on an ongoing basis. An organization' s health may include considerations such as resilience, capability, and capacity . Organizational Performance. An organization' s effectiveness in delivering mission -aligned results. Effectiveness and results can be measured by a range of indicators and evidence, both internal and external to the organization. Organizational Health and Organizational Performance Framework. A set of validated indicators that can be routinely measured, tracked, and assessed, with which an organization' s senior leadership, managers, front-line supervisors, workforce, and stakeholders can monitor the organization 's effectiveness and ability (including resilience, capability, and capacity) to perform and adapt. An effective organizational health and organizational performance framework can inform agency decisions regarding a variety of factors, including empowering agency leaders and managers to make, monitor, and assess changes in the organization' s work environment . SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 27 of Section 200 Output. Quantity of products or services delivered by a program, such as the number of inspections completed or the number of eligible clients completing a job training program . Outcome. The desired results of a program. For example, while the number of eligible clients completing a job training program is an output, an increase in long-term employment would be an outcome of the program. In another example, an outcome of a nation- wide program aimed to prevent the transmission of HIV infection might be a lower rate of new HIV infections in the U.S. Agencies are strongly encouraged to set outcome -focused performance goals to ensure they apply the full range of tools at their disposal to improve outcomes and find lower cost ways to deliver. However, there are circumstances where the effects of a program on final outcomes are so small and confounded with other factors that it may be more appropriate to base performance goals on indicators or intermediate outcomes. Ideally, those indicators and intermediate outcomes should have strong theoretical and empirical ties to final outcomes. Performance and Accountability Report (PAR). A combined annual report of the Ag ency Performance Report (APR) and Agency Financial Report (AFR). The report contains the agency 's audited financial statements and information on efforts to achieve goals during the past fiscal year. The AFR, combined with an APR pursuant to the GPRA Modernization Act , serves as an option for select agencies as designated by the OMB Director for reporting the agency 's end of fiscal year status through the consolidated Performance and Accountability Report. (See section 200.2 for information on the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000, and 240 on Annual Performance Reporting.) Performance Improvement Council (PIC). The PIC consists of Performance Improvement Officers from the 24 CFO Act agencies and other agencies and is chaired by the Chief Performance Officer and Deputy Director for Management at OMB or the Associate Director for Performance and Personnel Management as the designee. The purpose of the Council is to develop recommendations relating to performance management policies, requirements, and criteria for analysis of program performance. In addition, the Council is r esponsible for facilitating the exchange of performance management information among agencies to accelerate improvements in program performance. The Council also coordinates and monitors continuous reviews of the performance and management of Federal programs. Performance Management. Use of goals, measurement, evaluation, analysis, and data-driven reviews to improve results of programs and the effectiveness and efficiency of agency operations. Performance management activities often consist of plannin g, goal setting, measuring, analyzing, reviewing, identifying performance improvement actions, reporting, implementing, and evaluating. The primary purpose of performance management is to improve performance and then to find lower cost ways to deliver eff ective programs. Performance.gov. W eb -based system that include s information on the performance and associated management initiatives of the Executive Branch designed to improve organizational performance and program service delivery. As the Government -wide performance website required under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Performance.gov encompasses the Federal Performance Plan of the current Administration, with continued enhancements being made for inclu ding more agency -specific detail and performance information in accordance with the GPRA Modernization Act. Po rtfolio. A strategically structured, organized grouping of programs, activities, resources, or other efforts whose coordination and coherence in implementation enables the achievement of agency goals and objectives. Agencies will group programs and associated activities into portfolio in a manner that will best enable effective management and oversight of the portfolio. Portfolio Manager. A senior official, typically at the Assistant Secretary or Bureau Administrator level, responsible for defining the vision and roadmap for a logical, coordinated grouping of programs or systems. SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 28 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) The Portfolio Manager principally focuses on the high-level, executiv e aspects of managing programs throughout the portfolio, and addresses such key strategic areas as long -term financial health and resource requirements, policy considerations and direction, risk management, stakeholder management, and the impact of environmental factors on the portfolio 's effectiveness to achieve the agency 's overall mission and objectives. Program. Generally, an organized set of activities directed toward a common purpose or goal that an agency undertakes or proposes to carry out its responsibilities. Within this broad definition, agencies and their stakeholders currently use the term \" program \" in different ways. Agencies have widely varying missions and achieve these missions through different programmatic approaches, so differences in the use of the term \"program \" are legitimate and meaningful. For this reason, OMB does not prescribe a superseding definition of \"program \"; rather, consistent with the GPRA Modernization Act, agencies may identify programs consistent with the manner in which the agency uses programs to interact with key stakeholders and to execute its mission. (See section 270 on Program and Project Management .) Program Activity. Activities or projects listed in the program and financing schedules of the annual budget of the United States Government. For the purpose of preparing an Annual Performance Plan, an agency may aggregate, disaggregate, or consolidate program activities, except that any aggregation or consolidation may not omit or minimize the significance of any program activity constituting a major function or operation for the agency. Program Evaluation. See Evaluation. Program Management. The coordinated application of general and specialized knowledge, skills, expertise, and practices to a program for effective implementation. Effective program management requires program s be managed by both individuals and organizations as whole that work in concert to achieve benefits and advance outcomes towards the accomplishment of the agency mission, goals, and objectives. Project. A temporary endeavor to create a unique product or service with a start date, a completion date, and a defined scope. Projects are executed in a manner to improve the efficient and effective implementation of programs and contribute to or aligned with agency goals and objectives . Project Management. The coordinated application of general and specialized knowledge, skills, expertise, and practices to a project to achieve its stated goals and outcomes. Reasonable Administrative Burden. The concept of reasonable administrative burden is related to decisions about the frequency and granularity of reporting performance in the GPRA Modernization Act. It refers to considering the cost compared to the benefit of reporting information more frequently or at a more disaggregated level. Because it is not uncommon for more frequent or more granular data to have a higher benefit yet also a higher cost, agencies should increase the frequency and granularity of their performance reporting when the expected value justifies the estimated cost. Regulatory Review. The process by which agencies identify and review existing regulations in order to eliminate those that are obsolete, unnecessary, burdensome, or counterproductive or to modify others to increase their effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility. Executive Order 13563 cal ls for periodic review of existing significant regulations, with close reference to empirical evidence. Such reviews may be incorporated into the annual strategic review of objectives, as appropriate. Retrospective analyses conducted, including supporting data, should be released online wherever possible. Consistent with the commitment to periodic review and to public participation, agencies should continue to assess its existing regulations to the extent that review findings specify that a particular regulation, or its language, is impeding progress of achieving the strategic objective. SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023) Page 29 of Section 200 Risk Management. Coordinated activities to direct and control challenges or threats to achieving an organization' s goals and objectives. A risk management process is a systemat ic application of management policies, procedures and practices to the activities of communicating, consulting, establishing the context, and identifying, analyzing, evaluating, treating, monitoring and reviewing risk. (See also \" Enterprise Risk Management \"). Risk Profile. The agency 's risk profile provides a thoughtful analysis of the risks an agency faces towards achieving its strategic objectives arising from its activities and operations, and identifies appropriate options for addressing significant risks. See OMB Circular No. A-123. Statistical Activities. The term \" statistical activities,\" per 44 U.S.C. 3561(10) , (A) means the collection, compilation, processing, or analysis of data for the purpose of describing or making estimates concerning the whole, or relevant groups or components within, the economy, society, or the natural environment; and (B) includes the development of methods or resources that support those activities, such as measurement methods, models, statistical classifications, or sampling frames. Statistical activities include the use of data to describe outcomes and descriptors of interest, such as through estimates of population characteristics, summaries of test results, indices of economic activity, measures of environmental conditions, and incidence rates for a wide range of events. They may include relative measures amon g subgroups, geographies, and time periods, as well as relationships among measured variables. They also include a wide range of analytic applications, such as research reports, program evaluations, and experiment -based program studies. Finally, they encom pass transparency and accountability efforts, such as scorecards, that provide Federal agencies, State and local governments, and the public with information on the relative performance of different programs, providers, and systems . Statistical Purposes . The term \" statistical purpose, \" as defined by 44 U.S.C. 3561(12) , ( A) means the description, estimation, or analysis of the characteristics of groups, without identifying the individuals or organizations that comprise such groups; and (B) includes the development, implementation, or maintenance of methods, technical or administrative procedures, or information resources that support the purposes described in (A). Statistical purposes include the use of data to better understand the characteristics, behavior, or needs of groups of people, businesses or organizati ons. But they do not include the description of or decision-making about individual people, businesses or organizations . Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan presents the long-term objectives an agency hopes to accomplish, set at t he beginning of each new term of an Administration. It describes general and longer -term goals the agency aims to achieve, what actions the agency will take to realize those goals and how the agency will deal with the challenges likely to be barriers to achieving the desired result. An agency 's Strategic Plan should provide the context for decisions about performance goals, priorities, and budget planning, and should provide the framework for the detail provided in agency annual plans and reports. (See section 230 on strategic planning.) Strategic Review. An agency 's management process (or set of processes) that synthesizes available performance information and other evidence, including evaluations, to assess progress on its strategic objectives, in consultation with OMB. (See section 260 on strategic reviews.) Target. Quantifiable or otherwise measurable characteristic typically expressed as a number that tells how well or at what level an agency or one of its components aspires to perform. In setting and communicating targets, where available, agencies should include the baseline value from which the target change is calculated. SECTION 200 \u2014OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK Page 30 of Section 200 OMB Circular No. A-11 (2023 ) Vision Statement. A strategic planning best practice, a Vision statement is one that articulates an agency 's desired future state in terms of st rategic direction. An agency 's Vision statemen t helps create an image in the mind of readers and stakeholders that expresses what the organization wants to achieve while generating momentum for action on the part of the agency to accomplish the vision . Work Environment. The combination of: personnel policies; talent and workforce performance management strategies; workforce capacity, workloads, and work schedules; design of workspaces and workplaces; supportive and assistive technology tools for individual and collaborative work; and integration of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility principles across management practices and processes. Among other factors (e.g., resource allocation, workforce availability, and policy or statutory constraints), work environments can impact organizational health and, in turn, organizational performance . 200.25 Example Illustration of Goal Relationships 200.26 Performance Timeline and Management Calendar Performance Timeline.

SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING Page 2 of Section 210 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Summary of Chang es Standardizes and clarifies the actions agencies may propose for modifying a plan or report because it is outdated, duplicative, or unnecessary in support of the Elimination of Unnecessary Plans and Reports listing. PUBLIC REPORTING AND PERFORMANCE.GOV 210.1 To which agencies does this section apply? This section applies to all agencies, as defined in the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. This fiscal year: Agencies that were required to identify Agency Priority Goals (large , CFO Act agencies) will develop performance information for Performance.gov this year, and must follow all sections of this guidance. Al l other agencies ( non-CFO Act agencies) subject to the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 that were not required to establish Agency Priority Goals are required to follow all sections except 210.11 and 210.12. 210.2 What is the purpose of this section ? This section provides information on publishing performance information through a central website, as required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires: Availability of an agency Strategic Plan, Annual Performance Plan and Report, and performance updates through a central, Government -wide website. Quarterly updates via a central, Government-wide website on Agency Priority Goals and Cross- Agency Priority Goals. Availability of information on programs and management initiatives identified by agencies or the Administration on a central website. OMB 's approach to managing Performance.gov: Allows agencies to focus limited resources on the implementation of strategic plans, strategic reviews, and efforts to achiev e progress on Priority Goals ; Maintains effective, efficient, and transparent ways to report agency performance information; Maintains cross-agency collaboration via the Performance Management Line of Business (PMLOB) with the General Services Administration . 210.3 What is the purpose of Performance.gov? Performance.gov i s a website that serves as the public window into Federal agencies ' efforts to deliver a smarter, leaner, and more effective government. The site informs the public of the progress underway to SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 210 cut waste, streamline government, and improve performance through consolidating performance and strategic planning and reporting of the Federal Government 's goals and updates of performance progress in key, priority management areas of focus . Performance.gov is the performance website required under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. A centralized website makes information about Federal cross- agency and agency -specific goals and performance of priorit ies and initiatives easier for the public, Congress, delivery partners, agency employees, and other stakeholders to find. It also supports coordination and decision- making to advance shared goals. Through this central website, agencies also publish other required agency inf ormation, such as program information, within the Federal context of agency missions, goals, and performance management . 210.4 How does a Presidential transition year affect the timing of agency performance plans, reports, and other information that is included on Performance.gov? The performance planning and reporting cycle for most years strongly encourage s agencies to consolidate their Annual Performance Plan with their Annual Performance Report (see s ection 240). However, consistent with the intent of the GPRA Modernization Act to align strategic and performance planning to election cycles, in the event that a Presidential election leads to a change in Administration agencies should separate the reporting of performance under the outgoing Administration from the planning to be conducted by the incoming Administration. Specifically, agencies should: Publish the APR and final reports for Agency Priority Goals (APGs) prior to the transition to the new Administration. Publish the APP with the first full President' s Budget of the new Administration. Agencies must still produce and submit to OMB their draft APP and APR documents for review, collaboration, and deliberation through the Budget process that begins each September following the timelines established in s ection 200 . 210.5 What information is available on Performance.gov? Pursuant to the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Performance.gov communicates information on the Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal s, Agency Priority Goals (APGs), A gency Strategic Plans, Annual Performance Plans, Annual Performance Reports, and other initiatives or efforts that support priority management or policy areas. The site consolidat es and centralizes strategic and performance plans and reports for both large CFO -Act agencies in addition to other, non-CFO Act agencies. The site also display s agency strategic objectives and priority goals topically organized by theme (i.e., National Defense, International Affairs, Transportation , General Government, etc.), enabling visitors to search strategic objectives and priority goals by both agency and theme. The evidence planning or reporting documents that are aligned with the strategic planning process, including agency Learning Agendas and Annual Evaluation Plans, are also included on Evaluation.gov. The content table in this section ( 210.19) outlines the specific content , data, and informational elements required for plans and reports published by agencies and made available through Per formance.gov. 210.6 How do agencies ensure their Agency S trategic Plan, Agency Performance Plan, and Agency Performance Report are made available on Performance.gov, and communicate their publication status to OMB ? Federal agencies should produce for public release their final Strategic Plans, Annual Performance Plans, Annual Evaluation Plans, and Annual Performance Reports in PDF format using their existing processes and publication procedures . Once cleared, agencies shall make these plans and reports available on their SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING Page 4 of Section 210 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) individual agency website per sect ion 210.8, and provide a hyperlink for display on Performance.gov by emailing OMB 's Performance Team at performance@omb.eop.gov . Th is hyperlink will link to the agency 's public website where the agency has published current and past performance plans and reports. The email to OMB , with hyperlink to the agency 's public website by the agency PIO or designee, will also serve as notification of the plan/report' s publication . No te that f or the Annual Evaluation Plan, the agency must also provide the hyperlink to the OMB Evidence Team at evidence@omb.eop.gov for posting on evaluation.gov. 210.7 How do agencies ensure their Learnin g Agendas, Annual Evaluation Plans, and Capacity Assessments for Statistics, Research, Evaluation, and Other Analysis are made available on Evaluation.gov and communicate their publication status to OMB ? Federal agencies should produce for public release their final Learning Agendas, Annual Evaluation Plans, an d Capacity Assessments in PDF format using their existing processes and publication procedures. Once cleared, agencies shall make these plans and reports available on their individual agency website per section 290, and provide hyperlinks for display on Evaluation.gov using the online form made available by the OMB 's Evidence Team for this purpose, as well as emailing OMB 's Evidence Team at evidence@omb.eop.gov. These hyperlinks will link to the agenc y's published document as well as the website where the agency has published current and past evidence planning documents and reports. The form submission and email to OMB, by the agency evaluation officer ( EO) or designee, will also serve as notification of the plan/report' s publication . 210.8 How are agency -specific plans and reports made available to the public on the agency 's website? To enhance transparency of performance data, all Federal agencies should make information, including prior plans and reports, as easy as possible to locate from the agency 's individual website (e.g., www.usda.gov ). Federal Agencies must also provide a hyperlink on Performance.gov to the agency 's public website (e.g., https://www.usda.gov/our -agency/about-usda/performance ) wh ere the agency has published current and past performance plans and reports. In adherence to OMB Memorandum M - 17-06 , agencies must create a prominent link directly to their performance plans and reports from their \" About Agency \" or \" About Us \" page, which is directly off of the agency 's homepage. A gencies may also want to create links from this page to other planning and performance reporting documents, such as the human capital operating plans, information resources management plans, Annual Evaluation Plans, Agency Financial Reports or Performance and Accountability Reports, Congressional Budget Justifications, and other acquisition or capital asset management plans where those other documents are publicly available and relevant to performance on strategic objectives. Agency performance planning and reporting documents available on the agency website should be consistent with Administration policies and not include pre -decisional information. When developing performance information for publication, agencies should be open, transparent, and accountable for results of progress against stated performance goals and objectives, publishing information online consistent with the Federal Records Act, privacy and security restrictions, and other applicable law and policy including OMB Circular No. A -130, Managing Information as a Strategic Resource. It is important that agencies communicate relevant, reliable, and timely performance information within and outside their organizations to improve performance outcomes and operational efficiency. Ma chine -readable. Consistent with the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, information published through Performance.gov will be made available to the public in a machine-readable format . Documents posted on SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 210 Evaluation.gov will likewise be available in a machine-readable format . See section 240 for additional information on a n ongoing initiative to make agency performance plans and reports 'machine readable' with the Performance Management Cycle. 210.9 When will Performance.gov updates be published? Agencies should reference the timeline with approximate publication updates provided in s ection 200 . 210.10 May agencies publish their performance plans and reports in print ? A gencies should not incur expenses for the printing of the agency Strategic Plan, Annual Performance Plan or Annual Performance Report for release external to the agency, excep t when providing such documents to Congress, if Congress specifically requests a printed report. In these cases, agencies are encouraged to consider printing a copy of the electronically -published plan or report or leverage internal agency printing capabilities if already existent, rather than creating a special, professionally bound version which can be more expensive. Each agency will publish agency -specific plans and reports electronically on the agency 's website and must ensure the content is consistent with information published on Performance.gov. Ho wever, an agency may use information from the Strategic Plan, Annual Performance Plans or Annual Performance Reports to develop printed material about the agency for stakeholders or delivery partners i f there is a mission -advancing reason to do so and where the estimated benefits of such publication outweigh the estimated cost. Agencies are strongly encouraged to develop such materials electronically instead of printing when electronic distribution is possible and should develop printed materials only for targeted use . 210.11 Will agencies be required to update performance information on Performance.gov more frequently than annually ? Agencies that establish or contribute to Priority Goals on Performance.gov will continue to update information on a quarterly basis on Performance.gov until the end of the performance cycle, when they will be archived and remain available to the public (see 210.4 for reporting in the event of an Administration transition) . For any agency with lagging data related to APGs, the archived goals will remain open until such time that lagging data are available and updated. Agencies that contribute to the accomplishment of Cross-Agency Priority Goals will also report more frequently than annually, as coordinated by the Goal Leader, the Performance Improvement Council, and OMB pursuant to the GPRA Modernization Act . F EDERAL PROGRAM INVENTORY 210.12 What is the Federal Program Inventory (FPI) and what are the next steps agencies must take? T he GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (31 U.S.C. 1122) requires OMB to work with agencies to develop a single website that provides a \"coherent picture of all Federal programs, and the performance of the Federal Government as well as individual agencies.\" In late 2020 and early 2021 OMB worked with agencies on a pilot to test whether a consistent definition of \"program \" could accurately replicate several existing budget crosscuts. To see the results of the pilot , visit https://fpi. omb.gov/ . As a result of that effort, OMB recognized that substantial additional work is required to facilitate comparative analysis of similar activities within and across agencies. Based on the lessons learned from the pilot and the new statutory requirements, OMB is in the process of determining next steps towards building a Federal Program Inventory . SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING Page 6 of Section 210 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) To learn more about the lessons learned from the OMB pilot and a future vision for an inventory and plan to implement it, read OMB 's Federal Program Inventory Implementation Plan Report to Congress . ELIMINATION OF UNNECESSARY AGENCY PLANS AND REPORTS 210.13 What does the GPRA Modernization Act require with regard to the elimination of unnecessary agency reporting to Congress? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires that based on guidance provided by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Chief Operating Officer at each agency shall, annually: 1. Compile a list that identifies all plans and reports the agency produces for Congress, in accordance with statutory requirements or as directed in congressional reports (the full list should be readily available to OMB and Congress upon request); 2. Analyze the list compiled in accordance with bullet 1 above in order to identify which plans and reports are outdated or duplicative of other required plans and reports . Based on the agency 's analysis, refine the list to include only the plans and reports identified to be outdated or duplicative; 3. Consult with the congressional committees that receive the agency -proposed outdated or duplicative plans and reports to determine whether they could be eliminated or consolidated with other plans and reports; and 4. Provide a total count of plans and reports compiled in accordance with bullet 1 above, and the list of reported identified as outdated and duplicative to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget . 210.14 What information must agencies provide to OMB, if the agency has modification proposals for Congress? Agencies are required as a part of their Fall Budget submission to update their list of unnecessary reports. I n updating their annual list of unnecessary reports to be proposed for modification, agencies should examine the complete list of all plans and reports the agency produces for Congress (see section 210.15) to determine those that may be identified as outdated or duplicative. Previous report modification proposals submitted to OMB that remain unacted upon by the Congress provide a useful starting point to inform the initial development of agencies' current year submission, though should not constitute the agencies ' sole analysis in compiling this year 's list. Co ordinated with the Fall Budget submission each September, agencies are required to provide OMB with the following information on each congressionally -required plan or report modification proposal : Title of th e plan or report used by the agency when providing the plan or report to Congress; S tatute (or other congressional requirement citation) which mandates the agency to create the plan or report, and deliver it to Congress or the public; P roposed recommendation for modifying the plan or report . Agencies may propose one of four actions for modifying a plan or report because it outdated, duplicative, or unnecessary : SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 210 o Eliminate. Removes the agency's congressionally mandated planning or reporting requirement entirely . Content in the plan or report would no longer be delivered to the Congress or public if proposal was enacted ; o Consolidat e. Combines or merges the content in a plan or report with another existing plan or report . o Streamlining . Reduces the reporting volume or content that is required in the plan or report. o Reduced frequency. Decreases the frequency of the required submission of the plan or report to the Congress (e.g., annually instead of quarterly) ; J ustification for the Proposed Modification Action. A brief r ationale in support of the proposed modification action clearly explain ing why the report was identified as duplicative, outdated, or otherwise in need of modification (e.g., cost exceeds benefit) . Information that puts each plan or report modification proposal in its appropriate context and strengthens the rationale should also be provided as needed , including: frequency with which is it delivered to the Congress; t o whom it is delivered in the Congress; hyperlinks or copies of reports that are being proposed for m odification or elimination; or h yperlinks or copies of reports that are associated with the report being proposed for modification, such as a report that justifies that another plan or report is duplicative or a report for which content could be streamline d; and T otal count of all the plans and reports produced for Congress in accordance with statutory requirements or as directed in congressional reports. 210.15 W hat kind of agency reports should be proposed? Agencies should include agency -specific plans and reports that are usually reoccurring in nature, rather than one-time reporting requirements. A gencies should not include plans and reports that are required Government -wide by all agencies (e.g., strategic plans) among the modification or elimination proposals specific to their agency. Instead, OMB will consider recommendations submitted from agencies for streamlining such Government -wide documents in developing its list of modification proposals. In vettin g proposals before providing them to OMB, agencies ' analyses must consider previously enacted laws that may have eliminated the reporting requirements they are recommending for modifi cation , such as the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995, Public Law 104 -66. Ag encies shall not put forth report modification proposals that have already been acted upon to be eliminated or modified; doing so calls into quest ion the management processes and analyses used to inform the agencies ' revised listing submitted to OMB, and potentially delay s review and publication . 210.16 H ow will agencies provide the information to OMB ? For each annual update , agencies must follow instructions for submitting proposals to OMB as outlined in the detailed steps and templates that are posted each year on the Elimination of Unnecessary Agency Reporting MAX Community pa ge. Available from OMB 's central Performance Portal on MAX Community , the Elimination of Unnecessary Agency Reporting p age is updated as applicable for each submission cycle with information needed to facilitate agency submissions and OMB review and coordination of modification proposals to be published with the Budget that year. F or each annual update submitted to OMB, t he point of contact who is assigned by the COO to coordinate the agency 's submission must email official notification to performance@omb.eop.gov t hat the COO has approved the agency 's submission by including the following: SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING Page 8 of Section 210 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) A confirmation that the agency 's proposed list of modific ations to agency reports was validated by the agency and approved by the COO; An agency email address to which public inquiries may be directed on the proposed list; and; A notification as to when the agency consulted Congress on the agency 's proposals . 210.17 What if our agency has few congressional reporting requirements or no new proposals since the last time we submitted information to OMB? When requested, the agency should review the complete list of all plans and reports the agency produces for Congress to determine those that may be identified as outdated or duplicative, in addition to reviewing the previously -published modification list that is pre-populated in MAX to identify any plans and reports that have been eliminated or modified by Congress. The agency must remove modification proposals that have been addressed and acted on by Congress. The agency may choose to resubmit proposals that have not yet been addressed. If the agency has no new proposals, the agency point of contact who is assigned by the COO to coordinate the agency submission must notify the OMB at performance@omb.eop.gov t hat the agency Chief Operating Officer has confirmed that the previously -published list has been updated in MAX Collect as needed, and has approved no new modification proposals since the last time the agency provided a list to OMB. 210.1 8 Are agencies required to submit legislation? Any modifications of plans or reports that are required by appropriations legislation must be reflected in appropriations language modifications prepared for the purposes of publication of the President 's Budget. For all other modification proposals required by other congressional actions, agencies are encouraged to identify legislative vehicles that provide the opportunity to pursue legislation (or other congressional approval as required) on their list of modification pr oposals as appropriate; however, agencies are not required to do so. OUTLINE FOR ORGANIZING INFORMATION AND CONTENT IN STRATEGIC PLANS, ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, AND ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORTS 210.19 What information and content must agencies include when writing their Strategic Plans, Annual Performance Plans, and Annual Performance Reports for publication? Agency Strategic Plans (SP), Annual Performance Plans (APP), Annual Performance Reports (APR) , and Evidence Act deliverables are required to include common data and information elements when writing these plans. The table below establishes the common data and information elements , along with a detailed description of each element, that agencies mu st address and incorporate when writing and assembling agency Strategic Plans (SP), Annual Performance Plans (APP), Annual Performance Reports (APR) and Quarterly Performance Updates (QPU). Agencies are responsible for ensuring performance plans and report s posted to the agency website and made available to Performance.gov and Evaluation.gov are compliant with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

High level summary of the agency, which may include a description of core functions, organizational size, and key legislative authorities or initiatives. In order to illustrate the organization 's scope of responsibilities, the agency may include key data and narrative describing the number and kinds of people or businesses served, locations or characteristics of operation, and problems and opportunities addressed. SP / APP / APR 1.2 Mission Statement. The mission statement should be a brief, easy -to-understand narrative, usually no more than a sentence long. It defines the basic purpose of the agency and is consistent with the agency 's core programs and activities expressed within the broad context of nati onal problems, needs, or challenges. Mission statements enable the employees of an agency to see how their work contributes to the broader mission. Some agencies may also choose to include the mission statements of their major bureaus or components. SP / APP / APR 1.3 Vision and Value s. Some agencies opt to include vision or values statements. A strategic planning best practice, the vision statement articulates an agency 's desired future state in terms of strategic direction, express ing what the organization wants to achieve while generat ing momentum for action on the part of the agency to accomplish the vision . The values statement(s) articulate the beliefs that undergird the organization 's culture or framework for decision -making. On Performance.gov, the vision and values may be included in the overview section. Optional (strongly encouraged) 1.4 Organizational Structure.

A PR - Include the strategic goals to provide context for the prior year 's progress made on strategic objecti ves, performance goals, APGs and other indicators. SP / APP / APR 3.2 Strategic Goal Overview. In identifying each strategic goal, the agency should briefly describe the following in a level of detail appropriate for a long -term plan: The opportunity or problem being addressed by the strategic goal. This brief explanation could include demographic, geographic information, risks or other characteristics that inform priority setting and identification of causal factors (e.g., weather) th at influence outcomes. SP SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 210 Content Plan / Report Why the goals were selected including relevant background on the underlying reason for choosing each strategic goal, such as the problems necessitating the goal, opportunities being pursued, legislative mandates, and Presidential directives . 4.0 Strategic Objectives (Includes Mission, Management, Crosscutting and other objectives. See sections 200 and 230 for definitions and expanded discussion ). 4.1 Strategic Objective. Strategic objectives reflect the mission, service or stewardship outcome or impact the agency is trying to achieve and generally include the agency 's role. Strategic Objectives are tied to a set of performance goals and indicators established to help the agency monitor and understand progress against the Objective . Strategic objectives serve as the primary unit of analysis for agency and OMB assessment of how the agency is achieving its mission. Strategic objectives can support the agency in managing across goals and priority policy areas contributing to common outcomes. SP / APP / APR 4.2 Strategic Objective Overview. In discussing each strategic objective, the agency should briefly describe the following in a level of detail appropriate for the long- term plan: The opportunity or problem being a ddressed by the strategic objective and characteristics of the problem or opportunity, such as size and location. Why the objective was selected. SP 4.3 Strategies for Objectives. SP - Strategies generally reflect the unity of action and coherent coordination of resources, activities, personnel, and operational efforts for achieving Objectives. S trategies detailed in the SP for achieving Strategic Objectives should include a description of how programs and program activities, operational processes, human capital, training, skills, technology, information, data assets, and other resources that are critical to mission delivery are organized in a coherent and coordinated manner to achieve outcom es articulated by the Strategic Objective s. Strategies should also generally describe the agency actions planned to make progress on Strategic O bjectives, such as analysis of outliers, promising practices, and process improvement reforms. Key external or environmental factors should also be identifi ed and incorporated agencie s Strategies, including risks that could significantly affect the achievement of its objectives, distinguishing those beyond its control and those it seeks to influence. See 230.9. A PP - Identify how the agency will track progress on each objective using performance and other indicators. Identify external factors that may have influenced the agency 's progress on objectives in the past fiscal year. As new strategies are established in the annual performance plan, the agency should consider external factors. SP / APP 4.4 Strategic Objective Theme. For each Strategic Objective, agencies must identify a theme (s) that reflects the objective' s major purpose and outcome by topical categorization . SP / Performance.gov SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING Page 12 of Section 210 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Content Plan / Report 4.5 Contributing Programs and/or Program Activities for Strategic Objectives. Programs and program activities are often viewed as the princip al structure for organizing the funding requests, efforts, actions, and personnel for achieving the common purpose and goals of the program or program activity . In this context, program s and program activities then are the key organizing component that connects budget and funding requests with strategic and performance planning as part of the coordinated strategies for achieving strategic goals and objectives . Agencies then must clearly identify the programs and program activities that contribute to each strategic objective in order to strengthen and reinforce the soundness of their implementation strategies for objectives . As appropriate, agencies must also identify the organizations, regulations, tax expenditures, program activities, policies, and other activities that con tribute to each objective, both within and external to the agency. SP 4.6 Progress Update for Strategic Objectives. Each agency must include a brief narrative describing the achievements during the last fiscal year on the strategic objective , indicating where progress was made and where it was not, with an explanation of what worked and what did not. Challenges encountered during the last year should be described , along with plans or proposed actions for overcoming them where appl icable . An identification of the agency 's progress as either noteworthy or requiring focused improvement must be included in the narrative, with further explanation for the reasons for the characterization of progress. (See section 260 for details on characterizing progress and required language.) An agency may summarize progress made on performance goals or other indicators, but need not discuss each of them. An agency may also discuss trends, causal factors, promising practices, and findings from evaluatio ns or independent assessments. To keep the progress update brief, the agency should use hyperlinks or citations to supporting evidence, instead of including all the detail within the progress update. APR 4.7 Next Steps for Strategic Objectives. Each agency will s ummarize plans to make progress on strategic objectives for the next year, including prospects and strategies for performance improvement, and must include key milestones with planned completion dates. If a finding in the strategic reviews notes there is not enough evidence, describe evaluations or other studies planned as appropriate. Where possible the agency may describe plans to continue or expand what is working, develop or experiment to find promising practices, test the most promising practices to see if they can be replicated and validated, find or develop increasingly effective and cost -effective approaches, identify causal factors the Government can influence, and facilitate learning across delivery units . APP 4.8 Goal Leaders and/or Lead Office for Strategic Objectives. Each strategic objective shall have a Goal Leader (s) and/or Lead Office or Bureau/Component designated to oversee the implementation and execution of strategies necessary for goal achievement. Agencies will i dentify the agency of ficial' s title and the organization responsible for the achievement of each strategic objective, or Lead Office designated .

Performance.gov A PG Implementation Action Plan (Optional for A PP/APR) 5.3 APG Overview. Includes the problem opportunity being addressed by the APG, relationship to agency strategic goals and objectives, key barriers and challenges. An agency should highlight congressional input, if such input was relevant to setting a specific goal where appropriate. Performance.gov A PG Implementation Action Plan (O ptional for APP/APR ) 5.4 APG Goal Structure and Strategies. Each agency will summarize the APG Action Plan's leadership, implementation team, goal structure, and implementation strateg ies. As new strategies are established, the agency should take into consideration external factors it can influence and those it cannot. An agency should identify key factors external to the agency that significantly affect the achievement of its Agency Priority Goal, including those beyond its control . Performance.gov A PG Implementation Action Plan (O ption al for APP) 5.5 APG Indic ators and Milestones . Each APG is tracked through a suite of performance goals , indicators , and milestones. An agency should publish targets and actual results for each reporting perio d across the suite of indicators and milestones developed for tracking goal progress . Performance.gov A PG Implementation Action Plan (O ptional for APP/APR ) 5.6 APG Progress Update. Each agency will include a brief explanation of achievements during the last quarter on Performance.gov (or, for the last quarter of the year, a brief summary of accomplishments over the last fiscal year in the APR), as well as an identification of signifi cant challenges if any impeded progress on the APG. Because of their ambitious nature, all APGs face some risks with regard to the stretch targets set; therefore, agencies should include a description of significant risks of not achieving the planned level of performance, as appropriate. Performance.gov A PG Implementation Action Plan / APR SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING Page 14 of Section 210 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Content Plan / Report 5.7 APG Next Steps.

For each APG, agencies must identify a theme(s) that reflects the goal 's major purpose and outcome by topical categorization. Performance.gov (Optional for APP) 5.9 APG Contributing Programs and/or Program Activities . Programs and program activities are often viewed as the princip al structure for organizing the funding requests, efforts, actions, and personnel for achieving the common purpose and goals of the program or program activity, and which in turn, contribute to and support broader organizational goals and objectives in the agency strategic and performance plans. In this context, programs and program activities then are the key organizing component that connects budget and funding requests with strategic and performance planning as part of the coordinated strategies for achie ving strategic goals and objectives. Agencies then must identify the programs that contribute to each Agency Priority Goal. As appropriate , agencies must also identify the organizations, regulations, tax expenditures, program activities, policies, and other activities that contribute to each Agency Priority Goal, both within and external to the agency. Performance.gov A PG Implementation Action Plan (O ptional for APP) 5.10 APG Data Accuracy and Reliability .

Performance.gov A PG Implementation Action Plan (O ptional for APP) 6.0 Performance Goals 6.1 Performance Goal. SP - For each strategic objective included in the Strategic Plan, the agency will identify a limited number of examples of long- term performance goals. Details on long -term and annual performance goals need not be provided in the strategic plan, but instead should be i ncluded in the Annual Performance Plan and Annual Performance Report. A PP - The agency must establish performance goals, aligned to the agency 's objectives from the strategic plan, that contain a performance indicator, target and timeframe to define the level of performance to be achieved during the fiscal year in which the performance plan is submitted and the next fiscal year. Agencies should highlight if a performance goal addresses an ag ency major management challenge. Agencies may establish perform ance goals required by E.O. or OMB guidance and memoranda here, or in section 8 of this table below. A PR - The agency reports on progress made on performance goals . SP / APP / APR SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 15 of Section 210 Content Plan / Report 6.2 Actual Results. For all performance goals, performance indicators should compare actual performance with target levels of performance at least for the prior year and clarify if the target was met or not. For performance goals specified in an alternative form, the results will be described in r elation to such specifications. APP - the agency displays target data for every performance indicator for the current fiscal year and budget year in which the APP is being submitted in order to enable reporting of actual data in the APR upon the conclusion of the performance reporting period. APR - the agency displays actual results for performance indicators for at least the five preceding fiscal years, if available. Where useful, present trend data from its earliest point available even if the agency is publishing the performance indicator for the first time. It can, for example, be illuminating to show long - term trends, starting before a preventative government action was started, if the problem being addressed has since greatly diminished. Agencies do not need to present historic targets. APP / APR 6.3 Performance Targets. For each performance goal, the agency should establish targets for the current and upcoming fiscal year. APP 6.4 Performance Information Gaps. Identify where actual information for performance goals is missing, incomplete, preliminary, or estimated. Indicate the date when the actual information will be available. APR 6.5 Performance Goal Progress Update. Each agency will briefly explain the causes of variance or change in trends for the performance indicators, as well as whether or not the target was met. The agency may identify successful or promising practices relative to agency performance goals. The agency may describe where mid -year budget changes or delayed appropriations affected the agency 's targets or achievement of targets previously established for the full performance year. Where the agency is not making sufficient progress in meeting a performance goal, the agency will briefly address future improvement including why the performance goal was not met and plans for achieving it. If the performance goal is determined to be impractical or infeasible the agency should address in the explanation and plan why that is the case and what action is recommended APR 6.6 Changed Performance Goals and Indicators . Identify performance goals changed or dropped since publication of the Annual Performance Plan, as well as changed or dropped performance measur es, and the reasons for the changes. Such changes should be approved in consultation with OMB. APR 7.0 Other Indicators 7.1 Other Indicators.

APP / APR 8.0 Evidence Act Deliverables 8.1 Learning Agenda. Per the Evidence Act, agencies are required to include a multi - year Learning Agenda as part of their strategic plan. The Learning Agenda is a systematic plan for identifying and addressing policy questions relevant to the programs, policies, and regulation s of the agency. While agencies should include elements of their Learning Agenda s throughout the ir Strategic Plan s (e.g., in the narrative ), the Learning Agenda may be an appendix or separate chapter of, or a document referenced in and posted along with, the Strategic Plan. If an agency chooses to include the Learning Agenda as an appendix or separate, referenced document, the contents of the Learning Agenda must be summarized in the body of the Strategic Plan. Additional information about the requirements of the Learning Agenda is included in section 290. SP 8.2 Capacity Assessment. Per the Evidence Act, agencies are required to submit an assessment of the coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence of the statistics, evaluation, research and analysis efforts of the agency, as part of the Agency Strategic Plan. This as sessment, known as the Capacity Assessment for Statistics, Evaluation, Research, and Analysis (or Capacity Assessment), may be an appendix or separate chapter of, or a document referenced in and posted along with, the Strategic Plan. If an agency chooses to include the Capacity Assessment as an appendix or separate, referenced document , the contents of the Capacity Assessment must be summarized in the body of the Strategic Plan. Additional information about the requirements of the Capacity Assessment is inc luded in section 290. SP 8.3 Annual Evaluation Plan. Agencies must submit an Annual Evaluation Plan in conjunction with the Annual Performance Plan that describes the significant evaluation activities the agency plans to conduct during the fiscal year following the year in which the Annual Evaluation Plan is submitted, as described in the statute .

Section also i ncludes findings or summary of quarterly CX -data reporting, and offers an annual assessment derived from examining trends in agency 's quarterly CX -reporting that places CX-work in broader context of the agency 's organizational performance work to deliver services to the American public . 10.0 Other Information 10.1 Major Management Priorities and Challenges. If not integrated elsewhere within the agency 's presentation of strategic and performance goals and objectives in the strategic or performance plans and reports, a summary section should be included that describes or cross -reference the agency 's efforts to deliver greater impact through innovation, incr easing effectiveness and efficiency, and better customer service along with the agency official (title and office) responsible. Where a separate section of the plan or report is provided, this section should also highlight major management challenges -mana gement and programmatic issues and risks or areas that may have greater vulnerability to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement (such as issues identified by the GAO as high risk or issues identified by an Inspector General) or where a failure to perform could seriously affect the agency 's mission delivery and ability to achieve its goals. This summary section should also be used to reference where management priorities and challenges are addressed throughout the plan or report, as well as if an agency has determined they do not have major management challenges. SP - establish mission support and stewardship objective(s) ( see section 230). A PP - identify planned actions to address major management challenges or priorities; performance goals, indicators and/or milestones used to measure progress for the management challenges or priorities determined by the agency; and the agency official (title and office) responsible for resolving such challenges. Examples of management priorities and challenges that may be identified in this section, where not aligned to the discussion or identification of separate performance goals elsewhere in the Strategic Plan or APP, include: o Major management challenges and risks, including those on the GAO High -Risk List, or those areas identified by the IG and published in section 3/4 of the AFR/PAR. o Mission support and s tewardship objectives, if identified in the strat egic plan. o Agency -specific contributions to government -wide management initiatives, such as priorities or performance goals established through or in response to Executive Order or OMB Memoranda in specific management or policy areas . For example , M-21-22; M-21-20; M-20-21; M-20-03; / APP / APR SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING Page 18 of Section 210 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Content Plan / Report o Contribution to Cross -Agency Priority Goals . APR - describe progress made on management priorities and challenges that had been described in the Annual Performance Plan, such as results on stewardship objectives, performance goals and indicators that were established. 10.2 Cross -Agency C ollaborations. As a part of the discussion of strategies, or where applicable, describe how the agency is working with other agencies to achieve strategic objectives, APGs, and performance goals. Describe responsibilities of key agency programs and exter nal agency partners (e.g., other Federal programs, grantees; state, local, tribal, and foreign governments; major long- term contractors, etc.) and the nature of their expected contribution to strategic objectives. SP / APP / APR 10.3 Hyperlinks. Links or references to other more detailed plans, evaluations, or other studies to support the decisions and strategies described in the agency plan or report. SP / APP / APR 10.4 Data Validation and Verification. Include an assessment by the agency hea d of the reliability and completeness of the performance data included in the plan and report, preferably as an appendix that can be attached to performance plans and reports or hyperlinked to Performance.gov. The description must include how the agency e nsures the accuracy and reliability of the data used to measure progress towards its performance goals (including Agency Priority Goals), including an identification of \u2014 the means to be used to verify and validate measured values; the sources for the data; the level of accuracy required for the intended use of the data; any limitations to the data at the required level of accuracy; and how the agency will compensate for such limitations if needed to reach the required level of accuracy. The agency should summarize how the agency uses data to promote improved outcomes, including assessing the use and effectiveness of alternative form performance goals. Section 240 addresses approaches the agency should use to meet the data validation and verification requirement for both agency annual plans and annual reports. The agency may include an addendum that lists and briefly explains changes in performance indicators as c ompared to the prior year 's performance report. APP / APR 10.5 Lower -Priority Program Activities. Each agency must reference the President's Budget volume . \"The President 's Budget identifies the lower -priority program activities, where applicable, as required under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, 31 U.S.C. 1115(b)(10). The public can access the volume at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget. \" (See section 240 for more information on lower-priority program activities.) APP 210.20 How should agencies integrate a discussion of evidence and evaluation-building efforts from these plans when writing Strategic Plans, Annual Agency Performance Plan s, and Annual Agency Performance Reports for publication ? The Evidence Act established a number of requirements for agencies related to efforts to advance evaluation and evidence -building, including the Learning Agenda (i.e., Evidence -Building Plan) and Capacity Assessmen t as new components of the Agency Strategic Plan, and the creation of an Annual Evalua tion Plan. These d ocument s represent the agencies ' primary planning documents for detailing their efforts to SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 19 of Section 210 build and use evidence and conduct evaluation activities in a comprehensive, coordinated way across the agency . Importantly, the efforts and discussion detailing an agency 's evidence-building work complement and are mutually reinforcing to the agency 's organizational performance management and improvement efforts, establish ing organizational strategic objectives and priority goals in strategic and performance plans and reports , track ing and reporting on progress made against those objectives, discussing results achieved and barriers to performance, and identifying pr oposed actions or changes to implementation strategies wher e course corrections are needed, including identifying new or improved evidence. It is expected that agencies will necessarily need to integrate content and discussion from the Learning Agenda, Capacity Assessment, and Annual Eval uation Plan into the agency 's strategic and performance plans and reports when drafting these documents in order to create a coherent, cohesive narrative th at depict s the full complement of activities and efforts - both planned and implemented - to improve the organizational performance and program and service delivery of the agency. While the content table and information elements outlined in section 210.19 detail the required data elements for constructing the agency Strategic Plan, Annual Performance Plan, and Annual Performance Report, agencies must also effectively incorporate a discussion of evidence -building e fforts in these plans and reports where appropriate. The incorporation of information described in the Learning Agendas, Capacity Assessments, and Annual Evaluation Plans should ultimately articulate and reinforce those elements of the SP, APP, and APR in order to create a coherent, comprehensive picture of the agency 's organizational management and performance. Agencies have flexibility in terms of the organizational layout of their SP, APP, and APR in deciding how this narrative is incorporated within these documents. In addition, OMB Memorandum M - 21-27 pr ovides additional information about how evidence can and should be used to improve agency programs and operations across functions and areas. The following guidance is provided to a gencies in considering how to integrate the discussion and narrative of ideas of the Evidence Act plans into the SP, APP, and APR. SP - The agency should seek to describe how information from the full portfolio of evidence was used in developing the Strategic Plan, including how evaluation and research findings were used to establish or revise the agency 's strategic objectives and identify how effective strategies or approaches as determined by credible, high-quality evidence, will be used to reach these objectives. Importantly, the Evidence Act modified the requirements for agency Strategic Plans and requires that Strategic Plans include a \" description of the program evaluations used in establishing or revising general goals and objectives, with a schedule for future program evaluations to be conducted, and citations to relevant provisions of the plans [Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan] required under Section 312. \" While agency strategic plans were previously required to describe how program evaluation supported development of goals, t he Evidence Act provides another link between these new evidence-building plans (i.e., the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan), and the agency Strategic Plan, and requires an agency 's strategic planning narratives to reference activities i n its evidence-building plan. 5 U.S. Code \u00a7 306 (a)(8) . In addition, agencies should consider how the findings and analysis from the Capacity Assessment can inform their Strategic Plan, particularly as they consider their agency 's capacity to address key strategic objectives and goals. Other examples of evidence to be included are program reviews performed under OMB Circu lar No. A-129 for credit programs, performance measures, foundational fact - finding , secondary research from a comprehensive literature review, policy analysis, and program evaluation . Also see section 290.9. APP - The agency should seek to describe how evidence, including from program evaluation and other methods, was used to develop the performance plan , including infor mation from the Learning Agenda, Capacity Assessment, and Annual Evaluation Plan, as appropriate . This description should SECTION 2 10\u2014PUBLIC REPORTING Page 20 of Section 210 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) include how a portfolio of evidence w as used to establish or revise the agency 's performance goals; identify evidence -based strategies or approaches that will be used to reach these goals; provide an update on the agency 's progress toward these goals; and inform budgetary allocations using information about cost -effectiveness of agency efforts. The agency should be aware of and state the quality of the evidence cited and its relative strength in support of the decisions being made. Also see section 240.14 . APR - The agency should describe findings from agency-funded evaluations and other relevant evidence-building activities completed during the prior fiscal year, including those undertaken as part of the agency 's Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan. In addition, the agency should discuss any evidence related to its understanding of program performance, the problems the program a ims to address, and external factors that might influence agency performance. A gencies should articulate how findings from evaluations or other evidence -building activities were used in decision -making processes related to programs, policies, and budget ef forts. In citing evidence, the agency should address the relative strength of the evidence, and may consider adding such information to the data validation and verification appendix, as appropriate .

Updates guidance in the Equity sub-section based on Executive Order 1 4091 , Executive Order on Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government , including a revised definition of e quity , and resources to support the development of annual Equity Action Plans. Deletes guidance in the Sharing Quality Services sub -section explaining the relationship between the definition of core financial management to contract writing. THE PRESIDENT'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA (PMA) 220.1 What is the President 's Management Agenda (PMA) and how is it implemented? In general terms, a President 's management agenda identifies and establishes an Administration 's key management reform priorities and initiatives to be pursued and implemented for improving the ability of agencies to deliver mission outcomes, provide excellent service, and effectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people over time . Importantly, it communicates and organizes goals , objectives, and implementation strategies for reform priorities and initiatives across the Federal Government. To drive execution on these management priorities, the Administration leverages Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 to coordinate and publicly track implementation across Federal agencies. 220.2 How often is the PMA updated? Aligned to Administration transitions and implemented by leveraging the CAP Goals, the PMA is updated in conjunction with timelines established for updating or revising CAP Goals in accordance with the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. A PMA reflect ing current Administration policy and management priorities has been developed and is currently posted on Performance.gov. See section 220. 7 below. 220.3 Where can I find information on the PMA ? Information on the PMA can be found on Performance.gov , and is updated on a quarterly basis in conjunction with the quarterly performance updates for each CAP Goal. See section 220.8 . CROSS -AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS AND FEDERAL PERFORMANCE PLAN 220.4 To which agencies does this section apply? This section applies to all Executive Branch agencies. Agencies that contribute directly to Cross -Agency Priority Goals (CAP Goals) are identified by OMB and the CAP Goal Leader(s) . 220.5 What is a Cross-Agency Priority Goal (CAP Goal) ? Established by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Federal Government Priority Goals - more commonly referred to as Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals - are a tool used by leadership Government -SECTION 2 20\u2014THE PRESIDENT 'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA, CROSS-AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS AND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 220 wide to accelerate progress on a limited number of Presidential priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration among multiple agencies. CAP Goals are a subset of Presidential or PMA priorities and are complemented by other cross-agency coordination and goal -setting efforts. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires that the Federal Government set two types of CAP Goals (referred to as Federal Government priority goals in the GPRA Modernization Act): outcome -oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas; and management improvements across the Federal Government in the areas of information technology, financial management, human resources, procurement and acquisition, and real property. Cross-Agency Priority Goal s are identified in areas where increased cross-agency coordination on outcome - focused areas is likely to improve progress. 220.6 What is the Federal Performance Plan ? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires that the Federal Government Performance Plan define the level of performance to be achieved for each of the CAP Goals, including associated targets, action plan, goal leader, and contributing programs. The website Performance.gov m ake s available information on the CAP Goals, and provides the components of the Federal Performance Plan . The website will continue to be developed to provide information on agency performance in accordance with the GPRA Moder nization Act of 2010. 220.7 When are CAP Goals established and what time period do they span? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires CAP Goals to be made publicly available concurrently with the submission of the President 's Budget in the first full fiscal year following any year in which the term of the President commences. CAP Goals are required to be set every four years, but can address goals requiring longer timeframes. Performance targets and key implementation milestones will be reviewed and considered for updates at least annually with the President 's Budget. In accordance with the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, CAP Goals have been established to align with the President 's Management Agenda that was published and made available on Performan ce.gov in November, 2021. 220.8 Where can I find information on CAP Goals ? Performance.gov is updated on a quarterly basis for each CAP Goal . The website includes the information required by law, such as goal leader(s), contributing agencies, organizations, programs, targets, key milestones, major management challenges, and plans to address these challenges. Quarterly Performance Updates of progress for reporting to the website are provided by the goal leader in coordination with the Performance Improvement Council ( PIC), OMB, corresponding government -wide management (CXO) council s, and contributing agencies with coordination by the agency PIO as needed . 220.9 How does OMB engage with Congress and other partners in setting CAP Goals? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires OMB to consult the following congressional committees during the development of CAP Goals: SECTION 2 20\u2014THE PRESIDENT 'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA, CROSS-AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS AND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES Page 4 of Section 220 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Re presentatives; Budget of the Senate and the House of Representatives; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate; Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives; Finance of the Senate; Ways and Means of the House of Representatives; and Other committees as appropriate. OMB also work s closely with the President 's Management Council (PMC), the PIC, other G overnment - wide (CXO) councils, offices within the Executive Office of the President, and Executive Branch agencies to identify problems where cross- agency coordination could significantly improve performance . OMB outreach and consult ations with these stakeholders continues as implementation of the CAP Goals progresses, providing important feedback loops for staying on track to achieve goal outcomes. 220.10 What is the relationship between the CAP Goals and APGs ? While some Agency Priority Goals may be linked to CAP Goals either directly or indirectly, most APGs will focus on core agency missions and are not always tied directly to a CAP Goal. For the Government to make progress on its CAP Goals, OMB identifies government -wide councils (PMC, CXOs), contributing agencies, and programs under each goal to support and drive implementation efforts . In all cases, agencies and contributing programs that are responsible for making progress on CAP Goals will be required to contribute to the development of the overall action plan and clearly identify their respective agency contributions to the overall goal. The CAP Goal lea der will work with the corresponding government -wide management (CXO) council, OMB and agencies to determine each agency 's contribution to the overall plan. 220.11 How should agencies address CAP Goals in the agency Strategic Plan or a nnual Agency Performance Plan or a nnual Agency Performance Report? An agency that contributes to Cross-Agency Priority Goals must address this responsibility in the agency 's Strategic Plan, annual Agency Performance Plan (APP) , and a nnual Agency Performance Report (APR). In the APP/APR, a summary should highlight agency efforts to deliver greater impact through innovation, increasing effectiveness and efficiency, or better customer service along with the name of the agency official (title and office) responsible. (S ee section 210 Content table part \"Major Management Priorities and Challenges \"). This section of the APP/APR should highlight or cross reference the management issues most critical to the agency 's mission delivery which will include the agency 's contributions to the CAP Goals. In cases where a CAP Goal area represents a significant part of the agency 's mission delivery, the agency is encouraged to define an agency -specific strategic objective within the strategic plan and/or establish related agency -specific performance goals in the APP. The APP should identify planned actions, performance goals, indicators and/or milestones used to measure progress for contributions to CAP Goals. The APR describes progress made on CAP Goal priorities, such as results on performance goals and indicators that were established in the performance plans. In addition, an agency should include the following language: \" Per the GPRA Modernization Act requirement to address Cross-Agency Priority Goals in the agency strategic plan, the annual performance plan, and the annual performance report, please also refer to www.Performance.gov for more on the agency 's contributions to those goals and progress, where applicable .\" SECTION 2 20\u2014THE PRESIDENT 'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA, CROSS-AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS AND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 220 220.12 How will CAP Goals be managed? CAP Goal L eaders. Each Cross-Agency Priority Goal has at least two goal leader(s) from both the Executive Office of the President and key agencies who will manage the processes by which goals are executed and who will share accountability for progress. Goal leaders are encouraged to leverage existing structures as much as practicable in managing CAP Goals, (e.g., existing working groups, inter -agency policy committees, councils). Every CAP Goal will have an implementation team chaired by goal leaders and consisting of representatives from agencies contributing to the goal, OMB, and others as determined by the goal leaders to drive implementation strategies, activities, and efforts. As set out in s ection 200, CAP Goal leader(s) are officials named by the Director of OMB who will be held accountable for leading implementation efforts to achieve the goal. Goal leaders lay out strategies to achieve the goal, manage overall execution while identifying , where appropriate, a Deputy Goal Leader to oversee day -to-day operat ional activities of the CAP Goal, regularly review performance, engage others as needed, and make cours e corrections as appropriate. I mplementation Action Plans. Each implementation team develops an action plan explaining how the Federal Government will execute on the goal. The action plan will generally include a succinct goal statement; overview of challenges and opportunities; names of goal leaders and information on governance; contributing agencies and programs; goal strategies; performance measures and targets; and milestones. The action plan also includes a high-level progress update with anticipated risks or obstacles. Goal leaders will be responsible for ensuring the action plan is updated over the lifetime of the goal, at least quarterly, as experience is gained an d new information is learned. Regular Reviews of Progress. C onducting routine, data -driven performance reviews is a management practice proven to produce better results. CAP Goal leaders should run regular data-driven performance reviews to drive progress toward achieving the CAP Goal. Regular reviews occurring in-person or through virtual technology platforms provide a collaborative mechanism for CAP Goal leaders to review performance on the goal and bring together the people, resources, and analysis needed to drive progress on both mission- focused and management goals. Frequent data -driven performance reviews on CAP Goals focus contributing agencies on effective and efficient implementation to improve delivery. Frequent reviews provide a mechanism for CAP Goal leaders to keep contributing agencies focused on cross-cutting priorities. Teams come together to diagnose problems, identify opportunities through an analysis of data and experience, and decide on next steps to increase per formance and productivity. Section 260 includes more detailed guidance on best practices in conducting data -driven performance reviews. Reso urces to Support Implementation. Both the P IC, GSA, and various management Councils are available to advise CAP goal leaders and implementation teams on how best to apply these practices in the cross-agency context. CAP goal leaders should design a review approach tailored to the goal, taking into account nine leading practices that can be used to promote successful performance reviews, identified by the GAO in GAO-13-228 : Leaders use data-driven reviews as a leadership strategy to drive performance improvement. Key players attend reviews to facilitate problem solving. Reviews ensure alignment between goals, program activities, and resources. Leaders hold managers accountable for diagnosing performance problems and identifying strategies for improvement. There is capacity to collect accurate, useful and timely performance data. Staff have skills to analyze and clearly communicate complex data for decision making. Rigorous preparations enable meaningful performance discussions. Reviews are conducted on a frequent and regularly scheduled basis. SECTION 2 20\u2014THE PRESIDENT 'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA, CROSS-AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS AND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES Page 6 of Section 220 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Participants engage in rigorous and sustained follow -up on issues identified during reviews . 220.13 What information will be published on the CAP Goals ? Performance.gov is updated quarterly to reflect information on CAP Goals according to the GPRA M odernization Act of 2010 and with the intent of aligning priority goal setting with P residential election cycles. See section 200 for expected publication timeframes. CAP Goal leaders and teams work with contributing agencies to identify the information to be reported to Performance.gov. 220.14 H ow will OMB assess progress on CAP Goals? OMB conducts reviews on progress of the CAP Goals at least once per quarter. OMB , with support from the PIC , GSA, and other applicable G overnment -wide councils (CXOs) or governing structures, work with individual CAP G oal leaders to refine the review process for each CAP Goal, and coordinate with agencies, by goal, as needed. The decisions related to next steps for improving performance will be reflected in progress updates and next steps as published quarterly on Performance.gov. SHARING QUALITY SERVICES 220.15 What is the Sharing Quality Services (SQS) policy and what is required of agencies ? The Government strives to identify opportunities to improve stewardship of taxpayer dollars, to create high - performing, centralized capabilities for mission -support functions and to make more resources available for agency mission -specific work. In support of these efforts, the Federal strategy of sharing quality services was updated based on industry experiences, and lessons learned from other central governments, to reduce duplication, improve accountability, and improve Federal shared services. This initiative supports the delivery of an innovative, flexible, and competitive set of solutions and services. This strategy is outlined in OMB Memorandum M -19-16, C entralized Mission Support Capabilit ies for the Federal Government , which provides updated guidance detailing the process and desired outcomes for shared services for the Federal Government ; the process for designating Quality Services Management Offices (QSMOs); and establishes the governance and accountability model that will be used to engage customers and enable QSMO performance excellence including a Shared Services Governance Board (SSGB), the Business Standards Council (BSC) , and the SQS Senior Accountable Point of Contact (SAPOC) at each major agency . 220.16 What services fall under a pre -designated or designated QSMO that require QSMO and OMB approval for investment ? For a current list of pre-designated and designated services, please visit the shared services website located at https://ussm.gsa.gov/qsmo/ . Once an agency is pre-designated as a QSMO for a functional area, the QSMO begins preparing their 5 - year implementation plan to include detailed information about its proposed service offerings, acquisition strategy, and organizational structure. The implementation plan is reviewed against long -term designation criteria to help determine whether the agency is mature enough for full designation. Some agencies may have an immediate business need while the QSMO is trying to get fully functional and prior to the QSMO delivering a suite of solutions and assistance to new customers. Agencies who wish to SECTION 2 20\u2014THE PRESIDENT 'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA, CROSS-AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS AND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 220 make any investments towards a functional area covered under either a p re-designated or designated QSMO are subject to review and approval by the QSMO. If determined necessary by the agency, QSMO, or OMB , the agency and the QSMO will jointly develop an Investment Action Plan, also referred to as a joint business case, which must be approved by the agency 's CIO, SQS Senior Accountable Point o f Contact, QSMO, and OMB. The joint business case must demonstrate that a separate investment for these services will result in better value for the G overnment, timeline, and other appropr iate factors. More information on Investment Action Plan, also referred to as a joint business case, is available at https://ussm.gsa.gov/qsmo/ . 220.17 How are the QSMOs different than the current Federal providers? Legacy providers (service providers that pre -date M -19-16) traditionally offer one solution with varied flexibilities to respond to agency needs for technology and/or services or both. These legacy providers typically do not meet the standards outline d by the SQS Standards leads (https://ussm.gsa.gov/fibf) and should work to modernize their systems and solutions to meet the Federal standards. Additionally, legacy providers were sometimes housed in agencies whose missions were inconsistent with the services provided, limiting their capacity to scale, innovate , or implement fair governance models . QSMOs may offer multiple solutions for technology and services through partnerships with industry. They serve in the important role of integrating thos e solutions, conform to the new Federal standards (established by the SQS Standards lead), working with customers to ensure they have a voice and addressing the need for any requirements unique to Federal Government . QSMOs partner with legacy providers to determine their modernization strateg ies and timing for migrating to SQS Standards-compliant systems . A QSMO manages a marketplace of solutions for its designated service areas. Agencies must engage with their QSMOs to discuss their goals, business needs, and timelines. Deviations from using a QSMO 's services will require an approved Investment Action Plan, also referred to as a joint business case. CATEGORY MANAGEMENT 220.18 What is Category Management ? The term \" category management\" refers to the business practice of buying common goods and services as an organized entity to eliminate redundancies, increase efficiency, and deliver more value and savings from the Government 's acquisition programs. Teams of experts in each category of spending help agencies increase their use of common contract solutions and practices and bring decentralized spending into alignment with organized agency and Government -level spending strategies by sharing and using market intelligence, Government and industry best practices, prices paid data, and other information to facilitate informed buying decisions and improved vendor management strategies. With its focus on interagency collaboration and coordination, category management can help achieve key Administ ration priorities, including domestic sourcing and combatting climate change, by ensuring the many agency buying offices across the Federal Government offer sellers and supply chains clear and consistent demand signals and predictable work streams. SECTION 2 20\u2014THE PRESIDENT 'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA, CROSS-AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS AND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES Page 8 of Section 220 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 220.19 What is expected of agencies to implement Category Management? To implement category management, OMB requires agencies to carry out a set of tailored management actions and provide updates on these management actions to evaluate their progress in brin ging common spending under management. The expected result is more effectively managed contract spending through a balance of Government -wide, agency -wide, and local contracts; reduced unnecessary contract duplication and cost avoidance; and continued achievement of small business goals and other socioeconomic requirements. See OMB Memorandum M -19-13 , C ategory Management: Making Smarter Use of Common Contract Solutions and Practices, OMB Memorandum M - 22-03, A dvancing Equity in Federal Procurement , and OMB Memorandum M - 23-11, C reating a More Diverse and Resilient Federal Marketplace through Increased Participation of New and Recent Entrants , for more detailed guidance on the use of category management at agencies as well as requirements for developing and submitting Annual Category Management Plans to OMB . 220.2 0 Where can agencies find guidance for completing and submitting Annual C ategory Management P lans? OMB Memorandum M-19 -13 r equires agencies develop an annual Category Management Plan. These plans will detail agency actions to reduce unaligned spend and increase the use of Be st-In-Class solutions for common goods and services, consistent with small business and other statutory socioeconomic responsibilities. Ag encies are required to update and submit to OMB Annual C ategory Management Plan s. Additional guidance including content requirements, a template for developing Category Management Plans, and training is available on the Acquisition Gateway . EQUITY 220.21 What is Equity? Informed by Executive Order 14091 on Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government , the term \" equity \" means the consistent and systematic, treatment of all individuals in a fair, just, and impartial manner, including individuals who belong to communities that often have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander persons and other per sons of color; members of religious minorities; women and girls; LGBTQI+ persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; persons who live in United States Territories; persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality; and individuals who belong to multiple such communities. The term \"underserved communities \" refers to those populations and geographic communities that have been systematically denied the full opportunity to participate fully in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as defined in Executive Orders 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government and 14020 on Establishment of the White House Gender Policy Council. 220.22 What is expected of agencies to implement a more equity -based approach? Adopting a whole -of-government approach toward advancing equity will position agencies to deliver better outcomes for all Americans, including underserved communities. Advancing equity requires continuously and systematically embedding equity into all aspects of management, decision- making, and policy -making processes across agencies. It also requires improving the quality, frequency, and accessibility of SECTION 2 20\u2014THE PRESIDENT 'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA, CROSS-AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS AND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 220 engagement conducted with the public, including underserved communities, to make sure constituents can provide input on Federal policies and programs that affect them . Agencies should work with their Agency Equity Teams and OMB through the Federal budget process to include equity activities and capaci ty needs in agency budget requests. As agencies develop and execute the President's Budget, their Strategic Plans, Learning Agendas, Performance Plans, Evaluation Plans, CX Action Plans, Regulatory Agendas, and other agency planning and performance effort s outlined in this guidance, they should, whenever possible, prioritize advancing and embedding equity in their proposals, including by linking to strategies in their Equity Action Plans; conduct regular equity assessments; deploy meaningful public participation and community engagement; and consider how their organizational planning and decision-making processes may not account for certain perspectives and take action to address any gaps. 220.23 Where can agencies find guidance for implementing a more equity -based approach? As agencies move to develop and implement new, annual Equity Action Plans pursuant to Executive Order 14091 and continue implementing their existing Equity Action Plans pursuant to Executive Order 13985, they should work with their Agency Equity Teams and OMB to ensure they have sufficient capacity, including dedicated staff with the appropriate skills and competencies; equity training opportunities; budget; robust data collection and evidence building practices; and any other resources needed for effective implementation. In line with their Equity Action Plans, agencies should continue developing (and reporting) metrics to track progress on equity eff orts; communicate what success will look like in terms of what any proposed changes will mean for affected communities; and ensure accountability and oversight through appropriate internal and external mechanisms. Agencies' Performance Plans and Budget submissions should clearly identify what actions, initiatives, or efforts are aligned with and support their Equity Action Plans. For more detailed guidance on advancing equity through agency practices, policies, and programs , agencies should refer to: OMB Memorandum M -23-11 (Creating a More Diverse and Resilient Federal Marketplace through Increased Participation of New and Recent Entrants ); O MB Memorandum M -22-03 (Advancing Equity in Federal Procurement); OMB Memorandum M -22-10 (Improving Access to Public Benefits Programs Through the Paperwork Reduction Act ); O MB Memorandum M -22-12 (Advancing Effective Stewardship of Taxpayer Resources and Outcomes in the Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ); O MB guidance on Implementation of the Modernizing Re gulatory Review Executive Order ; a nd Recommendations from the Equitable Data Working Group . Additional resources, including guidance for developing the new Equity Action Plans, tools for conducting ongoing equity assessment activities, examples of meaningful public participation and community engagement strategies, and recordings of previous Equity Learning Community sessions are available on the Equity Learning Community MAX Community page . Questions may be directed to Equity@omb.eop.gov . SECTION 2 20\u2014THE PRESIDENT 'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA, CROSS-AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS AND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES Page 10 of Section 220 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND ACCESSIBILITY (DEIA) 220.24 What is Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) ? Each of these terms has an individual definition pursuant to E.O. 14035, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workplace, of June 25, 2021. As a holistic construct, the objective of DEIA is that across the Federal government, agencies will work collaboratively to drive innovation and organizational outcomes, draw from the full diversity of the nation, and position the federal government to serve as a model employer that values and promotes equity for all Americans . The term \" diversity \" means the practice of including the many communities, identities, races, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities, cultures, and beliefs of the American people, including underserved communities . The term \" equity \" means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment . The term \" inclusion \" means the recognit ion, appreciation, and use of the talents and skills of employees of all backgrounds . The term \" accessibility \" means the design, construction, development, and maintenance of facilities, information and communication technology, programs, and services so that all people, including people with disabilities, can fully and independently use them. Accessibility includ es the provision of accommodations and modifications to ensure equal access to employment and participation in activities for people with disabilities, the reduction or elimination of physical and attitudinal barriers to equitable opportunities, a commitme nt to ensuring that people with disabilities can independently access every outward -facing and internal activity or electronic space, and the pursuit of best practices such as universal design. 220.25 How can DEIA support agency missions and goals? DEIA is not a n additional or separate program, but rather a whole of organization priority that must be integrated into and across agency functions and embedded into agency culture. Agencies should incorporate DEIA into organizational planning documents, including an agency 's budget, learning agenda and annual evaluation plan, regulatory agenda, performance planning, human capital operating plan, and overall strategic plan. Approaching organizational planning with a DEIA perspective enhances the workforce' s capabilities to meet mission requirements and goals. This approach can lead to rethinking how to do business, including working across traditional silos, identifying and collaborating with new partners, challenging long-held assumptions and processes, and embracing innovative, visionary solutions to address new and long-standing challenges. Viewing goals, initiatives, and workstreams through a DEIA lens enables an agency to amplify the exemplary talents and skills of its workforce. To advance agency missions and goals, agencies are expected to embed DEIA, as a foundational component, throughout the organizational planning lifecycle . INFRASTRUCTURE PERMITTING 220.26 What is the Permitting Action Plan? The Permitting Action Plan o utlines the Administration's strategies to strengthen and accelerate Federal environmental review and permitting and ensure the timely and sound delivery of upgrades to America's infrastructure. The Permitting Action Plan states that Federal environmental reviews and permitting SECTION 2 20\u2014THE PRESIDENT 'S MANAGEMENT AGENDA, CROSS-AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS AND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 220 processes will be effective, efficient, and transparent, guided by the best available science to pro mote positive environmental and community outcomes, and shaped by early and meaningful public engagement. OMB M emorandum M -23-14 pr ovides guidance on how to implement the Permitting Action Plan and directs agencies to accelerate smart permitting through early cross-agency coordination; establish clear timeline goals and track key project information; engage early a nd meaningfully with States, Tribal Nations, territories, and local communities; improve agency responsiveness, technical assistance, and support; and use agency resources and the environmental review process to improve environmental and community outcomes . Agencies are also directed to identify performance indicators and data to monitor progress and establish and incorporate performance goals and indicators into annual performance plans and reports . 220.2 7 How should agencies track performance and monitor progress for infrastructure permitting ? Agencies should identify performance indicators and data that are meaningful for analyzing progress in advancing the environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure projects. Performance indicators an d data should be accurate and timely, help inform decision making, identify areas for process improvements and increased collaboration, identify resource needs, and drive progress towards improved outcomes. Agencies should establish performance indicator s and targets related to the timely completion of environmental reviews and authorization decisions, increased coordination and transparency, and improved environmental and community outcomes, including public engagement opportunities and implemented mitig ation measures. Agencies should incorporate these performance indicators and targets into their annual Agency Performance Plan and report progress against achieving those goals in their annual Agency Performance Report. Agencies can use information from th e Permitting Dashboard , internal agency tracking systems, historical data, and other relevant sources to establish baseline data, set benchmarks and targets for future performance, and monitor overall progress.

SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING Page 2 of Section 230 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 230.1 What is an Agency Strategic Plan ? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 aligns strategic planning with the beginning of each new term of an Administration, requiring every Federal agency to produce a new Strategic Plan by the first Monday in February following the year in which the term of the President commences. The Strategic Plan, therefore, presents the long -term objectives an agency hopes to accomplish at the beginning of each new term of an Administration by describing general and long-term goals the agency aims to achieve, what actions the agency will take to realize those goals, and how the agency will deal with challenges and risks that may hinder achieving results. In general, strategic planning as a process reflects the series of coordinated activities, steps, and phases the agency conducts in order to develop and produce the Agency Strategic Plan . The Strategic Plan will define the agency mission, long -term goals and objectives to achieve those goals, strategies planned, and the approaches it will use to monitor its progress in addressing specific national problems, needs, challenges, and opportunities related to its mission. A strategic planning best practice, some Strategic Plans may also include a vision statement designed to articulate a desired future state in terms of strategic direction that expresses what the organization wants to achieve while generating momentum for action on the part of the agency to accomplish the vision. The Strategic Plan explains the importance of the goals, appraises the agency 's capabilities, assesses the operating environment an d provides for evaluations and other studies to inform agency actions. The Strategic Plan should explain why goals and strategies were chosen, discussing the relevant evidence supporting the selected goals and strategies. Because many agency missions, programs and strategies are statutory in nature, some of the strategic plan is expected to be more descriptive of those past decisions, whereas other parts of the strategic plan should reflect important strategic decisions in response to a recent agency analysis of the operating environment, Administration priorities such as those articulated by Executive Order or memorandum, or other emerging factors, for example. An agency 's Strategic Plan should provide the context for decisions about performance goals, priorities, strategic human capital planning and budget planning. It should provide the framework for the detail published in agency Annual Performance Plans, Annual Performance Reports and on Performance.gov. Agencies need to translate the long -term goals in their Strategic Plans to strategic objectives and then to performance goals, including Agency Priority Goals, in the Annual Performance Plan. Moreover, with enactment of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (\"E vidence Act \"), agency strategic plan s are supported by the inclusion of the agency 's Learning Agenda (i.e., Evidence -Building Plan), which establishes and maps the activities agencies will undertake to answer important short-and long- term strategic and operational questions most pressing to achieving the agency 's mission. The Evidence Act also requires agencies to conduct and include a Capacity Assessment for Statistics, Evaluation, Research, and Analysis in their Strategic Plans. The Capacity Assessment will assess how an agency' s evaluation, research, and analysis efforts support various agency functions, including strategic management. Because the Strategic Plan focuses on long - term objectives, it is important that agencies consider risks and how risks change over time during formulation of the plan. Considering enterprise risk management in the early stages of the strategic planning process will ensure that the agency 's management of risk is appropriately aligned with the organization' s overall mission, objectives and priorities. See more on enterprise risk manag ement in section 260 and performance planning in section 240 . Moreover, incorporating strategic foresight into the strategic planning and review process is one method for identifying and managing long-term risk while also facilitating the achievement of long -term goals. Strategic foresight is a method for systematically considering a longer time horizon and broader scope of issues than other forms of planning. Integrating strategic foresight in the planning process also facilitates a systems approach to problem solving and may help an agency better prepare for future threats or take early advantage of emerging opportunities as strategic foresight tools and methods allow the consideration of multiple possible futures, with the goal of preparedness for the se possibilities based on analysis. The systems approach of SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 230 strategic foresight also encourages organizational communication to avoid the \" silo effect, \" in which problems are viewed in isolation. When exercised in conjunction with effective strategy development, agencies can understand and shape the future environment as opposed to merely reacting to it. Foresight methodologies may vary by agency depending on its mission and operating environment, but examples of strategic foresight methodologies include scanning, trend analysis, and scenario planning. Opportunities for cross-agency foresight coordination are also encouraged to be explored where appropriate . 230.2 What is the purpose of strategic planning ? In addition to fulfilling the GPRA Modernizatio n Act of 2010 requirements, strategic planning serves a number of important management functions related to achieving an agency 's mission , and vision statement where one is provided by the agency. Empirical r esearch published in peer -reviewed journals exploring its relationship to organizational performance has shown that strategic planning has a positive impact on organizational performance in both public and private sectors across international settings, and is most powerful as a predictor of organiza tional effectiveness. 1 Strategic planning is a valuable tool for communicating to agency managers, employees, delivery partners, suppliers, Congress, and the public a vision for the future. An agency 's strategic goals and objectives should be used to align resources and guide decision -making to accomplish priorities to improve outcomes. It should inform agency decision-making about the need for major new acquisitions, information technology, strategic human capital planning, evaluations, and other evidenc e-building and evidence -capacity building investments. Strategic Plans can also help agencies invite ideas and stimulate innovation to advance agency goals. The Strategic Plan should support planning across organizational operating units and describe how agency components are working toward common results. An agency formulates its Strategic Plan with input from Congress, OMB, the public and the agency 's personnel, partners, and stakeholders and makes the plan easily accessible to all. The agency 's process for establishing and managing strategic goals and objectives should fulfill these important roles: Leadership. The strategic goals and objectives communicate the Administration 's priorities and direction through a unified vision, long- term goals, and s upporting strategies. The Strategic Plan features strategic goals and objectives that state what the agency wants to accomplish in terms of outcomes or results. Planning. The Strategic Plan is the foundation of an agency 's planning system because it pro vides direction for all programmatic and management functions used to execute the strategies needed to reach goals. Executives should use the Strategic Plan to provide guidance to agency components for planning their program implementation, including the alignment of information technologies and human capital resources to support improved outcomes and cost -effectiveness. Additionally, the Strategic Plan, through the multi-year learning agenda, also helps the agency to plan its evidence-building activities, which should support its overall mission. The Strategic Plan should not, however, be a binding document that prevents agencies from learning from experiences and adapting their plans to changing circumstances. Instead, the strategic goals and objectives should be updated over time, incorporating agency learning, and emergent or external factors that may impact agency implementation. Management. After the planning process, the agency uses the strategic goals and objectives to guide implementation and management. Each strategic goal should be supported by a suite of strategic objectives and performance goals. These, in turn, should be supported by other indicators used to monitor and interpret progress. The annual performance planning, human capital planning 1 George, B ert, Walker, R ichard, and Monster, J oost. (2019) . \"Does Strategic Planning Improve Organizational Performance? -Analysis. Public Administration Review , 79(6): 810-819. SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING Page 4 of Section 230 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) and budget processes jointly support the agency' s implementation of the strategic goals and objectives by establishing resource allocations, refined strategies, activities, indicators, targets, and milestones in more detail. Agency Strategic Pl ans provide the framework for other plans and reports where agency performance goals and related analyses are communicated and monitored and revised when needed. For more information on management toward the strategic goals and objectives, see section 260 regarding the strategic review which includes information on the link between strategic planning and enterprise risk management. Engagement. The strategic goals and objectives in an agency Strategic Plan are a tool to engage external entities to enlis t their ideas, expertise, and assistance, including Congress, the public and the agency 's stakeholders. For example, because delivery partners external to the Federal Government can be critical in accomplishing agency objectives, agencies may want to engage them in identifying potential goals and strategies to accelerate progress. 230.3 What content is included in the agency Strategic Plan? Agencies should plan to address the standards for required content and information elements that are established in section 210 when writing a new or updated Agency Strategic Plan, and should use findings from strategic reviews as well as the development of enterprise risk management profiles and their analysis of risks to help the agency identify the mos t effective long-term strategies. Additionally, the Evidence Act requires the agency Strategic Plan include a separate section on evidence-building, referred to as the Learning Agenda , as well as a Capacity Assessment. See s ections 210 and 290 for additional guidance describing the relationship of agency Learning Agenda s and the Capacity Assessment to the Agency Strategic Plan , and how to effectively incorporate a discussion of the agency 's evaluation and evidence - building efforts into the plans and strategies narrative throughout the agency strategic plan. 230.4 What timeframes must be established for achieving strategic goals and objectives? The strategic goals and objectives should be established for a period of not less than four years following the fiscal year in which it is published, starting the first Monday in February of any year following the year in which the term of the President commences. Agencies may set strategic goals for longer periods of time. See section 230.19 regarding interim updates. Strategic Plan: Publication in February , 2026 covers February, 2030 covers FYs 2030-2034 230.5 How does development of the annual Agency Performance Plan (APP) relate to the agency Strategic Plan? The Agency Performance Plan complements the Agency Strategic Plan whereby agencies translate the longer -term strategic goals and objectives in their Strategic Plans to programmatic performance goals, including Agency Priority Goals, in the Agency 's annual Performance Plan . Reviewed and updated annually, agencies establish in the annual Agency Performance Plan performance goals, measures, and targets aligned to agency 's objectives in the strategic plan, identifying the level of performance to be achieved during the current year in which the performance plan is submitted as well as the budget year for which it is submitted . SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 230 Agencies will publish their annual FY 2025 Agency Performance Plan in February 202 4. The FY 2025 APP should be aligned to the Strategic Plan covering FYs 20 22-2026, and affords agencies the opportunity to establish performance goals, measures, and target s planned for FY 202 5 while revising FY 20 24 performance goals, measure, and targets midyear , if needed , in order to reflect new leadership and management priorities and resource levels. 230.6 When must agencies next update their Strategic Plan according to the GPRA Modernization Act? To meet the requirements of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 , agencies publish ed an updated Strategic Plan concurrent with the publication of the FY 2023 President 's Budget in March 2022. A gencies must next issue a new Strategic Plan in February 202 6 covering FYs 202 6-2030. Agencies should update as applicable their Strategic Plan s by applying information learned from strategic reviews and other data - driven performance reviews as they are conducted , as well as reflect organizational plans and learning related to the agency 's evidence and evaluation building efforts . Agencies will prepare the initial draft components of the FYs 202 6-2030 Strate gic Plan s by June 2025 in order to inform the development of the FY 202 7 budget submission and FY 2027 Annual Performance Plan, which will also include FY s 2026-2027 Agency Priority Goals. The FY 2027 APP, to complement the FYs 2026 -2030 Strategic Plan that will be published in February 202 6, will be developed throughout the course of 2025 and aligned to the new Strategic Plan covering FYs 2026 -2030. Continued refinements to the initial draft components and draft Strategic Plan will be expected prior to publication in February 2026. Agencies may work with OMB to make adjustments to the ir Strategic Plan draft submission s if needed. Additionally, the FYs 202 6-2030 Strategic Plan s will also include a separate section on evidence-building and capacity, implementing requirements aimed at advancing agency evaluation and evidence-building activities identified in the Evidence Act . 230.7 What is an effective strategic goal ? Strategic goals should reflect the broad, long-term, outcomes the agency aspires to achieve by implementing its mission. Strategic goals communicate the agency efforts to address national problems, needs, challenges, and opportunities on behalf of the American people. Effective strategic goals also take into account emerging trends, technologies, o r significant changes in the operational environment in anticipating the impact to agency missions during a longer -term planning horizon. Both the way strategic goals are framed and the substance they communicate are important to consider. Strategic goal s should reflect the statutory mission of the agency, and most agency activity will align to the strategic goals. Strategic goals need not be as specific as strategic objectives, and need not reflect every activity that the agency must undertake to accomp lish its mission. Stylistically, strategic goals should be simple statements which are neither long nor overly complex. Some guidelines for developing these include: Use language that the public will understand and avoid highly technical terms that are very specific to technical or professional fields. Use language that expresses future direction or vision, and include active or directional verbs such as strengthen, support, maintain, improve, reduce, etc. SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING Page 6 of Section 230 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Be specific enough for the public to clearly understand how the goal supports the agency 's mission and communicates the agency 's unique responsibilities. For example, strategic goals such as \" Improve Safety \" do not communicate the agency 's specific efforts in this outcome a rea. Better specificit y might be \" Maintain and Improve the Safety of America 's Transportation \" for the Department of Transportation. If desired, short headers may be used preceding the strategic goal statement (e.g. Safety: Maintain Safe and Healthy Workplaces), and a separat e field will be provided in Performance.gov for the ' header ' in addition to the full strategic goal statement. Examples of strategic goals include : Reduce Transportation-Related Fatalities and Serious Injuries Across the Transportation System . Protect the Health of Americans Where They Live, Learn, Work, and Play . Restore Small Businesses and Communities after Disasters. Extend human presence deeper into space and to the moon for sustainable long- term exploration and utilization . 230.8 What is an effect ive strategic objective? Strategic objectives reflect the outcome or management impact the agency is trying to achieve and generally include the agency 's role. They express more specifically the results or direction the agency will work to achieve outcomes in order to make progress on its mission and provide services to customers. Although objectives are usually outcome -oriented some objectives may be established to communicate the breadth of agency efforts - such as cross-cutting customer service or stewardship objectives that support multiple strategic goals. For the purposes of developing strategic objectives in the Agency S trategic Plan, strategic objectives may be described in the areas reflected below: Mission / Service Focused. A type of strategic objective that expresses more specifically the path an agency plans to follow to achieve or make progress on a strategic goal . For programs which deliver direct services to customers, this may also include the objective of providing a good experience for customers, and is therefore Service Focused. Service Focused objectives should be considered as those activities that reflect the interaction(s) between individual citizens or businesses and Federal agencies in providing a direct servi ce on behalf of the Federal Government, and which is core to the mission of the agency. Mission / Service Focused (Crosscutting/Other). A type of strategic objective that is not directly tied to a single strategic goal, but may be tied to several or none. In some circumstances agencies perform statutory or crosscutting activities which are not closely tied to a single strategic goal. Mission -Support / Management Focused. A type of strategic objective that communicates the agencies ' improvement priorities for management functions to support and strengthen organizational health and organizational performance, such as strategic human capital management, acquisition, information technology, cybersecurity, or financial management . Activities and responsibilities around stewardship to provide appropriate safeguards in executing mission and service related activities effectively and efficiently, including minimizing instances of waste, fraud, and abuse, may also be conveyed . Management objectives often support more than one strategic goal Agencies should treat strategic objectives as a primary unit for strategic analysis and decision -making. It is important to develop strategic objectives that enable a review of progress both on effectiveness of implementation and the impact made on ultimate outcomes, using a variety of sources of evidence. When SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 230 developing each objective, the agency should consider how to measure progress toward achieving it, such as considering which performance indi cators and other sources of evidence are most useful to understand progress and assess if current strategies are effective. The following guidelines should be considered in crafting mission- focused strategic objectives: Purpose : Will the strategic objective align agency efforts to achieve a desired outcome, and facilitate improved decision-making? The purpose of each strategic objective is to align agency efforts toward achieving the intended outcome. Objectives should be meaningful and inspiring t o agency leadership, program managers, and front -line employees, and their ongoing implementation should stimulate analysis and decisions which lead to improved outcomes. Strategic objectives should be defined to facilitate decision- making at the agency, as well as decision-making by the agency 's stakeholders. It should be possible to identify the lead office and other responsible offices for each strategic objective, and to identify the programs, activities and strategies utilized to achieve the objectiv e. In some cases, objectives may be chosen which cut across organizational or programmatic silos in order to facilitate cross-organization management , improve customer experience, or realize a better return on investment. Assessment : Can progress on the strategic objective be reasonably assessed? Agencies are required to annually assess progress toward achieving the intended outcomes of each strategic objective, as part of the strategic review ( see section 260). Considerations when determining if a strategic objective will support a meaningful assessment include: o Strategic objectives should be articulated so they express future direction or vision, and include active or directional verbs such as strengthen, support, maintain, improve, reduce, etc. The objective should be framed so it can serve as a standard against which an assessment can reasonably be performed (i.e., it is reasonable to say if progress had been made toward the objective and whether or not the objective was met). o Each strategic objective should have some means of assessing progress both on effectiveness of implementation and progress toward ultimate outcomes (e.g., performance indicators that can be analyzed to assess likely impact s of agency action s, evaluations). o An objective which includes a diverse set of outcomes will be more difficult to assess than objectives expressing a single outcome or multiple closely related outcomes. o The more ambiguity there is in the strategic objective statement as to the intended outcomes, the more challenging it will be to conduct a meaningful assessment. Scope : Is the scope of the objective appropriate? Strategic objectives should break down the broader, mission-oriented strategic goals to a level that reflects the impact or outcome the agen cy is trying to achieve through its programs. In general, strategic objectives will not be quantitative, but will add more specificity to the strategic goals and act as a bridge between the agency 's strategic goals and more specific quantitative or alternative form performance goals. The full set of an agency 's strategic objectives will not necessarily capture the full depth and detail of agency activities. Many agency activities will be described through narrative supporting a strategic objective, or through the establishment of performance goals at a more granular level of agency planning, rather than through inclusion in the strategic objective statement. In general, agencies should have approximately 2-10 strategic objectives for each strategic goal; however , the number may vary by agency and mission areas. SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING Page 8 of Section 230 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Clarity : Is it understandable? Strategic objectives should be relatively simple statements that clearly communicate the outcome or impact that is desired. Statements should not be too long or complex since there will be strategies and other narrative supporting each. Agencies should use language that the public will understand and should avoid jargon. Uniqueness : Is the objective defined in a way that clarifies the agency 's role and mission? In some cases, it may be difficult to understand the objective unless the agency 's role is communicated. In these cases, the strategic objective should differentiate the agency 's efforts from other agencies in a particular outcome area. For example, many agencies may be working to impact economic development; however, each organization may be responsible for a different facet, using different programs, interventions and strategies (e.g., housing rehabilitation vs. small business assistance). To the extent these distinctions can be made within the strategic objective statement, agencies should do so by clarifying the agency role or communicating the desired program results in summary. Alternatively, the strategies and other narratives that describe what the agency will do to execute on the strategic objective should be used to help to clarify the agency role. Examples of missi on-focused strategic objectives: Increase agricultural opportunities and support economic growth by creating new markets and supporting a competitive agricultural system . Enforce the n ation 's trade laws and security l aws. Improve quality of service for customers across the entire student aid life cycle. Reduce the average length of homelessness. Provide workers ' compensation benefits for workers who are injured or become ill on the job . Project American values and leadership by preventing the spread of disease and providing humanitarian relief. Support tribal self -determination, self -governance, and sovereignty . Deliver trusted currency and services that enable citizens and businesses to participate in the economy . Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions . Conduct Human Exploration in Deep Space, Including to the Surface of the Moon. Improve healthcare quality and affordability in the FEHB Program with 75 percent of enrollees in quality, affordable plans . 230.9 How should strategies be developed to support the achiev ement of strategic goals and objectives? Developing effective implementation strategies is as important as setting strategic goals and objectives , seeking to influence the operating environment of agencies by offering direction in the application of resources and other means in order to achieve stated objectives A wealth of literature, both academic and SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 230 applied, has been written on the topics of strategy and strategic planning in settings from the private sector, to business, national security, and the public sector more generally. Agency officials who lead agency strategic planning and strategy development are encouraged to explore this literature offering a richness of lessons-l earned and observations in these fields. The discussion below of strategy devel opment in support of achieving strategic goals and objectives is intended to provide a common understanding and framework of the key components and factors to consider in constr ucting effective implementation strategies, and strengthen this critical component of strategic planning government -wide. Effective strategies to achieve strategic goals and objectives should: Meet criteria of suitability, feasibility, and acceptability, rest ing on a data-driven diagnosis of the problems being addressed and the complexities of goal achievement , reflecting the input of key experts, stakeholders , and previous organization learning through such processes as the agency 's strategic review; Consider several alternative implementation approaches to address the problem, and identify a primary strategy which promises to be most effective by providing the most likelihood for success while accounting for : legal and policy considerations ; likely fu ture scenarios; lessons learned through the strategic reviews; the extent to which the agency has control over desired outcomes ; the degree of certainty on cause and effect of the agency 's interventions; and the agency risk tolerance (as identified in the agency ERM process) . Effective strategies are often about choices, with selection of the primary strategy reflecting a determination of how best to achieve the desired future state or outcome while accounting for factors within the strategic environment ; Reflect direction of agency leadership that accounts for critical legal, organizational, management, legislative, and budget considerations , and cascade down the organization ; Incorporate both internal and external s takeholder input s, including feedback f rom key customer groups who may lack a formal role in policy development; Create a coherence of effort , including alignment of budgetary resources; coordination with related programs, other agencies, and external delivery partners; and integration of contributing management capabilities and assets, such as IT investments, human capital, and evidence and evaluation -building . Effective strategies seek to apply such coherence of effort across the resources available in order to influence and shape the en vironment to enable achievement of desired outcomes, versus merely reacting to it ; Be designed with an applied, action-oriented focus t hat effectively directs activities, resources, and efforts to address the identified problems and achieved desired goals. 230.10 What is a logic model, and how can this framework tool help agencies coordinate strategic planning, strategies, and evidence ? A Logic Model generally reflects an agency 's underlying theory for how the planned coordination and orchestration of resources and activities will achieve the desired outcome or change in terms of performance and impac t at the organizational, operational, or programmatic levels. Often thought of as a series of \"If...then \" statement s to dem onstrate connections and linkages across the chain of planning and action , Logic Models are informed by evidence and help to operationalize the agency 's implementation strategy(ies) . The efficacy of the subsequent implementation strategies to achieve an agency 's expressed desired change or impact has a direct relationship to the soundness of the Logic Model on which those strategies are based . To ensure strong connections and linkages that span the range of a Logic Model 's various components, a gencies then should strive to incorporate a Logic Model approach throughout the SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING Page 10 of Section 230 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) development of their strategic plan , mapping inputs, activities, resources, programs, etc., to outcomes and impacts that are reflected within the achievement of strategic goals and obj ectives. The Figure below (from OMB M -21-27 ) i llustrates the Logic Model concept, expressing how inputs and activities relate to and connect desired outputs, outc omes, and impacts based on a diagnosis of the problem or opportunity to be addressed . Ultimately, the goal of the Logic Model is to clarify the agency 's theory of how inputs are translated into outcomes, and the exact contents should be adapted to meet the needs of the individual agency . Importantly, it highlights how agencies can use evidence, and the different types of evidence, to inform each . And while existing evidence informs our selection of the resources and activities we choo se to meet our goals , we also continually generate new evidence about whether and how these resources and activities contribute to our goals , with adjustments made accordingly . 230. 11 What is the relationship of program(s) or program activity(ies) to strategies that are developed to support achievement of strategic goals and objectives? While program activities offer a structure for organizing funding requests, the organizational performance and management principles advanced by the GPRA Modernization Act's strategic and performance planning are strategic and priority -goal oriented, aligned to the policy priorities of Administration and agency leadership. Agency strategic and performance plans then represent the organizational management documents that are the outcomes of effective management routines to articulate the agency 's mission, goals, and priorities, and bring a unity of action and coordination of resources, activities, and efforts to achieve strategic objectives and priority goals through effe ctive implementation strategies. When viewed more holistically through an integrated, systems view of organizational management , which connects agency budget planning with strategic and performance planning, agency strategic and performance plans can also provide a useful organizing structure by demonstrating the programs and program activities which contribute to strategic goals and objectives. In this systems view, the program activity can be a key organizing component that connects budget and funding requests as part of a coordinated strateg y for achieving goals and objectives in the agency Strategic Plan. It is in this context , then, that agencies should incorporate into their existing strategic and performance planning processes considerations of how the SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 230 organization of spending (i.e., program activities) is linked to and connected with performance; that is, a planning approach that views programs and program activities as critical components of the implementation strategies embedded in agency strategic and performance plans, and which serve to focus resources, activities, and organizational efforts in order to achieve progress against the strategic plan, strategic objectives, and agencies ' priority goals and initiatives (see section 230.9 ). Such a planning approach also reinforces the Federal Performance Framework 's focus as a management system that coordinates and aligns a broader complement of financial and programmatic data to enable improved decision making, accountability, and transparency of the Federal Government . 230.12 What is the role of enterprise risk management in strategic and performance planning ? The alignment of enterprise risk management with strategic and performance planning helps an agency understand risks to achieving its objectives. ERM and strategic planning and performance should thus be viewed as complementary efforts to be orchestrated with each other, not as independent activities. In addition, t he identification and management of enterprise risks when developing and executing s trategies for achieving an agency 's mission and programmatic objectives improves an agency 's decision -making efforts. Activities being undertaken to accomplish goals and objectives are at an increased risk of failure when implementing strategies are formulated without identifying potential risks and without embedd ed mitigation mechanisms to effectively assess and manage such risks. Successful integration of ERM into an agency 's day -to-day decision -making and management practices will enable an agency to leverage opportunities for managing, mitigating, or avoiding risks that affect strategic goals and objectives, which will ultimately result in more resilient and effective programmatic operations . 230.13 Must the agency 's strategic objectives be comprehensive, reflecting the major mission activities that the agency undertakes ? Yes. The strategic objectives should generally encompass the agency 's mission and scope of responsibilities, including statutory responsibilities. However, encompassing the scope of mission activities does not mean that the strategic objectives will cover the depth and detail of agency activities. There will be many cases where agency activities are too detailed to be included in the strategic objective statement or associated description, but are relevant to support an objective or multiple objectives. In some cases, these activities will be included in supporting narrative in the Annual Performance Plan or implementation strategies for strategic objectives. The graphic below shows the relationship between Strategic Goals and Strategic Objectives, including mission -support or management -focused and crosscutting objectives. SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING Page 12 of Section 230 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Example illustration of goal and objective relationships . 230.14 Are agencies required to set mission-support and management -focused objectives addressing management functions such as financial management, acquisition, human capital, information technology, etc.? OMB encourages agencies to establish mission -support, management-focused objectives that reflect key priorities of the agency, such as a significant effort to improve the health and performance across the organization or stewardship of resources. Agency leadership may opt to include mission -support or management -focused objective (s) that reflect these significant agency -specific management priorities for strengthening organizational health, stewardship, or other organizational management improvement efforts. In agency strategic and performance plans, mission -support and management -focused objectives will be listed under a separate category, similar to the categorization of strategic objectives under strategic goals (see section 210). Each kind of strategic objective has the same management and public reporting requirements . 230.15 What is an effective mission -support , management -focused objective? Mission -support and management -focused objectives communicate improvement priorities for management functions such as strategic human capital management, information technology, sustainability or financial stewardship. In general, these efforts will cut across the organization and should reflect priorities that leadership would like to emphasize over the period of performance established in the strategic plan. These key management efforts need not reflect all the important operations or management functions of the agency (e.g.; budget or legal functions) . Rather, they should reflect broad, strategic-level decisions of emphasis or describe a relatively significant performance improvement change that affects most of the organization. SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 230 Management and operational functions not reflected in the strategic plan as mission -support objectives should be addressed among performance goals in the a nnual Agency Performance Plan or in agency operational plans. Strategies supporting mission -oriented strategic objectives or strategies in the a nnual Agency Performance Plan should identify key operational processes, human capital, training, skills, technology, information and other management resources where they are relevant to the implementation of mission -focused strategic objectives. For example, revised Federal regulations (5 C.F.R. 250) require agencies to develop and update a Human Capital Operating Plan (HCOP) in alignment with GPRAMA strategic and performance planning timelines. Specifically, the HCOP operates on the same annual cycle as the agency Annual Performance Plan in order to identify and focus on the human capital goals and measures that need to be implemented each year to achieve the strategic goals set forth over the duratio n of the Agency Strategic Plan. Examples of mission -support and management -focused objective s include : Financial Management: Fight fraud and work to eliminate improper payments through increased emphasis on agency program integrity initiatives. Strategic Human Capital Management: Invest in the agency 's employee recruitment, hiring, training, work-life programs and performance management so staff is engaged to more effectivel y serve small businesses. 230.16 Are agencies required to address the agency specific contributions to Cross -Agency Priority Goals (CAP) within the strategic plan? Yes. Because development and planning of CAP Goals is often done concurrently with strategic planning , agencies may use the development and publication of the ir Annual Performance Plan to update as needed the discussion or description addressing agency -specific contributions to CAP Goals in the agency 's strategic plan . See sections 210 and 220 for details . 230.17 Who should prepare the agency strategic goals and objectives? The development of strategic goals and objectives is an inherently governmental function, and the plan is to be drafted only by Federal employees. Agencies should designate a lead office with adequate staffing, capacity, and expertise to coordinate and lead the various planning activities and organizational processes involved in writing the Agency Strategic Plan and the strategic goals and objectives that constitute the core framing of the plan. In this process, agencies should also engage their organizational components (employees), Congress, OMB, delivery partners and other stakeholders in the development of the strategic goals and objectives. When preparing the plan for publication, agencies may be assisted by non -Federal parties, such as consultants or contractors who are hired specifically to provide technical input on the design and assembly of the plan, and who are not solicited for their input on policy or budget issues. The Strategic Plan should include an acknowledgment and brief description of the contribution by a non- Federal entity in preparing the plan, if applicable . 230.18 What is the timeline for agencies to develop and obtain input from OMB on the FYs 202 6- 2030 Strategic Plan? Agencies are currently operating under their FYs 20 22-2026 Strategic Plans which were published in March 2022 . Agencies will next publish revised Strategic Plans i n February 2026, concurrent with the release of the President 's FY 202 7 Budget. The table below provides an overview of the major planning milestones SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING Page 14 of Section 230 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) that will occur throughout 2025 in the strategic planning process that will help enable agencies to publish their updated Strategic Plan s in February 2026, as required by the GPRA Modernization Act . Date Action June, 2025 Agencies submit initial draft components of the Strategic Plan covering FYs 20 26-2030 for OMB review.

Outreach by a Federal agency to connect with those directly affected by policies, regulations, processes, and actions is a powerf ul statement. It is a direct acknowledgement that what an agency decides to do in advancement of its mission and strategic goals and strategic objectives affects the daily lives of real people across the country and around the world. In that acknowledgemen t is an invitation to leverage the expertise of those with relevant experience to help make agency goals, strategies, and implementation action s more directly responsive and effective. Through public participation and community engagement, agencies s olicit and consider the views and suggestions of those entities potentially affected by or interested in the Agency 's Strategic P lan, in order to ensure: Better understanding of challenges and burdens faced by the public , which helps agencies design poli cies and programs that reflect community priorities and preferences; Regular channels for input on and evaluation of existing policies, programs, and processes , which enable agencies to modify service delivery in more effective and timely ways; Stronger relationships with members of the public , including underserved communities, which helps to overcome historic differences and drive trust in government; More opportunities to build on and develop agency and community capacities and to foster shared goals , which means agencies can leverage resources outside of government to advance shared priorities; and Greater public awareness of policy issues and choices that impact the lives of individuals , which improves transparency and builds buy -in for the decisions made by agencies. An important by-product of such outreach is the potential also to increase the public 's trust in Government . Effective public participation and community engagement is purposeful, inclusive , and accessible; transparent and accountable; respectful and mutually beneficial ; and evidence-based and iterative. When preparing a Strategic Plan, agencies must consult with an array of entities , including both majority and minority views of any Congressional stakeholders , as well as the views of other interested and potentially - affected parties, including non -Federal entities and key delivery partners (see 5 U.S.C. 306(d)). These consultations should occur throughout the process used by the agency for developing update s to its Strategic Plan and take into account key milestones and timeline s established in this Circular . Engagements external to the agency should occur in consultation with OMB, and generally after an initial draft is reviewed by OMB during the summer prior to publication . Agencies are encouraged to conduct stakeholder mapping and develop specific outreach strategies and approaches to guide their stakeholder consultation activities specific to internal and external stakeholder groups . Leverag ing ongoing agency communications and contact processes to solicit views and recommendations for revising goals, objectives, and strategies that are in the current plan is one approach, while other examples include hosting public meetings and town hal ls on the draft plan, draft strategic goals and objectives framework, or posting the draft plan or variations of the plan on the internet and inviting public comment. Agencies that invite comment from the public or external stakeholders on their draft strategic plan should do so after OMB has been provided and reviewed a draft of the plan and is comfortable with Administration policy reflected in the draft of the plan being circulated for comment. Agencies may also consider using their existing published S trategic Plan to begin earlier consultations with Congress and other stakeholders before a more fully -developed revision is completed, or when presented with compressed planning timeframes. This approach would allow stakeholders to engage in the development process. SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING Page 16 of Section 230 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Agencies should work with their legislative affairs offices to determine the best ways to consult with Congress on the strategic plan, in advance of finalizing the plan with OMB. Additionally, agencies must consult with Congress at least once every two years on their Strategic Plans, briefly not ing how any feedback received was incorporated. Agencies are also expected to conduct engagement with a range of interested parties regarding the contents of the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Pl an. Per the Evidence Act, agencies are required to consult with the public, State and local governments, and representatives of non-governmental researchers as they develop their learning agendas. OMB Memorandum M -19-23 l ists additional entities and groups that agencies should consult when developing their Learning Agendas, including internal agency staff and officials who play a role in, have a stake in, or will use the results of the learning that results, in addition to others. OMB also expects that agencies consult with internal and external parties as they develop and implement the Annual Evaluation Plan, although the engagement will likely differ by agency depending on its needs, the individuals and groups engaged, evaluation, activities, etc. (see OMB Memorandum M -19 - 23). Section 290 includes additional information a bout OMB 's expectation s for engagement for these Evidence Act plans. 230.20 C an an agency consult with other agencies within the Executive Branch in the development of Strategic Plans ? Yes. Ag encies are strongly encouraged to consult with other agencies within the Executive Branch in the development of Strategic Plans, as the outcomes reflected in many strategic goals and objectives that an agency 's strategic plan seeks to achieve often require interagency coordination of programs and resources identified in implementation strategies (see section 230. 9). Interagency coordination in the development of the agency strategic plan will help ensure the appropriate alignment of resources and strategies in instances where agencies have shared or overlapping strategic goals and objectives. Agencies that want assistance should contact OMB. 230.21 H ow should agencies publish Strategic Plans and deliver them to Congress ? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 r equires agencies to make the Strategic Plan available on both the public website of the agency as well as on a central website ( i.e., Performance.gov) in machine readable format, and notify the President and Congress of its availability. Agencies will publish Strategic Plans on the agency 's website, and provide a hyperlink for publication on Performance.gov that directs readers to the agency plan on the agency 's website. To meet the GPRA Modernization Act 's notification requirement to the President , agency PIOs will notify the OMB Director by emailing performance@ omb.eop.gov , and include in the email th e URL to the agency 's final Strategic Plan published on the agency 's website so that the plan can also be made available on Performance.gov. Related submissions or questions may be emailed to the same address. N otification to Congress of the availability of the Strategic Plan on Performance.gov (or the agency website, if applica ble) is transmitted electronically by the agency head or other senior agency official in accordance with how agencies normally communicate with Congressional stakeholders . Transmittals are addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, and the President pro tempore of the Senate. SECTION 2 30\u2014AGENCY STRATEGIC PLANNING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 17 of Section 230 230.22 Can Strategic Plans be updated in the interim, before the end of the four -year revision cycle? Yes. With OMB 's collaboration and review, agencies may make adjustments to their Strategic Plan s in advance of the four -year revision cycle prescribed by GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 as organizational learning generated through annual strategic reviews or external factors impact changes to long -term decisions. In order to ensure the strategic goals and objectives reflect agency efforts throughout the Administration, agencies are encouraged to consider changes to their strategic goals and objectives as part of the strategic reviews. Revisions may occur based on results of strategic r eviews, information gained through evaluations, external events, changes in legislation, changes in strategy, or other factors to reflect significant changes in the environment in which the agency is operating such as new statutory requirements, new leadership and/or priorities, or major management initiatives. Agencies should also apply information and analysis learned from their annual strategic review assessment processes, in addition to other analyses associated with strategic planning best practices when considering revisions to the agency' s Strategic Plan and strategies for implementation . While these changes will be encouraged to be made as part of the agency strategic review process, interim adjustments will also be considered throughout the year in response to major events. Interim adjustments do not alter the four -year revision cycle for Strategic Plans. An agency does not need to consult with Congress or conduct outreach to potentially interested or affected parties when preparing interim adjustments, unless such adjustments reflect significant changes. Significant changes to an agency 's Strategic Plan should be made using a more extensive update process with review and consultation by OMB. Congressional consultation requirements apply in these instances of significant change. In general, any updates to an agency strategic objective(s) should be made during the annual update of the Agency Performance Plan, concurrent with the release of the President 's Budget in February . 230.23 How should interim updates be communicated or published? Interim adjustments to the Strategic Plan, such as new Agency Priority Goals or revised agency contributions to the CAP Goals , generally will not require a new publication of the full Strategic Plan. For example, an agency may append an interim adjustment (e.g., newly defined Priority Goals) to its budget submission or include the changes as a part of the a nnual Agency Performance Plan to OMB to address the needed adjustments to the Strategic Plan , if any. Such interim adjustments should be published in the a nnual Agency Performance Plan that is sent to OMB in September, and to Congress in February , and should be made easily accessible to the public. However, m ore significant and substantive changes to the Strategic Plan, such as revisions to the agency 's strategic goal (s) or strategic objective (s) framework, should be incorporated into a revised Strategic Plan that is made publicly accessible on the agency 's website and on Performance.gov. Agencies seeking to revise their strategic goal (s) or strategic objective (s) fram ework should consult with OMB in reviewing these changes and collaborate on the process and timeline for reflecting updated goal frameworks in revised Strategic Plans and a nnual Agency Performance Plans. For information on updates to the Learning Agenda and Capacity Assessment, please see Section 290 .

Adds guidance explaining how the Agency Performance Plan relates to agency assessments of organizational health and organizational performance. I ncorporates reference to list of example indicators of performance goals for measuring, monitoring, and improving organizational performance and organizational health. ANN UAL PERFORMANCE PLANNING 240.1 What is the a nnual Agency Performance Plan (APP) ? The annual Agency Performance Plan (APP) is a description of the level of performance to be achieved during the fiscal year in which the plan is submitted , and the next fiscal year. The plan should be specific in describing the strategies the agency will follow, explaining why those strategies have been chosen, and identifying performance targets and key milestones that will be accomplished in the current and next fiscal year. It should be comprehensive of the agency' s mission by showing the plan for making progress towards each strategic objective. 240.2 What is the purpose of an a nnual Agency Performance Plan (APP) ? Agencies annually prepare an Agency Performance Plan to communicate the agency 's strategic objectives and performance goals with other elements of the agency budget request. The plan describes how the goals will be achieved, identifies priorities a mong the goals and explains how the agency will monitor progress. The APP also updates the previous year's APP to reflect changes in plans, funding decisions, and changes in the operating environment . 240.3 How does the a nnual Agency Performance Plan relate to the Strategic Plan? The annual Agency Performance Plan should align to the agency 's strategic goals and objectives, explaining how they will be achieved. Revi ewed and updated annually, the shorter -term organizational planning and goal-setting of the APP complements the Agency Strategi c Plan, translat ing the longer -term strategic goals and objectives in the Strategic Plans to programmatic performance goals, including Agency Priority Goals, SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 240 in the Agency 's Annual Performance Plan . Strategic goals are advanced by strategic objectives, whi ch in turn, are supported by specific performance goals and indicators. For each strategic goal, the annual plan should show the supporting strategic objectives and performance goals. The indicators that will be used to track, interpret or improve progre ss on performance goals must also be included in the performance plan. Agencies should add performance goals as needed to reflect multiple objectives: Mission focused . The core functions and activities of Federal agencies that are reflected in statutory requirements or leadership priorities and which serve to drive their efforts in addressing pressing and relevant national problems, needs, and challenges. Mission/Service focused . The activities that reflect the interaction(s) between individual citizens or businesses and Federal agencies in providing a direct service on behalf of the Federal Government, and which is core to the mission of the agency. Mission -support and Management -focused . The improvement priorities for management functions that support and strengthen organizational health and organizational performance; and responsibilities of Federal agencies to provide appropriate safeguards in executing mission and service related activities effectively and efficiently, including minimizing instances of waste, fraud, and abuse. The annual Agency Performance Plan supports the agency 's budget request by identifying the performance goals and key milestones that an agency will pursue in the coming year. Results of agency progress on strategic objectives and performance goals are presented and discussed in the Annual Performance Report. Agencies will develop their FY 202 5 APP to align with the strategic plan fr amework of goals and objectives reflected in the agency FYs 20 22-2026 Strategic Plan. The FY 2025 APP will be developed throughout the course of 2023 , and include performance goals, measures, and targets covering FY 202 4 and projected for FY 2025 . Thus, a gencies will have an opportunity in the FY 2025 APP to update , as needed , performance goals, measures, and targets originally identified in the FY 20 24 APP in order to support strategic objectives and priorities reflected in the agency Strategic Plan. 240.4 What is the relationship between the Agency Performance Plan, Agency Performance Report and Congressional Budget Justification? Section 51 outlines agency budget justification requirements. The performance plan may be used to structure the budget submission, or at minimum, be part of the agency 's budget submission to OMB and to Congress. Changes in the plan should reflect and be consistent with changes to the program activities in the budget request. To reduce duplication and to communicate future plans in the context of historical trends, agencies are strongly encouraged to consolidate the a nnual Agency Performance Plan with the a nnual Agency Performance Report to deliver them concurrent with the Congressional Budget Justification and on Perform ance.gov. Agencies should consult with relevant congressional appropriations committees to confirm their support for modifications to the format of the Congressional Budget Justification. 240.5 Does the A gency Performance Plan include contributions to the Cross- Agency Priority Goals and other Administration priorities or initiatives ? Yes, as applicable, annual Agency Performance Plans shall include contributions to Cross -Agency Priority (CAP) goals as well as establish performance goals, measures, and targets in management and policy priority areas required by Executive Orders or OMB memoranda and guidance . In developing the APP, SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING Page 4 of Section 240 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) agency PIOs should coordinate across the organization to ensure the APP is comprehensive of the agency 's mission , including identified policy or management priorities the agency is working to achieve. For example: OMB Memorandum M -22-12 , Ad vancing Effective Stewardship of Taxpayer Resources and Outcomes in the Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), provided initial guidance to agencies that have responsibilities for implementing IIJA programs including detailed guidance on perfor mance planning, measurement, and evaluation requirements . Additionally, transparency into IIJA goal-setting and reporting activities by agencies will strengthen the performance management routines that support effective implementation, while also holding agencies accountable for the basis of decisions and their results. To underscore the importance of the Act's implementation to agencies ' overall efforts to improve outcomes for the American public , agencies should also highlight or tag in their next annual FY 2024 Agency Performance Plan specific performance goals and measures that directly implement or align to IIJA programs. Agencies should also highlight or tag in the FY 2024 Agency Annual Evaluation Plan and/or Learning Agenda specific evidence-building activities connected to IIJA programs. O MB Memorandum M -21-22 d irected alignment of agency strategic goals and objectives, including Agency Priority Goals, with Administration policy priorities, in particular continuing to meet the health, welfare, and economic challenges of the COVID- 19 pandemic, advance equity, and address climate change ; O MB Memorandum s M- 21-20 and M-20-21 i nstructed agencies to incorporate, respectively, American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding, programs, and related efforts into existing organizational performance management routine and plans and reports; P er OMB Memorandum M -20-03, all landholding agencies, beginning within their FY 2022 Annual Performance Plan, should incorporate performance goals and metrics developed as part of the agency 's capital planning for real property. P er OMB Memorandum M -19-17, agencies should incorporate objectives for improving Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) into their strategic and performance plans; P er OMB Memorandum M -19-13 , i dentifying agency -specific goals in consultation with OMB for making smarter use of c ommon c ontract solution through category management . See sections 210 and 220 for additional details on how to incorporate these policy and management priority areas in the APP . 240.6 How will agencies be expected to link resources to the performance plan this year? Performance information in the annual Agency Performance Plan (APP), especially the goals, indicators of past performance and other evidence such as evaluations, should inform agency budget decisions, complementing other factors considered in the budget process. The funding proposed in the agency 's FY 2025 final budget submission should reflect funding levels the agency believes are needed to meet proposed FY 20 25 targets identified in the FY 2025 APP. The performance goals in the Agency Performance Plan should be consistent with those set through agency strategic and performance planning processes. As funding levels are finalized through the Budget Process, agencies must update their FY 202 5 APP as applicable to reflect budgeted resources as well as other policies or directives provided to the agency SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 240 through OMB Passback. In addition to incorporating budget policies or other guidance provided in Passback, current fiscal year performance goals should also be updated to reflect final congressional action on appropriations and other changes in external conditions or management priorities as necessary. Program activities are a key organizing component that connects budget and funding requests as part of the coordinated strategies for achieving goals and objectives in the agency Strategic Plan. Thus, strategic goals and objectives in the performance plan should capture efforts for all program activities in the budget request , and support the implementation strategies for achieving strategic objectives and performance goals . Agencies may aggregate, disaggregate, or consolidate program activities for the purposes of aligning performance information and resources as appropriate for the agency size, except that any aggregation or consolidation may not omit or minimize the significance of any program activity constituting a major function or operation for the agency . 240.7 How does the a nnual Agency Performance Plan relate to agency organizational health and organizational performance frameworks? Agency Performance Plans establish performance goals to define the level of performance to be achieved during the year in which the plan is submitted and the next fiscal year . Performance goals should be expressed in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form unless otherwise authorized (i.e., agreed to in advance between the agency and OMB ), and include a balanced set of performance indicators to be used in measuring or assessing progress toward each performance goal, including, as appropriate, customer service, efficiency, output, and outcome indicators. OMB Memorandum M-23-15 , M easuring, Monitoring, and Improving Organizational Health and Organizational Performance in the Context of Evolving Agency Work Environments outlines steps that agencies should take to ensure that agency decisions reg arding work environments continue to improve organizational health and organizational performance . The frameworks and routines outlined in that memorandum should align to and integrate with agency -level and component - level strategic plans, and annual Agenc y Performance Plans. Appendix 1 of M-23 -15 i dentifies a range of example performance indicators for performance goals that may be set for measuring and monitoring organizational health and performance, which should be considered when developing and updating annual Agency Performance Plans . 240.8 Can agencies change performance indicators or measures in the Agency Performance Plan? Yes, a gencies may choose to revise, drop, or add measures in the a nnual Agency Performance Plan, in consultation with OMB , in order to reflect the analyses and results of organizational learning obtained through the agency 's strategic review or other data-driven reviews conducted throughout the year . Agencies should include a consolidated list or summary of changes in the FY 2025 APP that identifies performance measures that are added or dropped compared to the prior year' s published FY 202 4 APP. Agencies should still report FY 2023 results of any performance goals and indicators that will be discontinued in the FY 2025 APP but were originally identified in the FY 202 4 APP. Targets for dropped measures no longer need to be set as part of the FY 202 5 APP. 240.9 Wha t content should be included in the a nnual Agency Performance Plan and how will it be published? The content table in section 210 est ablishes what information must be included in the a nnual Agency Performance Plan , and describes requirements for publication of the APP on Performance.gov. Section 210 should also be considered in conjunction with section 51 on Basic Justification Materials. Agencies that are required to establish Agency Priority Goals on Performance.gov will also be expected to publish Agency Performance Plan information on Performance.gov. The FY 2025 A gency Performance Plan will be developed to align with Administration policies and should reflect, where applicable, the agency 's FYs SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING Page 6 of Section 240 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 2024- 2025 APGs. The FY 202 5 Agency Performance Plan will be published concurrent with the agency 's final FY 20 25 congressional budget justification, with all agencies producing a full agency performance plan for posting on the agency 's website with all required content. The agency 's congressional committees may also require additional information for the performance plan that is submitted to Congress . Machine -Readable. To more fully implement provisions of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 that require agency plans and reports be produced in a searchable, machine-readable format, OMB will continue to work with a small subset of Federal agencies to explore the production of machine-readable components or portions of the ir Agency Performance Plan s and A gency Performance Reports. Producing agency performance plans and reports in a machine -readable format improves accessibility of agency performance data contained within the APP and APR, as well as en hances transparency through advanced data visualization tools. This machine-readable initiative for agency performance plans and reports will be conducted in conjunction with OMB and agency efforts that is also focused on exploring the production of machine-readable components of congressional budget justifications as part of the Budget cycle (see section 22.6). The purpose of the effort will be to identify processes, resources, and best practices in order to inform a timeline and additional guidance for full implementation of machine -readable performance plans and reports required by all Federal agencies in future Budget and Performance Planning and Reporting cycles. 240.10 How should agencies report performance improvement actions for items identified as major management challenges in the Agency Performance Plan ? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (P ub. L. No. 111-352) requires agencies to describe the major management challenges the agency faces as part of the Agency 's Annual Performance Plan. Major management challenges are programmatic or management functions, within or across agencies, and may have greater vulnerability to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement (such as issues the Government Accountability Office identifies as high risk or issues that an Inspector General (IG) identifies) or where failure to pe rform well could seriously affect the ability of an agency or the Federal Government to achieve its mission or goals. Agencies may consider IG recommendations on serious management and performance challenges as well as management issues and risks or areas most critical to the agency 's mission delivery when developing performance goals as part of performance planning, or as an input to the agency 's enterprise risk management planning and processes ( see OMB Circular No. A-123). Where applicable, agencies should highlight instances where a performance goal has been developed as a result of a major management challenge, and include detailed performance information required in section 210 . Agencies should address identified major management challenges in the a nnual Agency Performance Plan as a part of Other Information if not addressed as agency priority or performance goals elsewhere in the performance plan. Agency discussion of major management challenges in the Agency Performance Plan should include: planned actions to address major management challenges; performance goals, indicators and/or milestones used to measure progress for the major management challenges identified; and the agency official (title and office) responsible for resolving such challenges. See section 210 . 240.11 What are data of \"significant value? \" What attributes and dimensions should agencies consider when selecting and gathering data to improve agency progress on goals? Data are most valuable when they are meaningful for analyzing progress and identifying ways to improve performance. Data need to be sufficiently accurate and timely to inform a decision, behavior, or outcome by those who have the authority to take action to drive progress towards mission, service, and stewardship outcomes . For information to be actionable, it must be prepared in a format appropriate for the user. A first step for agencies will be to identify data sources that are already available and assess whether they adequately measure the performance goal or other indicator of interest. Agencies may be able to adapt SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 240 existing data, or they may find that new data sources will need to be developed. Data attributes to consider include: Frequency \u2014How often should the data be collected in order to impact future perfor mance? How quickly is it needed to make sound decisions? Annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily? Time \u2014Is the time of day, day of the week, or week of the year likely to correlate with performance or causal factors affecting performance (e.g.; time o f incidents, demand patterns)? If so, is it worth tagging performance indicators with this information so that they can be sorted to see variations in performance patterns across time? Users \u2014Who uses the data to learn from experience, improve performance, or make decisions and for what purpose? Are they responsible for achieving the task, accountable for accomplishing it, potentially supportive of the endeavor, likely to be consulted due to their expertise, or do they need to be kept informed? Are they in central offices, field offices, among delivery partners, the public or the Congress? What does that information -using role imply for the form, timing, collection and dissemination of the collected indicators? Format \u2014How will people use th e information and what format is most conducive to its use? Methods \u2014How are data collected or delivered and what methods are used to get feedback on the data to continually improve its quality or usefulness? What challenges related to data collection may impact its use? Context and Analysis \u2014What analysis and evaluation will be needed in order to be able to use the data to make decisions or improve performance? Cost\u2014How costly or burdensome is the data collection or analysis before it can be put to use ? Other Indicators are Sometimes Essential for Interpreting Performance Indicators Some performance indicators require context and analysis to interpret the agency 's performance trends accurately, so other indicators are needed to accompany performance indicators. Here are a few examples: Other indicators: When an agency faces a process backlog and sets a target to reduce the backlog, it is not sufficient to track only the size of the backlog or the percent of applications processed within the threshold processing time set. It is also essential to track in put indicators (e.g.; the number of applications coming in to the agency) and output indicators (e.g.; number of applications processed by the agency) for the same time period to interpret accurately the agency 's performance addressing the backlog. Exte rnal factor indicators: When an agency reviews the performance across field offices or delivery partners, meeting indicator targets does not always mean the intended outcome is being achieved. The number of people receiving jobs after participating in a state 's employment readiness program could be very high as compared to another program in a different state. In that situation, contextual indicators may be critical to understanding the performance of individual delivery units. The participants, economic conditions, or level of demand for services in an area may be critical to interpreting the job placement rates and for finding effective practices for improving performance. SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING Page 8 of Section 240 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 240.12 How do performance measurement and evaluation complement each other in the Federal Performance Framework? Performance measurement and evaluation should generally be viewed as two of the key tools available to help policymakers and program managers develop systematic evidence in order to support decision-making, understand how well policies and programs are working, and identify or promote possible changes that improve performance. Both evaluation and performance measurement generate informa tion that falls along the continuum of evidence, serve as methods for systematic assessment, and aim to facilitate learni ng about and improve results of government activities. While often undertaken separately, collaboration between performance measurement and evaluation teams can lead to stronger evidence -building. For example, opportunities in which the two may work hand in hand include: Performance measurement can help identify priority questions to be addressed by evaluations, informing decisions about allocating evaluation resources. Evaluation findings can clarify which indicators are predictive of an activity 's success and should be tracked in performance measurement. Performance measurement can identify outliers in performance (either poor or strong) that warrant evaluation, while e valuation can provide context and potential explanations for variation over time or across sites revealed by performance measurement. When performance measures suggest that many participants in a program experience a certain outcome, evaluation can confirm (or refute) whether that is directly attributable to the program by comparing outcomes seen in a control or comparison group when possible. Performance measurement can suggest to evaluators what types of indicators are important to program operators and might thus be useful to include in selecting evaluation measures . 240.13 What kind of evidence is considered appropriate for use in managing organizational performance under the GPRA Modernization Act ? For the purpose of managing performance under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 and the Federal Performance Framework , evidence as a general construct should be viewed and approached as the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid. This view of evidence does not d isplace the definitions of key terms provided for in the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018 ( \"Evide nce Act\" ) related to and 'statistical purposes' (see section 200.22 ), as information produced by ' statistical activities ' with a 'statistical purpose ' is potentially useful when assessing policies or programs . However , approaching evidence more broadly as a body of information in the context of performance management and the Federal Performance Framework is used to illustrate how it should be applied to support and advance the organizational performance and goal s/objective s/outcome s articulated by agencies' strategic and performance plans. Evidence can be quantitative or qualitative and may come from a variety of sources or include various components , including foundational fact finding (e.g., aggregate indicators, exploratory studies, descriptive statistics, and other research), performance measurement, policy analysis, and program evaluations. Evidence has varying degrees of credibility, and the strongest evid ence generally comes from a portfolio of high- quality , credible sources rather than a single study. The Figure below , which is also found in OMB Memorandum M -19-23 , pr ovides a graphical depiction of how these sources combine to represent the components of evidence. SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 240 The credible use of evidence in decision -making requires an understanding of what conclusions can be drawn from the information, and equally important, what conclusions cannot be drawn. For example, multiple impact and implementation evaluations may provide strong evidence that a particular intervention is effective with a particular population, but it may be less definitive on how effective that intervention would be in other settings or with different populations. Quasi-experimental evidence from large, d iverse samples of administrative data may address concerns about generalizability, but could lack definitive evidence on causality or be silent on important outcomes not captured in the administrative data. Descriptive analyses from Federal statistical ser ies provide context to examine societal and economic trends over time , but do not speak to program outcomes or impacts . Qualitative evidence can complement other evidence on outcomes and impacts by providing insight or cont ext into how programs and practic es can be successfully implemented with particular populations and under what circumstances (see Section 200 for definitions of the different types of evaluation) . This is a broad definition of evidence, and portfolios of evidence have varying degrees of credibility. The \"intended use \" of evidence compels agencies to set expectations for levels of credibility that are aligned to and appropriate for the specific purpose for which the portfolio of evidence , including specific activities, will be used. It is important that agencies use the appropriate tools and methods to answer the questions of interest. SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING Page 10 of Section 240 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 240.14 What can be used to measure performance in areas where quantifiable performance goals cannot be developed ? When agencies cannot express a performance goal in a quantifiable form for a particular program, an \"alternative form \" performance goal or suite of indicators may be used instead. For example, milestones are often used as the basis of an alternative form performance goal. In other cases, the attainment or maintenance of a third -party, established, standard can be a qual itative, measurable performance goal, such as obtaining an unmodified audit opinion on the agency' s financial statements. For certain programs, a suite of indicators in lieu of a performance goal will be appropriate. Evaluations and other assessment tools may also be helpful . 240.15 How should evidence, aside from performance goals and indicators, be incorporated in the Agency Performance Plan ? Evidence can include many sources, such as foundational fact finding, performance measurement, policy analysis, and program evaluation. Each of these sources can support agencies as they carry out their missions, though may do so in different ways. When combined, various sources of evidence can be combined to create a portfolio of evidence, each piece of which may p rovide information about a different aspect of a particular program, policy, or organization. While some evidence can help agencies determine whether a program is effective, others can address whether a policy is being implemented as intended or if an intervention is reaching its target popula tion. Evidence is a critical tool to help agencies ensure that resources are used in the smartest way possible to achieve intended impacts and continuous improvement. Thus, using evidence to support budget, management, programmatic, policy, and regulatory decisions is critical to make government work effectively . Whereas agencies will use their Annual Evaluation Plan to describe the significant evaluation s that they plan to conduct following from the agency 's Learni ng Agenda , other priorities, and evaluations required by Congress, agencies should demonstrate the use of evidence throughout their FY 2024 budget submissions, in particular illustrating how evidence will support agency assessments of performance goals and implementation strategies in the Annual Agency Performance Plan and final congressional budget justification. In the Agency 's Annual Performance Plan , an agency 's use of evidence may focus on identify ing which evidence is needed and articulating how it will be used to measure progress in achieving performance goals and objective s. This may be a part of the evidence-building activities outlined in the agency 's Learning Agenda, but the Learning Agenda will include evidence -building activities that go beyond performance measurement . See section 210. 240.16 What is required by the GPRA Modernization Act on lower -priority program activities ? Agencies are required to identify lower -priority program activities as a part of the performance planning process and final budget submission for FY 2025 . In cases where small agencies have only one program activity in the President 's Budget the agency may disaggregate the program activity for the purposes of identifying lower -priorities appropriate to the agency 's size. 240.17 How do agencies prepare and publish their lower-priority program activities to meet the reporting intent of this provision of the Act ? Program Activities are the main organizing unit around which agency budget and funding requests are structured. As changes to resource and/or funding requests are reflected from one fiscal year to the next , agency budget submissions to OMB necessarily reflect those program activities upon which an agency places a lower -priority on the program activity relative to the funding requested in previous years. Thus, it SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 240 is through the annual B udget process that facilitates production of the annual President 's Budget then that agencies prepare and publish their lower -priority program activities and therefore meet the reporting intent of this provision of the GPRA Modernization Act. As in previous years, OMB work s with agencies through the annual Budget process to approve and finalize lower -priority program activity lists as part of publi shing the President 's Budget. Agencies must publish in the agency 's performance plan a clear reference to the President 's Budget for the agency 's lower priorities such as \"The President' s Budget identifies the lower - priority program activities, as required under the GPRA Modernization Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b)(10). The public can access the volume at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget. \" 240.18 The GPRA Modernization Act requires each agency to make available on the web an update on agency performance. How and when will agencies annually publish the final A gency Performance Plan? Since the passage of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 , agencies have been aligning the annual performance plan and report with the agency 's congressional budget justification, both to improve the accessibility and usefulness of agency performance reporting for stakeholders, as well as to reduce the burden of duplicative planning and reporting timelines. The FY 20 25 Agency Performance Plan should be developed to align with and publish concurrent with the agency 's final FY 20 25 congressional budget justification. The timeline and key milestones for development and publication of the FY 2025 A ge ncy Performance Plan are identified in section 200 , with those dates aligned to section 25, which provides key dates for Budget development. Agencies must first submit electronically the draft Agency Performance Plan to OMB for review September 11, 2023 by posting it on the agency 's Performance Submission Portal acces sible from OMB 's Performance Portal page on MAX Community. N otification to the Congress is transmitted electronically by the agency head when released publicly concurrent with the President' s Budget in February . When delivering notification to the Congress, agencies should also notify the President by emailing the OMB Director at performance@omb.eop.gov . Agencies shall post a copy of the final document on the agency 's website and provide a hyperlink to the plan on Performance.gov. Related submission questions should be emailed to perfo r mance@omb.eop.gov . 240.19 How does the Agency Performance Plan relate to the agency 's enterprise architecture? Once an agency 's Performance Plan is established, agencies should ensure that the enterprise architecture planning documents are consistent with achieving the agency goals and objectives. This will require direct alignment of the capital and enterprise architecture planning efforts to meet the strategic objectives and performance goals in agency strategic and annual performance plans, to the extent that information technology resources are critical to the achievement of those objectives and goals. ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORTING 240.20 What is the a nnual Agency Performance Report (APR)? The annual Agency Performance Report (APR) provides information on the agency 's progress achieving the goals and objectives described in the agency 's Strategic Plan and Performance Plan, including progress on strategic objectives, performance goals and Agency Priority Goal s. It is the primary organizational document for detailed, comprehensive organizational performance reporting of results and progress, comparing actual performance achieved against goals and objectives established. The term Agency Performance Report means the same as the performance section of the Performance and Accountability SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING Page 12 of Section 240 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Report (PAR) published by agencies in November, or the Agency Performance Report that is published by agencies in February concurrent with their APP and congressional budget justifications . 240.21 The GPRA Modernization Act requires \" more frequent updates of actual performance on indicators that provide data of significant value to the Government, Congress, or program partners at a reasonable level of administrative burden.\" How will agencies meet this requirement ? Agencies report progress quarterly on Priority Goals of the Administration on Performance.gov. In addition, Cross -Agency Priority (CAP) Goal progress is updated quarterly by CAP Goal Leaders in coordination with the GSA, OMB and contributing agencies. All agencies are encouraged to report performance on their other performance goals more frequently t h an annually, if cost-effective, valuable , or required by Executive Order or other OMB memoranda and guidance to a gencies. Each agency should determine the areas and kinds of information where more frequent data will lead to better decisions by the public, field offices, and delivery partners that generate more value and/or lower cost. Agencies should use their own websites to provide more frequent performance updates, where cost effective or required , and explore opportunities for establishing Application Programming Interface (API) feeds directly to Performance.gov. See \"actionable information/data of significant value\" in section 200. 240.22 The GPRA Modernization Act requires each agency to make available on the website of the agency an update on agency performance. When are agencies required to publish the annual Agency Performance Report? With the passage of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, agencies have been aligning the annual performance plan and report with the agency 's congressional budget justification, both to improve the accessibility and usefulness of agency performance reporting for stakeholders, as well as to reduce the burden of duplicative planning and reporting timelines. Agencies are required to publish their FY 20 23 Agency Performance Report with their FY 20 25 Agency Performance Plan and final FY 20 25 congressional budget justification on February 5, 2024 . Small agencies maintain the flexibility to publish the Annual Performance Report (APR) for FY 20 23 on the agency 's website as a Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) (November 20 23), but are encouraged to produce a combined annual performance plan and report where the capacity for doing so exists. 240.23 How are agencies expected to work with OMB or Congress in the preparation of the performance report ? When preparing an agency -specific Annual Performance Report, agency staff and OMB should discuss the presentation and work out any concerns, if needed, in advance of the submission of the reports to the Congress. Agencies are encouraged to reach out to th e Congress, where possible, to obtain input on how they might improve their communication of performance information to the Congress. Agencies should work with their legislative affairs offices to determine the best ways to consult with the Congress. 240.24 How do agencies deliver the report to the President, Congress and the public? Agencies shall make the annual Agency Performance Report available on the agency 's website. A hyperlink to the agency performance report will also be published via Performance.gov . For notification to the President, agencies should post final reports on the agency 's website, and email the Director of OMB at email performance@om b. eop.gov w ith the hyperlink to the published report. SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 240 Agencies should notify the Congress electronically of the availability of the final Annual Performance Report. The report notification must be from the head of the agency, but may be transmitted elec tronically by his or her delegate. An agency may add other signatories, such as the Deputy Secretary, Chief Operating Officer, Performance Improvement Officer or Chief Financial Officer, as necessary to the transmittal, thus recognizing a shared responsib ility within the agency. Transmittal letters to the Congress are addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate and the President pro tempore of the Senate. Copies of the congressional transmittal are sent electronically, unless otherwise requested in print by the Congress, to the chair and ranking minority members of the budget committees, relevant authorization and oversight committees, appropriation subcommittees, and the chair and ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Agencies should work with their legislative affairs and congressional staff to determine the optimal way to transmit notification to the Congress. If an agency performance update includes any program activity or information that is specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and is proper ly classified, the head of the agency will make such information available in a classified appendix . 240.25 Should agencies consolidate the Agency Performance Report with the Agency Performance Plan? Generally, y es (see 210 for exceptions during Presidential election and transition years) . To streamline agency planning and reporting of performance information for stakeholders and more efficiently manage duplicative planning and reporting timelines, agencies are strongly encouraged, but not required, to consolidate the Agency Performance Plan and Agency Performance Report. Agencies are required to provide a hyperlink to Performance.gov from the agency 's website where the Agency Performance Report is published. 240.26 What information should the annual Agency Performance Report contain ? Agency Performance Reports should clearly articulate how the work of the agency benefits the public, enable the public to understand the actions agencies have taken to make progress and explain what the agency is doing to improve performance. The APR must address the content established in section 210, with agencies encouraged to format the APR by strategic goal and objective. The APR should include summary assessment s of progress as described in sections 210 and 260 for strategic objectives, and focus on comparing and reporting results achieved against performance goals and associated measures and indicators established in the A gency's Annual Performance Plan. Agencies must still report the FY 20 22 results of any performance goals and indicators that will be discontinued by the agency in future performance plans, and targets for dropped measures no longer need to be set or included in the FY 2025 Performance Plan , which covers both FYs 2024 and 2025. 240.27 What other parts selectively apply to the Agency Performance Report, as applicable? The following parts selectively apply to agencies. Information on use of non-Federal parties. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 states that preparation of an annual report is an inherently governmental function. However, the report should include an acknowledgment of the role and a brief description of any significant contribution made by a non -Federal entity in supporting preparation of the report. SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING Page 14 of Section 240 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Classified appendices not available to the public. Agencies that conduct classified activities may prepare a classified appendix for the Annual Performance Plan. Also, if an agency believes that reporting of actual performanc e will impede goal achievement, a non -public appendix may be prepared for the Annual Performance Report. Agencies should consult with OMB to determine whether such an appendix is necessary . 240.28 How should agencies assess the completeness, reliability, and quality of performance data reported in the Agency Performance Report ? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires agencies to prepare information on the reliability of data presented in the Agency Performance Report . Agencies may develop a single data verification and validation appendix used to communicate the agency' s approaches, and/or may also choose to provide information about data quality wherever the performance information is communicated (e.g., websites). Agencies should discuss their verification and validation techniques with their respective OMB Resource Management Office, if necessary. The transmittal letter included in Annual Performance Reports must contain an assessment by the agency head of the completeness and reliability of the performance data presented and a description of agency plans to improve completeness, reliability, and quality, where needed. Data limitations. In order to assess the progress towards achievement of performance goals, the performance data must be appropriately valid and reliable for intended use. Significant or known data limitations should be identified to include a description of the limitatio ns, the impact they have on goal achievement, and the actions that will be taken to correct the limitations. Performance data need not be perfect to be valid and reliable to inform management decision-making. Agencies can calibrate the accuracy of the data to the intended use of the data and the cost of improving data quality. At the same time, significant data limitations can lead to bad decisions resulting in lower performance or inaccurate performance assessments. Examples of data limitations include imprecise measurement and recordings, incomplete data, inconsistencies in data collection procedures and data that are too old and/or too infrequently collected to allow quick adjustments of agency action in a timely and cost -effective way. Verification and validation. Verification and validation of performance data support the general accuracy and reliability of performance information, reduce the risk of inaccurate performance data, and provide a sufficient level of confidence to the Congress and the public that the information presented is credible as appropriate to its intended use. The GAO defines verification as a process of checking or testing performance information to assess other types of errors, such as errors in keying data. The GAO defines validation as an effort to ensure that data are free of systematic error or bias and that what is intended to be measured is actually measured. See GAO's Performance Plans: Selected Approaches f o r Verification and Validation of Agency Performance Information . Agencies should have in place verification and validation (V&V) techniques that will ensure the completeness and reliability of all performance measurement data contained in their Annual Ag ency Performance Plans and Reports as appropriate to the intended use of the data. In addition, the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) through an interagency working group, has developed a Data Quality Maturity Model and Example Practices guidebook to assist agencies in improving their data quality programs over time. Copies of the guidebook can be obtained by emailing the PIC directly at PICStaff@pic.gov . The guidance that follows provides agencies with a list of reasonable V&V criteria that when applied should increase the level of confidence the Congress and the public have in the performance information presented. Agency internal assessments. Agencies are encouraged to consider the verification and validation factors outlined below. SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 15 of Section 240 1. Standards and procedures Source data are well defined, documented; definitions are available and used. Collection standards are documented/available/used. Data r eporting schedules are documented/distributed/followed. Supporting documentation is maintained and readily available. Collection staff are skilled/trained in proper procedures. 2. Data entry and transfer Data entry methodology is documented and followed. Data are verified as appropriate to the needed level of accuracy. Procedures for making changes to previously entered data are documented and followed. Data are available when needed for reporting, learning and critical decision -making cycles. Data entry staf f are skilled and trained in proper procedures. 3. Data integrity Whenever possible, data should be returned to data suppliers with value added so that data suppliers benefit from the analysis of the data and are engaged to improve its quality over time. Third -party measurement is often preferable to self -measurement. Administrative data that is used for other purposes and validated by its use can be a source of high-quality performance data at a relatively low cost . 4. Data quality and limitations Accuracy lim its of all data are appropriate to their intended use. Data limitations are explained and documented. Method for handling anomalous data is established and used, not just to isolate data artifacts but also to search for promising practices to validate and possibly solve problems needing attention. Third party evaluations are conducted. Use of externally controlled data is documented. 5. Oversight and certifications Accountability for data accuracy exists in a responsible employee' s performance standards. Resp onsible officials certify that procedures were followed each reporting period. Responsible officials certify that data accuracy has been checked each reporting period. External Assessments. External assessments, such as evaluations and peer reviews can b e helpful to determine data or information gaps and whether changes in performance trends are attributable, in whole or in part, to agency action or to other factors. Agencies are expected to consider the available evidence, including any available evaluation results, when conducting this analysis. As appropriate, such analysis should consider whether the goals and indicators have been validated through 1) research to be well correlated with ultimate outcomes; 2) implications of available research on the appropriateness of the measure; and 3) the relative strength or weakness of the measure overall. Agencies should determine when and how to complement performance measurement with evaluations or other high-quality external assessments to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the data being reported. External Audits. It is important to note the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 does not require the use of audits for performance data contained in Annual Agency Performance Plans or Reports. SECTION 2 40\u2014ANNUAL AGENCY PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND REPORTING Page 16 of Section 240 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Scope. Beca use most agencies process a large amount of performance measurement data, agencies should apply judgment when deciding which performance indicators will be verified and validated. Agencies should consider priorities, spending, GAO high risk lists, IG reports and management challenges. Frequency of Validation and Verification. Agencies should determine the appropriate frequency of validation and verification needed for the intended use and should allocate appropriate resources to carry out validation and verification on an appropriately periodic basis. Data presented annually should typically be validated annually or biennially. Agency Head Responsibility. Agency heads are officially accountable for the accuracy and reliability of performance data. The agency head shall include in the transmittal letter of the agency 's APR a brief statement on the completeness and reliability of the performance data, and on what data limitations exist. 240.29 How does the update to OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix A, Management of Reporting and Data Integrity Risk affect agency preparation of the Agency Performance Plan and Agency Performance Report? OMB Circular No. A- 123, Appendix A, pr ovides updated guidance to agencies that integrates internal control over reporting (ICOR) with enterprise risk management (ERM) processes, and assurances over internal control . Specifically, the 2018 update to OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix A expanded internal controls from financial reporting (internal controls over financial reporting, e.g., ICOFR ) to all reporting objectives (internal controls over reporting, e.g., ICOR). By aligning the updated Appendix A to the agency 's ERM processes, agency management should apply their analysis of risk in the agency 's risk profiles across a portfolio view of the agency 's objectives (e.g., Strategic, Operations, Reporting, and Compliance Objectives - see OMB Circular No. A-123) when deciding where internal co ntrols will be most effectively employed to those reporting objectives where inaccurate, unreliable, or outstanding reporting would significantly impact the agency 's ability to accomplish its mission and performance go als or objectives. Importantly, manage ment decisions to apply ICOR should not be done against the entire Annual Agency Performance Plan or Annual Agency Performance Report. Rather, management decision s to apply ICOR should be made at the individual performance goal and indicator level, applying only in those instances where: th e re is a significant risk that a material reporting error may impact achievement of the agency 's mission objectives; and application of ICOR is likely to cost effectively mitigate that risk. SECTION 2 50\u2014A GENCY PRIORITY GOALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Section 250 SECTION 2 50 - A GENCY PRIORITY GOALS Table of Contents 250.1 To which agencies does this section apply? 250.2 What is an Agency Priority Goal? 250.3 What primary criteria must agencies use in their setting Agency Priority Goals? 250.4 What additional criteria should agencies consider when developing Agency Priority Goals? 250.5 Can multiple agencies work together to set joint Agency Priority Goals? 250.6 Do all Agency Priority Goals have to address outcomes? 250.7 For what purpose will OMB review selection of the Agency Priority Goals? 250.8 How many Agency Priority Goals should agencies have? 250.9 What time period do Agency Priority Goals span? 250.10 What is the relationship of Agency Priority Goals to the agency Strategic Plan, Annual Performance Plan and Annual Performance Report? 250.11 What happens to the old Agency Priority Goals after the two -year performance period has ended and a new set of Agency Priority Goals is established? 250.12 How does the final quarterly update of a two -year Agency Priority Goal cycle differ from other quarterly updates during the two- y ear performance period ? 250.13 How does a Presidential transition year affect quarterly progress reviews and reporting of Agency Priority Goals? 250.14 When must agencies next establish or update their Agency Priority Goals, and what is the relationship between APGs and the FY 202 3 Presiden t's Budget ? 250.15 What Agency Priority Goal information will be made public? 250.16 How should agencies construct APG Goal Statements, and are they required to include specific quantitative targets within the Agency Priority Goal statement? 250.17 Do all Agency Priority Goals (APGs) have to relate to a Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal? 250.18 What is the timeline for agencies to begin developing the next cycle of Agency Priority Goals covering FYs 202 4 -2025? 250.19 How much external stakeholder engagement is expected in Agency Priority Goals development? 250.20 How should agencies engage Congress in the Agency Priority Goals development process? 250.21 Can Agency Priority Goals be changed after they have been approved and published? If so, by what criteria and process? Summary of Chang es Changes the range of A gency P riority Goals (APGs) to be established by agencies each two -year cycle from 2 -8 to 2- 6. Updates the planning timeline for development and publication of the FYs 2024- 2025 APG cycle. 250.1 To which agencies does this section apply ? The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 requires th ose Federal agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 to submit Agency Priority Goal (APG) information to OMB and to review SECTION 2 50\u2014AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS Page 2 of Section 250 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) progress on the APGs at least on a quarterly basis. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 provided the OMB Director discretion to determine which agencies need or do not need to set Priority Goals. While non-CFO Act agencies and agency components are not r equired to set Agency Priority Goals, OMB strongly encourages all agencies to follow the practice of prioritizing the goals they have in their strategic and annual plans and to adopt the measurement and management practices that are established for the Priority Goals. These practices include organization leaders and other managers frequently reviewing progress on specific priorities to figure out how to improve performance and resolve problems . 250.2 What is an Agency Priority Goal ? An Agency Priority Goal (APG) supports improvements in near -term outcomes, customer experience, or efficiencies, and advances progress toward longer -term, outcome -focused strategic goals and objectives in the agency 's Strategic Plan. It is a near -term result or achievement that leadership wants to accomplish within approximately 2-years that relies predominantly on agency execution to be accomplished, not new legislation or additional funding. Agency Priority Goals reflect the top implementation -focused, performance improvement priorities of agency leadership and the Administration, and therefore do not reflect the full scope of the agency mission. The need to identify Agency Priority Goals stimulates conversation s and requires decisions about agency priorities, trade -offs, measurement, evidence, strategies, timing, and those responsible for leading implementation efforts. At least quarterly reviews of progress on Agency Priority Goals led by agency leaders are in tended to keep all levels of the organization focused on the goals and ensure that sufficient time, resources, and attention are allotted to addressing specific problems or opportunities related to the goal. The identification of a limited number of Age ncy Priority Goals does not mean that other agency goals are unimportant. Agencies may have important goals in their Strategic Plans or performance plans as well as legislative and policy priorities. They may also have other priorities that do not lend t hemselves well to specific, measurable, near -term targets. Agencies should consider all agency goals and activities on a spectrum of priority levels and allocate resources and management attention accordingly . 250.3 What primary criteria must agencies use in their setting Agency Priority Goals ? Agency Priority Goals must: 1. Advance priorities for agency leadership and the Administration; 2. Rely predominantly on strong agency execution to be accomplished, not new legislation or additional funding; Align with the resource levels proposed in the President 's Budget (or as appropriated by the Congress) 3. Support improvements in near -term outcomes, customer service, or efficiencies, and advance progress toward longer -term outcome-focused goals in the agency 's Strategic Plan ; The submission to OMB demonstrates how the Agency Priority Goal supports a strategic objective included in the agency Strategic Plan SECTION 2 50\u2014AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 250 The goal statement clearly identifies the problem or opportunity the agency is trying to address and is f ramed or written concisely and in a way that can be easily understood by the public . 4. Be able to discern if the goal has been achieved by the end of the 2 -year period; The Agency Priority Goal has indicators and quarterly milestones to track progress The goal statement has a clear completion date, target, and indicator(s) (which can be measured or marked by a milestone to gauge progress) 5. Be ambitious yet achievable within the 2 -year period. OMB encourages agencies to develop clear and concise goal statements that will drive and easily communicate performance improvement throughout the agency and to external audiences. However, if an agency strongly believes that multiple targets in the goal statement are integral to achieving the goal or an alternative form performance goal is warranted, the agency should discuss with OMB . 250.4 What additional criteria should agencies consider when developing Agency Priority Goals ? Agencies should consider several additional criteria when developing Agency Priorit y Goals: Objectives set forth in the President 's State of the Union Address, Executive Orders , or management priorities or initiatives identified by the Administration in memoranda ; The views and priorities of the Congress and other stakeholders; Whether quarterly reviews are likely to speed progress on the goal . For example, while in some instances only annual data may be available , the use of quarterly milestones may be appropriate for the established APG; Areas where cross-component /Bureau or cross-agency coordination is needed to improve outcomes; Potential to improve understanding of the agency 's impact on people or communities; Potential to improve efficiencies by: o Maintaining a level of performance at a lower cost; o Improving perfor mance levels at a lower cost; o Improving performance levels at the same cost; o Improving performance levels to a greater degree than costs are increased; and o Potential to reduce unnecessary overlap and duplication. Generally, goals should take into accou nt the available evidence, including any available evaluation results, and whether the goals and indicators have been validated through research. This should be well correlated with ultimate outcomes, implications of available research on the appropriatene ss of the measure, and SECTION 2 50\u2014AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS Page 4 of Section 250 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) whether the available research indicates that the use of the measure may encourage negative unintended consequences . Additionally, agencies are encouraged to consider continuation of an APG goal area from one two -year cycle to the next where the goal area remains a priority to the Agency head, agency leadership, and Administration. In such instances, the APG goal area being continued would be revised to reflect more ambitious performance indicator targets in the goal statement and organizational learning generated by previous quarterly data -driven reviews. 250.5 Can multiple agencies work together to set joint Agency Priority Goals? Yes. Advancing outcomes in certain programmatic policy areas or priorities may be strengthened throu gh shared strategy development and implementation that require collaboration and coordination across multiple agencies. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) collaborated with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on initiatives to reduce vetera ns homelessness while the Department of State (DOS ) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have used a joint APG to lead efforts to control the HIV epidemic in select countries while also leveraging the expert ise of other government agencies contributing to this work including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) , the Department of Defense ( DoD), the Department of Labor ( DoL), the Department of the Treasury, and the Peace Corps. Agencies are encour aged to consider setting joint APGs in such areas. When setting joint APGs, agencies should also establish regular quarterly joint performance reviews to help align the identification and resolution of barriers across program silos . 250.6 Do all Agency Priority Goals have to address outcomes? Agency Priority Goals should support improved outcomes which can include the quality of agency interactions with the public, improvements in the effectiveness or efficiency of agency operations or the achievement o f the agency 's long-term goals described in its Strategic Plan. When output goals are used, the agency must have appropriately robust evidence demonstrating a link between the output and the outcome goal or well -developed logic showing how progress on the output targets is likely to influence the outcomes, with a plan to confirm the logic over the longer term . 250.7 For what purpose will OMB review selection of the Agency Priority Goals? OMB will review proposed Agency Priority Goals by the criteria outli ned above, as well as for submission completeness, quality, and the ambitiousness of the target. Ultimately, Agency Priority Goals should reflect the priorities of the agency 's senior leaders and the Administration, informed by the views of the Congress and other stakeholders . 250.8 How many Agency Priority Goals should agencies have ? Agencies should identify between 2 and 6 Agency Priority Goals. When determining the number of goals, each agency should consider: Agency mission, size and scope; and Input, as appropriate, from congressional authorizers and appropriators, OMB, White House policy councils, program and management leadership, delivery partners, the public, and other key stakeholders. SECTION 2 50\u2014A GENCY PRIORITY GOALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 250 250.9 What time period do Agency Priority Goals span? The Agency Priority Goals are two -year goals, although they can contribute to longer -term goals. Agencies have the flexibility to describe the longer -term goals in the APG \"Overview. \" Indicators used to track progress against the goals should cover the full fiscal year to the extent possible, and quarterly indicators and/or milestones will follow the fiscal year quarters. Agencies may choose monthly indicators and milestones, if preferred . 250.10 What is the relationship of Agency Priority Goals to the agency Strategic Plan, Annual Performance Plan and Annual Performance Report ? Agency Priority Goals are a subset of an agency 's performance goals and should be those that represent the highest implementation priorities of the agency leader and the Administration and are not dependent on new legislation or new funding to accomplish within a 2- year period. In most cases, Agency Priority Goals will directly contribute to the advancement of at least one strategic objective. Agency Strategic Plans and annual Agency Performance Plans should reflect agency priorities among activities planned, including incorporation of the Agency Priority Goals. Agencies should discuss and provide a summary of progress made in the a nnual Agency Performance Report. See section 210. 250.11 What happens to the old Agency Priority Goals after the two -year performance period has ended and a new set of Agency Priority Goals is established ? The Agency Priority Goals of previous cycles (e.g., FYs 2016 -2017, FYs 2018 -2019) are archived and remain publicly available on Performance.gov. Agencies may want to continue to track progress on ' retired ' Agency Priority Goals and related indicators as part of their a nnual Performance Report as, for example, a performance goal and where aligned with the current Administration policy. A discussion of the final results of progress of APGs should be included in the applicable A gency Performance Report. In some cases, agencies may choose to set a new target for an Agency Priority Goal after an initial two- year performance cycle has been completed. When setting new Agency Priority Goals, agencies may opt to reset, reframe, or maintain an existing goal if needed . 250.12 How d oes the final quarterly update of a two -year Agency Priority Goal cycle differ from other quarterly updates during the two -year performance period ? Agencies will follow the usual quarterly updating process for the final quarterly update of any APG implementation and reporting cycle (e.g., FY 20 23, Quarter 4 of the FYs 20 22-2023 cycle ) while also being required to include a clear statement in the quarterly update and Implementation Action Plan that definitively states whether the goal was achieved relative to the goal 's impact and achievement statement s. This summary of p erformance statement will help the public, delivery partners, and other stakeholders understand performance achievements in accordance with the goal target(s). 250.13 How does a Presidential transition year affect quarterly progress reviews and reporting of Agency Priority Goals ? The GPRA Modernization Act requires agencies to report quarterly updates of progress made towards achieving Agency Priority Goals to a centralized website: Performance.gov . These APGs are intended to focus efforts toward achieving the priorities of the Administration leadership under which they were established. C onsistent with this intention, in the event that a Presidential election leads to a change in SECTION 2 50\u2014AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS Page 6 of Section 250 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Administration, reporting on the APGs established by a different Administration to Performance.gov is discontinued in a transition year (e.g., 2021) for the remainder of that APG cycle's performance period (e.g., FYs 2020-2021 APG cycle) . Agencies and teams working on implementation efforts of a previous Administration 's APGs should shift the focus of their efforts on furthering the work and activities of goal strategies where they are aligned with the policies and priorities of the current Administration, and report the results of progress as part of any subsequent performance goals or programmatic performance indicators as applicable in the agency 's next Annual Performance Report covering the APG performance period (e.g. FY 2021 APR). Agencies should consult with their appropriate OMB Resource Management Office in determining whether an APG would be aligned with the policy priorities of the current Administration. Additionally, a gencies have flexibility in structuring continued quarterly, data -driven performance reviews where applicable. Such reviews should continue where leadership can utilize the reviews as a mechanism for focusing on the underlying program or programmatic activities contributing to the agency 's goals and priorities, diagnosing problems, and finding opportunities for performa nce and operational improvements . 250.14 When must agencies next establish or update their Agency Priority Goals, and what is the relationship between APGs and the President 's Budget ? Agencies will next establish or update their Agency Priority Goals (APGs) in parallel with the development of the FY 2025 President 's Budget, and cover FYs 2024-202 5. The process for determining, reviewing, and executing Agency Priority Goals complements the budget proc ess. For example, the FYs 20 22-20 23 Agency Priority Goal development were linked to the FY 2023 budget submission process, and agencies were asked to align targets with the resource levels proposed in the FY 20 23 President 's Budget. The FYs 2024- 2025 Agency Priority Goal development should be linked to the FY 202 5 budget submission and accompanying agency organizational strategic and performance planning process es. Agencies will be required to align FYs 2024-2025 APG targets with the resource levels p roposed in the FY 202 5 President 's Budget. If the Congress enacts a resource level that differs significantly from the President 's Budget, agencies may elect to realign targets with enacted levels. To ensure ongoing alignment with Administration budget policy, some targets may need to be revised during the 20 25 budget process, following annual appropriations, or after the enactment of significant authorizations. However, agencies should choose Priority Goals that rely predominantly on implementation and do not require new legislative authority or significant additional funding. This does not preclude the agency from selecting a Priority Goal in an area for which the agency is also requesting additional funding; however , the success of the goal should not depend on new funding. Agencies can pursue goals that require new legislation or funding, but those goals should be reflected in the Strategic and annual Performance Plans and such requests should be made through normal legislative and budget channel s. While the FYs 20 24- 2025 Agency Priority Goal targets will be reviewed as part of the FY 2025 budget process, programs supporting Priority Goals are not specifically protected during the FY 2025 budget deliberations . 250.15 What Agency Priority Goal information will be made public? Information on Priority Goals are published on Performance.gov and must also be included in the agency 's annual Performance Plan and Report, to include a summary discussion of progress made on priority goals per the content table in s ection 210. Progress updates and next steps will continue to be updated each quarter on Performance.gov. See section 210 for additional information and guidance on the report ing of APG information in the agency 's Annual Performance Plan and Report. Additionally, to ensure consistency of reporting and standardize information elements that must be addressed in APG Implementation Action Plans, a reporting template provided by OMB is utilized for APG SECTION 2 50\u2014A GENCY PRIORITY GOALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 250 reporting to Performance.gov. APG Implementation Action Plan reporting templates are available for agency and APG implementation team use on \" Submission Portal > APG pages\" on MAX Community . 250.16 How should agencie s construct APG Goal Statements, and are they required to include specific quantitative targets within the Agency Priority Goal statement ? Successful APGs address a problem, have a set completion date, a target, and an indicator. The format of APG goal statement s will generally include two sentences, written in a concise, plain, narrative form : 1) an impact statement that describes the broader outcome or problem or opportunity being addressed by the goal ; and 2) an achievement statement that clearly reflects what the agency wants to achieve. The achievement statement will start with \"By September 30...\" followed by a quantitative target. A qua ntitative target within a goal statement (e.g., how much of what by when, possibly narrowing by indicating where and/or for whom) is strongly encouraged, as it helps the organization focus on specific actions needed to achieve the goal. However, alternative form or qualitative goal statements may be appropriate in certain cases. Such alternative form goal statements may be supported by milestones that make it possible to assess if progress is being made or, in other circumstances, progress across a suite of indicators. Agencies are encouraged to include baseline data in the goal statement (e.g., reduce by 10 percent from a previous year 's level of baseline), although goals for which data collection will be initiated but for which the data are not yet available are acceptable, provided dates for initiating or continuing data collection are set as milestones. An example of an effective APG goal statement that follows this framework is: Support the global effort to end preventable child and maternal deaths (Impact Statement) . By September 30, 2015, U.S. assistance to end preventable child and maternal deaths will contribute to reductions in under -five mortality in 24 maternal and child health U.S. Government -priority countries by four deaths per 1,000 live births as compared to a 2013 baseline (Achievement Statement). 250.17 Do all Agency Priority Goals (APGs) have to relate to a Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Go al? No. In order for the Federal Government to make progress towards its Cross-Agency Priority Goals, some agencies will have goals that contribute to a CAP Goal, but not all Agency Priority Goals will directly or indirectly contribute to a CAP Goal . 250.18 What is the timeline for agencies to begin developing the next cycle of Agency Priority Goals covering FYs 202 4-202 5? Concurrent with current APG execution activities, OMB, agencies, the Performance Improvement Council , and relevant policy councils will next establish Agency Priority Goals covering FYs 202 4-202 5, developing these goals in parallel with the FY 20 25 President 's Budget process . SECTION 2 50\u2014AGENCY PRIORITY GOALS Page 8 of Section 250 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Date Action June, 2023 (concurrent w/ 20 23 Strategic Review submission) Agencies submit to OMB for review draft impact and achievement statements for FYs 2024 -2025 APGs . *Agencies, in their submission s to OMB, should specifically identify instances in which an APG from the previous two- year cycle will be continued for FYs 2024 -2025 but with a more ambitious performance indicator target . Agency/OMB Strategic Review Meeting Agencies will receive feedback from OMB on proposed APG goal statements as part of the 2023 strategic reviews . September 11, 2023 (concurrent with Budget submission) Agencies submit to OMB draft APG Implementation Action Plans (minus Quarterly update slide s). Final APG goal statements contained in the draft APG Implementation Action Plan s will be used to facilitate OMB review of Goal Statements as part of the FY 2025 Budget process . October 1, 2023 goal period ends. FYs 2024- October 19 FYs 2024- 2025 goal statements published to Performance.gov. February 5, 2024 (concurrent with Budget publication) FYs 20 24-2025 goal statements published on Performance.gov are incorporated and reflected in the FY 2025 Agency Performance Plan . February 9, 2024 Agencies submit initial draft FY 202 4 Q1 Quarterly Performance Updates and Implementation Action Plan s for FYs 202 4-2025 APGs for OMB review . March 1, 2024 Agencies submit final draft FY 202 4 Q1 Quarterly Performance Updates for FYs 202 4- 2025 APGs for OMB review. March 21 , 2024 Agencies p ublish FY 202 4 Updates for FYs 202 4-2025 APGs. 250.19 How much external stakeholder engagement is expected in Agency Priority Goals development ? Agencies are encouraged to consult with the Congress, OMB , and both Federal and non-Federal stakeholders early in the process, beginning in summer 202 3, and discuss possible goal areas before goals are finalized. Agencies should consider the perspectives of entities affected by or interested in the Agency 's Priority Goals when formulating their goals. If stakeholder engagement is a significant barrier, this should be discussed with OMB. Agencies should keep in mind the importance of engaging stakeholders who will be critical to the success of agency efforts, such as bureaus, employees, and delivery partners. 250.20 How should agencies engage Congress in the Agency Priority Goals development process? Agencies should work with their legislative affairs offices to determine the best ways to consult with the Congress on their Priority Goal areas, in advance of defining Agency Priority Goals with OMB. Agencies should consult with the Congress, obtaining both majority and minority views from the appropriate authorizing, appropriations, and oversight committees, on Priority Goal issue areas, generally prior to submitting action plans, but should consult with the OMB examiner while planning for the timing of congressional outreach. Agencies may find it easiest to start discussions about the next set of Agency Priority Goals in the context of providing the Congress an update of progress on current APGs or other agency performance planning efforts for developing new or revised management priorities . SECTION 2 50\u2014A GENCY PRIORITY GOALS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 250 250.21 Can Agency Priority Goals be changed after they have been ap proved and published? If so, by what criteria and process? In general, after they have been approved and published Agency Priority Goals should only be changed in exceptional circumstances. The possibility of missing a target is not a justification for a goal change. Possible justifications for a change include: The agency wants to make the goal more ambitious; The original goal included an error; Intervening events have had a significant impact on the agency 's ability to accomplish the goal; or Enacted appropriations significantly changed the amount of funding available from levels projected during the goal setting process. Proposed changes to APGs that affect the goal statement or goal area must be submitted in writing via email to performance@omb.eop.gov f rom the agency goal leader with the approval of the agency 's Chief Operating Officer and Performance Improvement Officer. The goal change request ed will be directed to the OMB 's Deputy Director for Management, the OMB Associate Director for Performance and Personnel Management and the relevant OMB Program Associate Director with copies provided to the relevant OMB Deputy Associate Director(s) and Branch Chief(s). The memorandum or written correspondence should explain why the goal change is needed, what has changed since the goal was published concurrent with the President 's Budget, why it is necessary to make the change and how the change will be explained to the public. Agencies will also have to write a short summary of the reasoning and justification underpinning the goal change , to be posted on Performance.gov .

Summary of Chang es Adds guidance on establishing routines of data -driven performance reviews of frameworks for organizational health and organizational performance. Updates and streamlines submission requirements to OMB on agency findings and assessments from their internal strategic review of strategic objectives. 260.1 To which agencies does this section apply ? All agencies are required to conduct frequent data-driven orga nizational performance reviews and strategic reviews, which are addressed in this section. All agenci es must follow the public reporting guidelines that discuss and reflect on the organization learning derived by the performance and strategic reviews outlined below. Guidelines for public reporting for S trategic Plans, Annual Performance Plans, and Annual Performance Reports, which will include a progress update by strategic objective for those aligned with the policy priorities of the Administration , are defined in section 210 . Additionally, all agencies will be required to implement activities supporting Enterprise Risk Management guidance found in OMB Circular No. A- 123, Management 's Re sponsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control, as a ppropriate for the agency mission and in accordance with agency -specific programs. Agen cies covered by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act of 1990 must conduct internal strategic reviews and meet the specific standards outlined in this section. This inc ludes producing a Summary of Findings by Strategic Objective that is then follo wed by more formal consultati ve discussions and deliberations between the agency and OMB to discuss the results of their strategic review in the Spring/Summer . 260.2 What is required of other agencies not covered by the CFO Act of 1990 ? Agencies not covered by the CFO Act of 1990 are encouraged to conduct a comprehensive, organizational - wide strategic review that provides an assessment of progress being made against the agency 's strategic objectives in addition to identifying priority questions. However, findings generated from the agency 's strategic review assessment would be discussed informally with the agency 's applicable OMB Resource Management Office. Non -CFO Act agencies are not required to formally meet with OMB during an OMB/agency Strategic Review meeting in Spring/Summer , and encouraged to submit to OMB their SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 260 Summary of Findings by Strategic Objective and priority questions identified in developing their Interim Learning Agenda . 260.3 What is the purpose of this section ? This section provides agency guidance on: Da ta -Driven Performance Reviews (2 60.4-26 0.9): At least quarterly, agency leaders should run data-driven performance reviews on their organization' s priorities to drive progress toward achieving their goals. COOs must run at least quarterly, data-driven reviews on each of the Agency Priority Goals with agency goal leaders or their designees. Many agencies opt to run these reviews on a more frequent c ycle, every six weeks or every month, on every Agency Priority Goal or with every bureau/component. Data-driven reviews can be used to drive progress on specific mission delivery or management issues and priorities. S trategic Reviews (2 60.10-260.29): Annually, agency leaders should review progress on each of the agency 's strategic objectives established by the agency Strategic Plans and updated annually in the Annual Performance Plan. These reviews should inform strategic decision -making, budget formulat ion, and near -term agency actions, as well as preparation of the a nnual Agency Performance Plan and a nnual Agency Performance Report. E nterprise Risk Management (26 0.30-260.33): Agencies should assess and manage risk as a part of strategic and data-driven reviews in support of the broader organizational risk management framework, as appropriate for their missions, and in accordance with OMB Circular No . A-123, Management 's Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control . Guidance found in Part 6 sections 26 0.26-260.29 complements OMB Circ u lar No. A-123. Ag encies should refer to OMB Circular No. A-123 for a complete description of Enterprise Risk Management responsibilities in the Federal Government. In addition to these reviews, OMB, with the support of the Performance Improvement Council (PIC), will c onduct quarterly reviews on the Cross -Agency Priority Goals (CAP Goals) as required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. OMB and the PIC will work directly with agencies as appropriate regarding these reviews. See section 220. DAT A-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE REVIEWS 260.4 What is the purpose of frequent data -driven performance reviews? Conducting routine, data -driven performance reviews led by agency leaders on a limited set of the agency 's performance improvement priorities is a management practice proven to produce better results. Organizational routines of regular , data -driven reviews provide a mechanism for agency leaders to review the organization' s performance and bring together the people, resources, and analysis needed to drive progress on agency priorities, both mission-focused and management goals. Frequent data -driven performance reviews should reinforce the agency 's priorities and establish an agency culture of continuous learn ing and improvement, sending a signal throughout the organization that agency leaders are focused on effective and efficient implementation to improve the delivery of results. Frequent reviews provide a mechanism for agency leaders to keep an agency focused on an identified set of priorities, diagnose problems and opportunities through an analysis of disaggregated data, learn from past experience, and decide next steps to increase performance and productivity through adjustments to resource allocations or other operational improvements . Planning activities related to agency Learning Agendas and Capacity Assessments required by the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 ( i.e., \"Evidence SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 4 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Act\") reinforce this culture of learning and improvement, which is cultivated by the data-driven performance review. For example, OMB Memorandum M-23-15 , M easuring, Monitoring, and Improving Organizational Health and Organizational Performance in the Context of Evolving Agency Work Environments , outline d guidance to help ensure that agency decisions regarding their work environments are aimed to continually improve their organization' s health and organizational performance by establishing an approach for agenc y leaders and managers to regularly take stock of the organizational health and organizational performance (with particular focus at the com ponent -level) of operating units, and use those insights to make decisions on agency work environments. Establish ing routines of data -driven reviews to assess those frameworks , monitoring progress and diagnosing issues related to organizational health and organizational performance on an ongoing basis , is a strategy that is central to ensuring that agency decisions regarding work environments continue to improve organizational health and organizational performance - and that is optimized to support delivery of the agency 's statutory missions. In particular, agency headquarters are expected to develop regular data -driven routines with leadership of their major operating units to review progress on organizational health and performance. Agencies are strongly encouraged to plan for and invest in the capital resources needed to conduct useful, effective routines of data-driven reviews. I n another example, agencies should, as a part of a continuous feedback and process improvement effort, use the results from t he Human Capital Evaluation Framework t o identify areas where improvements to human capital policies and programs are needed to ensure program success. A s part of this evalu ation framework, Chief Human Capital Officers run quarterly HRStat reviews to assess implementation of the human capital performance goals and measures that are detailed in the annual Human Capital Operating Plan (HCOP) and summarized in the a nnual Perform ance Plan of the agency . By engaging in data -driven reviews, agencies will be able to identify, plan, and potentially improve existing human capital practices to support mission goals and strategic objectives, in particular. 260.5 What frequent data-driven performance reviews are required ? Routines of Data -driven Performance R eviews of APGs. Agencies required to publish Agency Priority Goals on Performance.gov are required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 to conduct performance reviews on their APGs at least once a quarter. Quarterly priority progress reviews must cover APGs per the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 . Routines of Data -driven Performance Reviews of Organizational Health and Organizational Performance Frameworks. OMB Memo M-23-15 , M easuring, Monitoring, and Improving Organizational Health and Organizational Performance in the Context of Evolving Agency Work Environments, requires the Major Operating Units of CFO Act agencies to establish frameworks for measuring organizational health and organizational performance, and routines to monitor and assess those framework s on an ongoing basis, diagnos ing issues and taking actions to strengthen and improve the organizational health and organizational performance of the organizational unit. A gencies not required to publish APGs on Performance.gov should establish routine data -driven performance reviews consistent with this guidance. 260.6 How shoul d frequent data -driven performance reviews of APGs be conducted ? Agencies are encouraged to experiment and leverage the experience of others in refining their performance review process. The PIC has established a community of practice and a Playbook with guides and other resources to support cross -agency learning on data -driven reviews. SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 260 Agencies can design the performance review process to fit the agency 's mission, leadership preferences, organizational structure, and culture. However, th e agency head and/or COO, with support of the PIO and his/her office, should: Review with the appropriate goal leader the progress achieved during the most recent quarter, overall trend data, and the likelihood of meeting the planned level of performance. Hold goal leaders accountable for knowing whether or not their performance indicators are trending in the right direction at a reasonable speed and, if they are not, for understanding why they are not and for having a plan to accelerate progress on the goal. Hold goal leaders accountable for knowing the quality of their data, for having a plan to improve it if necessary, for filling critical evidence or other information gaps , and for coordinating and consulting with the agency Chief Data Officer and Statistical Official as appropriate. Hold goal leaders accountable for identifying effective practices by searching the literature and engaging with their agency Evaluation Officer and relevant research or evaluation unit to identify practices that have evidence of effectiveness based on rigorous data, identifying and testing promising approaches, looking for benchmarks, and analyzing disaggregated data to find positive outliers across performanc e units. Hold goal leaders accountable for validating promising practices using rigorous evaluation methods or other evidence -based methods. Review variations in performance trends across the organization and delivery partners, identify possible reasons for the variance, and understand whether the variance points to promising practices or problems needing greater attention. Include Evaluation Officer and evaluation staff to share and review performance information and evaluation findings, to bett er understand performance issues that evaluation and research studies can help to address, and develop a plan to answer those questions and refine performance measures and indicators , including through the agency 's Learning Agenda . Include, as appropria te, relevant personnel within and outside the agency who contribute to the accomplishment of each Agency Priority Goal (or other priorities). Support the goal leaders in assuring other organizations and programs are contributing as expected to Agency Priority Goals (or other priorities). Identify Agency Priority Goals (or other priorities) at risk of not achieving the planned level of performance and work with goal leaders to identify strategies that support performance improvement. Encourage a meaning ful dialogue around what works, what does not, and the best way to move forward on the organization' s top priorities, using a variety of appropriate analytical and evaluation methods. Establish an environment that promotes learning and sharing openly about successes and challenges. SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 6 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Agree on follow -up actions at each meeting and track timely follow-through. Generally, agencies should consider how best to maximize the time of senior leadership and staff by prioritizing mission and management issues for r egular performance reviews and determining at what level of the organization various types of performance reviews should be conducted. 260.7 How should routines of data -driven performance reviews of Organizational Health and Organizational Performance Frameworks be established , and what are the responsibilities of agency leadership and managers ? As outlined in OMB Memorandum M -23-15, a gency Deputy Secretaries or equivalents are accountable for ensuri ng that senior Federal Government leaders and managers monitor and assess the organizational health and organizational performance of the individual major operating units within an agency in order to strengthen mission delivery. This action includes developing routines for engaging managers and staff within each such operating unit to pursue improved performance in concert with increased organizational health. These routines should be consistent with overall agency mission and strategy and informed by a variety of indicators of organizational health and organizational performance, which can assist agencies in monitoring the effect of changes to workforce and operational policies and practices. Organizational health and organizational performance routines a nd frameworks should also build on existing indicators and data collection efforts, while considering the development of new metrics where needed . Mechanisms and routines should be established for collecting, tracking, and analyzing quantitative and quali tative data and receiving regular feedback and assessments. Assessments should consider quantitative and qualitative information, and identify specific indicators of organizational capacity to perform and resilience to adapt within a dynamic working enviro nment. Qualitative information (e.g., from focus groups or stakeholder input) can help contextualize and inform the interpretation of quantitative results. Agencies should establish a routine for reviewing their data to identify, assess, and improve on str engths and weaknesses, organizational risks, and data and feedback gaps. Analyses should be conducted in a way that enables an agency to identify positive and negative outliers and inter -organizational trends, and to disaggregate by impact area, location, and organizational type. Building a c ulture of c ontinuous improvement by taking actions based on findings of these assessment s, at all levels of the organization , is critical to the effectiveness of the agency 's established routines for organizational health and organizational performance frameworks. Such strategies and actions include: Agencies should use available evidence and diagnostics to identify actions that can lead to improved organizational health and/or organizational performance, and use monitoring and evaluation efforts to assess whether those routines lead to expected improvements. Agency frameworks should incorporate processes for evidence and evaluation planning into agency organizational planning to further embed a data -driven and evide nce-based approach to support agency decisions. Agency processes should encourage and incorporate building evidence where it is lacking to inform understanding of practices and policies that contribute to improvements in organizational health, as well as to contribute to evidence on the relationships among work environments, organizational health, and organizational performance. Facilitating the sharing of available, existing evidence as well as new, emerging evidence generated through the implementation a cross agencies will be a key focus of the Organizational Health and Organizational Performance Community of Practice. Agencies should use a portfolio of evidence to inform improvements to processes and agency decisions. This should include organizational performance measurements, workforce and other SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 260 organizational policy analysis, program evaluations, and foundational fact finding regarding organizational health and organizational performance. Agencies should describe their evidence needs and associated pl ans in their Learning Agendas and Annual Evaluation Plans where appropriate. Agencies ' processes should encourage adjustment of operations and work environments based on evidence that demonstrates the associated benefits related to organizational health an d/or organizational performance. When agencies are trying new strategies, evidence planning should be built in from the start to assess implementation and determine what is working to inform further and future improvements. Agency processes should also drive benefit at the operational level by identifying key organizational decisions, the data required to make those decisions, and the creation of data where it is lacking to support decision-making on mission delivery. 260.8 Can frequent data -driven performance reviews be conducted through written documents? No. Agency leaders should use performance reviews as an opportunity to engage those involved in all levels of program delivery. Significant experience at Federal agencies, states, localities, and ot her countries demonstrates that in-person engagement of senior leaders greatly accelerates learning and performance improvement. The personal engagement of agency leaders demonstrates commitment to improvement across the organization, ensures coordination across agency silos, and enables rapid -decision making. In-person reviews may be conducted by gathering agency participants in one location or through teleconferencing. In very rare circumstances, written communications may replace an in -person review but should only be a stopgap means to assure frequent reviews in a process that otherwise primarily operates in-person or virtually leveraging video and telecommunications technologies . 260.9 What information from the frequent data -driven performance reviews must be made public ? In general, frequent data -driven performance reviews are considered internal agency deliberation, conducted in a way that supports candid and open dialogue between agency leaders and those responsible for program delivery at multiple levels of the organiza tion. Agencies may determine that selected analyses from these reviews are meaningful to agency stakeholders, delivery partners and the public, and therefore could be shared more broadly, where appropriate, if useful. All agencies that establish Agen c y Priority Goals published on Performance.gov must provide a summary of progress on each APG approximately six weeks after the end of each quarter for the most recent completed quarter (See section 200 submission timelines). These summaries should descri be progress on the Priority Goal during the most recent quarter, problems encountered and plans for improvement in the next quarter. S TRATEGIC REVIEWS 260.10 What reviews are required on an annual basis for agency strategic objectives? Section 4 of t he GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 , 31 U.S.C. 1116(f) , requires a r eview of the performance goals and objectives of each Federal agency to be conducted on an annual basis. OMB implements this provision of the GPRA Modernization Act through the strategic review policies and guidance provided for in this section. Using the A gency Strategic Plan, agency leaders assess progress on mission, service, stewardship, and crosscutting strategic objectives. The assessment considers performance goals and other indicators the agency tracks for each strategic objective, as well as challenges, risks, external factors, and other events that may have affected the outcomes. OMB works with agencies to determine which strategic SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 8 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) objectives require focused improvement relative to other strategic objectives. This internal assessment analyzing progress towards achieving strategic goals and objectives in the Agency Strategic Plan is the core of the strategic review policy requirement. In addition, as required by the PMIAA, agencies will regularly conduct portfolio reviews of programs with OMB to identify opportunities for performance improvement. The agency 's portfolio reviews of programs will be conducted and integrated to the extent practical with the agency 's strategic review so that results may be considered as part of the agency 's assessment of strategic objective progress. The production of the agency 's findings and analysis from the program portfolio reviews should be coordinated with the agency 's strategic review summary of findings by strategic objective that are discussed with OMB and reviewed each Spring. This section includes guidance to agencies on the conduct of strategic reviews that assess agency strategic objectives. All agencies will maintain the information normally reported in the annual Agency Performance Report on performance goals met or not met which provides the Congress and the public information required by section 1116(f). OMB will track the strategic objectives identified in the Agency Strategic Plan as required by sections 1116(g )-(i) of the GPRA Moderniza tion Act of 2010, and will work closely with agencies to ensure appropriate information is included in the President 's Budget, Performance.gov, and agency performance plans and reports. 260.11 What is the purpose of the strategic review? The agency strategic review represents the process or set of management processes conducted by the agency each spring to synthesize the body of available performance information and other evidence, including evaluations, in order to assess: progress being made to i mprove program outcomes ; whether the agency is using the best measures to identify progress on program outcomes; and opportunities for productivity gains using a variety of analytical, research, and evaluation methods to support the assessment. Organizational routines of the data -driven, agency strategic review represent best practices of a learning organization by reflecting , at least annually , on where the agency has been ( retrospective and backward looking) and where the agency is going ( prospective and forwarding looking) from an organizational performance and management perspective. Effective strategic reviews leverag e analytic contributions across an array of functions and disciplines, including performance management, enterprise risk management, program management, and evaluation. The results of these reviews should inform many of the decision -making processes at the agency, as well as decision -making by the agency 's stakeholders. The reviews should: Inform long -term strategy: Inform long-term strategic decision -making by agency leadership and key stakeholders, including OMB and the Congress; and inform the development of the Strategic Plan at the beginning of each new Administration. For example, s trategic foresight methodologies, conceptualized as the capacity to think systematically about the future to inform strategy development, represent one such approach to inform long-term decision -making and can be used as a planning tool to prepare for change. Agencies are encouraged to think and, where applicable, apply core elements of strategic foresight as a part of their review process, including framing, environmental scanning, forecasting potential, identifying probable and plausible future scenarios, and using those scenarios to infor m the development of strategic actions. SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 260 Inform annual planning and budget formulation: Reviews provide a mechanism for understanding the current strategic or operational environment s, inform ing shorter -term planning through the development of the a nnual Agency Performance Plan ; and budget formulation within the agency and strategic context for the Congress to consider the agency budget request. Facilitate identification and adoption of opportunities for improvement, including risk management: Use analy ses, evaluation , and the results of other evidence-building activities to identify areas where agencies are making progress, facilitate learning and the identification of best practices, and identify the areas where agencies face challenges in achieving st rategic objectives that require additional leadership attention or a reassessment of the agency strategy. Identify areas where additional evaluation, other studies or analyses of performance data are needed to determine effectiveness or set priorities: Inform agencies where to focus limited resources available for program evaluations and other studies, and encourage an evidence structure which will inform strategic decisions facing the agency that can be reflected in the agency 's Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan . Identify where additional skills or other capacity are needed: Inform agencies where skill or capacity gaps exist that impede progress on agency goals. Capacity gaps can be related to human resources, organizational processes, or evi dence-building infrastructure (i.e., Capacity Assessments required by the \" Evidence Act \"). The agency should incorporate strategic objectives in individuals ' performance planning and appraisal processes and rewarding contributions to the advancement of strategy, where appropriate. Improve decision -making response time: The annual review facilitates strategic changes due to emerging trends, events, and externa l factors within the strategic or operational environments in a timely manner - such as adjustments to strategic goal(s)/strategic objective(s) . Strengthen collaboration on crosscutting issues: Support agencies in identifying and addressing crosscutting challenges or fragmentation. Improve transparency: Provide information to the public on progress toward achieving the agency 's mission. 260.12 What is the general timeline the strategic review process follows throughout the year ? The strategic review process is depicted below, outlining a general timeline for key agency and OMB actions and engagement throughout the year. SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 10 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 260.13 What is the relationship between agency 's strategic plans, strategic reviews, and the agency/OMB strategic review meetings that occur in the Spring/Summer timeframe? Strategic Planning. One of the hallmarks of high-performing organizations is an effective strategic planning process (see section 230.2). Federal agencies engage in and conduct strategic planning in order to produce Agency Strategic Plans, which present the long -term strategic goals and objectives an agency hopes to accomplish at the beginning of a new term of an Administration. Agency Strategic Plans define the agency 's mission, long-term goals and objectives the agency aims to achieve, the implementation strategies and actions the agency will take to realize those goals, and how the agency will deal with challenges and risks that present barriers to achieving results and outcomes. Agency Strategic Review. It is through the Strategic Review process that agencies annually assess the effectiveness of their implementation strategies and progress being made towards advancing efforts in achieving the strategic goals and objectives identified in the Agency Strategic Plan. By synthesizing the body of available performance information and other evidence, including evaluations, these reviews help agency leadership and senior management official s understand progress being made to improve program outcomes, assess whether the agency is using the best measures to identify progress on program outcomes, the effectiveness of implementation strategies, and look at opportunities for productivity gains using a variety of analytical, research, and evaluation methods to support the assessment. The reviews facilitate best practices of a learning organization by reflecting annually on where the agency has been (backward looking) and where the agency is going (forwarding looking) from an organizational performance and management perspective by leveraging the analytic contributions of practices such as performance management, enterprise risk management , program management, and evaluation. The results of these reviews should inform many of the decision- making processes at the agency while also providing a mechanism for discussing agency assessments and analyses, including whether the agency is using the best measures to identify progress on strategic objective and program outcomes, opportunities for management and programmatic improvements using a variety of analytical, research, and evaluation methods to support the assessments, the effectiveness of implementation strategies, the effects of major programmatic and operational risks to objectives, as well as other management priorities with OMB to inform future strategic SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 260 planning and management efforts by agencies. Strategic Reviews thus become a critical management routine for organizational l earning, identifying areas where additional evaluation, other studies, or analyses of performance data are needed to determine effectiveness or set priorities that support an evidence infrastructure which will inform strategic decisions facing the agency. It is in this context then that t he annual strategic review process reflects a \"connective tissue\" of agency processes that links the complementary aspects of strategic planning, performance management reviews, and evidence and evaluation activities to sup port agency leaders and managers to deliver better program performance and services for the public. Agency/OMB Strategic Review Meeting. The annual agency/OMB Strategic Review meetings provide an opportunity for agencies and OMB to discuss the results of t he agency 's strategic review and progress in the implementation of the agency strategic plan using recent evidence and performance data, while incorporating an analysis of strategic and programmatic risks. Importantly, they help ensure budget and managemen t policy alignment by facilitating a discussion between OMB and agency senior leadership on strategic decisions and priorities to a timeline that informs the President 's budget development and future strategic planning and management efforts by agencies. Effective discussions during strategic review meetings focus on and reinforce how critical organizational functions of strategic planning, performance measurement, enterprise risk management, program evaluation, and other evidence -building activities can be integrated to complement organizational improvement efforts for effective program and service delivery . While the core of the Agency/OMB strategic review meeting remains stable from year to year and is focused on the discussion of findings from the agenc y's internal strategic review, OMB may provide additional implem enting instructions to agencies outside of the guidance contained in this Circular each year in order to refine the focus and /or conduct of the OMB/Agency meetings that are convened. Building a high-performance government that enables agencies to deliver and improve upon their mission outcomes and services to the public while maintaining appropriate stewardship of taxpayer resources requires a framework to guide the interactions of key organiza tional improvement processes like those outlined above. The Federal Performance Framework and guidance outlined in this Circular provides such a guide, leveraging the organizational learning inherent to agencies strategic reviews processes as an integratin g point for coordinating components of the GPRA Modernization Act and Evidence Act to build a stronger evidence base for improving organizational performance . 260.14 How should progress on each strategic objective be assessed ? Agencies should develop a process and approach fitting for the nature of the programs and activities that the agency operates, which considers multiple perspectives and sources of evidence to understand the progress made on each strategic objective. Progr ess toward achieving individual quantitative performance goals related to the strategic objective is one important consideration, but alone is not representative of the scope, complexity, or external factors that can influence program results and outcomes toward which Federal agencies are working. When reviewing progress on each strategic objective, agencies should at a minimum, consider: if desired changes have occurred in the ultimate outcomes the agency seeks to improve and whether these outcomes are d irectly measurable or must be assessed through proxies or other means of evaluation; progress made by the agency toward the performance goals established in the most recent Annual Performance Plan that relate to the strategic objective, including both outcome indicators and output indicators; SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 12 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) evidence relevant to the strategic objective or related programs, including program evaluations, research studies, policy analysis, or other evidence -building activities and assessments relevant to the strategic objective or the related programs; external factors affecting the strategic objective, including existing and likely changes in the operating environment, the size of program demand, or challenges faced during program execution; benchmarking information from others trying to accomplish the same or similar objectives or using the same or similar key process; lessons learned from past efforts to continuously improve service delivery and resolve management challenges, especially in coordinating across organizat ion components and with delivery partners; effectiveness of coordination and collaboration across organizational boundaries and with delivery partners including management milestones met; identification, assessment and prioritization of probable risks t hat may impact program delivery or outcomes significantly in the coming year or two; effectiveness of scaling efforts; and budgetary, regulatory or legislative constraints that may have an impact on progress . The Figure below is offered as a helpful illustration depicting the relationship across key components of a strategic review analyses, connecting evidence, evaluation, and measurement in the assessment of strategic objectives that is both backward looking (i.e., Impact / Implementation) and forwa rd looking (i.e., Risks / Opportunities) . SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 260 260.15 What methodology should agencies use to conduct strategic reviews? Agencies are strongly encouraged to leverage existing decision- making processes to conduct the annual assessment of strategic object ive progress which lies at the core of the strategic review. The strategic reviews, in most cases, should be integrated into existing agency management processes, such as the budget development process, in order to raise key decisions, issues and analysis to agency leadership. The agency should use a tailored approach that is appropriate for the nature of the agency' s programs, operations and strategic objectives and evidence available. The agency PIO should work with the COO, component heads, and program m anagers to establish a process for the annual review on strategic objectives, considering the agency 's existing, effective management systems. In many cases analysis on individual strategic objectives should be conducted at the objective lead level with support from bureaus or programs, and with guidance from the agency PIO. For credit programs, the analysis should align with program review requirements in OMB Circular No. A-123. The PIO 's office will then conduct the analysis across strategic objectives. The COO should then review the decisions, agree to changes in strategy, and prioritize proposals for consideration during the budget and performance pl an development. To the extent possible, the PIO should leverage and strengthen bureau-level data-driven review processes when developing the strategic reviews. To support the identification, assessment and prioritization of probable risks that may impact program delivery or outcomes and are likely to impact the strategic objectives, agencies should coordinate Enterprise Risk Management efforts and the analysis of risk profiles with the strategic review. SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 14 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) The approach for conducting the strategic review sho uld be refined each year based on the prior year 's review process considering the timing, roles, responsibilities, sources of evidence as well as how the agency identifies areas for focused improvement or areas of noteworthy progress. The agency 's approach to the strategic reviews should maintain a maturity model for future improvements to the strategic reviews. OMB will continue to work with agencies to refine review methodologies and maturity models, and will provide additional guidance through interagency working group sessions and direct engagement with major agencies. 260.16 What is OMB' s role in the strategic review? OMB will play three primary roles related to the strategic reviews. OMB will: Work with agencies to maintain an appropriate review methodology and offer suggestions to potentially improve the agency 's review process over time. OMB works with agencies to develop the strategic review approach over time to better evaluate and assess progress on mission outcomes using the strategi c objectives established with the Strategic Plan. This will broaden the implementation of section 1116(f) to focus primarily on the relative assessment of agency strategic objectives, while also continuing normal reporting on performance goals and indicat ors. Review analysis generated by the agency in their Summary of Findings and supporting information for each strategic objective to focus on the systematic identification of the need for strategy revisions and risk mitigation. OMB will discuss with the agency what budget, administrative or legislative proposals resulting from the assessment may be appropriate to drive further progress. OMB will also assess if the agency provided reasonably sufficient evidence to support the assessment. Where sufficient evidence is not available, OMB will work with the agency to determine if building capacity for gathering evidence would be cost -effective. Review the agency 's Summary of P rogress update prior to publication of results in the a nnual Agency Performance Report, as well as plans communicated in c ongressional justifications, and annual Agency Performance Plan to ensure assessments and improvement actions align with Administration policy and President's Budget . 260.17 What period of performance will be assessed ? Strategic reviews permit agencies to annually assess progress using the most recent evidence available at the time of the assessment. For example, w hile the 2023 strategic review 's final assessment will be updated with results of fiscal year 202 3 performance goals and indicators, the initial baseline assessment presented in the spring/summer 's \"Summary of Findings by Strategic Objective \" should use the most recent sources of quantit ative and qualitative evidence available at the time of the review, which usually occur s at the mid - year point of the fiscal year . The final results and assessment of fiscal year 202 3 performance goals and indicators will likely not be available and finalized until closer to the publication of the FY 20 23 Agency Performance Report (APR). The 2024 strategic review would adhere to a similar cycle based on the availability of evidence to inform the assessments generated by the agency in the ir \"Summary of Findings \" and subsequently finalized in that fiscal year 's APR . Thus, a gencies are encouraged to use historical trend data, evaluations, research studies or other policy and risk analyses. When identifying the objectives facing challenges, agencies should also consider future opportunities and risks that are likely to impact the strategic objective in the coming year or two along with the existing agency capacity to mitigate those risks. SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 15 of Section 260 260.18 How should agencies categorize progress on each strategic objective for the strategic review? The relative assessment of progress for an agency 's strategic objectives requires analysis across multiple perspectives and sources of evidence, both qualitative and quantitative, and as such agency leaders must use their judgment when determining relative levels of progress and appropriate follow -up action for long- term strategic objectives. This is appropriate and necessary given the complexity of analyzing the performance of Federal programs toward the agency 's goals. For the agency 's management purposes, agency leaders should develop an appropriate assessment methodology which enables a practical determination if any changes are needed to the strategies being used to achieve the objectives, agency operations or program structure, or resource allocations, including program elimination. At a minimum, these assessments should identify relative levels of performance across the agency 's portfolio of all strategic objectives including where the agency made noteworthy progress or where the agency should pursue focused improvement. There are a variety of different scenarios that may make such identification appropriate for a strategic objective relative to the other objectives at the agency. Such scenarios may include: Areas Demonstrating Noteworthy Progress As a result of actions being taken, the intended results or improvements in ultimate outcomes have largely been realized and represent a significant improvement in national welfare. New innovations in strategy, program design, risk mitigation, or operations have led to notable improvements in outcomes, risk reductions, and/or cost reductions and promise greater impact in the future. Existing strategies and/or operations have proven more effective than projected and have led to notable improvements in outcomes, risk reductions, and/or cost reductions and promise greater impact in the future. External factors beyond the scope of agency efforts have led to a significant decrease in the magnitude of the problem being addressed, representing a significant improvement in national welfare. Focus Areas for Improvement Challenges during program execution have resulted in too little impact on program outcomes. The ultimate problem the strategic objective seeks to address is growing more quickly than current actions to address it or the actions are not of sufficient magnitude to have a significant impact. The current strategies are not having the intended impa ct on outcomes. Actions taken are effective, but costs are currently exceeding benefits. Significant risks exist which may impact program delivery or outcomes. For the Summary of Findings submission to OMB in the spring, agencies must conduct a relative assessment and identify 10% to 20% of strategic objectives in to each of these two categories. This will ensure OMB and each agency are able to discuss relative performance across the organization 's mission and prioritize analysis and decision -making as well as enable OMB to meet the requirements of 31 U.S.C . SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 16 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 1116(f) . Ag encies with fewer than 10 strategic objectives should identify at least one strategic objective in each category unless receiving approval from OMB to do otherwise. Categorization of the remaining strategic objectives is not required, as achi eving government -wide consistency on finer gradations of progress would require significant investment and would not be cost -effective at the government -wide level. I nitial identification of 10% to 20% of strategic objectives in each of these two categories for deliberation with OMB does not mean that this same number of objectives will ultimately be selected for identification in each of these categories for publication and reporting in the Agency 's Annual Performance Report and on Performance.gov. Furt her, categorization of the relative progress made by agencies on strategic objectives should not be misconstrued to be a relative assessment of the objectives' importance or value over other mission objectives . 260.19 What will agencies do to improve progress on strategic objectives? After reviewing each strategic objective, agencies must determine what actions should be taken to maintain or improve progress on the strategic objectives and must incorporate those decisions and implementation activities into the next a nnual Agency Performance Plan or other operating plans like the agency 's Annual Evaluation Plan . In addition, the agency should consider what administrative actions, budget, legislative, or policy proposals must be included in the President' s Budget or the agency 's congressional b udget j ustification for congressional consideration . 260.20 What information from the agency 's internal strategic review process must the agency produce in order to prepare for the core of the agency/OMB strategic review meeting ? The \"Summary of Findings by Strategic Objective \" is the core of the analysis and assessments generated through the agency 's strategic review process. The Summary of Findings provide a preliminary overview of relative progress and learning from the agency 's strategic review, and include a discussion of the key findings from the agency 's updated ERM risk profile and other programmatic analysis of risks where appropriate . They are aligned to review progress being made on the agency 's current Strategic Plan and foster dialogue between OMB and agencies, and across agencies as needed, in the spring and summer for agency consideration during budget formulation and strategic and performance plan implementation Agencies are encouraged to continue to build and iterate on internal management dashboards or displays that present their analysis and assessments in their Summary of Findings, enhanc ing how key performance information and data is visualiz ed for consumption by agency leadership. While agencies have flexibility in designing how they prepare and present their Summary of Findings, optimized for agency leadership, the Summary of Findings produced by the agency must nonetheless include analyses addressing the following are as for each Strategic Objective. P erformance results and priority evidence-building activities (including program evaluations ), summarizing key results or conclusions and synopsis of key areas of progress identifying 10% - 20% of strategic objectives as \"A rea Demonstrating Noteworthy Progress\" and \"Focus Area for Improvement (See 260.18 ).\" Summary of risks and opportunities, discussing challenges and threats to achieving goals and objectives by leveraging the agency 's risk profile to identify risks that could either negatively affect the ability to achieve objectives, or may present opportunities to significantly impact mission, service, mission -support , stewardship outcomes or operational objectives. Such analysis of risks and opportunities should be discussed in the context of how resource allocation decisions were made to achieve the agency 's strategic objectives, and take into account the agency 's established risk appetite. SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 17 of Section 260 Next Steps, briefly identifying proposed actions, decisions, or options being considered for continued performance or to remedy barriers to implementation. For each strategic objective, the agency present s key analysis, conclusions, risks, and proposals under consideration. The agency also identif ies areas of relative progress and challenges for each strategic objective. Updates to OMB in other key management areas, priorities, or initiatives may also be coordinated as part of agencies ' overall strategic review, and communicated separately by ag encies. OMB's primary focus in discussing the Summary of Findings with agencies is on the learning that has occurred to date. Such a focus includes identifying outstanding key analytical questions that may need to be addressed and those which can be addressed as part of the agency 's Learning Agendas, as well as discussing priorities for the submission of budget, administrative or legislative proposals related to the formulation of the President 's Budget. This dialogue will be at a strategic level and is designed to inform, not replace, the agency 's budget submission to OMB. While the Summary of Findings will not be published, the discussions between OMB and the agency on its analysis and f indings will inform decisions resulting from the strategic review and will inform the content required to be published in the congressional justifications, updates as appropriate to the Agency Strategic Plan, A gency Performance Plan , and A gency Performance Report with the President 's Budget. 260.21 What information will be published from the strategic reviews? Agencies are required to publish a brief, narrative progress update in the a nnual Agency Performance Report for each strategic objective. The a nnual Agency Performance Plan should address plans to improve performance, noting key actions which will be taken over the course of the next year, as well as the longer - term plan for performance improvement, if appropriate. See section 210 for content that should be included in the a nnual Performance Plan and a nnual Performance Report on strategic objectives. Prior to publication in the Agency Performance Report, agencies will provide in draft, as a part of the budget submission, a progress update for every strategic objective resulting from the agency 's strategic review and proposed categorizations of strategic objectives for OMB review. The progress update narrative must include the following for every strategic objective: Summary of Progress: A brief summary of what progress was made and brief explanation of the achievements made or challenges (e.g., strategy, external factors, human capital or other management) that have impeded progress on the strategic objective . To keep the progress update short, the agency should use hyperlinks, citations or footnotes to supporting evidence or external links if available, such as published analyses, evaluations, research studies, historical trends on performance goals and other indicators, milestones, external factors, or other independent assessments that support the summary or are relevant to problems or opportunities discussed. Proposed Strategic Objective Categorization: Based on the agency 's relative assessment, a subset of the strategic objectives should be identified as either making \"noteworthy progress \" or requiring \"focused improvement \" (see section 260.18 ). The first sentence of the progress update for these strategic objectives must include on e of the following two phrases: \"The [agency name], in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that p erformance toward this objective is making noteworthy progress \" \"The [agency name], in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, has highlighted this objective as a focus area for improvement. \" Among next steps, the agency must ensure the Agency Performance Plan includes at a minimum: the agency 's summary of plans to improve or maintain performance key milestones planned for the next year with completion dates SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 18 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) if applicable, the agency 's effort to close evidence gaps where information is not sufficient (including proposed research questions or proposed evaluations, as appropriate ) 260.22 How do es the agency 's Summary of Findings by Strategic Objective differ from the Summary of Progress by Strategic Objective reported in the agency' s annual Performance Report ? Summary of Findings : A critical output of the agency 's internal strategic review process is the agency 's Summary of Findings by Strategic Objective, which reflects the agency 's assessment of progress towards achieving strategic objectives in the Agency Strategic Plan , and provide s an analysis by agency managers and leaders on the actions needed to sustain or improve performance and/or mitigate risks to overcome performance challenges. The analysis produced from the agency 's Summary of Findings by Strategic Objective is designed to generate and foster internal, pre -decisional strategic discussions between OMB and agency over the course of the summer . These meetings and discussions on the agency 's Summary of Findings are intended to inform the agency 's budget development and strategic and performance plan development , as strategies and actions needed to advance the agency 's overall mission accomplishment are refined. As such, these documents are pre-decisional and deliber ative and intended for use only internal to the Executive Branch. The Summary of Findings by S trategic Objectives in the spring also include the agency 's initial, proposed categorization of strategic objectives making Noteworthy Progress or Focus Area for Improvement. Summary of Progress: The agency 's Summary of Progress by Strategic Objective, on the other hand, are the publicly reported element s resulting from the agency 's internal strategic review and subsequent meetings and discussions with OMB in the summer. The Summary of Progress for each strategic objective in the Annual Performance Report should reflect a brief narrative that describes how well the agency 's strategic objectives are meeting goal outcomes articulated in the agency' s Strategic Plan, and based on the agency 's strategic review assessment s. Agencies must publicly report their Summary of Progress by strategic objectives annually as a part of the agency 's Annual Performance Report, and include the agency 's final categorization designations for objectives making Noteworthy Progress or Focus Area for Improvement in consultation with OMB. 260.23 How does a Presidential transition year affect the information that will be published from the strategic review? During a transition year (e.g., 2021) , agencies are developing new strategic goals and objectives that will be reflected in the update to the agency Strategic Plan (e.g., FYs 2022 -2026) with an Administration 's first full fiscal year President 's Budget (e.g., FY 2023) . Agencies m ay forego the reporting requirements for any strategic objectives in the agency Strategic P lan published under a previous Administration that an agency determines will be substantively different or no longer aligned with the current Administration' s policy, legislative, regulatory or budgetary priorities. Agencies should include a progress update for any strategic objective identified as \"Noteworthy Progress\" or a \" Focus Area for Improvement \" as part of their progress update in their applicable a nnual Performance Report and address performance improvement next steps as part of their applicable annual Performance Plan, to the extent that the agency findings from the strategic reviews conducted during the previous Administration are consistent with the policies and priorities of the current Administration. Agencies should consult with their appropriate OMB Resource Management Office in making the determination on which strategic objectives may or may not be aligned wi th the p olicy priorities of the new Administration. SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 19 of Section 260 260.24 Because of their outcome-oriented nature, strategic objectives may be affected by factors beyond the agency 's control. What are agencies held accountable for ? Agency leaders at all levels of the organization are accountable for choosing strategic objectives wisely and for monitoring agency performance on those outcome -oriented objectives. Wise selection of strategic objectives reflects a careful analysis of the characteristics of the problems and opportunities an agency seeks to influence to advance its mission, factors affecting those outcomes, and agency capacity and priorities. OMB expects agencies to make progress on most strategic objectives, to understand the impact of external factors and the environment, and delivery -partner collaboration, and to have reasonable improvement plans to support the more challenging objectives or effectively respond to management or operational changes that may arise in the external environment agencies may find themselves operating in . Agencies are accountable for constantly striving to achieve meaningful progress and finding lower -cost ways to achieve positive results while tailoring agency operational or management plans and implementation strategies in a manner that effectively incorporate s into future planning efforts the organizational learning derived from the analyses and assessments obtained through agency strategic and performance reviews. 260.25 What actions will be taken by the agency and OMB if a particular performance goal was not met? What actions will be taken by the agency and OMB if a particular strategic objective requires focused improvement ? Sections 1116(g-i) of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 establish a framework for the Executive Branch to engage the Congress on obje ctives that are not meeting a planned level of performance. OMB will work closely with agencies to ensure appropriate follow up actions are included in the Annual Performance Plan and as part of the President' s Budget if applicable. This may include major reforms, legislative proposals, and program reductions, eliminations or investments depending on the nature of the challenge and the needed improvement actions. When strategic objectives have been determined by the agency and OMB as requiring focused im provement for multiple, consecutive fiscal years, the agency and OMB are required by law to take progressive actions each year. The Agency Performance Plan and c ongressional justification will incorporate improvement actions determined by the agency in consultation with OMB, by publishing changes to strategies, progress updates and next steps for each strategic objective in the a nnual Performance Plan and Report as directed in section 210. Because many of the actions required by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 are appropriate actions to take for all strategic objectives, OMB will continue to consider proposing recommendations to the Congress even on those strategic objectives that are making progress, but where such actions could improve Federal perform ance. 260.26 What if there is not enough information to determine how the agency is progressing on a particular objective, or if the evidence available is inconsistent, making it difficult to draw a conclusion about progress? Due to the complex nature of the outcomes that G overnment is working to affect and the agency 's capacity to impact those outcomes, in certain cases an agency may not have enough consistent evidence to characterize progress or data may be lagging. If the lack of or inconsistent evidence makes it impossible to summarize progress on a particular strategic objective, the agency should explain the status of the objective as best possible in the progress update while noting the relative strength of the evidence in either direction. In considering the potential risks or impacts of inconsistent or unavailable information, the agency should determine, in consultation with OMB, the appropriate next steps for cost -effective investments in SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 20 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) evaluation, research studies, data collection, or administrative potential actions that could mitigate potential risks and/or close the information gaps. Objectives where inconsistent or unavailable information poses a relatively high risk and high impact to an outcome should be considered for addition to the agency 's objectives facing challenges. 260.27 When must information be provided to OMB ? The internal strategic review typically begin s at agencies in the early part of the calendar year as agencies prepare their analysis and assessments for their Summary of Findings in the Spring ( see section 200). OMB Circular No. A-123 requires updates to the an alyses reflected in the agency 's risk profile be aligned to and integrated with the agency 's individual strategic review process(es) and overall strategic review methodology and approach. A gencies will include a discussion of the key findings from their updated ERM Risk Profile as a component of their Summary of Findings. As such, agencies must coordinate the timing of their ERM Risk Profile update so that their ERM Risk Profile analyses can effectively inform the analyses and assessment of strategic objectives being reflected in the agency 's Summary of Findings . Additionally, while OMB Circular No. A -123 r equires agencies at a minimum update their ERM risk profiles no less than annually, agencies are encouraged to update their assessmen t of risks more frequently as applicable to inform management processes and decision -making. As agencies and OMB deliberate budget formulation and gather year - end results of performance goals and indicators, the agency will refine the progress update for publication in the a nnual Agency Performance Report as well as improvement plans for the annual Agency Performance Plan. See section 200 for specific dates. 260.2 8 In what kind of circumstances can agencies change a strategic objective in between the strategic plan updates every four years? Agencies may make changes to objectives where significant circumstances in the strategic or operational environments require a change, such as emerging trends, new or revised Administration or leadership priorities, budget, organizational learning from implementation or execution of current goals and objectives, or significant external factors. Agencies may use development of the annual Agency Performance Plan to modify strategic objectives , and release their revised strategic objective structure publicly . Some examples of reasons to change a strategic objective may be, but are not limited to: Significant budget or other resource changes, increases, or reductions. Significant program, legislative or policy change s. Unexpected external factors that require significant response or change in priorities by the agency. 260.29 How will agency and OMB track progress on a strategic objective that was changed in between strategic plan updates every four years? If a strategic objective is dropped, added or modified significantly in between the four -year updates to the strategic plan, the agency must notify and obtain concurrence from OMB to make the change by submitting a justification to performance@omb.eop.gov . S uch modifications may require publishing a revised Strategic Plan (see section 230). In addition, the agency will summarize the modifications to objectives in the annual Agency Performa nce Plan, similarly to how changes in performance goals are published, with a brief explanation for the change . SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 21 of Section 260 ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT 260.30 What is Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) ? Risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives. Risk management is coordinated activity to direct and control challenges or threats to achieving an organization 's goals and objectives. Enterprise risk management (ERM) is an effective agency -wide approach to addressing the full spectrum of the organization 's significan t risks by understanding the combined impact of risks as an interrelated portfolio, rather than addressing risks only within silos. ERM provides an enterprise -wide, strategically -aligned portfolio view of organizational challenges that provides better insi ght about how to most effectively prioritize and manage risks to mission delivery. While agencies cannot mitigate all risks related to achieving strategic objectives and performance goals, they should identify, measure, and assess challenges related to mis sion delivery, to the extent possible. Effective risk management: creates and protects value; is an integral part of all organizational processes; is part of decision -making; explicitly addresses uncertainty; is systematic, structured, and timely; is based on the best available information; is tailored and responsive to the evolving risk profile of the agency; takes human and cultural factors into account; is transparent and inclusive; is dynamic, iterative, and responsive to change; and facilitates co ntinual improvement of the organization. 260.31 How is ERM relevant to strategic reviews? Agencies are expected to manage risks and challenges related to delivering the organization 's mission. ERM is a strategic discipline that can help agencies to properly identify and manage risks to performance, especially those risks related to achieving strategic objectives. An organizational view of risk positions allows the agency to quickly gauge which risks are directly aligned to achieving strategic objecti ves, and which have the highest probability of impacting mission. When significant, prioritized risks are vetted and escalated appropriately in the context of the agency 's risk appetite with agency leadership , challenges and opportunities can be routinely analyzed and incorporated into performance plans . Aligning strategy and performance to develop the appropriate risk responses through the planning process is critical to mitigating the influence of risks on achieving agency goals and objectives . When well executed and properly aligned with performance and program evaluation, ERM improves agency capacity to prioritize efforts, optimize resources, and assess changes in the environment . Instituting ERM can help agency leaders make risk - aware decisions that imp act prioritization, performance and resource allocation. The agency 's strategic review process should be used to coordinate its analysis of risk using ERM to make risk-aware decisions, aligning the activities of staff engaged in risk identification and evaluation with performance analysis and programmatic reviews to develop and integrate effective responses for treatin g risk. This includes the development of risk profiles as a component of the annual strategic review, identifying risks arising from mission and mission-support operations and providing a thoughtful analysis of the risks an agency faces towards achieving its strategic objectives to develop responses that may be used to inform decision- making through existing management processes. SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 22 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) The results of the agency 's risk assessment in the risk profile will be discussed each year with OMB as a component of the Summary of Findings from the agency strategic review, and used to inform changes to agency implementation strategies and future strategic and performance planning efforts. Agencies will need to coordinate the timing of the update to the ir ERM risk profile in order to effectively inform the analyses and assessment of strategic objectives being generated in the agency 's Summary of Findings and for discussion with OMB. See OMB Circular No. A-123. 260.32 What are the key roles of risk managers at an agency ? Enterprise risk managers, who may be referred to as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) in some agencies, champion agency -wide efforts to manage risk within the agency and advise senior leaders on the strategically -aligned portfolio view of risks at the agency. The responsibilities of managing risk, however , are shared throughout the agency from the highest levels of executive leadership to the service delivery staff executing Federal programs. Agencies are required to have an enterprise risk management function, and expected to manage risks to mission, goals, and objectives of the agency. Where applicable, a CRO or other person designated with these responsibilities may serve as a strategic advisor to the COO and other staff on the integration of risk management practices into day -to-day business operati ons and decision-making. An effective enterprise risk manager does the following: Develops, manages, coordinates, and oversees a comprehensive system for proactively identifying, prioritizing, monitoring, and communicating an organization' s enterprise-wid e risks (see OMB Circular No. A-123 for discussion of \"R isk Profiles \"). Such risks include relevant strategic, operational, financial, and programmatic barriers as well as reputational risks that could interfere with an organization 's defined strategic objectives or performance goals. Ov ersees the development and use of a robust set of risk management indicators that are representative of organizational operations and prioritized risks. Establishes and provides oversight of policies that enable consistent use of enterprise risk management principles and supports an integrated view of risk across the organization. Facilitates the incorporation and diss emination of enterprise -wide risk management protocols and best practices appropriate for the whole organization to reduce duplication of effort and improve agency performance. Establishes the procedures for determining the amount of risk an agency will accept or mitigate, including the manner in which these elements of the decision -making process are documented. Creates and maintains institutional capacity and accountability for risk management through the exchange of information, knowledge, education and training staff. The Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC) and the Performance Improvement Council (PIC), through an interagency effort, developed a \"playbook \" (Playbook : Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) for the U.S. Federal Government) to help Federal agencies implement the requirements of OMB Circular No . A-123, providing high-level concepts for agencies to consider when establishing a comprehensive and effective ERM program and governance . SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 23 of Section 260 260.33 What other guidance does OMB provide agencies regarding risk management concepts discussed in this Circular ? OMB provides agencies with guidance related to risk management in some specialized areas. OM B Circular No. A -123, Management 's Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control . T his Circular defines management 's responsibilities for enterprise risk management (ERM) and internal control. The Circular provides updated implementation guidance to Federal managers to improve accountability and effectiveness of Federal programs, as well as mission support operations, through implementation of ERM practices and by establishing, maintaining, and assessing internal control effectiveness. The Circular emphasizes the need to integrate and coordinate risk management and strong and effective internal control into existing business activities and as an integral part of managing an Agency. J oint OMB/OSTP M emorandum M-07-24 , Updated Principles for Risk Analysis . Agency activities designed to reduce risks are influenced by numerous factors, including c ongressional priorities, information on the degree of risk faced by different populations, entities, or individuals, resources available, and the ease of implementing chosen priorities. Recognizing the diversity of documents that stem from risk analysis techniques, this memo reinforces generally -accepted principles for risk analysis related to environmental, health, and safety risks. OM B Circular No. A- 129, Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non -Tax Receivables . Federal credit programs are intended to accomplish a variety of social and economic goals. To support agencies ' efforts to effectively and efficiently manage programs, the Circular includes guidance for objectives that agencies should achieve with respect to risk management, data reporting, and use of evidence to improve programs through regular program reviews. It also established the Federal Credit Policy Council, an interagency collaborative forum for identifying and implementing best practices. OM B Memorandum M -22-10, Improving Access to Public Benefits Programs Through the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) . This Memorandum provides g uidance to help Federal agencies identify and reduce burdens associated with applying for and maintaining eligibility for public benefits programs, with a particular focus on members of underserved and marginalized communities . To minimize burden where possible, a gencies should ensure that their PRA offices are empowered to work across offices with in the agency to identify and advocate for burden reduction opportunities. This includes, for example, PRA offices coordinating with the agency 's Chief Risk Officer or other officials within the agency that oversee the agency 's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) efforts and process. Additionally, ERM policies outlined in OMB Circular A - 123 also provide an existing management routine at the agency where information collection review burden considerations may be addressed through a risk-informed framework acros s the agency 's strategic, operational, reporting, and compliance objectives, and appropriately influenced by the agency 's approaches to risk appetite and risk tolerance . O MB Memorandum M -17-25, Reporting Guidance for Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure . This Memorandum provides implementing guidance on actions required by Executive Order 13800 on S trengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. Agency heads are required to manage risk commensurate with the magnitude of harm that would result from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of a Federal information system or Federal information. Agencies are directed to assess their cybersecurity risk and, to manage the SECTION 2 60\u2014DATA-DRIVEN PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC REVIEWS Page 24 of Section 260 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) cybersecurity component of enterprise risk, adopt the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the Framework). Additionally, with support from the PIO and CFO Counc ils, an interagency effort to gather, define, and illustrate practices in applying ERM in the federal context has produc ed the ERM P laybook : Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) for the U.S. Federal Government. The Playbook is intended as a r esource to assist Federal managers by identifying the objectives of a strong ERM program, suggesting questions agencies should consider in establishing or reviewing their approaches to ERM, and offering examples of best practices. The ERM Playbook is available on the main ERM Community MAX pa ge .

Summary of Changes Adds guidance on the role of the PMPC in facilitating the c oordinat ion and promotion of agency P/PM learning opportunities . 270.1 To which agencies does this section apply? Section 270 i s applicable to the 24 Federal agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 ( 31 U.S.C. 901(b) ) unless otherwise specified. The Department of Defense is exempt from the requirements where program management guidance would significantly overlap or duplicate (1) the provisions of chapter 87 of title 10, or (2) policy, guidance, or instruction of the Depar tment related to program management. 31 U.S.C. 503(c)(2). Non -CFO Act agencies are encouraged but not required to SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT Page 2 of Section 270 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) adopt and work towards implementing the strategies for improving Program and Project Management (P/PM ) at their agencies outlined in this section. 270.2 What is the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (PMIAA) and what is its relationship to the Federal Performance framework? The Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (the Act, or the PMIAA), Pub. L. No. 114- 264, requires government -w ide standards and policies for program management and established a new interagency council to improve P/PM practices among agencies. The Act also established the role of the Program Management Improvement Officer (PMIO) , who is responsible for implementing program management policies established at the agency and develop ing strategies to enhance the role of program management and managers within the department. The Act also requires that agencies conduct annual portfolio reviews of programs in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to ensure major programs are being managed effectively, and that OMB conduct reviews of areas identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as \" high risk. \" Implementation of the Act complements the broader Federal Performance framework, which is designed to improve agency performance in ensuring taxpayer dollars are providing criti cal Federal services to citizens and delivering on the mission of Federal agencies efficiently and cost -effectively. Over time, implementation will strengthen the ability of agencies to achieve mission outcomes by improving the management of programs that are aligned to and support the achievement of agency goals and objectives. 270.3 What strategies have been developed for improving Program and Project Management (P/PM) at Federal agencies? Federal program and project managers have an important obligation to ensure programs and projects deliver critical services to the American public efficiently and effectively. To accomplish this, OMB and Federal agencies will leverage three key strategies as part of a 5 -year strategic plan for implementing the PMIAA. Outlined below, these strategies focus on clarifying key roles and responsibilities, identifying principle - based standards, holding managers accountable for results, and building a capable program management workforce. Coordinated Governance. Leverage a coordinated approach and governance structure that clarifies key roles and responsibilities for senior leader engagement in strengthening P/PM, and establishes broadly applicable program management principles and standards. Improving program management will require leadership from each agency Chief Operating Officer ( COO) and agency PMIO, with close collaboration across all agency mission and mission -support functions. o Agency COOs will provide organizational leadership to improve program perfor mance by ensuring organizational and staff expertise across a range of management skills and disciplines, including but not limited to P/PM. o Agency PMIOs, reporting directly to the COO (or other equivalent senior agency official responsible for agency program performance), will lead efforts to enhance the role and practice of program management. o The Program Management Policy Council (the Council or PMPC) , comprised of OMB and CFO -Act agency officials, will oversee implementation of the Act 's major provisions and strengthen agency program management by developing capacity, facilitating cross - agency learning, improving cooperation, and sharing best -practices identified by agencies and the private sector. SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 270 The PMIAA also requires the establishment of gover nment -wide P/PM standards, policies, and guidelines for P/PM for agencies. A set of common, principle -based government -wide program management standards provide foundational resources that agencies can leverage to ensure they produce their desired outcomes and effectively contribute towards the achievement of agency mission and strategic goals and objectives. Regular OMB/Agency Engagement and Reviews. Hold managers accountable for results through annual program portfolio reviews. These reviews will assess performance and identify opportunities for improvement as well as point out barriers to achieving program outcomes. These portfolio reviews will be conducted in coordination with the agency internal review processes supporting the analyses generated for the agency 's annual Strategic Review meeting with OMB (see section 270). Portfolio Reviews will incorporate a set of broadly applicable program management principles, practices and standards associated with successful program outcomes, in addition to mor e specific standards based on the type of program being reviewed. Agency managers will be held accountable for addressing areas identified for improvement during the review. OMB will also coordinate reviews of programs identified by GAO as most \" at risk \" for fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or most in need of transformation to address economic, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges. Strengthening Program Management Capacity to Build a Capable Program Management Workforce. Utilize a new or updated job series, or a job identifier, to better track the P/PM workforce, and investment in building program management capacity and capability over time through increased training opportunities, career pathways, and mentorship opportunities. Improving the management of government programs will require agencies to professionalize this critical workforce on an increasing basis, encouraging the application of education, training, and experience to inform critical thinking and expert analysis that will support dec ision -making and overcome challenges to program implementation and execution. Agencies will develop program and project managers via a career path that provides experience and mentorship opportunities designed to teach these skillsets. The complexity and diversity of Federal programs will require sustained and long-term focus to improve P/PM. As such, implementation across these three strategies will proceed in a phased approach, with learning from the initial years of implementation informing future phase s. 270.4 How is the role of the COO impacted by implementation of the strategies for strengthening P/PM? As outlined in s ection 200, the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 created the position of COO and is responsible for providing overall organization management to improve and achieve the mission and goals of the agency. By creating the position of Program Management Improvement Officers (PMIOs) at agencies, the PMIAA introduces a focus at agencies for advancing the practice of P/PM across the Federal Government, with agency COOs integrating P/PM as a component of the agencies ' broader organizational management functions and capabilities. COOs provide organizational leadership to improve performance of both mission and management functions. They bring together other leaders and staff within the agency, including component managers, program and project managers, Evaluation Officers and research and evaluation experts, and other leaders of key management functions such as the Chief Information Officer (C IO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO), the Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), the Performance Improvement Officer (PIO), and the Chief Data Officer (CDO). With leadership from the COO, these and SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT Page 4 of Section 270 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) other agency leaders collectively solve problems and pursue opportunities that help the agency operate more effectively and efficiently. COOs empower these senior accountable officials to lead within their area of expertise, drive results, and ensure these officials have the t ools and authority needed to manage both within and across organizational boundaries to improve results. COOs also ensure that senior officials and supporting staff offices are organized to leverage agency expertise in a range of management activities and functions, and develop these skills where needed within various levels of the organization. To achieve success, COOs require organizational expertise across a range of management skills and fields, including P/PM, and should ensure these skills are lever aged effectively to support agency needs at various levels of organizational complexity (e.g., departmental headquarters, bureau or component level, implementation of a program at the field office level). COOs must ensure that agency officials work collabo ratively in pursuit of the agency mission to provide analysis that informs the decision -making of senior leaders, and aids in identifying improvements to achieve greater efficiencies or effectiveness in the delivery of agency programs and services. An ove rview of the relationship of management competencies across various levels of the organization is provided below. 270.5 What is the role of the Program Management Improvement Officer (PMIO), and how does the agency designate and notify OMB of the designation? The heads of each CFO Act agency shall designate a senior executive of the agency to serve as the agency 's PMIO. The names of the agency PMIO, to include updates as applicable, shall be provided to OMB 's Office of Performance and Personnel Management via email at Performance@omb.eop.gov . PMIOs will focus on professionalizing agency program and project managers and enhancing the utilization of P/PM practices to build greater capability at agencies over time. PMIOs will be designated based on the agency 's organizational structure and management processes, and will report directly to the agency COO, Deputy Secretary, or other equivalent senior agency official responsible for agency performance and management. When designating the PMIO, agency heads should consider lines of accountability and coordination needed to ensure the PMIO is aligned and partnered with supporting management offices and SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 270 CXO functions such as the CFO, CHCO, CAO, and CIO to effectively perform their roles and responsibilities. Agency heads should also ensure that the PMIO has program management expertise. Agencies may either establish the PMIO as a separate position, or assign the responsibilities to a senior official alre ady performing related functions (e.g., the PIO, CAO, etc.) where the agency has determined the designation to be effective in carrying out PMIO responsibilities. The Act gives specific direction to the designation of the PMIO at the Department of Defense. Improvements in program management should lead to improved program performance and effectiveness that advances progress towards the achievement of agency strategic goals and objectives. In order to enhance and coordinate the practice and application of program management at agencies, the PMIOs are expected to support the head of the agency and COO functions by performing the following roles within their agencies: C oordinate development of agency -specific program management policies and processes, which are aligned to the Government -wide standards and principles for managing programs provided in section 270.8 , and refine to reflect best practices as needed over time. Oversee and ensure implementation of program and project management policies , including tools and techniques, established by the agency. Coordinate reviews of agency programs and portfolios with agency PIOs as an activity that is integrated into the agency 's annual Strategic Review process. Collaborate and partner with other management fu nctions, bureaus, component program offices, and goal leaders to oversee and improve the execution of program management policies and processes that improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs where needed. Collaborate with and support CIOs to en sure information technology ( IT) programs and projects have trained and qualified program and project managers with the appropriate qualifications per the approved Federal IT P rogram Management Guidance Matrix and to enforce FITARA, OMB Memorandum M -04-19 , and O MB Me morandum M -10-27 pol icy for IT programs. Collaborate and provide P/PM expertise as part of cross-functional agency infrastructure teams in implementing Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) programs. See OMB Memorandum M-22-12 , A dvancing Effective Stewardship of Taxpayer Resources and Outcomes in the Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act . C ollaborate and partner with OPM, CHCOs, and Chief Learning Officers to: o Identify the key skills and competencies related to P/PM that helps inform the establishment of a new OPM occupational series, or update to and improvement of existing occupational series for program and project management by OPM, as applicable. o Develop, refine, or tailor training programs that enhance the practice of program management within the agency. o Develop a talent management plan that is appropriately integrated into agency strategic, performance, and human capital and acquisition human capital plans to ensure an effectively trained and equipped program management workforce. SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT Page 6 of Section 270 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Serve on the PMPC and share agency best practices and lessons learned for the benefit of broader community of Federal program and project managers and s taff. Instill and reinforce a culture of professionalism and excellence within agencies for performance and program management to: o Empower program and project managers to develop strategies to successfully manage their projects and programs. o Hold progra m and project managers accountable for achieving results, such as those defined action plans or other operational and implementation planning documents , to improve program effectiveness to overcome barriers to program performance. Encourage program and pr oject managers to apply their education, training and experience through critical thinking and expert analysis that supports decision-making to solve problems and challenges in implementing and executing programs. 270.6 What is the role of the Program Mana gement Policy Council (PMPC)? Established by the PMIAA, the PMPC serves as the principal interagency forum for improving agency practices related to P/PM across the Federal Government. OMB 's Deputy Director for Management, or their designee, will hold the title of Chairperson and c hair the Council. The Chairperson will be responsible for presiding at meetings, determining the agenda of the Council, and directing its work to enhance program management within the Federal Government. In addition to the Chairperson, the Council is comprised of: OMB 's Administrator of the Office of E -Government and Information Technology OMB 's Administrator of Federal Procurement Policy OMB 's Controller of the Office of Federal Financial Management OMB 's Associate Director of the Office of Performance and Personnel Management Rotating Program Associate Director from an OMB Resource Management Office PMIOs from the 24 CFO Act agencies Chair of the Federal Program and Project Management Community of Practice The Council will oversee implementation of the Act and adoption of P/PM practices among agencies to drive improvements in program performance and efficiency. The Council will at a minimum convene at least twice annually and focus on sharing best practices and lessons learn ed across the Federal Government. Additionally, joint Council meetings may also be held with other interagency groups that share a similar focus on driving shared solutions to government -wide management improvement initiatives (e.g., the President 's Manage ment Council, the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, etc.), and where policy areas overlap. The Council will also engage the Federal Program and Project Management Community of Practice (FedPM CoP), in addition to other stakeholder groups as appropriate, to work collaboratively and leverage their ability to connect Federal employees to a wide array of resources and networking opportunities. As the primary interagency forum for improving agency practices related to P/PM, the Council will: Oversee agency adoption and provide a central , coordinating body for implementation of the Act 's major provisions. SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 270 Share program management best practices and lessons learned (case studies, templates, agency - specific guidelines, technology resources, etc.) for the benef it of Council members, and encourage their adoption where applicable within agencies. Discuss areas of focus and emphasis related to the training and competency of program and project managers. Identify barriers and challenges to P/PM within agencies to foster cross-agency dialogue and shared solutions to common problems. Identify, develop, and refine core P/PM capabilities and expertise associated with successful program outcomes, as needed. Develop tips, tools, training, and other capacity -building mechanisms to strengthen agency P/PM. Coordinate and promote agency P/PM learning opportunities , including conferences, webinars, and other for ums, through a committee established to support the Council 's efforts. Facilitate cross -agency learning and cooperation by considering the program management experiences of entities both within and outside the Federal Government. Review and advise on the results of program reviews conducted by OMB, agencies, and GAO on programs identified by GAO as \" high risk. \" Advise on the development and continued refinement of general and program -specific government- wide standards, policies, guidelines, and principles for P/PM for executive agencies. 270.7 Who supports the work of the PMIO? Agencies may create a dedicated PMIO staff and/or identify cross-agency teams from various supporting management offices and functions (such as the CFO, CHCO, CAO, CIO, PIO, CDO, Evaluation Officer, etc.) to support the PMIO 's efforts to assist the COO in strengthening the P/PM practices and culture to improve program outcomes and cost -effectiveness. PMIOs are also encouraged to leverage the resources provided by such groups as the Federal Program and Project Management Community of Practice ( FedPMCoP ) and Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI), in addition to others who have knowledge and expertise in this critical management field. For example, the FedPM CoP is a government -wide community of practice that combines the energy and expertise of thought leaders in the area of program and project management from all agencies across the Federal Government to help facilitate government -wide improvement of program and project management practices and execution. The FedPM CoP actively works to connect Federal employees to a wide array of program and project management resources which can assist PMIOs in institutionalizing this management function at their agencies. Agencies can access the resources of the FedPM CoP directly on their MAX Community page . SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT Page 8 of Section 270 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 270.8 What government -wide standards and principles for program and project management have been developed, and how should they be applied to programs by program and project managers at agencies? OMB, in conjunction with agencies and stakeholders, has developed a set of common, principle-based government -wide program management standards that agencies can apply to programs to ensure they produce their desired outcomes and effectively contribute towards the achievement of agency mission and strategic goals and objectives, as required by the PMIAA. These principle-based standards have been developed with consideration given to the variation among programs implemented by agencies. OMB 's approach to these principle -based standards is to continue to develop and refine them over time by the PMPC in collaboration with private industry and stakeholders with expertise in P/PM. Areas Standard / Principle Change Management Development of methods for recording changes to established baselines and requirements within a program lifecycle on a procedural, operational or organizational level , and communications plan for disseminating identified changes to increase awareness and cooperation to facilitate execution . Communications Planning, Stakeholder Engagement, and Coalition Building Building coalitions internally and with other Federal agencies, State and local governments, or nonprofit and private sector organizations to achieve program goals. Includes aspects of: Partnering and Team Building - developing networks, building teams and alliances, and collaborating across boundaries to build strategic relationships to achieve program goals. Understanding the Human Factor - Identifying internal and external relationships that may impact the program. Influencing / Negotiating - Persuading others, building consensus, and gaining cooperation to achieve program goals. Contracting and Acquisition Management Development of statements of objectives, statem ents of work, concept of operations, cost, schedule, scope, earned value management, and supporting documents to best plan and track the procurement of program requirements and projects. Customer Experience Delivering customer satisfaction by employing ef fective time management skills, clear communication, product/service knowledge and goal -oriented focus in program implementation. Evaluation Systematically assessing how well an entire program, or a specific strategy or an aspect of a program, is working to achieve intended result or outcomes. Financial Management Applying budget, accounting, financial controls and audit principles to ensure the stewardship of taxpayer resources throughout program execution. Human Capital Management Building and managi ng the program 's workforce requirements based on organizational and program goals, budget considerations, and staffing needs. Includes strategies and actions for ensuring employees are appropriately recruited, selected, appraised, and rewarded, and action taken to address performance problems. Information Management Activities related to the planning, budgeting, manipulating, and controlling of information throughout the program 's life cycle, encompassing both information itself and the related resources, such as personnel, equipment, funds, and information technology that support the program. Performance Management Use of goals, measurement, evaluation, analysis, and data -driven reviews to improve program results. SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 270 Areas Standard / Principle Portfolio Management Defining a set of p rograms, projects, contracts and other work that support strategic goals. Process Improvement Employing a systematic application of disciplined problem solving techniques to impact the operations of systems or programs. Uses Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) models to leverage strategy and performance management data to identify and eliminate waste, reduce variation, and satisfy the needs of customers. Project Management Applying general and specialized knowledge, skills, expertise, and practices to a temporary endeavor with a defined scope, cost and completion date. A project may be part of a larger program or portfolio. Requirements Development and Management Identifying program needs and matching identified needs to the organization' s mission and g oals. Developing preliminary and subsequent capital planning, budget formulation, cost/ benefit analysis, and investment decision document for evaluation and justification of program costs. Risk Management Coordinated activities to direct and control challenges or threats to achieving a program 's goals and objectives, and includes developing risk mitigation plans to overcome potential barriers to program performance. Strategic Planning Planning activity to present the long -term objectives the program hopes to accomplish, what actions the agency will take to realize those goals, and how the agency will deal with the challenges likely to arise as barriers to achieving the desired outcomes. Agency managers should apply these standards to internal management processes for planning, implementing, and reviewing the performance of programs and activities. Adoption of these principles and application of their practice should be incorporated or aligned with existing agency -specific program management policies and practices, and tailored to reflect the size, scope, structure, organizational placement, and characteristics that a ffect delivery of the program. 270.9 Can agencies adopt or use alternative or agency -specified policies, standards, and principles for program management? Yes. Many Federal agencies have established policies, procedures, and standards for managing programs currently in place, which reflect the specific organizational and programmatic characteristics of the agency. Agencies may continue to utilize existing agency and program -specific policies, procedures, and standards for managing agency programs, but they must generally align and be equivalent to or encompassed by the manag ement areas and standards outlined in s ection 270.8. Agencies may also use program management standards that have been developed and endorsed by external voluntary consensus standards bodies. Agency PMIOs will determine whether adopting the program manag ement standards of external voluntary consensus standards bodies are most effective for managing agency specific programs and activities. Instances in which agency -specific program management policies do not align to the management areas in section 270.8 , or where an external consensus standards body 's framework is being utilized will be identified by the PMIO for discussion with OMB. These discussions will help inform ongoing work by the PMPC to refine as needed the government -wide P/PM standards. 270.10 What reviews are required by the PMIAA? The PMIAA requires two types of program reviews be conducted to assess the effectiveness of an agency program 's management of performance and risk. SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT Page 10 of Section 270 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 1. P rogram Portfolio Reviews. CFO- Act agencies and OMB will regularly review portfolios of programs to identify opportunities for improvement. Beginning with the 2019 strategic review, these reviews were to be conducted in coordination with the agency 's strategic review, which serves as the agency 's management process or set of processes to assess performance across the organizational enterprise and analyze progress on the agency 's strategic objectives towards mission accomplishment. Findings and analyses from the agency 's strategic review will be shared with OMB during Strategic Review meetings each spring. Agencies will integrate to the extent practical program portfolio reviews required by the Act as part of their internal strategic review processes so that performance data and results generated by the portfolio reviews may be used to inform the assessment of strategic objective progress discussed with OMB during the spring meeting. See section 260 for a discussion of OMB 's role in the Strategic Review process which may be leveraged for the Program Portfolio Reviews conducted under the PMIAA. 2. GA O High Risk Areas. Since 1990, GAO has released a biennial report (in alignment with the start of each Congress) on Federal programs and operations deemed \"high risk\" due to their vulnerabilities to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, or those most in need of transformative change to address economic, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges. Beginning in 2018, OMB will conduct portfolio revi ews of the most at -risk agency programs designated as high risk by GAO in its biennial report, and follow an annual cadence for conducting future portfolio reviews. As revised \"high risk list \" reports are published by GAO, new areas may be added to the annual review process for engagement with OMB. Since the first GAO high risk report, more than one -third of the areas designated as high risk have successfully resolved concerns, and been subsequently removed from the list. However, many issues are long -stand ing; six of the areas identified in the original 1990 report remain on the high-risk list today. This and other factors will be taken into consideration as OMB reviews the high risk list and prioritizes areas for agency and GAO engagement to address these programmatic management challenges. 270.11 W hat is the relationship of the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act 's (FITARA) annual information technology (IT ) portfolio reviews to the portfolio reviews required by PMIAA? Pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 11319 , agency CIOs, in conjunction with COOs and Deputy Secretaries, are required to conduct an annual review of the IT portfolio of the covered agency with OMB. To the extent practical, the annual IT portfolio reviews required by FITARA will be coordinated with the portfolio review requirements of the PMIAA and integrated into the agency 's internal review processes in preparing materials for the annual Strategic Review meeting with OMB each spring. 270.12 Wh at is OMB' s role in the GAO High Risk area reviews? Portfolio reviews of GAO high -risk programs will focus on reducing each portfolio' s vulnerability to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. The focus of high risk program portfolio reviews by OMB and agencies will be aligned with the criteria used by GAO in evaluating each high -risk issue, examining progress, and proposing improvements in the following areas. Leadership Commitment - Demonstrated strong commitment and top leadership support. Capacity - Agency has the capacity (i.e., people and resources) to resolve the risk(s). Action Plan - A corrective action plan exists that defines the root cause, recommends solutions, and provides for substantially completing corrective measures, including steps necessary to implement recommended solutions. SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 270 Monitoring - A program has been instituted to monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures. Demonstrated Progress - Ability to demonstrate progress in implementing corrective measures and resolving the high-risk area. GAO High Risk list reviews will be cross-c utting in nature and are anticipated to generally occur as tri - lateral engagements between senior management officials within OMB, applicable agencies, and GAO. OMB 's Deputy Director for Management (DDM) will coordinate and lead engagements during the revi ew process, and will convene GAO high -risk meetings to review status updates and provide direction to address identified risks and challenges in areas where additional management attention could be beneficial . 270.13 How do the GAO High Risk reviews apply to IT programs? Agencies will continue to conduct TechStats as outlined by FITARA implementation guidance for IT programs that are listed on the GAO High Risk list. 270.14 How should agencies implement the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (PMIAA) program portfolio reviews as part of the strategic review? The PMIAA 's program portfolio reviews are designed to assess the effectiveness of an agency 's overall management of programs and projects by regularly reviewing performance data in order to understand operational or programmatic risks to implementation, and make course corrections by changing execution strategies and actions accordingly. Because most Federal agencies will require a number of years to fully implement PMIAA, agencies and OMB are initially focusing on implementation of program portfolio reviews in the area of non -IT major acquisition programs, identifying approximately 1-2 projects for additional management review of cost and other performance information. The program por tfolio reviews should be conducted in coordination with the agency 's internal strategic review assessments in order to better integrate and streamline these management reviews. As part of the maturity path for the PMIAA, agencies should include - where possible - key cost and other performance data (e.g., schedule) with the submission of their Summary of Findings by Strategic Objective for the small subset (approximately 1 -2) of non-IT major acquisition programs or projects the agency has previously identif ied, in consultation with OMB, for implementing the Act's program portfolio reviews. The submission of cost and other performance data for the 1 -2 non-IT major acquisition programs or projects as part of the Summary of Findings analysis will help identify how these projects map to the agency 's strategic goals and objectives framework, and serve as the core of the program portfolio reviews between OMB/agencies. As the integration and coordination of PMIAA portfolio reviews mature as a component of the agency 's strategic review, agencies should make refinements as applicable in order for PMIAA portfolio reviews to effectively inform assessments of progress being made towards the broader outcomes articulated by the agency 's strategic goals and obj ectives through the strategic review . SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT Page 12 of Section 270 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 270.15 Improving program and project management will require agencies to focus on developing this management skillset. What actions should agencies take as part of PMIAA implementation related to program and project management workforce development and training? Effective program management requires a trained and competent workforce equipped with program management experience, knowledge, and expertise, including the use of critical thinking that supports decision -making to solve program management challenges. OMB and agencies will take the following steps related to talent management and training to improve the competencies of their P/PM workforce across all areas, and identifying and tracking program managers throughout the agency to match their skillsets to better meet agency program management requirements. Program Management Job Series / Identifier: o Competencies: OPM, working in consultation with OMB and the PMPC, identif ied the key skills and competencies needed for program and project managers in an agency . The Program and Project Management Competencies consist of 32 general competencies and 19 technical competencies that have been identified on a Government -wide basis for program and project management work by individual program or project managers . The list of these competencies can be found in an April 5, 2019, memorandum published by OPM titled Program M anagement Improvement Accountability Act - Program and Project Management Competencies . o Job Series: OPM , working in consultation with OMB and the PMPC, reviewed its current policy guidance on program and project management work performed across established occupational series, to include a review of 0340, the existing Program Management Series . This review resulted in an update d and improve d existing occupational job series, Program Management - 0340 job series, and the Interpretive Guidance for Classifying Project Management work . OPM issued their memorandum titled PMIAA - Po sition Classification for Program Management Series 0340 and the Interpretive Guidance for Program Management Positions o n May 2, 2019. This memorandum provides guidance to agenci es for implementation of the Position Classification Flysheet for Program Management Series 0340, and the Interpretive Guidance for Project Management Positions. The Flysheet provides the series definition, titling instructions, and occupational information for classifying progra m management positions. Agencies can use the Interpretive Guidance for Project Management Positions to identify and classify project management positions. o Following the completion of their review of the existing Program Management job series, OPM is review ing the appropriateness of a program management job identifier which, when combined with an existing occupational series, will identify and code Federal positions with program management functions. Utilization of the job identifier and job series will allow agency leadership to pinpoint these critical positions throughout the workforce. Training and Development: OPM conduct s a competency assessment of program and project managers throughout the government to identify competency gaps. Working in consulta tion with OMB, CHCOs, Chief Learning Officers ( CLOs), and the PMPC, OPM will leverage these communities as well as the expertise of applicable government -wide Councils (e.g., CHCO Council, CAO Council, PIC, etc.) to lead a review of existing G overnment -wide training and recommend training and development options to the PMIOs. PMIOs will review OPM recommendations and existing agency -specific training to determine gaps in the training and SECTION 270 \u2014PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 270 development of program and project managers. In collaboration with agency CHCOs and CLOs, PMIOs should identify strategies to close competency gaps, develop program managers to their fullest potential, and ensure agencies have personnel who can readily assume senior program management positions. C areer Paths: Career paths are a critical success factor for establishing an effective job progression process, enabling capable and competent program managers to successfully manage Federal programs of all sizes and levels of complexity. In addition to improving performance, establ ished career paths also facilitate program manager recruitment and retention. OPM is build ing upon the model used during previous work with IT program managers to: o I dentify key skills and competencies. o Establish a career path to develop capable and competent program managers. M entoring Programs : PMIOs will work with agency CHCOs to develop and implement a mentoring strategy for agency program and project managers, leveraging existing programs within the agency where applicable. Mentoring programs will pair program and project managers at various levels of experience to share institutional knowledge and allow senior leaders to offer junior and mid-level colleagues their insights and guidance. Agency mentoring strategies should be included as a component of the PMIAA implementation plan detailed above . 270.16 A re there other actions agencies should take that apply to acquisition-specific program and project managers? Yes. Agencies should refer to OMB Memorandum M -18-19 f or additional guidance on actions and strategies required that apply to acquisition -specific program and project management workforce development .

Summary of Change s Updates submission dates for required deliverables, provides simplified structures for transaction surveys and data collection, and outlines leading practices for effective management of customer experience. This update also provides additional connection between customer research efforts and the Paperwork Reduction Act, and provides additional detail on the collection of digital analytics data to augment transactional surveys. 280.1 Who is responsible for c ustomer experience and service delivery ? All Executive agencies (5 U .S.C. 105) have a responsibility to manage customer experience and improve service delivery using leading practices and a human -centered approach , pursuant to Executive Order 14058 (\"E.O. 14058 \") on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery To Rebuild Trust in Government of December 13, 2021, and the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (P.L. 115-336) (\"21st Century IDEA \"). All agencies should apply the guidance provided in this section for annual customer experience management and planning, as well as the design of feedback surveys and measureme nt strategies for the performance of Federal services. This guidance provides detail on activities to be conducted by designated High Impact Service P rovider s (HISP s, as defined in section 280. 11), which are required to implement the guidance in sections 280. 12 through 280. 15. 280.2 What is Federal g overnment customer experience and service delivery ? It is the Federal government 's responsibility to ensure that every interaction a member of the public has with their government demonstrates competence and transparency and builds trust. As defined by E.O. SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY Page 2 of Section 280 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 14058, the term \"customer experience\" (\"CX\") means the public' s perceptions of a nd overall satisfaction with interactions with an agency, product, or service.1 Building on this definition and applied in the broader context of this Section and the Federal Performance Framework , the term refers to a combination of factors that result from touchpoints between an individual , business, or organization and the Federal government over the duration of an interaction, service journey, and relationship. These factors of experience can include : ease/simplicity /effort (burden/friction), efficiency/speed , transparency , equity (e.g., participation, access), humanity (e.g., respect, dignity, empathy) , effectiveness/perceived value of the service itself, and interactions with any employees. Perceived responsiveness to individual needs and ability to provide feedback is also important.2 Similar to their application in the private sector, these factors can drive the overall satisfaction with and trust in the program, agency, and the government at large . A customer 's experience interacting with the Federal government directly contributes to their trust in government itself .3 To that end, measures of experience are of co-equal importance as traditional measures of financial and operational performance , and which this document begins to outline an accountability framework to deliver. Services are the unit of observation for this performance accountability irrespective of perceived current ownership or budgetary/organizational lines. \"Service delivery \" means the actions taken by an organization, such as the Federal government, related to providing a benefit or service to a customer of a Federal government entity; the term refers to the multitude of diverse interactions between a customer and Federal agency. The Federal customer experience framework is centered on services. Services are a more well - defined unit of observation for customer experience management than a Federal program . I n many sectors, the service, even more so than the offering or end product , determines the customer 's satisfaction and the reputation of the organization or brand. Other factors affect customers' total experience - the environment, prior interactions, etc. - but the service is the most critical part controlled by the entity. T oday, citizens are dissatisfied with government services when compared against the private sector, which has leveraged technology, process re-design, self -service, empowered front lines, and other tactics to raise expectations. All Federal agencies should have knowledge, and in some instances documentation, of the services they provide (e.g., SNAP recertification, land border checkpoints, business tax filing) and should be able to articulate how the components of the services, such as the occasion, offering, channels, roles, and tools , come together to make up the agencies ' approach to service design and delivery. The Federal customer experience framework is intended to provide agencies with a clear approach and roadmap for aligning service design with customer needs. For definitions of terms (such as \" services\" and service types) used in the previous paragraphs as well as others relating to CX and service delivery, please see https://performance.gov/cx/ terms . 280.3 How should agencies identify services? The 21 st Century IDEA requires all Executive agencies (5 U.S.C. 105) to identify public non- digital, paper - based, or in -person government services for purposes of digitization. To fulfill this requirement, OMB requires agencies to develop an inventory of all services - digital, non-digital, paper -based, and in -person -offered to their primary customers, tasks to get or manage each service, and channels available to complete each task (e.g., online, in person, phone, mail, paper, etc.) and submit this information to OMB. 1 E.O. 14058 defined critical terms like \"Customer Experience.\" A list of related terms and their definitions can be found here: https://performance.gov/cx/ terms 2 The OECD has done work to demonstrate that \"government' s competence - its responsiveness and reliability in delivering public services and anti cipating new needs - are crucial for boosting trust in institutions. \" See https://www.oecd.org/gov/trust-in - government.htm . 3 A recent analysis reveals that 67 percent of the public 's trust i n government comes from their experience with government programs. See https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social -s ector/our-insights/Customer-Experience-in -the-Public- Sector . SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 280 280.4 What are agency responsibilities to deliver services and make them available through multiple channels ? Service delivery through multiple channels increases access and participation , ensuring that government services are available to all - including those who need them the most , such as underserved communities. Agencies are encouraged to leverage a multi-channel approach - as is appropriate , feasible, and supported by customer research - including both traditional (e.g., in -person, postal mail, or phone) and digital channels, to ensure the equitable and effective delivery of services. Agencies should maintain accessible methods for completing services to en able individuals without sufficient access to information technology and/or digital literacy to successfully utilize those services. 280.5 How should agencies collect metrics to analyze digital services? Agencies should ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that all services and tasks are made available through digital channel s using industry leading practices and human -centered design . Examples of digital service channels include websites, mobile apps, email, text messaging, and social media. In general, and consistent with the requirements in OMB Memoranda M-10-22 of June 25, 2010, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies agencies should use t he following leading practices for gathering and analyzing metrics for digital service s: I n designing metrics for a website or web application, agencies should work backward from customer insights and strategic questions. Agencies should define specific actions they plan to take to improve digital experience with the service or product based on insights derived from digital analytics. An agency 's digital analytics program (e.g., the General Services Administration 's Digital Analytics Program ) sh ould capture data from key customer actions, such as button clicks, page views, and transactions. At tach timestamps to data points to trace a user 's journey through time as well as analyze macro - level shifts in user behavior over longer time periods. Collect website and web application metrics on a continuous basis to observe longitudinal trends. Website and web application data should be collected in a structured and machine -readable format to facilitate quantitative aggregation ( e.g., sum, median, mean, minimum, maximum) of customer behavior data for analytics and monitoring. Agencies are encouraged to implement continuous monitoring and dashboards to proactively visualize when there has been a significant change or regression in the customer 's digital experience (e.g., if page views or volume of key transactions has suddenly dropped). Implementing alarms to send alerts when critical metrics have regressed allow s for immediate corrective action. As new user flows are added, digital analytics should be implemented at the launch of the new feature to ensure comprehensive monitoring of customer digital experience. Changes to continuous monitoring and dashboards should reflect any user flows that are optimized, deprecated , or replaced. SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY Page 4 of Section 280 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Customer ex perience transactional data generates perceptions of trust, confidence, and satisfaction with government services ( see section 280.14 ). The collection and use of website and web application data may be used to augment point -in-time data and may also be instrumental for evaluating an agency 's changes to digital service s that enhance customer interactions and experiences. 280.6 What is the purpose of implementing this guidance ? Implementing the guidance specified in this section will esta blish a more consistent, comprehensive, robust , and deliberate approach to CX across g overnment. The purpose of this guidance is to: Increase agencies ' understanding of customer s' needs and measure continuous improvement of Federal g overnment services to better meet customers ' priorit ies; Establish a CX- mindful culture across Federal g overnment services; Improve customer trust in Federal g overnment; Provide structure and consistency around how agencies/programs approach CX; Promote accountability and governance mechanisms to improve service design, quality and service; Ensure Federal service providers are making progress in growing CX program maturity , service definition, and applying leading practices4; Ensure Federal service providers are receiving and acting upon customer feedback to drive performance improvement and service recovery; Allow for government -wide comparative assessment of trust in government following interactions ; Ensure transparen cy through informed consent and public reporting ; and, Encourage the application of human-centered design as foundational to achieving customer experience outcomes. 280.7 How should agencies manage customer experience? At multiple levels of government organizations (departmental enterprise, bureau, program office, service center), elements of core CX functions should be present . 5 These include : M easurement : Defining and instituting CX outcome measures, as well as service operational measures, to ensure accountability for improving service delivery and communicating performance across the organization and to the public, routinely analyzing and making use of this data; Go vernance and Strategy: Institutionalizing C X by identifying executives and leaders responsible, organizing supporting resources, defining the processes by which strategic decisions incorporate 4 For examples of leading practices and industry frameworks for managing customer experience, please review the annual CX Capacity Assessment template provided on performance.gov/cx . 5 For a practitioner 's guide on implementing CX core functions and capabilities, see the CX Cookbook, https://www.performance.gov/cx/assets/files/va -customer- experience -cookbook.pdf . SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 280 customer perspective, and aligning CX strategy and activities with business decisions, initiatives and inve stments within the agency 's broader mission and strategic priorities; C ulture and Organization: Acquiring and developing the talent required to incorporate and improve CX within agency activities, and empowering all employees to adopt a CX mindset through training, performance measurement, and rewards; C ustomer Understanding: Identifying the main occasions that result in the public making use of or interacting with Federal services and conducting qualitative and quantitative research across organizationa l silos to map intra -agency customer journeys, as well as cross-agency journeys where applicable, to build and continually refine a knowledge base of the agency 's customer segments and needs, integrating disparate customer interaction and administrative data; and, S ervice Design and Improvement : Adopting a customer -focused approach to the implementation of services, involving and engaging internal and external customers in feedback gathering and iterative development, designing and building digital produc ts and services, adopting leading practices to deliver more efficient and effective interactions , and sharing lessons learned across government. Each fiscal year, Executive agencies should reflect on their maturity and capacity to perform these f unctions , such as during strategic review, annual planning, and in executing requirements outlined in this section . Further, agencies and programs should develop an understanding of the types of and explicit definition of the services they offer (as defined in sections 280.2 and 280.3); this should include an assessment of the talent they have to perform and oversee these functions, and specifically identify needs for hiring individuals with the expertise and experience into their agency . 280.8 H ow do these efforts relate to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), reducing burden, improving access, and engaging customers? Engaging customers and speaking directly with the public is a central component of h uman -centered design and leads to a better understanding of the problems faced by the public, including underserved communities, which helps agencies design solutions that are more responsive to the needs of the American people. The surveys described in section 280.14 are not the only methods through which agenci es can engage with customers. When developing approaches to customer engagement, research, and feedback gathering, agencies should also consider burdens placed on individuals and groups most affected by information collection related to accessing and maint aining eligibility for public benefits programs. 6 Agencies are to submit the feedback surveys described in section 28 0.14 for approval under the PRA using the OMB Circular A-11 Section 280 Umbrella Clearance that can be established at the department level using the templates provided on the Customer Experience Collections MAX Page . Indi vidual collection reque sts under this clearance will be reviewed by OMB 's CX Desk Officer in collaboration with the relevant policy analyst in OMB 's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in an effort to further harmonize the review of these types of collections. These umbrella clearances provide a framework for conducting qualitative customer research and user testing, both of which seek to involve the individuals and organizations that agencies serve in the actual design and improvement of those services. 6 Considering burden is in alignment with E .O. 14058, E .O. 13985 o f January 25, 2021, on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, E.O. 14091 of February 16, 2023, on Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government and OMB Memorandum M- 22-10 of April 13, 2022 , Improving Access to Public Benefits Programs Through the Paperwork Reduction Act . SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY Page 6 of Section 280 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Outsid e of the OMB Circular A-11 Section 280 Clearance , agencies are able to explore other opportunities for customer engagement. Agencies should note that approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act is not always required when speak ing with members of the public , and OIRA has published ex tensive guidelines that can help guide agencies to appropriate flexibilities. Below are a few highlights that may be useful when an agency is looking to learn about the public 's experience with their services: N ine or Fewer Members of the P ublic: PRA approval is not needed when an agency is speaking with nine or fewer members of the public . Often discovery and design work can be accomplished effectively with nine or fewer people, such as through interviews, focus groups, or product testing. However, using multiple groups of nine for the same purpose or with the same set of questions would require PRA approval. Re cruiting 10 or M ore Members of the Public: The applicability of the PRA for recruiting members of the public depends on the intention and specifics of the request. For example, asking if people are interested in participating and, if so, to send contact information for attendance does not require a PRA approval ; asking one or more screening questions (orally or in writing), such as \"what zip code do you live in?\" and \"to what degree do you use this service? \" will require a PRA approval . Op en -Ended Questions During the Design/ Discovery Phase: Conducting unscripted conversations in the design or discovery phase will not generally require PRA approval (e.g., displaying a prototype or service and asking for general thoughts and reactions, asking participants to narrate their experience of using a p roduct or service, and asking questions during a public listening session to promote discussion). P ost -Transaction Data Collection of 10 or More Individuals : PRA approval is needed for post- transaction surveys (assuming an agency is surveying 10 or more individuals) . When data is being collected to understand and continuously improve an existing product or service (not during the design and discovery phases), the PRA will apply. I ncreasingly, agencies are recognizing the importance of including hard -to-reach populations, particularly those from underserved communities, in their samples in order to improve the quality and representation of customer research . If your agency wishes to provide compensation or incentives to participants in focus groups or other similarly time and effort -intensive feedback surveys, the first step is to have a conversation with your agency 's legal counsel to determine whether your agency may offer incentives, and if so, what kind and in what amount. If your agency' s legal cou nsel approves providing incentives to participants, you will need to justify these incentives in the Information Collection Review package you submit to OMB. Contact the OMB CX Desk Officer for an example of what a justification for incentives should look like for purposes of the PRA submission to OMB. 280.9 How can agencies know their services are working and delivering value for the public? Traditionally, agencies have solely used output and program integrity measures to assess performance. Under E .O. 14058, experience measures are considered equal ly as importan t as operational measures. There are various ways agencies should be collecting and using customer experience measures to monitor, improve, and report on the customer experience of their designated services. The following activities are core components of effective service delivery at an agency : C ustomer Research Activities: Customer research is one of the first steps agencies can take to better understand their customers and is generally associated with the discovery phase of the CX journey. Customer research enables agencies to learn who their customers are, their specific needs, and what SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 280 pain points exist, among other insights. Research can be conducted in both structured (e.g., a customer survey, a focus group) and unstructured (e.g., in-person customer observation, reviewing social media messages). Common products result ing from customer research include user personas, customer segments, and journey maps. User Feedback Activities: User feedback typically involves using tangible artifacts to help better understand how users will react or interact with a new or improved product or service (e.g., assessing customer reactions to a plan language rewrite of a website, launching a prototype of a new digital form). User fe edback activities can be conducted in many formats including user observations , focus groups, card sorting, usability studies, A/B testing, and other methods. P ost -Transaction Feedback Data Collection: Post-transaction feedback is any feedback that is collected from customers after they have engaged with a provider at a moment in their service journey . Typically, a post- transaction survey collects data on measures such as trust and other drivers of experience. With some exceptions, OMB defines post -transaction feedback as the 48- hour period following the end of a customer interaction with a service, acknowledging that the most appropriate post -transaction feedback opportunity may vary by the type of service. Da ta -Driven Decision -Making: Data gathered by agencies (e.g., administrative data, systems data, digital analytics data, post -transaction feedback data, etc.) should form a customer listening data ecosystem that informs agency decision -making, goalsetting, and strategic planning. Data should be made available to staff directly managing service delivery, as well as leadership overseeing agency priority -setting on a regular and consistent basis. Agencies should also ensure staff exist within the organization that have the skillset and e xperience to analyze and communicate various data. Where practical, agencies should integrate customer experience measures into existing dashboards of operational metrics in ways that consider specifics of service delivery, such as differentiating between channels, regions, and customer segments. V oice of the Customer (VOC) Programs: A VOC program is a systematic approach for collecting, analyzing, and taking actions based on the customer feedback data that an organization collects. Data types may include structured sources (e.g., e nd of interaction ; end of journey feedback surveys), and unstructured sources (e.g., emails, online reviews, social media messaging, chats, and call center notes). A mature VOC program includes three core elements: 1) an enterprise surveying platform that is able to solicit, ingest, analyze, and visualize customer feedback, as well as integrate with operational, digital analytics, and case management data; 2) sufficient agency staffing to monitor, analyze, and interpr et key transaction points and trends across time; and, 3) a business process change whereby agencies are engaging leadership and frontline staff with the data to arrive at shared understanding of customer concerns and to co -design and implement improvement s. 280.10 How should customer experience be reflected in an agency's Annual Performance Plan? Agency Annual Performance Plans should include indicators for outcomes related to customer experience and relevant service levels. This should include customer feedback data collected as described below in section 280.1 4, as well as service level indicators (e.g., wait times, website analytics) appropriate to their program. More information on integrating this information into the Annual Performance Plan is included in section 210 . 280.11 What programs have been identified as High Impact Service Providers (HISPs)? As defined in E .O. 14058, High Impact Service Providers are those Federal entities designated by OMB that provide or fund high- impact customer-facing services, either due to a large customer base or a high SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY Page 8 of Section 280 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) impact on those served by the program. The list of HISPs is reviewed and updated periodically by OMB. The current list of HISPs is available at www.performance.gov/HISPs . The senior accountable official for the HIS P (or appropriate senior official) shall coordinate activities described in section 280.12 for the enterprise. In addition to relevant program and field office staff, these activities should serve as intra-agency convening mechanism s around the customers served and involve cross-cutting representation from mission support functions within the agency, including the Chief Information Officer, Chief Human Capital Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Performance Improvement Officer, Evaluation Officer, Chief Data Officer, and Customer Experience / Digital Service Teams. 280.12 W hat steps should HISPs take to manage customer experience? Given the significance of the services they provide and the requirements in E .O. 14058, HISPs must: In collaboration with OMB, designate at least two (2) priority services, in alignment with the requirements of the 21st Century IDEA and guidance outlined in this section , for focused assessment and the activities of this guidance (by May 31, 2024); C ollect customer feedback in accordance with section 280.1 4 for identified moments that matter along designated service journeys (e.g., no longer sufficient to only report general call center satisfaction measures without the context of a service journey); S ubmit this feedback data to OMB at a minimum quarterly, until feedback data is provided directly to Performance.gov through an open application programming interface (API) (once developed). Quarterly submissions will be due the last business day of th e month following the last day of the quarter; for FY 2024, these due dates are January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31, 2024; Conduct an annual CX Capacity Assessment (submitted to OMB by February 23, 2024) for both HISPs and HISP -maintaining departments and discuss the resulting findings with OMB at an annual CX Deep Dive (completed by April 14, 2024); Develop a draft CX Action Plan (submitted to OMB by May 31, 2024) and final CX Action Plan (submitted to OMB, along with the budget submission, by September 9 , 2024) annually for each designated HISP and HISP -maintaining department, with a focus on improvement actions for designated services; and, As directed in E.O. 14058, embed more customer -focused practices into their service design and deliv ery such as conducting service assessments, customer research through qualitative and quantitative research and journey mapping, approaching more holistic calculations of burden (learning, compliance, and psychological costs, in accordance with OMB Memorandum M -22-10 ) for their service transactions and full journeys, and continually user -test program elements with customers to refine and improve. 280.13 How should HISPs designate pr iority services? Annually, based on an agency 's knowledge of existing services (e.g., as in alignment with an agency 's list of services in the Federal Services Index ), each HISP is required to designate two or more of these services for targeted customer experience improvement efforts. These services will be the subject of CX Capacity Assessment and Action Plans, will be highlighted on www.performance.gov/cx , and will be the focus of customer feedback data submitted quarterly and shared publicly. SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 280 As HISPs determine which services to designate, they should consider designating pri ority services that focus on the one or two most important things the HISP does to serve its customers (e.g., high percentage of the population served, high volume of annual transactions, outsized impact in the lives of the people served [i.e., where successful use of the services has a consequential impact on the livelihood of an individual group, such as Tribal members ' access to trust assets, an individual applying for benefits under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation program] ). Impor tance can be defined in several different ways, but each HISP should be able to clearly articulate why choosing this service drives value to the organization and to customers and contributes to the performance of the agency, and should utilize data to determine which services to prioritize. HISPs should also consider OMB Memorandum M -22-10 , of April 13, 2022, Improving Access to Public Benefits Programs Through the Paper work Reduction Act when choosing services to designate. OMB Memorandum M -22-10 provides guidance to help agencies identify and reduce burdens related to applying for and maintaining eligibility for public benefits programs, with a particular focus on membe rs of underserved and marginalized communities . HI SPs should remember that services require action and should be considered through the lens of the customer: services involve actions taken by customers to accomplish task s, receive benefit s, submit information, or otherwise engage with an agency HISPs should also consider how designated services relate to their agency strategy plans, priority goals, learning agendas, equity plans, organizational health measures, and other planning processes. 280.14 H ow should HISPs collect and submit \"post-transaction \" feedback data? To assist in developing comparable, government -wide scores that enable cross- agency benchmarking (when relevant), identify those improvements and service elements that most effectively improve trust for different service types, and reduce burden on the public, programs providing services to the public should measure their touchpoint and transactional perfo rmance in line with industry leading practices for customer feedback surveys. OMB outlines three types of customer feedback surveys: P ost -Interaction : The customer recently completed (generally defined as within the last 48 hours) a single, stand -alone interaction (e.g., a survey after viewing a website to find a piece of information to initiate a service journey , or speaking with a contact center employee). P ost -Service Journey: The customer completed a series of interactions or a multi -stage process of a service (e.g., a survey after the process for applying for and receiving Federal student aid, filing an individual tax return, or a specific period of someone' s life that included transacting with services such as one -month post -partum ). Re lation al: The customer completed multiple transactions, service journeys, or a lifetime of engagement with the agency (e.g., a survey after a customer 's most recent year of interacting with an agency or program) and is asked to reflect on their transactions at a po int-in -time when a sample is collected, rather than based on a single, specific transaction . HI SPs must implement at least one customer feedback survey for each of their current designated services. If only doing one survey for a service, HISPs must implement a customer feedback survey at the completion of the service journey. HISPs may deploy multiple or as many post -transaction customer feedback surveys per designated services as needed and appropriate. HISPs should work with OMB to determine opportunit ies for post -transaction customer feedback that are most relevant and appropriate for their designated services , and provide data that enables the ongoing delivery and improvement of the services . SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY Page 10 of Section 280 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) The below framework , including question wording, response architecture, and branching logic , seeks to reduce burden on the public and to assist in developing comparable, government -wide customer experience measures that can be shared publicly . All HISPs should consider switching to this model , although exceptions will be made for HISPs that have demonstrated success with the current model and facility with and capacity to use more granular data. All post -transaction customer feedback surveys will require PRA approval under the OMB Circular A -11 Section 280 Umbrella Clearance . HISPs that shift to this more streamlined framework will be part of discussions regarding results of this model as OMB considers further implementation in FY 2024. HISP customer feedback surveys must include : Q1 Required Wording: This [interaction / service] increased my trust in [High Impact Service Provider ]. If a HISP would prefer to use a statement with a L ikert scale rating , rather than a binary question, for respondent' s agreement with that statement, adapted wording and scale will be reviewed as part of the PRA approval process. Please note that if a HISP does employ a 5-point rating scale, OMB will work with them to understand whether and how different ratings (3, 4, 5 / 5) will be included in OMB 's overall trust calculations to be incorporated in the percentage of respondents that responded in the affirmative on trust in OMB data visualizations and reporting. Depending on the service and transaction context, other iterations of wording for this question could include sentences such as: Based on my experience calling the IRS, I trust IRS is working in the best interest of the American public. Having completed FA FSA, I trust FSA to deliver on its responsibility to students. If respondent provides \" thumbs up\" or 5-point rating: Q2a Required Wording: What about this interaction made the difference? (Tap/Select all that apply ) Driver (Not shown) Corresponding Statement (HISPs may choose one statement per category to be shown in a multiple -selection question format. ) Status 1 Effectiveness My need was addressed . My issue was resolved. I found what I needed. My question was answered. (Or similar. ) Required 2 Ease It was easy to complete what I needed to do. It was easy to find what I needed. (Or similar.) Required 3 Efficiency It took a reasonable amount of time to do what I needed to do. I found what I needed on the site quickly. (Or similar.) Required 4 Transparency I understand what was being asked of me throughout the process. I understand the reason for the [Agency/Program/service] 's decision. (Or similar.) Required if applicable 5 Humanity / Equity I was treated fairly. (Or similar.) Required if applicable 6 Employee Interaction Employees I interacted with were helpful. The call center r epresentative was committed to solving my problem. (Or similar.) Required if applicable 7 Other Something else. None of the above. (Or similar).) If applicable HISPs are encouraged to the extent possible to simplify statements to 1 -3-word clauses and use iconography as relevant. SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 280 If respondent provides \" thumbs down \" or 1-4-point rating: Q2b Required Wording: What could have been better ? (Tap/Select all that apply ) Driver (Not shown) Corresponding Statement (HISP s may choose one statement per category to be shown in a multiple selection question format. ) Status 1 Effectiveness My need was not addressed. My issue was not resolved. I did not find what I needed. My question was not answered. (Or similar.) Required 2 Ease It was difficult to complete what I needed to do. It was difficult to find what I needed. (Or similar.) Required 3 Efficiency It took too long to do what I needed to do. I did not find what I needed on the site quickly. (Or similar.) Required 4 Transparency I did not understand what was being asked of me throughout the process. I did not understand the reason for the [Agency/Program/Service] 's decision. (Or similar.) Required if applicable 5 Humanity I was not treated fairly. (Or similar.) Required if applicable 6 Employee Interaction Employees I interacted with were not helpful. The call center r epresentative was not committed to solving my problem. (Or s imilar.) Required if applicable 7 Other Something else. None of the above. (Or similar).) If applicable HISP s are encouraged to the extent possible to simplify statements to 1 -3-word clauses and use iconography as relevant. Q3 Required Wording: Anything else you want us to know about your experience? (Or similar.) [Free text response] May be excluded if format, such as an interactive voice response (IVR)-based survey, does not enable. Additional considerations: If applicable and appropriate , HISPs may include additional questions that enable the HISP to collect more useful data, such as a question regarding the purpose of a visit or call. The best practice is that the total survey length should be no more than 15 questions and five minutes of burden (in addition to accounting for the PRA considerations in section 280. 9). Any additional questions should be placed after the required questions outlined above. All questions on the survey must be optional for respondents, meaning that a respondent's decision to not answer one or more questions on the survey will not in any way affect the respondent 's receipt of benefits or services, subject them to any penalties, or otherwise negatively impact them . HISPs should administer surveys by applying prac tices that promote the validity, accuracy, and utility of the data and that facilitate ease of response. For example, to promote ease of response, HISPs can use methods such as presenting only a single -screen (even on a mobile device) version of the survey . To the extent possible, HISPs may use sampling techniques on high-volume transactions to split a long survey into several shorter surveys to reduce burden on the respondents while collecting sufficient data from a larger pool. HISPs must consult with OMB through the PRA approval process prior to implementation to ensure survey validity. HISPs should deploy post -transaction feedback survey(s) in the channels (e.g., mail, phone, online, email, texting, in -person, etc.) that are appropriate and relevant to the experience of the customers for that service (e.g., if a service includes visits to a government webpage, surveying online makes sense; if a service is paper -based , a paper survey with both mail-in and phone option is appropriate ). SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY Page 12 of Section 280 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) OMB will work with HISPs to determine whether they should use binary questions or whether they should use Likert -scale, given the relevant context of each particular HISP. In working with HISPs to assist them in making this determination, OMB will consider factors including data quality and validity, aggregating metrics, and granularity. How to Submit Feedback Data to OMB HISPs are required to report quarterly post -transaction feedback data on each of their current designated services (i.e., one post -transaction feedback survey for each current designated service, each quarter). HISPs may report data from multiple post-tran saction feedback survey s for each designated service, if relevant and appropriate. HISPs will be asked to identify the point -in-time of each post-transaction feedback data collection during reporting. HISPs must also submit raw data for Questions 1 and 2 so that OMB may conduct analysis on drivers tapped for individual trust responses. A data reporting template will be provided on the CX MAX Community page . The template includes instructions, a section for reporting on the customer experience measures outlined in this section, a placeholder for program -specific service-level indicators as appropriate, and space to summarize recent accomplishments. Submissions will be due the last business day of the month following the last day of the quarter: for FY 2024 , these due dates are January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31, 2024. HISPs (many of which are collecting data in real-time) should submit their data as soon as they are able following the last day of the quarter. Feedback data will be made available publicly on performance.gov in coordination with OIRA . Agency -specific post -transaction feedback data are currently published on performance.gov/cx and can be included in the Annual Agency Performance Plan (see section 280.10 ). A Federal -level trust measure and success target is published on https://www.performance.gov/pma/cx/data/.7 When OMB and HISP designate a new service, the HISP has a maximum of 365 calendar days from the date of designation to develop a post -transaction feedback data collection survey for the designated service and to begin quarterly data reporting. 280.15 What shall HISP CX Capacity Assessments and Action Plans include? The content of CX Capacity Assessments shall address the core CX functions at the HISP enterprise-level o utlined in section 280.7 as well as the results of designated service assessments. Further, HISP s maintaining department -level CX organizations will also be asked to complete an annual CX Capacity Assessment. T he content of the CX Action Plans shall address specific delivery improvements to designated services, as well as actions to improve the maturity of CX and service delivery capabilities and capacity. This includes updates to current year priorities, adjustments to the following year 's priorities, and p roposals to be considered in the formulation of the next President 's Budget (in this case, FY 2026). Actions should address pain points identified through service assessments, customer feedback, human -centered design research, and other evidence generation activities. CX Action Plans should focus on customer outcomes and should communicate what success will look like in terms of what any proposed improvements will mean for an individual customer using the service. Commitments will be made publicly available on performance.gov/cx. 7Agencies seeking to create an agency -specific CX reporting website (i.e., agency.gov/cx) highlighting their CX efforts should contact OMB so that reporting duplication and overlap can be minimized. SECTION 2 80\u2014MANAGING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 280 An annual HISP CX Capacity Assessment and Action Plan template will be made available on the CX MAX Community page . 280.16 How should agencies participate in designated Life Experiences ? OMB will manage the select ion of a limited number of customer life experiences to prioritize for Government -wide action to improve customer experience in line with the cadence of the President 's Management Agenda. These designated life experiences are those that require members of the public to navigate a service or services across the boundaries of multiple Federal programs, agencies, or levels of government. OMB will provide leadership, policy consultation, and reporting in accordance with E.O. 14058, a governance structure, and support to agencies through the President 's Management Council. The charters for these designated Life Experience portfolios will be made publicly available at http://www.performance.gov/cx . Additionally, individual Life Experience project milestones and deliverables will be made available at https://www.performance.gov/pma/cx/strategy/2/ . The full Life Experience program cycle includes a Discovery phase to understand people 's experiences and opportunities for improvement, a Design phase of building and testing solutions, a Delivery phase to scale the interventions and products that work, and continuous Measurement to ensure the designs are working to reach outcomes. Agencies and their staff will participate in a variety of ways across Life Experience portfolios and projects, including serving as subject matter experts to contribute to and review material s, serving on interagency delivery teams, providing programmatic leadership for a given project, providing data that enables more streamlined delivery, supporting procurement by leveraging best -in-class contracting vehicles, or other ways of supporting pro jects. Per E .O. 14058, t he Director of OMB shall work with the head of each relevant agency to help resolve issues related to overlapping responsibilities among agencies, to address barriers serving customers across multiple agencies, and to coordinate activities to improve customer experience and services delivery when the primary responsibility among multiple agencies is unclear. 8 8 Section 5(d), E .O. 14058 of December 16, 2021, on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery To Rebuild Trust in Government, available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/16/2021 EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Section 290 SECTION 2 90 - EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES Table of Contents 290.1 To which a gencies does this s ection a pply? 290.2 How do the requirements in this section apply to sub- agencies, bureaus, or divisions within CFO Act agencies? 290.3 What i s the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (i. e., the \" Evidence Act\"), and what is its relationship to the Federal Performance Framework ? 290.4 What new positions were created by the Evidence Act ? 290.5 What is the role of agency Evaluation Officers, and how does the agency designate and notify OMB of the designation? 290.6 Who supports the work of the agency Evaluation Officer ? 290.7 What is a Learning Agenda (i.e ., \"Evidence-Building Plan\")? 290.8 How, and how often, should an agency update its Learning Agenda? 290.9 How does the Learning Agenda relate to the agency Strategic Plan ? 290.10 How does the Learning Agenda relate to agency obligations under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review? 290.11 What is an Annual Evaluation Plan ? 290.12 How does the Annual Evaluation Plan relate to the annual A gency Performance Plan , annual Agency P erformance Report , and annual Strategic Review? 290.13 What is the Capacity Assessment for Statistics, Evaluation, Research, and Analysis that is required as part of the Evidence Act, and how should agencies update it ? 290.14 How do the Learning Agenda, Annual Evaluation Pla n, and Capacity Assessment relate to one another? 290.15 What are the requirements for engag ing interested parties on the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan? 290.16 How does OMB Guidance, including OMB Memorandum M -20-12 (Phase 4 Implementation of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018: Program Evaluation Standards and Practices) , and OMB Memorandum M -21-27 (Evidence -Based Policymaking: Learning Agendas and Annual Evaluation Plans) , affect Evidence Act a ctivities and plans ? 290.17 How do the functions of internal control processes performed by agency management and independent audits and evaluations conducted by an agency 's Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office, or other external auditor differ from program evaluation as defined in M -20 -12? 290.18 What is the agency Evaluation Policy and when must agencies submit it? 290.19 How and when should agencies update and publish their Learning Agenda, Annual Evaluation Plan , and Capacity Assessment ? 290.20 What is OMB 's role with respect to the plans in Title I of the Evidence Act ? 290.21 What is the relationship between these activities and the agency 's budget submission? 290.22 How should agencies monitor and report on their progress implementing activities included on the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan? Summary of Chang es Refines and updates prior guidance on how agencies make and publish off -cycle updates to Agency Learning Agendas . Refines and updates requirements for agency monitoring and reporting on their progress implementing activities in the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan. SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES Page 2 of Section 290 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 290.1 To which agencies does this section apply ? This section is a requirement for CFO Act agencies and is strongly encouraged for all others . 290.2 How do the requirements in this section apply to sub-agencies, bureau s, and divisions within CFO Act agencies? While the requirements in this section apply to CFO Act agencies, it is OMB 's expectation, as noted in OMB Memorandum M -19-23 and reiterated in OMB Memorandum M -21-27 , that the ev idence plans discussed here (i.e., Learning Agenda, Annual Evaluation Plan, and Capacity Assessment) reflect activities across the agency (i.e., the entire Cabinet-level Department). To that end, the activities of sub -agencies, bureaus, and divisions within a CFO Act agency should be reflected in these documents . Thus, OMB expects that these sub -agencies, bureaus, and divisions be actively engaged in the process to meet these requirements. Additionally, as noted in OMB Memorandum M - 19-23 and OMB Memorandum M -21-27 , OMB strongly encourages sub-agencies, operational divisions, or bureaus of CFO Act agencies, as well as non-CFO Act agencies, to develop and implement similar evidence plans that tie into and are consistent with, but are not limited by, the agency -wide plans , as appropriate. For sub -agencies, operational divisions, or bureaus of CFO Act agencies that are already undertaking these evidence activities, the Evidence Act requirements should be used to strengthen or uphold their current processes, as well as tie into and inform agency -wide efforts. 290.3 Wh at i s the Foundations for Evidenc e-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 ( i.e., the \" Evidence Act\"), and what is its relationship to the Federal Performance Framework ? The Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (or \" E vidence Act\" ) advances data and evidence-building functions in the Federal government by statutorily mandating F ederal evidence-building activities, open government data, and confidential information protection and statistica l efficiency. The Evidence Act addresses about half of the recommendations of the bipartisan Commission on Evidence- Based Policymaking and was enacted into law on January 14, 2019 as P ublic Law 115-435. Many of the Evidence Act 's provisions support the Federal Performance Framework, and the Act emphasizes the need for collaboration and coordination of agency staff and activities in order to achieve successful implementation. Two of the Act 's provisions ( the Learning Agenda and Capacity Assessment for Statistics, Evaluation, Research, and Analysis) modify what is required in agency strategic plans, and one provision (the Annual Evaluation Plan) adds a new requirement concurrent with the performance plan cycle. 290.4 What new positions were created by the Evidence Act? The Evidence Act created three new positions: Chief Data Officers (all agencies), Evaluation Officers (CFO Act agencies), and Statistical Officials (CFO Act agencies) . 290.5 What is the role of agency Evaluation Officers, and how does the agency designate and notify OMB of the designation? The Evaluation Officer is responsible for playing a leading role in overseeing the agency 's evaluation activities, Learning Agenda, Annual Evaluation Plan, Capacity Assessment, and information reported to OMB on evidence, as well as collaborating with, shaping, and making contributions to other evidence - building functions within the agency. The Evaluation Officer is responsible for providing technical and methodological leadershi p to assess, improve, and advise evaluation activities across the agency. For agencies that are less mature in their evaluation activities, or for those agencies without additional evaluation expertise distributed throughout the agency, or for those agenci es with a centralized enterprise-SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Section 290 wide evaluation function, the Evaluation Officer may also be responsible for conceptualizing, prioritizing, designing, and executing the agency 's evaluation activities in addition to coordinating the Annual Evaluation Plan . Each agency must have one Evaluation Officer to serve in this role for the agency as a whole (e.g., the entire Cabinet -level department). In addition, where appropriate, OMB strongly recommends that agencies consider building capacity in operational divisions, bureaus, or sub-agencies within the agency that also may have a need for an evaluation officer, with the agency -level official providing technical leadership and coordination across those officials . Per OMB Memorandum M -21-27, E valuation Officers \" must adhere to scientific integrity principles, demonstrate a learning and improvement orientation to the building and use of evidence, and have substantive expertise in evaluation methods and practices. \" As described in OMB Memorandum M - 19-23, the Evaluation Officer must be appointed without regard to political affiliation and possess \" demonstra ted, senior -level technical expertise in evaluation methods and practices ... [and] appropriate expertise in the culture, disciplines, and policy areas of the agency. \" More specifically, OMB has determined that the role should be filled by a senior career employee with the skills and expertise to maintain principles of scientific integrity throughout the evaluation process, ensure adherence to the agency evaluation pol icy, and maintain the evaluation standards in OMB Memorandum M - 20-12. Critically, the Evaluation Officer must also have sufficient time and resources to lead and execute this work, which requires limiting, to the extent practicable, the number of other roles that the Evaluation Officer is tasked to fill. S pecifically, the Evaluation Officer serves as: Agency champion for , and educates agency staff and leaders about , evaluation, including what program evaluation is, th e value of conducting evaluations, how to discern high-quality evaluation from other types of analyses, and the importance of evaluation as a strategic investment; Senior advisor to agency leaders on issues of evaluation policy and practice, such as designing and undertaking evaluations, interpreting results, and integrating evaluation findings into day -to-day agency operations, management processes, budgeting, strategic planning, and other decisions; Senior agency contact on evaluation for agency-wide and cross-cutting evaluation efforts, both with interested parties and other stakeholders and in coordination with senior officials responsible for other agency functions, including the official responsibl e for implementing privacy policy, the Chief Data Officer, the Chief Information Officer, the Statistical Official, the Performance Improvement Officer, additional evaluation and analysis units and personnel in the agency, and others as appropriate; Participant in the agency 's Chief Operating Officer -led efforts to review progress on Agency Priority Goals and other management priorities to ensure that evidence is included and used appropriately; Member of the agency Data Governance Body; and Member of th e interagency Evaluation Officer Council . The Evaluation Officer also oversees or conducts: Assessment s of the coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, objectivity, scientific integrity, and balance of the portfolio of evaluations, policy research, and ongoing evaluation activities of the agency, in consultation with other methodologists, such as the Stat istical Official, when appropriate; SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES Page 4 of Section 290 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Improvement of agency capacity to support the development and use of evaluation, coordinate and increase technical expertise available for evaluation and related research activities within the agency, and improve the quality of evaluations and knowledge of evaluation methodology and standards; Implementation of OMB Memorandum M -20-12 , P hase 4 Implementation of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018: Program Evaluation Standards and Practices ; E stablishment and implementation of an agency evaluation policy that affirms the agency 's commitment to conducting evaluations and using evidence from evaluations to inform policy and practice.

Agencies must provide any changes to their designated Evaluation Officer to OMB via email at Evidence@omb.eop.gov a nd update their agency 's https://[agency].gov/data webpage accordingly . 290.6 Who supports the work of the agency Evaluatio n Officer ? The work of the Evaluation Officer is supported by the Statistical Official and Chief Data Officer, as well as program staff; other evaluation, statistics, analysis, data, enterprise risk management, and performance units and personnel in the agency; policy staff; regulatory staff; privacy and information law and policy personnel; and agency leadership . Further, it is OMB 's expectations that staff throughout the agency, including sub-agencies, bureaus, and divisions, will meaningfully support the work of the Evaluation Officer as they fulfill the requirements laid out in this section. In addition, consistent with OMB M -20-12, agencies should have evaluation staff with appropriate expertise carrying out and overseeing program evaluations. SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Section 290 290.7 What is a Learning Agenda (i.e., \" Evidence-Building Plan\")? The Learning Agenda (i.e., the Evidence -Building Plan ) is a systematic plan for identifying and addressing policy questions relevant to the programs, policies, and regulations of the agency. It identifies, prioritizes, and establishes strategies to develop evidence to answer important short- and long-term strategic questions (i.e., questions about how the agency meets its missions, including about how programs, policies, and regulations function both individually and in combination) and operational questions (i.e., questions about the agency 's operations like human resources, grant -making, and internal processes). OMB expects that an agency 's Learning Agenda will include questions that address current Administration priorities, as well as long-standing challenges and future priorities that may emerge. The question being asked should drive the choice of method(s), and OMB expects that agencies use all types of evidence - program evaluation, performance measurement, policy analysis, or foundational factfinding - to answer questions o n their learning agenda s. Agencies are also reminded that Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge (ITEK) is a form of knowledge that can and should inform Federal Government decision making where appropriate , including in answering questions on the Learning Agenda and as part of activities on Annual Evaluation Plans . 1 Agencies should review OMB Memorandum M -21-27 f or more information about the variety of methodological approaches that agencies are encouraged to consider as they develop their activities to answer questions on the Learning Agenda. For the purposes of implementing the Evidence Act, a Learning Agenda does not refer to the professional development plans for employees' human capital development. T he process of developing the Learning Agenda (i.e., engaging stakeholders, reviewing available evidence, developing questions, planning and undertaking evidence activities, disseminating and using results, and refining questions based on the evidence generated) may be equally if not more beneficial than the resulting document itself. This process is one of collective learning and continuous improvement, hence the \"learning \" frame work in the document 's name. The Learning Agenda should be a flexible, iterative document that is revisited at least annually, and there is no single approach or format that will be effective for every agency . For agencies with more mature evidence-building efforts, and which may already have comprehensi ve research plans, research roadmaps, enterprise learning agendas, or evaluation strategic plans, the L earning Agenda may highlight and prioritize existing efforts. However, a Learning Agenda should not simply restate existing portfolios of work. For agenc ies with emerging evidence-building functions, the Learning Agenda may emphasize and help coordinate efforts to design and implement new evidence building activities. A Learning Agenda is a strategic evidence-building plan. By thinking strategically abou t evidence needs, agencies can limit ad hoc and uncoordinated analytic efforts and the associated inefficient use of scarce resources, instead prioritizing those questions that, when answered, can inform consequential decisions and high-priority functions. Once the Learning Agenda is developed, agencies should execute the identified evidence-building activities that, in turn, will inform and shape subsequent priority questions, and build the evidence needed to inform programs, policies, regulations, and operations . These documents are intended to be actionable guides , and OMB expects agencies to undertake the evidence- building activities included in them to the extent possible, recognizing that circumstances change, app ropriations may be unknown, and some activities are best suited to external partnership s. The Learning Agenda complement s, but is distinct from research and development planning for the purposes of building the portfolio of fundamental knowledge and can also complement an agency 's submission to the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions regulatory planning process and published agenda by clearly documenting how an agency intends to build and use evidence to support its proposed regula tory actions . 1 For additional information on Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge, please see \" Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Federal Decision Making\" available at 111521-OSTP-CEQ-ITEK -Memo.pdf (whitehouse.gov) . SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES Page 6 of Section 290 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 290.8 How , and how often, should an agency update its Learning Agenda? As noted in OMB Memorandum M -19-23 and reiterated in OMB Memorandum M -21-27 , ag encies must review and assess their Learning Agenda s at least annually , and OMB will use the Evidence Submission referen ced in Section 51.9 to ensure that agencies have met this requirement , including timelines for any planned updates . As agencies review their Learning Agendas, OMB expects that they update them as needed to reflect progr ess toward answering the agency 's priority questions , shifting agency priorities, changing contexts within which the agency op erates, input from interested parties, and emergent needs. These updates to the Learning Agenda could include revisions to priority questions, the addition of new questions , and summaries of new or available evidence generated that led the agency to revise its priority questions or develop new ones (as needed). The Learning Agenda should be updated to reflect the status of evidence-building activities described in the Learning Agenda or Annual Evaluation Plans (if applicable) with links to or summaries of evidence generated, if appropriate and available (see section 290.19). Finally, agencies may use these updates as an opportunity to discuss how they have continued to engage inter ested parties and affected communities, sometimes known as stakeholders, including, for example how their input informed the development of new or revisions to existing priority questions. OMB requires t hat agencies revisit their Learning Agendas annually and anticipates that this process will likely lead to update s to the Learning Agenda s at some point(s) over the four -year Strategic Planning Cycle (see section 290.22 ). However, when an agency determines that updates are needed, they are not requi red to rewrite or draft a n entirely new Learning Agenda annually. Similarly, while part of agency strategic plans, OMB recognizes that the Learning Agenda can be updated independently from strategic plans. OMB does not expect that updates to the Learning Agenda will also require updates to the full Strategic Plan document (see section 230.1 9 for information on how to update the Strategic Plan). Finally , agencies have flexibility as to how they publish updates (if needed) to their Learning Agenda s, including, for example, through an updated document or as a separate document that reflects updates. I f any agency determines that it is desirable to publish updates to its Learning Agenda, the agency shall submit these updates to OMB for review and clearance no less than 45 days b efore publishing. The updates to the Learning Agenda shall be submitted to OMB via the Submission Portal, and agencies must also alert OMB via email at Evidence@omb.eop.gov . Th e final updates to the Learning Agenda should be p osted on the agency 's website. In addition, agencies should provide the link to the updates to OMB via email at Evidence@omb.eop.gov a nd via an online form shared with Agency Evaluation Officers by OMB for inclusion on the evaluation.gov website. 290.9 How does the Learning Agenda relate to the agency Strategic Plan ? The Evidence Act requires that the Learning Agenda is part of the agency 's strategic plan, cover s the same four-year period , and addresses priority questions across the entire agency (i.e., the entire Cabinet -level Department). The Learning Agenda and strategic planning processes shoul d leverage and inform each other. This linkage ensures that Learning Agenda questions are aligned with strategic goals and objectives, thereby making the resulting evidence relevant and timely for agency needs. Developing the documents together allows evid ence to inform strategy from the outset. Further, the Evidence Act modified the requirements for agency strategic plans and requires that strategic plans include a \"description of the program evaluations used in establishing or revising general goals and objectives, with a schedule for future program evaluations to be conducted, and citations to relevant provisions of the plans [Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan ] required under Section 312. \" While agency strategic plans were previously required to describe how program evaluation supported development of goals, the Evidence Act provides another link between the se evidence-building plans (i.e., SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Section 290 the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation P lan) and the agency strategic plan and requires an agency 's strategic planning narrative s to reference activities in the evidence-building plans. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 306 (a)(8). As reaffirmed in OMB Memorandum M -21-27 , the Learning Agenda must be a standalone component of the agency strategic plan. Agencies may include it as an appendix, separate chapter of, or document referenced in and posted along with, the strategic plan . If an agency chooses to include the Learning Agenda as an appendix or separate referenced document , they must summarize the Learning Agenda somewhere in the body of the strategic plan (see 210). Elements of the Learning Agenda must also be woven throughout the strategic planning narrative, for example by referencing priority questions and their associated evidence - building activities in the context of describing the relevant strategic priority or by describing how the Learning Agenda will build evidence i n key areas of the strategic plan where evidence is lacking . 290.10 H ow does the Learning Agenda relate to agency obligations under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review? The Learning Agenda fully complements Executive Order 12866 (E.O.) and will support agencies in fulfilling their obligations under the E.O. The Evidence Act requires that agencies ' learning agendas include \"policy questions relevant to...regulations of the agency. \" Under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review , agencies are directed to adhere to a set of principles for regulatory policymaking. Agencies should read the principles articulated in E.O. 12866 as fully consistent with the requirement to include priority policy questions about regulat ions in their Learning Agenda. Further, the principles laid out in E.O. 12866 provide a framework for agencies to use as they think about how to address and include priority reg ulatory questions on their Le arning Agenda. For example, one principle states that agencies should base decisions on the best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and other information concerning the need for, and consequences of, the intended regulation (Section 1(b)(7)). To that end, agencies should use the L earning Agenda as an important tool to help them build evidence to gather that best reasonably obtainable information. Additionally, fully assessing both the costs and the benefits of the intended regulation as obligated by the E.O. (Section 6, (a)(3)), requires objective evidence and data. To support future cost -benefit analyses, agencies should include questions o n their L earning Agenda related to the measurement and comparison of a ctual costs with anticipated costs prior to implementation of a regulation. 290.1 1 What is an Annual Evaluation Plan ? The Evidence Act requires agencies to develop an Annual Evaluation Plan, which describes the significant evaluation activities the agency plans to conduct in the fiscal year following the year in which it is submitted. It should include \"significant \" evaluations that would help answer priority questions on the Learning Agenda and any other \" significant \" evaluation s, such as those required by statute. The significance of an evaluation study should be defined by each agency and take into consideration factors such as the importance of a program or funding stream to the agency mission; the size of the program in terms of funding or people serve d; and the extent to which the study will fill an important knowledge gap regarding the program, population(s) served, or the issue(s) that the program was designed to address. Agencies must clearly state their criteria for designating evaluations as \" significant \" in their Annual Evaluation Plan . The Annual Evaluation Plan should include only those activities that meet the statutory definition of evaluation and each agency 's definition of \"significant. \" Please refer to s ection 200.22 and OMB M emorandum M-20- 12 for the statutory definition of evaluation. The Annual Evaluation Plan need not be limited to those evaluations that address Learning Agenda questions and may also include other significant evaluations. Furthermore, OMB expects that agencies may also undertake evaluations that are not included in the Annual Evaluation Plan, depending on how \"significant\" is defined. Evaluation activities included in the Annual Evalua tion Plan should be those the SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES Page 8 of Section 290 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) agency expects will begin, or be carried out partially or fully , in the associated fiscal year. Evaluation studies often span multiple years, so agencies can determine how best to capture ongoing activities as they develop the Annual Evaluation Plan each year. OMB expects agencies to consider and describe progress and results from evaluation activities on prior years' Annual Evaluation Plans in the forthcoming fiscal year's Annual Evaluation Plan, as appropriate. For instance, to the extent that an evaluation is included across multiple Annual Evaluation Plans, the description and discussion of the evaluation should reflect progress and learning to date, including, for example, summaries of interim findings, publication of int erim deliverables (as available), achievement of key milestones, or deviations from the original plan based on recent progress . When updating evaluations included on prior Annual Evaluation Plans, agencies have flexibility regarding the level of detail inc luded, and are encouraged to link to publicly -available information or more detailed information on the agency 's public website. The focus is on updates that inform or support the execution of the evaluation and retain the nature of the Annual Evaluation P lan as a forward-looking planning document. As discussed further in sections 290.12 and 290.22 , OMB expects that findings from activities on prior Annual Evaluation Plans will be incorporated into other plans and processes. 290.12 How does the Annual Evaluation Plan relate to the annual A gency Performance Plan , annual Agency Performance Report, and annual Strategic Reviews? The Evidence Act requires agencies to develop an Annual Evaluation Plan to be submitted in conjunction with the a nnual Agency Performance Plan. While there is no formal requirement that these plans and activities reference one another, OMB expects that the performance and evaluation activities undertaken by an agency should necessarily complement and inform each other, when appropriate. For example, s ection 210.19 includes instructions to agencies to describe ho w evidence, including from program evaluations and other methods, was used to develop the annual Agency Performance Plan. Further, sections 240.12 and 240.14 describe the types of evidence that are appropriate to manage organizational performance and include in the a nnual Agency Performance Report , noting that program evaluation is a critical and important tool to help the agency assess its performance. T he annual Agency Performance Report (section 240.27) should include external assessments and notes that, \"Agencies are expected to consider the available evidence, including any available evaluation results... and should determine when and how to complement performance measurement with evaluations .\" Section 260 highlights the importance of evaluations to understand outcomes and effectiveness as part of the Strategic Review process, but also notes how the review can inform opportunities where additional evaluations or other evidence are needed and could be included on an Annual Evaluation Plan, for instance. Collectively, the a nnual Agency Performance Plan, a nnual Agency Performance Report, and annual Strategic Review offer agencies the opportunity to incorporate findings from evaluation activities, including those described in prior Annual Evaluation Plans, as well as identify evaluations for future Annual Evaluation Plans, as appropriate. 290.13 What is the Capacity Assessment for Statistics, Evaluation, Research , and Analysis that is required as part of the Evidence Act, and how should agencies update it ? The Evidence Act requires agencies to submit a Capacity Assessment for Statistics , Evaluation, Research , and Analysis (herein after referred to as \" Capacity Assessment\") every four years as part of their Strategic Plans. Led by the Evaluation Officer, in conjunction with the Statistical Official, Chief Data Officer, and other agency personnel, t his requires agencies to conduct and provide an assessment of the coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence of the statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis efforts of the agency. Thus, agencies shall assess their statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis activities against the following criteria: SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Section 290 Coverage : what is happening and where is it happening? Quality : are the data used of high quality with respect to utility, objectivity, and integrity? Methods : what are the methods being used for these activities , do these methods incorporate the necessary level of rigor, and are those methods appropriate for the activities to which they are being applied ? Effectiveness : are the activities meeting their intended outcomes, including serving the needs of stakeholders and being disseminated? Independence : to what extent are the activities being carried out free from bias and inappropriate influence? For each of the areas of assessment - statistics , evaluation, research and analysis - OMB encourages agencies to consider the above criteria and think about how those criteria apply for each of these activities within the agency. In considering the criterion above, agencies must also address the following as part of the Capacity Assessment for Statistics, Evaluation, Research, and Analysis: A list of the activities (e.g., programs, initiatives, etc.) and operations (e.g., administrative and support tasks) of the agency that are currently being evaluated and analyzed; The extent to which the evaluations, research, and analysis efforts and related activities of the agency support the needs of various divisions within the agency; The extent to which the evaluation, research, and analysis efforts and related activities o f the agency address an appropriate balance between needs related to organizational learning, ongoing program management, performance management, strategic management, interagency and private sector coordination, internal and external oversight, and accountability; The extent to which the agency uses methods and combinations of methods that are appropriate to agency divisions and the corresponding research questions being addressed, including an appropriate combination of formative and summative evaluation research and analysis approaches; The extent to which evaluation and research capacity is present within the agency to include personnel and agency processes for planning and implementing evaluation activities, disseminating best practices and findings, and incorporating employee views and feedback; and The extent to which the agency has the capacity to assist agency staff and program offices to develop the capacity to use evaluation research and analysis approaches and data in the day -to-day operations. These specific requirements tie directly to the statutory criteria and address elements such as coverage (i.e., the list of activities and operations of the agency that are currently being evaluated or analyzed ) and effectiveness (i.e., the extent to which these activities meet the needs of the agency and appropriately balance across those needs). In addition, these requirements touch on important areas like dissemination of findings from statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis activities (i.e., does the agency have processes and procedures in place to make sure findings are disseminated?), as well as the agency 's capacity to use these findings (i.e., does the agency have processes, procedures, and trained staff in place to use the findings SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES Page 10 of Section 290 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) to support agency learning , improvement , and decision -making?). As agencies assess their capacity in the areas of coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence, it is important to consider not only whether and how the agency is doing those activities, but also whether they have staffing, infrastructure, and processes to do so. In that sense, this Capacity Assessment should be holistic, considering the agency 's current capacity, but also what future capacity might be needed. The Capacity Assessment is expected to provide agencies with a baseline against which they can measure improvements to coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence of their statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis activities. The Capacity Assessment will pr ovide senior officials with information needed to improve the agency 's ability to support the development and use of evaluation, coordinate and increase technical expertise available for evaluation and related research activities within the agency, and improve the quality of evaluations and knowledge of evaluation methodology and standards. In conducting the assessment , agencies should draw on existing OMB guidance and policies, including, but not limited to: O MB Memorandum M -21-27, Evidence-Based Policymaking: Learning Agendas and Annual Evaluation Plans ; OM B Memorandum M-19 -23, Phase I Implementation of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018: Learning Agendas, Personnel, and Planning Guidance ; OM B Memorandum M-20-12, Phase 4 Implementation of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018: Program Evaluation Standards and Practices ; OMB Memorandum M-19-15, Improving Implementation of the Information Quality Act ; OM B Memorandum M-18 -04, Monitoring and Evaluation Guidelines for Federal Departments and Agencies that Administer United States Foreign Assistance ; G uidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal Agencies; and OMB Statistical Policy Directives . In developing the Capacity Assessment, OMB encourages agencies to use a format, process, and structure that best meets their specific context. There is no template or specific format for this document, but OMB expects that each agency 's assessment will include discussion and analysis of the five criteria (i.e., coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence) for their statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis activities, including those specific components listed above. The Capacity Assessment must be a standalone component of the agency strategic plan. Agencies may include it as a separate section, chapter, appendix of, or document referenced in and posted along with, the strategic plan . If an agency chooses to include the Capacity Assessment as an appendix or separate referenced document , they must summarize the Capacity Assessment somewhere in the body of the strategic plan. While there is no formal requirement that agencies update their Capacity Assessments outside of the strategic planning cycle, OMB encourages them to do so , as appropriate, given their context and needs. The Capacity Assessmen t provides a critical baseline against which agencies can measure improvements to their statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis activities. A gencies should use and apply the information generated to make th e improvements needed to enhance their capacity in these areas. Agencies should use updates to the Capacity Assessment to both describe how they are building capacity to address gaps SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 11 of Section 290 identified in the original document and to identify new or emerging gaps i n capacity. OMB is also interested in understanding how and to what extent agencies use the results of evidence-building activities, including those on the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plans, to inform programs, policies, and operations, and agenc ies may consider addressing this as part of any updates to the Capacity Assessment. Agencies may also use updates to reflect changes in capacity, including, for example, in whether and to what extent the evidence-building activities of the agency meet its needs. While the Capacity Assessment published in FY 2022 gives agencies a baseline, revisiting that baseline and systematically re-assessing capacity against it allows agencies to fully realize the benefits of this Evidence Act requirement. If an agency chooses to publish updates to its Capacity Assessment, it must submit its draft updates for OMB review and clearance no less than 45 days prior to posting. An agency should do so via the MAX.gov submission portal a nd an email notification to OMB at Evidence@omb.eop.gov to indicate that the draft updates have been submitted. Agencies should post their final updates to the Capacity Assessment on their respective agency websites and provide the link to OMB via an email to Evidence@omb.eop.gov an d an online form (link to be provided to Ag ency Evaluation Officers by OMB) for inclusion on the evaluation.gov website. 290.1 4 How do the Learning Agenda, Annual Evaluation Plan, and Capacity Assessment relate to one another? While the Learning Agenda, Annual Evaluation Plan, and Capacity Assessment for Statistics, Evaluation, Research, and Analysis are independent documents, the nature of their contents necessitates that they have complementary relationships with one another. Learning Agendas and Annual Evaluation Plans. The Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan are distinct, but complementary , documents. While OMB expects that there will necessarily be some overlap between these two documents, perfect overlap is neither expected nor required . The Annual Evaluation Plan should inc lude only those evaluation activities that meet the statutory definition of evaluation (see OMB Memorandum M -19-23 and OMB Memorandum M -20-12 f or further explanation) and each agency 's definition of \" significant.\" The Annual Evaluation Plan need not be limited to those evaluations that address Learning Agenda questions, and it can and should address other significant evaluations. Moreover, OMB expects that agencies will also undertake evaluations that are not i n the Annual Evaluation Plan. Conversely, OMB expects that the activities an agency includes on its Learning Agenda to a nswer priority questions will include both evaluation and non-evaluation activities, such as performance measurement, foundational fact finding, and policy analysis. As noted in OMB Memorandum M - 19-23 and reaffirmed in OMB Memorandum M -21-27, the questions to be answered must drive the methods to be used (a nd not vice versa), and OMB expects that some questions on the Learning Agenda are most appropriately answered by methods other than program evaluation. Thus, the Learning Agenda should include activities beyond those significant evaluations on the Annual Evaluation Plan. T here is also a timin g consideration with these documents. While the Annual Evaluation Plan focuses on the activities that an agency plans to undertake in the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the plan is submitted , the Learning Agenda is a longer -term document that covers the full period of the strategic plan (i.e., not less than four years). Depending on how and how often an agency update s its Learning Agenda, \"significant \" evaluations listed on Annual Evaluation Plans published in the middle of the time period covered by the Learning Agenda (e.g., FY 2024 and FY 2025), may not be reflected in the published Learning Agenda . However, OMB expects that agencies will use finding s from activities in their Annual Evaluation Plan s to inform the Learning Agenda , and vice versa. OMB Memorandum M -21-27 i ncludes a graphic that clearly describes the relationship between these documents. SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES Page 12 of Section 290 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Learning Agenda and Capacity Assessment . While the Learning Agenda and Capacity Assessment are both components of the agency strategic plan, they are distinct documents with different purposes and content. However, the nature of each necessitates that they complement one another. For instance, the Learning Agenda will highlight the activities an agency plans to undertake to answer its priority questions. The Capacity Assessment, through its analysis of the coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence of statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis activities, necessarily provides information about the extent to which the agency has the capacity to undertake the activities outlined in the Learning Agenda , as well as other evidence-building activities. OMB expects, for instance, that the activities discussed in the Learning Agenda might likewise appear in the Capacity Assessment as part of the discussion of current capacity or capacity needed in the future. Annual Evaluation Plan and Capacity Assessment. The Annual Evaluation Plan and Capacity Assessment are distinct documents that serve different purposes. However, as with the Learning Agenda and Capacity Assessment discussed above, the nature of each of these two documents necessitates that they complement one another. For instance, the Annual Evaluation Plan includes the \" significant \" evaluations that an agency plans to undertake in the following fiscal year. This information may also be covered as part of the list of \"activities and operations of the agency that are currently being evaluated and analyzed \" required in the Capacity Assessment. Similarly, the Annual Evaluation Plan requires agencies to discuss their plans to disseminate and use the findings from the significant evaluations included in the plan. OMB expects that this information may serve as one input to the agency' s assessment of its capacity to disseminate and use information resulting from its statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis activities as required in the Capacity Assessment. Thus, as is true of the relationship between other documents described here, OMB expects there will be some overlap in portions of the documents. 290.15 What are the requirements for engaging interested parties on the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan? Per OMB Memorandum M -21-27 , OM B expects agencies to engage a diverse array of interested parties as they develop the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan. Agencies should engage these parties from the outset so that they can help shape the priority questions being asked or the study design, as appropriate, rather than waiting until the data needed to support the activity is being analyzed. OMB expects that agencies engage with internal staff who oversee the designs, processes, operations, or programs being discussed in the plan; other evaluation, statistics, analysis, data, enterprise risk management, and performance units and personnel in the agency; policy staff; regulatory staff; privacy and information law and policy personnel; and agency leadership. The Evidence Act requires engagement with the public, State and local governments, and representatives of non- governmental researchers for the Learning Agenda. Other key partners include OMB itself, recipients of Federal awards, Congress, industry and trade groups, the academic and non-profit communities, Tribal governments, and the communities and individuals that the agency ultimately serves. A gencies should systematically and thoughtfully consider (e.g., through mapping exercises) how to identify and engage with specific parties in ways that provide value for both the agency and those engaged. A gencies should engage interested parties and the public in a manner, and using methodology, that is transparent , accessible, generates trust, and p rovides opportunities for meaningful input . To the extent possible, agencies should rely on existing activities and requirements, in accordance with applicable law and policy As noted in OMB Memorandum M -19-23 and OMB Memorandum M-21-27 , potential approaches to engagement include Requests for Information published in the Federal Register, sustained community engagement, participatory research methods, listening sessions or focus groups, technical working groups, one -on-one consultations, and thorough consideration of the lived experiences of those affected by agency policies. OMB acknowledges that employing these methods effectively may require review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act . OMB encourages agencies to use available SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 13 of Section 290 flexibilities, as appropriate, for these purposes, including those outlined in OMB 's Memorandum fro m the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs entitled \" Flexibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act for Compliance with Information Collection Requirements ,\" (July 22, 2016). Ag encies are reminded that meaningful engagement with the public and interested parties is not limited to development of the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plans. E ngaging with diverse, interested parties is beneficial as agencies move from planning to action and implement the activities outlined in these evidence plans. Robust engagement throughout the lifecycle of evidence generation and use promotes continued transparency, helps to ensure that the evidence generated is relevant for interested and affected parties, and may support broad use of findings . Approaches for engaging with interested parties should be described in the Annual Evaluation Plan and updates to the Learning Agenda , if appropriate . 290.16 How does OMB Guidance, including OMB Memorandum M-20 -12 ( Phase 4 Implementation of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018: Program Evaluation Standards and Practices ), and OMB Memorandum M-21-27 ( Evidence-Based Policymaking: Learning Agendas and Annual Evaluation Plans ), affect Evidence Act activities and plans? Agencies shall adhere to OMB guidance on standards and practices as they implement evidence-building activities, including program evaluation. OMB Memorandum M -20-12, \"P hase 4 Implementation of the Foundations for Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018: Program Evaluation Standards and Practices, \" provides program evaluation standards and practices to guide agencies in developing and implementing evaluation activities, evaluation policies, and in hiring and retaining qualified staff. These standards inform both specific evaluations and the broader set of evaluation activities , including those in the Annual Evaluation Plan and other evaluations undertaken to address Learning Agenda priorities . T he standards are: Relevance and Utility : Federal evaluations must address questions of importance and serve the information needs of stakeholders in order to be useful resources. Rigor : Federal evaluations must produce findings that Federal agencies and their stakeholders can confidently rely on, while providing clear explanations of limitations. Independence and Objectivity: Federal evaluations must be viewed as objective in order fo r stakeholders, experts, and the public to accept their findings. Evaluators should operate with an appropriate level of independence from programmatic, regulatory, policymaking and stakeholder activities. Transparency: Federal evaluations must be transp arent in the planning, implementation, and reporting phases to enable accountability and help ensure that aspects of an evaluation are not tailored to generate specific findings. Ethics: Federal evaluations must be conducted to the highest ethical standards to protect the public and maintain public trust in the government 's efforts. The practices are: 1. Build and Maintain Evaluation Capacity 2. Use Expert Consultation Effectively 3. Establish, Implement, and Widely Disseminate an Agency Evaluation Policy 4. Pre-S pecify Evaluation Design and Methods SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES Page 14 of Section 290 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 5. Engage Key Stakeholders Meaningfully 6. Plan Dissemination Strategically 7. Take Steps to Ensure Ethical Treatment of Participants 8. Foster and Steward Data Management for Evaluation 9. Make Evaluation Data Available for Secondary Use 10. Establish and Uphold Policies and Procedures to Protect Independence and Objectivity The Program Evaluation Standards and Practices are designed to improve the quality and use of e valuation across Federal agencies, while recognizing that agencies must build policies, evaluation offices, and infrastructure that meet their distinct evaluation needs and responsibilities. As such, these standards and practices apply not just to Federal evaluation offices, but also have applicability to other Federal units that carry out or sponsor evaluation and to individual evaluators, including Federal evaluation staff, outside partners, and recipients of Federal awards that are performing work on be half of the agency. OMB Memorandum M -20-12 Appendix B and C includes a more detailed explanation of the standards and practices. O MB Memorandum M -21-27 reaffirmed the program evaluation standards and practices from OMB Memorandum M -20-12 and emphasized the importance of transparency and rigor across all types of evidence building. Importantly, OMB Memorandum M -21-27 requires agencies to consider equity throughout the li fecycle of evidence generation and use, regardless of methodological approach. The inclusion of equity as a through-line in these efforts will ensure that evidence-building activities yield high - quality insights and do not inadvertently perpetuate underlyi ng biases. OMB expects agencies to include equity as a key consideration as they undertake the Evidence Act activities and processes outlined in this Section. 290.17 How do the functions of internal control processes performed by agency management and independent audits and evaluations conducted by an agency 's Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office, or other external auditor differ from program evaluation as defined in M-20-12? There are other important functions at agencies, such as internal control evaluations, that may be different in purpose and function from program evaluation. For example, internal controls follow frameworks established by OMB Circular A-123 and GAO 's Green Book. However, in situations where agencies determine a need for program evaluation, which involves a different intellectual discipline and skillset than existing internal control processes, program evaluation should adhere to the principles established i n OMB Memorandum M -20-12. The Evaluation Officer cannot be a member of the Inspector General 's st aff or located in the Inspector General 's (IG) office, as established by OMB Memorandum M - 19-23. While agency management staff responsible for implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of internal control systems play an important role in agency oversight and accountability, the Evaluation Officer required by the Evidence Act has a different function, and program evaluation servers a different purpose. When making decisions, agencies should use all available information at their disposal, including internal control reports, IG audits or IG evaluations, annual performance plans, strategic reviews, or program evaluations . 290.18 W hat is the agency Evaluation Policy and when must agencies submit it? An agency 's Evaluation Policy documents the standards and practices that govern all of an agency 's program evaluation activities. An agency 's Evaluation Policy, as required by the Evidence Act, must reflect and include the standards outlined in OMB Memorandum M -20-12 a nd should identify concrete ways that the agency plans to implement and safeguard these standards. Importantly, agencies must ensure that these evaluation policies apply not only to Federal evaluation offi ces but also to other Federal units that carry out SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 15 of Section 290 or support evaluations and to individual evaluators, including Federal evaluation staff, outside partners, and recipients of Federal awards that are performing work on behalf of the agency. At this time, agencies are expected to have publish ed their Evaluation Policies. If an agency updates or changes its Evaluation Policy, it must notify OMB via email to Evidence@omb.eop.gov w ith a link to the updated E valuation Policy , as well as complete the online form provided to Agency Evaluation Officers by OMB . Links to these policies will also be posted on the evaluation.gov website. 290.1 9 How and when should agencies update and publish their Learning Agenda s, Annual Evaluation Plans, and Capacity Assessment s? Update s to the Learning Agenda : As noted in Section 290. 8, when deemed desirable to publish an update , agencies must submit draft updates to the ir Learning Agenda s to OMB via the MAX.gov submission portal and alert OMB via email at Evidence@omb.eop.gov t hat the draft updates have been submitted for review and clearance. Agencies must submit these updates no less than 45 days before anticipated publication . Agencies should post their final updates to the ir Learning Agenda s on their respective agency websites and provide the link to OMB via an ema il to Evidence@omb.eop.gov a nd an online form (link to be provided to Agency Evaluation Officers by OMB) for inclusion on the evaluation.gov website. A nnual Evaluation Plan: The FY 2025 Annual Evaluation Plan will cover \" significant \" evaluations planned for FY 2025. At a minimum, th is plan shall describe \"significant \" evaluation activities for fiscal year FY 2025 , including key questions for each planned \" significant \" evaluation study and key information collections or acquisitions the agency plans to begin. The draft FY 2025 Annual Evaluation Plan is due in September 11, 2023, with the final draft Plan due on January 12, 2024 , and publication in February 2024. Agencies must submit these plans to OMB via the MAX.gov submission portal, should post their final FY 2025 Annual Evaluation Plan s on their respective agency websites, and should provide the link to OMB via an email at Evidence@omb.eop.gov a nd an online form (link to be provided to Agency Evaluation Officers by OMB) for inclusion on the evaluation.gov website. U pdate s to the Capacity Assessment f or Statistics, Evaluation, Research, and Analysis : Agencies are encouraged to make update s to their Capacity Assessment s, when appropriate. If an agency plans to publish updates to its Capacity Assessment, the agency shall submit its draft updates for OMB review and clearance no less than 45 days prior to post ing. A gencies shall submit draft updates to the Capacity Assessment via the MAX.gov submission portal and alert OMB via email at Evidence@omb.eop.gov to indicate that the draft updates have been submitted. Agencies should post their final updates to the ir Capacity Assessments on their respective agency websites and provide the link to O MB via an email to Evidence@omb.eop.gov and an online form (link to be provided to Agency Evaluation Officers by OMB) for inclusion on the evaluation.gov website. T he table below provides an updated timeline for developing and publishing these requirements. Agencies must submit all non-final documents for the ir Annual Evaluation Plans and updates to their Learning Agenda s and Capacity Assessment s, if appropriate , to OMB in Microsoft Word. Final documents should be published in a machine -readable format. Timelines for future years will be provided in subsequent OMB guidance.

OMB will support agencies w ith the Evidence Act (Title I) deliverables (i.e., the Learning Agenda ; Annual Evaluation Plan ; and Capacity Assessment for Statistics, Evaluation, Research, and Analysis; and Evaluation Policy ) described in s ection 290. OMB will : Work with agencies as they develop these documents, providing technical assistance, clarifying direction , and offering other support as needed; Review the agency 's draft documents, and provide feedback to the agency on those documents as needed , such as whether they adhere to OMB guidance and statute , suggestions for improving the agency 's ability to build and use evide nce, or the extent to which they reflect the evidence and learning needs of the agency; Review the agency 's plans , including updates to the Learning Agenda and Capacity Assessment , prior to publication to confirm that prior OMB feedback has been considered, and that the final documents and planned activities align with Administration policy and priorities ; and Monitor agencies ' progress in generating and using evidence from the activities included i n their Annual Evaluation Plans and Learning Agendas, as well as progress in addressing gaps identified in their Capacity Assessment s. SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 17 of Section 290 290.21 What is the relationship between these activities and the agency 's budget submission? Budget submissions should be grounded in all available evidence. As agencies move from evidence planning to executing on those activities , OMB expects that they use findings generated from evaluations and other evidence-building activities included on the Annual Evaluation Plans and Learning Agenda s to support budget requests, and OMB will look for supporting empirical evidence as it assesses agencies ' proposals. In addition, agencies shall commit to building evidence in priority areas where it is lacking and to building capacity to undertake evidence -building, including by addressing gaps noted in the agency Capacity Assessment. 290.22 How should agencies monitor and report on their progress implementing activities included on the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan? OMB expects agencies to continue their efforts to move these evidence p lans to wards execution - undertaking and accelerating the evidence -building activities included in them, and using the evidence generated to inform decision -making. To that end, agencies should be prepared to demonstrate progress in two areas: (1) status of evidence-b uilding activities included on the plans ; and (2) findings from completed studies, evaluations, or other evidence-building activities, when available and appropriate. Agencies have flexibility in how they demonstrate the above progress to OMB and are encouraged to use existing reports, plans, and processes as appropriate to their context and needs. For example, an agency may include findings from completed activities as part of its Annual Performance Report or Annual Performance Plan (section 290.12), its budget justifications ( section 290.21), its annual Strategic Review (section 290.12), or other reports and plans . A dditionally , agencies will be required to participate in a S pring 2024 briefing with OMB to provide updates on the status of evidence -buildin g activities included on the Learning Agenda s and Annual Evaluation Plans. This discussion will focus on progress made, challenges encountered, changes to activities on the plan s, and other topics as determined by the agency in consultation with OMB. When there are interim or final results available, the agency should be prepared to share those as part of this discussion. This briefing is not intended to duplicate other reporting mechanisms, new plans, or updates to existing plans. Rather, the purpose of the briefing is to provide a focused opportunity for OMB and agencies to discuss progress and findings from evidence activities and the use of those findings. Following the Spring 2024 briefings, OMB will revisit the use of briefings to provide these updates and will adjust the process as needed. Finally, agencies are reminded that OMB expects future iterations of the Learning Agenda to build on and refer to evidence generated in response to the prior multi -year Learning Agenda, just as Annual Evaluation Plans should build on progress made and reflect the evidence produced i n prior plans, as appropriate . The figure below, which is included in OMB Memorandum M -21-27 , i llustrates the four-year strategic planning and evidence planning cycles and shows how the evidence produced from undertaking activities on the Learning Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan, as well as other relevant evidence-building activities not included on these pl ans, is used to update the Learning Agenda and draft the next fiscal year 's Annual Evaluation Plan. SECTION 290 \u2014EVALUATION AND EVIDENCE -BUILDING ACTIVITIES Page 18 of Section 290 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) CIRCULAR NO. A-11 PART 7 APPENDICES AND CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET AUGUST 2023 APPENDIX A\u2014SCOREKEEPING GUIDELINES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 1 of Appendix A APPENDIX A\u2014SCOREKEEPING GUIDELINES Section 252(d)(5) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended (BBEDCA, sometimes known as GRH in reference to its three Senate sponsors: Phil Gramm (R- TX), Warren Rudman (R -NH), and Ernest Hollings (D -SC)) , requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Co ngressional Budget Office (CBO) to determine common budget scorekeeping guidelines in consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The following guidelines were set forth in 1997 in the joint explanatory s tatement of the committee of conference accompanying House Report 105-217, the conference report for the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, with any subsequent revisions agreed upon by the scorekeepers. These budget scorekeeping guidelines are used by the House and Senate Budget Committees, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Management and Budget (the \"scorekeepers\") in measuring compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA), as amended; the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Cont rol Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), as amended; and the Statutory Pay -As-You -Go Act of 2010. The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure that the scorekeepers measure the effects of legislation on the deficit consistent with established scorekeeping conventions and w ith the specific requirements in those Acts regarding discretionary spending, direct spending, and receipts. These rules are reviewed periodically by the scorekeepers and revised as necessary to adhere to the purpose. They cannot be changed unless all of t he scorekeepers agree. New accounts or activities are classified only after consultation among the scorekeepers. Accounts and activities cannot be reclassified unless all of the scorekeepers agree. 1. Classification of appropriations A list of appropria tions that are normally enacted in appropriations acts is included in the conference report of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, House Report 105 -217, pages 1014 -1053. The list identifies appropriated entitlements and other mandatory spending in appropriati ons acts, and it identifies discretionary appropriations by category. 2. Outlays prior Outlays from prior -year appropriations will be classified consistent with the discretionary/mandatory classification of the account from which the outlays occur. 3. Direct spending programs Revenues, entitlements and other mandatory programs (including offsetting receipts) will be scored at current law levels, as defined in section 257 of GRH, unless congressional action modifies the authorizing legislation. Substantive changes to or restrictions on entitlement law or other mandatory spending law in appropriations laws will be scored against the Appropriations Committee's section 302(b) allocations in the House and the Senate. For the purpose of CBA scoring, direct sp ending savings that are included in both an appropriations bill and a reconciliation bill will be scored to the reconciliation bill and not to the appropriations bill. For scoring under sections 251 or 252 of GRH, such provisions will be scored to the first bill enacted. 4. Transfer of budget authority from a mandatory account to a discretionary account The transfer of budget authority to a discretionary account will be scored as an increase in discretionary budget authority and outlays in the gaining acc ount. The losing account will not show an offsetting reduction if the account is an entitlement or mandatory program. APPENDIX A\u2014SCOREKEEPING GUIDELINES Page 2 of Appendix A OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) 5. Permissive transfer authority Permissive transfers will be assumed to occur (in full or in part) unless sufficient evidence exists to the contrary. Outlays from such transfers will be estimated based on the best information available, primarily historical experience and, where applicable, indications of Executive or congressional intent. This guideline will apply both to specific transfers (transfers where the gaining and losing accounts and the amounts subject to transfer can be ascertained) and general transfer authority. 6. Reappropriations Reappropriations of expiring balances of budget authority will be scored as new budget authority in the fiscal year in which the balances become newly available. 7. Advance appropriations Advance appropriations of budget authority will be scored as new budget authority in the fiscal year in which the funds become newly available for obliga tion, not when the appropriations are enacted. 8. Rescissions and transfers of unobligated balances Rescissions of unobligated balances will be scored as reductions in current budget authority and outlays in the year the money is rescinded. Transfers o f unobligated balances will be scored as reductions in current budget authority and outlays in the account from which the funds are being transferred, and as increases in budget authority and outlays in the account to which these funds are being transferred. In certain instances, these transactions will result in a net negative budget authority amount in the source accounts. For purposes of section 257 of GRH, such amounts of budget authority will be projected at zero. Outlay estimates for both the transferring and receiving accounts will be based on the spending patterns appropriate to the respective accounts. 9. Delay of obligations Appropriations acts specify a date when funds will become available for obligation. It is this date that determines the year for which new budget authority is scored. In the absence of such a date, the act is assumed to be effective upon enactment. If a new appropriation provides that a portion of the budget authority shall not be available for obligation until a future fisc al year, that portion shall be treated as an advance appropriation of budget authority. If a law defers existing budget authority (or unobligated balances) from a year in which it was available for obligation to a year in which it was not available for obl igation, that law shall be scored as a rescission in the current year and a reappropriation in the year in which obligational authority is extended. 10. Contingent legislation If the authority to obligate is contingent upon the enactment of a subsequent appropriation, new budget authority and outlays will be scored with the subsequent appropriation. If a discretionary appropriation is contingent on the enactment of a subsequent authorization, new budget authority and outlays will be scored with the appropriation. If a discretionary appropriation is contingent on the fulfillment of some action by APPENDIX A\u2014SCOREKEEPING GUIDELINES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Appendix A the Executive branch or some other event normally estimated, new budget authority will be scored with the appropriation, and outlays will be estimated based on the best information about when (or if) the contingency will be met. If direct spending legislation is contingent on the fulfillment of some action by the Executive branch or some other event normally estimated, new budget authority and outlays will be scored based on the best information about when (or if) the contingency will be met. Non-lawmaking contingencies within the control of the Congress are not scoreable events. 11. Scoring purchases When a law provides the authority for an agency to enter into a contract for the purchase, lease-purchase, capital lease, or operating lease of an asset, budget authority and outlays will be scored as follows: For lease-purchases and capital leases, budget authority will be scored against the legislation in the year i n which the budget authority is first made available in the amount of the estimated net present value of the Government's total estimated legal obligations over the life of the contract, except for imputed interest costs calculated at Treasury rates for marketable debt instruments of similar maturity to the lease period and identifiable annual operating expenses that would be paid by the Government as owner (such as utilities, maintenance, and insurance). Property taxes will not be considered to be an operating cost. Imputed interest costs will be classified as mandatory and will not be scored against the legislation or for current level but will count for other purposes. For operating leases, budget authority will be scored against the legislation in the year in which the budget authority is first made available in the amount necessary to cover the Government's legal obligations. The amount scored will include the estimated total payments expected to arise under the full term of a lease contract or, if the contract will include a cancellation clause, an amount sufficient to cover the lease payments for the first fiscal year during which the contract is in effect, plus an amount sufficient to cover the costs associated with cancellation of the contract. For funds that are self -insuring under existing authority, only budget authority to cover the annual lease payment is required to be scored. Outlays for a lease-purchase in which the Federal government assumes substantial risk (for example, through an explici t Government guarantee of third party financing) will be spread across the period during which the contractor constructs, manufactures, or purchases the asset. Outlays for an operating lease, a capital lease, or a lease-purchase in which the private sector retains substantial risk will be spread across the lease period. In all cases, the total amount of outlays scored over time against legislation will equal the amount of budget authority scored against that legislation. No special rules apply to scoring p urchases of assets (whether the asset is existing or is to be manufactured or constructed). Budget authority is scored in the year in which the authority to purchase is first made available in the amount of the Government's estimated legal obligations. Out lays scored will equal the estimated disbursements by the Government based on the particular purchase arrangement, and over time will equal the amount of budget authority scored against that legislation. Existing contracts will not be rescored. To distinguish lease purchases and capital leases from operating leases, the following criteria will be used for defining an operating lease: Ownership of the asset remains with the lessor during the term of the lease and is not transferred to the Govern ment at or shortly after the end of the lease period. The lease does not contain a bargain -price purchase option. APPENDIX A\u2014SCOREKEEPING GUIDELINES Page 4 of Appendix A OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) The lease term does not exceed 75 percent of the estimated economic lifetime of the asset. The present value of the minimum lease payments over the life of the lease does not exceed 90 percent of the fair market value of the asset at the inception of the lease. The asset is a general purpose asset rather than being for a special purpose of the Government and is not built to unique specifica tion for the Government as lessee. There is a private-sector market for the asset. Risks of ownership of the asset should remain with the lessor. Risk is defined in terms of how governmental in nature the project is. If a project is less governmental in nature, the private -sector risk is considered to be higher. To evaluate the level of private -sector risk associated with a lease-purchase, legislation and lease-purchase contracts will be considered against the following type of illustrative criteria, which indicate ways in which the project is less governmental: There should be no provision of Government financing and no explicit Government guarantee of third party financing. Risks of ownership of the asset should remain with the lessor unless the Government was at fault for such losses. The asset should be a general purpose asset rather than for a special purpose of the Government and should not be built to unique specification for the Government as lessee. There should be a private -sector market for the asset. The project should not be constructed on Government land. Language that attempts to waive the Anti -Deficiency Act, or to limit the amount or timing of obligations recorded, does not change the Government's obligations or obligational authority, and so will not affect the scoring of budget authority or outlays. Unless language that authorizes a project clearly states that no obligations are allowed unless budget authority is provided specifically for that project in an appropriations bill in advance of the obligation, the legislation will be interpreted as providing obligation authority, in an amount to be estimated by the scorekeepers. 12. Write -offs of uncashed checks, unredeemed food stamps, and similar instruments Exceptional write -offs of uncashed checks, unredeemed food stamps, and similar instruments (i.e., write -offs of cumulative balances that have built up over several years or have been on the books for several years) shall be scored as an adjustment to the means of financing th e deficit rather than as an offset. An estimate of write-offs or similar adjustments that are part of a continuing routine process shall be netted against outlays in the year in which the write -off will occur. Such write -offs shall be recorded in the accou nt in which the outlay was originally recorded. APPENDIX A\u2014SCOREKEEPING GUIDELINES OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Appendix A 13. Reclassification after an agreement Except to the extent assumed in a budget agreement, a law that has the effect of altering the classification or scoring of spending and revenues (e.g., from discret ionary to mandatory, special fund to revolving fund, on-budget to off -budget, revenue to offsetting receipt), will not be scored as reclassified for the purpose of enforcing a budget agreement. 14. Scoring of receipt increases or direct spending reduction s for additional administrative program management expenses No increase in receipts or decrease in direct spending will be scored as a result of provisions of a law that provides direct spending for administrative or program management activities. 15. As set sales If the net financial cost to the Government of an asset sale is zero or negative (a savings), the amount scored shall be the estimated change in receipts and mandatory outlays in each fiscal year on a cost basis. If the cost to the Government is positive (a loss), the proceeds from the sale shall not be scored for purposes of the CBA or GRH. The net financial cost to the Federal government of an asset sale shall be the net present value of the cash flows from: (1) Estimated proceeds from the asset sale; (2) The net effect on Federal revenues, if any, based on special tax treatments specified in the legislation; (3) The loss of future offsetting receipts that would otherwise be collected under continued Government ownership (using baseline le vels for the projection period and estimated levels thereafter); and (4) Changes in future spending, both discretionary and mandatory, from levels that would otherwise occur under continued Government ownership (using baseline levels for the projection pe riod and at levels estimated to be necessary to operate and maintain the asset thereafter). The discount rate used to estimate the net present value shall be the average interest rate on marketable Treasury securities of similar maturity to the expected r emaining useful life of the asset for which the estimate is being made, plus 2 percentage points to reflect the economic effects of continued ownership by the Government. 16. Indefinite borrowing authority and limits on outstanding debt If legislation im poses or changes a limit on outstanding debt for an account financed by indefinite budget authority in the form of borrowing authority, the legislation will be scored as changing budget authority only if and to the extent the imposition of a limit or the c hange in the existing limit alters the estimated amount of obligations that will be incurred. APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSETS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Appendix B APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSET S This Appendix provides instructions on the budgetary treatment of lease - purchases and leases of capital assets consistent with the scorekeeping rule developed by the executive and legislative branches originally in connection with the Budget Enforce ment Act of 1990 (BEA) (see Appendix A). The scorekeeping rule focuses on leases and lease-purchases specifically authorized by law. However, these requirements apply to all lease-purchase arrangements and capital leases, including those arrangements that agencies may enter into under existing general legal authorities and arrangements that are financed through the Federal Financing Bank, except as noted below. T hese requirements do not apply to leases between Federal agencies if the lessor recorded the full cost of the asset when it was acquired. In addition, the costs of Energy Savings Performance Contracts may be scored on an annual basis, consistent with the guidance provided in OMB Memorandum M -98-13 , F ederal Use of Energy Savings Performance Contracting and OMB Memorandum M-12-21 , A ddendum to OMB Memorandum M -98-13 on Federal Use of Energy Savings Performance Contracts and Utility Energy Service Contracts. A gencies are required to submit to their OMB representatives the following types of leasing and other non- routine fin ancing proposals for review of the scoring impact: Any proposed lease of a capital asset where total Government payments over the full term of the lease would exceed $50 million. It should be assumed that options to renew will be exercised. All financin g proposals that are non -routine in nature and involve unique or unusual concepts or characteristics such as those listed below: All enhanced -use lease ( outlease)-leaseback mechanisms; Establishment of public -private partnerships or limited liability corporations; Issuance of debt by a third party that includes an explicit \"full faith and credit\" guarantee of debt repayment by the Government or an implicit guarantee of repayment from Federal funds that removes a substantial amount of the investor's risk; Special purpose assets for which there is no real private sector market; Any leases executed by GSA with an annual cost that exceeds the p rospectus threshold associated on Government land; Contracts that require the contractor to acquire, construct , or renovate assets valued over $50 million; APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSETS Page 2 of Appendix B OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Share in savings proposals that result in the acquisition of real property; Proposals that raise issu es about the governmental/non-governmental status of the asset or the entity that holds the title to the asset; Any financing proposal for which a statute requires OMB approval of the scoring (or of the proposal) or compliance with Circular No. A- 11. Whe re compliance with Circular No. A- 11 or other specified scoring rules is required by statute, the agency submission must be accompanied by a memorandum from the agency General Counsel explaining how the statutory criteria are satisfied; Arrangements that convey special tax status to the project by virtue of the Government's participation; and Leasing arrangements that involve options that can be conveyed to a third party in exchange for future considerations. Additionally, agencies are required to submit to OMB any proposed arrangements requested by their Resource Management Office. Agencies should submit these proposals to OMB during the conceptual, developmental stage. Subsequent changes that could substan tially change the scope of the proposal or affect the scoring impact (e.g., change from an operating lease to a lease-purchase) must be resubmitted to OMB. 1. Basic requirements (a) General. When an agency is authorized to enter into a lease-purchase or capital lease contract, budget authority will be scored in the year in which the authority is first made available in the amount of the net present value of the Government's total estimated legal obligations over the life of the contract, as described in section 2(b) below. Outlays for lease-purchases in which the Federal Government assumes substantial risk will be spread across the period during which the contractor constructs, manufactures, or purchases the asset. Outlays for a capital lease or a lease-purchase in which the private sector retains substantial risk will be spread across the lease term. The scorekeeping requirements are summarized below. For operating leases, budget authority is required to be obligated up front in the amount necessary to cover the Government's legal obligations, consistent with the requirements of the Antideficiency Act. This will include the estimated total payments expected to arise under the full term of the contract or, if the contract includes a cancellation clause, an amount sufficient to cover the lease and other contractually required payments for the first year plus an amount sufficient to cover the costs associated with cancellation of the contract. For each subsequent year, sufficient budget authority is requi red to be obligated to cover the annual lease payment for that year plus any additional cancellation costs. For operating leases funded by the General Services Administration's Federal Buildings Fund (which is self -insuring under existing authority), only the amount of budget authority needed to cover the annual lease payment is required to be obligated. APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSETS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Appendix B (b) Making annual lease payments after the BA expires. Unless otherwise specified by law, budget authority is available for liquidating obligations (i.e., outlays) for only five fiscal years after the authority expires. For leases financed by annual or multi -year budget authority, agencies should ensure that the appropriations language allows the budget authority to remain available for lease and other contractually required payments over the full term of the lease. If this period is expected to be longer than five fiscal years after the authority expires, the appropriations language should include the provision described in section 95.8 . (c) Change s to existing contracts. When an agency modifies or amends an existing capital lease or lease-purchase contract, any remaining budgetary resources prior to modification should be used to offset the cost of the new contract. The amount scored will be the difference in the net present value of the Government's total estimated legal obligations between the new contract and the remaining term of the original contract. (Both net present values should be calculated using the Treasury borrowing rates published in the annual update to Appendix C of OMB Circular No. A- 94 at the time the contract is amended (see section 4)). There would be no remaining budgetary resources if funds equal to the lease and other contractually required payments or the present value of the lease and other contractually required payments were not scored up front at the time the lease was signed. In this case, the full cost of the new contract should be scored, consistent with the rules for scoring lease -purchases and capital leases. Similarly, when an agency modifies or amends an existing operating lease contract, the impact of the changes needs to be evaluated. If the lease no longer meets the criteri a for an operating lease, the modified lease should be rescored. (d) Options to renew or purchase. When the lease agreement contains an option to renew that can be exercised without additional legislation, it will be presumed that the option will be exe rcised for purposes of calculating the term of the lease and scoring budget authority. When the lease agreement contains an option to purchase at less than fair market value (at the time the option is to be exercised), and the option can be exercised with out additional legislation, it will be presumed that the option will be exercised for purposes of classifying the type of lease and scoring budget authority. SUMMARY OF BUDGET REQUIREMENTS Transaction Budget Authority Outlays Lease- purchase without substantial private risk Amount equal to asset cost recorded up front; amount equal to imputed interest costs recorded on an annual basis over lease period. Amount equal to asset cost scored over the construction period in proportion to the distri bution of the contractor's costs; amount equal to imputed interest costs recorded on an annual basis over lease term. Lease- purchase with substantial private risk Amount equal to asset cost recorded up front; amount equal to imputed interest costs record ed on an annual basis over lease term.

Budget presentation (a) General. For the purposes of scorekeeping transactions that involve lease-purchases and capital leases, the costs are separated into the following components: Asset cost (which equals the present value of the lease and other contractually required payments); and Imputed interest cost (which equals the financing cost Treasury would have incurred if it had financed the project by borrowing). These concepts are defined more fully in section 3. The amounts can be determined from the amortization tables developed in accordance with the instructions in section 4. Budget authority and outlays attributable to asset costs will be classified as investment -type activities (physical assets), and budget authority and outlays attributable to imputed interest costs will be classified as non -investment activities (see section 84.4). (b) Budget authority. Amounts. The up-front budget authority required for both lease -purchases and capital leases is called the asset cost. This equals the present value of the minimum lease and other contractually required payments excluding payments for identifiable annual operating expenses that would be paid by the Government as owner, such as utilities, minor maintenance, and insurance. Property taxes will not be considered to be an operating expense and will be included in the calculation of the up-front budget authority. (See section 3 for the treatment of property taxes for purposes of distinguishing operating leases from capital leases.) Other contractually required payments include any and all costs related to the asset being leased in addition to the rent fee applied under the lease. For example, other contractually required payments would include all costs under triple net or other unique arrangements. The present value of the lease and other contractually required payments is discounted as of the date of the first payment (or the beginning of the lease term, whichever is earlier) using the appropriate interest rate (see section 4 for a more detailed explanation and the treatment of multiple deliveries). Additional budget authority equal to Treasury's cost of financing (i.e., the imputed interest cost) plus any annual operating expenses will be recorded on an annual basis over the lease term. APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSETS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Appendix B Type of authority . When an agency enters into a capital lease or lease-purchase under general authorities available to the agency, it must do so within the limits of the budgetary resources available to it and the constraints of the scorekeeping requirements. If the Congress enacts legislation that enables an agency to enter into a lease-purchase or capital lease for a specific project without further congressional action (e.g., appropriations action), it will be assumed that the Congress has provided the budget authority required for the transaction. If the Congress does not provide the budget authority in the form of an appropriation, then authority to borrow or contract authority will be recorded as follows: Authority to borrow will be recorded if the transaction is a lease- purchase without substantial private risk, in which case outlays need to be scored up -front in advance of appropriations for the annual lease payment (or offsetting collections). A portion of the amount subsequently appropriated (or collected, if the agency receives offsetting collections) will be applied to retire outstanding agency debt attributable to the lease-purchase. (See sections 2(c) and 2(d) for more information on how that portion is determined and presented in the Budget.) Contract authority will be recorded if the transaction is a lease-purchase with substantial pr ivate risk or a capital lease, in which case outlays will be scored over the lease term and financed by appropriations for the annual lease payment (or offsetting collections). A portion of the amount appropriated (or collected, if the agency receives off setting collections) will be applied to liquidate contract authority. (See sections 2(c) and 2(d) for more information on how that portion is determined and presented in the Budget.) Timing. When the Congress enacts legislation that specifically enables an agency to enter into a lease-purchase or capital lease, the budget authority required for the transaction will be recorded when the authority first becomes available for obligation. Obligations will be recorded when the lease agreement is signed. When the authority stems from general authority available to the agency, obligations are recorded, and sufficient budgetary resources must be available, when the lease agreement is signed. (c) Outlays. Lease-purchases without substantial private risk . Outlays are not equal to the annual lease payments. Outlays are scored over the period during which the contractor constructs, manufactures, or purchases the asset, in an amount equal to the a sset cost. This amount will equal the up -front budget authority. Amounts of the asset cost in excess of the contractor's actual construction or manufacturing costs should be distributed in proportion to the distribution of the construction or manufacturin g costs. If the asset already exists, the outlays will be recorded in the year in which the lease-purchase contract is signed. Outlays equal to the imputed interest costs are reported on an annual basis over the lease term. Lease-purchases with substantial private risk and capital leases . Outlays are scored annually equal to the annual lease and other contractually required payments. Over the life of the lease agreement, a portion of the outlays (equivalent to the asset cost) will come from the balan ces obligated when the lease agreement was signed, and a portion (equivalent to the imputed interest cost) will come from new budget authority. The appropriate APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSETS Page 6 of Appendix B OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) amounts can be determined from amortization tables developed in accordance with the instructions in section 4. (d) Annual appropriations for lease financed by contract authority or borrowing authority. Lease-purchases and capital leases that are financed by contract authority or borrowing authority will generally require annual appropriations in an amount equal to the annual lease payment. Since budget authority equal to the asset cost is scored up front, the portion of the annual appropriation that corresponds to the amortization of the asset cost is not scored as new budget authority. If it wer e, total budget authority would be overstated over the life of the lease. The budget authority that is recorded on an annual basis will equal the imputed interest cost. The required adjustments are explained below: For lease-purchases without substantial private risk that are financed by borrowing authority. An amount equal to the amortization of the asset cost component of the annual lease payment will be treated as redemption of debt and deducted from the new budget authority totals. On the program and financing schedule, this amount will be reported as a negative entry on line 1135 or 1236 (see section 82.18 ). If offsetting collections are used to make the annual lease payment in lieu of an appropriation, the amount will be reported as a negative entry on line 1726 or 1825. For capital leases and lease -purchases with substantial private risk that are financed by contract authority . An amount equal to the amortization of the asset cost component of the annual lease payment will be treated as liquidating cash and deducted from the new budget authority totals. On the program and financing schedule, this amount will be reported as a negative entry on line 1137 or 1238 (see section 82.18). (If offsetting collections are used to make the annual lease payment in lieu of an appropriation, the amount will be reported as a negative entry on line 1727 or 1826.) (e) Agency debt. For lease-purchases without substantial private risk, agency borrowing must be recorded to finance the outlays scored for the construction, manufacture, or purchase of the asset. The agency debt that accumulates over this period is equal to the asset cost; this debt is subsequently redeemed over the lease payment period in an amount equal to a portion of the annual lease payment. The appropriate amounts of debt and debt redemption can be determined from the amortization tables developed in accordance with the instructions in section 4, Step 5. Interest on agency debt can be determined in accordance with Steps 3, 4, and 5. If the account has a balance sheet, the amount of such agency debt should be included as a separate item (and separate from other agency debt) under liabilities and identified as having been incurred to finance lease-purchases. All other accounts should include the amount of agency debt in the narrative statement for the account that is published in the Budget Appendix . 3. Definitions and concepts For the purposes of scoring lease-purchases, capital leases, and operating leases, the following definitions and c oncepts apply. Agencies should consult with OMB in cases where enhanced use leases and public- private partnerships are involved. Public -private partnerships should not be used solely or primarily as a vehicle for obtaining private financing of Federal construction or renovation projects. Such transactions should be used only when they are the least expensive method, in present value terms, to finance construction or repair. Agencies shall consult with OMB in cases where a contract requires a private contractor to construct , renovate, or acquire a capital asset solely or primarily to provide the service to the Govern ment to determine the appropriate treatment or obligations. APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSETS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 7 of Appendix B Lease-purchase means a type of lease in which ownership of the asset is transferred to the Government at or shortly after the end of the lease term. Such a lease may or may not contain a bargain -price purchase option. Capital lease means any lease other than a lease-purchase that does not meet the criteria of an operating lease. Operating lease means a lease that meets all the criteria listed below. If the criteria are not met, the lease will be considered to be a capital lease or a lease-purchase, as appropriate. Multi -year service contracts (e.g., grounds maintenance) and multi -year purchase contracts for expendable commodities (e.g., aspirin) are not considered to be operating leases. Owner ship of the asset remains with the lessor during the term of the lease and is not transferred to the Government at or shortly after the end of the lease term; The lease does not contain a bargain -price purchase option; The lease term does not exceed 75 percent of the estimated economic life of the asset; The present value of the minimum contractually required payments over the life of the lease does not exceed 90 percent of the fair market value of the asset at the beginning of the lease term; The asset is a general purpose asset rather than being for a special purpose of the Government and is not built to the unique specification of the Government as lessee; and There is a private sector market for the asset. The following guidelines will be used in distinguishing between operating leases, capital leases, and lease purchases. They should be used in calculating the term of the lease and the value of the minimum lease and other contractually required payments: Estimate of fair market value. In the case of real property, the fair market value should be based on current market appraisals. If no asset exists, the fair market value of the proposed asset should be based on the Government's estimate of the private d eveloper's cost to construct the leased facility. The estimate should only include the costs the Government would normally pay the private sector for such a facility. These costs include the total direct and indirect costs of constructing the facility, including land purchase, design, site improvements, and management costs. Fair market value should not include the value of features or enhancements that were built or added for the Government's unique needs or special purposes or features or enhancements that will be paid for by the Government in lump sum. If the Government proposes to lease only a portion of a facility, then the estimate of fair market value should be adjusted accordingly to reflect the portion that will be leased by the Government. Special features or enhancements. Assets that have special features or enhancements that were built or added for the Government's unique needs or special purposes need to be evaluated on a case -by- case basis to ascertain whether they can be considered to be general purpose assets. If the asset is considered to be a general purpose asset, then, as a general rule, such special features or enhancements should be financed up-front, separate from the lease. Upfront, lump sum payments. If the terms of a lease co ntain an upfront, lump sum payment, only the amounts associated with special features or enhancements to meet the Government's unique APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSETS Page 8 of Appendix B OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) needs or specifications and the amounts associated with agency specific customizations can be removed from the agency scor ing calculation. Any payment in excess of that amount will be factored into the net present value scoring calculation. The rental stream over the life of the lease must be adequate to provide functional space. Projects on Government land . If the projec t is constructed or located on Government land, it will be presumed to be for a special purpose of the Government. Renewal and purchase options . If the lease agreement contains an option to renew that can be exercised without additional legislation, it w ill be presumed that the option will be exercised. If the lease agreement contains an option to purchase at less than fair market value (at the time the option is to be exercised), and the option can be exercised without additional legislation, it will be presumed that the option will be exercised. Cancellation clauses . It will be presumed that the lease will run for the full term of the contract, and the minimum payments will be calculated on the basis of the lease and other contractually required payme nts that will be made over the full term of the lease (including options to renew). Lease-backs from public/private partnerships or non -Federal entities . If an agency leases from a public/private partnership that has substantial private participation, th e lease will be treated as a capital lease. The term \"public/private partnership\" includes special purpose entities for which the Government is a beneficiary. Substantial private participation means (1) the non-Federal partner has a majority ownership sh are of the partnership and its revenues; (2) the non- Federal partner has contributed at least 20 percent of the total value of the assets owned by the partnership; and (3) the Government has not provided indirect guarantees of the project, such as a rental guarantee or a requirement to pay higher rent if it reduces its use of space. Total value includes the value of assets contributed by the Government (but not the value of land) and all improvements made to the asset. Contributions by the non-Federal par tner of cash, real assets, and loans for which the non -Federal partner is responsible for repayment will count towards meeting the 20 percent threshold. Direct loans from the Government or guarantees by the Government of loans made to the non-Federal partner or to the partnership will not count towards the 20 percent threshold. If a public/private partnership fails to meet the test of substantial private participation, the partnership will be considered governmental for purposes of the budget, and the lea se-back will be scored against the agency that enters into the partnership. If the Government ground- leases property to a non -Federal entity and at a later date, as the result of a separate, full and open competition, leases back the improvements, the lease will not be considered a lease-back from a public/private partnership, as long as the lessor is a totally non -Federal entity. Such lease-backs will be assessed by applying the criteria in this Appendix and may be treated as an operating lease only if t he transaction meets all the criteria for an operating lease. In the circumstances where the Government outleased improvements and the Government then wants to lease a portion of the project at a later date, post completion, the following analysis must be undertaken: 1. Evaluate the proposed transaction against the substantial private participation definition above; 2. Is the competition to lease a portion of the project part of a separate, full and open competition for the lowest cost option; and 3. Evaluate against the operating versus capital lease criteria. APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSETS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 9 of Appendix B In contrast, an outlease (enhanced -use lease) and leaseback as one transaction (as opposed to the two transactions discussed above) with full or substantial Federal G overnment occupancy of a facility, is a capital lease transaction. Similarly, if the Government enters into a transaction to dispose of a facility, through any means, yet seeks to continue Federal use of (e.g., lease back) the same facility or any subsequent improvements to that fa cility, it is entering into a capital lease transaction. Bargain-price purchase option. A bargain -price purchase option is a provision allowing the Government to purchase the leased property for a price that is lower than the expected fair market value o f the property at the date the option can be exercised. The purchase price includes the value of any rebates or income to the agency or Government resulting from its purchase of the asset. Property taxes. Property taxes, along with other annual operating expenses, will be excluded from the lease payments for purposes of comparing the present value of the minimum lease and other contractually required payments with the fair market value of the asset. (Note: Property taxes will be included in the calculation of the net present value of the lease and other contractually required payments for purposes of scoring budget authority under BBEDCA. See section 2(b) above.) Interest rates . The present value of th e minimum lease and other contractually required payments will be calculated on the basis of Treasury rates for marketable debt instruments of similar maturity to the lease term (see section 4). Risk means the level of private-sector risk. Lease- purchase agreements are scored as with or without substantial private risk depending on the level of private -sector risk. Substantial private risk means the absence of substantial G overnment risk. Risk is defined in terms of how governmental in nature the projec t is. That is, if the project is less governmental in nature, the private sector risk is considered to be higher. The following types of illustrative criteria indicate ways in which the project is less governmental : There is no provision of Government financing and no explicit Government guarantee of third-party financing; Risks incident to ownership of the asset (e.g., financial responsibility for destruction or loss of the asset) remain with the lessor unless the Government was at fault for such lo sses; The asset is a general purpose asset rather than being for a special purpose of the Government and is not built to the unique specification of the Government as lessee; There is a private-sector market for the asset; or The project is not const ructed on Government land. Imputed interest cost means the financing costs that Treasury would have incurred if it had sold debt to the public equal to the total project cost. The difference between the total estimated legal obligations (excluding obligations for annual operating expenses as described i n section 2(b)) and their estimated net present value represents imputed interest costs. Imputed interest costs will be calculated at Treasury rates for marketable debt instruments of similar maturity to the lease term on the date the contract is signed. T hese costs will be considered mandatory under the BBEDCA and will be shown in the same function as interest on agency debt, that is, in the function that provided the obligational authority to enter into the contract. APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSETS Page 10 of Appendix B OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Differential cost of financing means the total annual interest payments on any debt sold to the public less the interest payments that would have been made on the same amount of debt at the Treasury rate (i.e., less the imputed interest costs). Simply stated, this corresponds to any interest above Treasury's interest rate. Asset cost means the present value of the agency's minimum lease and other contractually required payments discounted from the date of the first payment (or the beginning of the lease term, whichever is earlier) using the Treasury interest rate for marketable debt instruments of similar maturity to the lease term on the date the contract is signed and excluding obligations for identifiable annual operating expenses as described in section 2(b). Asset cost corresponds to th e total construction or acquisition costs, plus property taxes and any interest above Treasury's cost of financing (i.e., the differential cost of financing). See section 4 for more detailed explanation and the treatment of multiple deliveries. 4. Guidanc e on calculations A schedule of lease and other contractually required payments or an amortization schedule is required to calculate budget authority, outlays, and debt for capital leases or lease-purchases. The correct Treasury rate to use for discounting to present value and for calculating imputed interest costs will be based on the economic assumptions in the most recent budget, which, for the current year, are published in the annual update to Appendix C of OMB Circular No. A -94. Revised forecasts of these Treasury interest rates are released whenever economic assumptions for the budget are updated. Use Treasury rates for marketable debt instruments of similar matur ity to the lease term on the date the contract is signed. Discount from the date of the first payment (or the beginning of the lease term, whichever is earlier). The term selected for the Treasury rate should be comparable to the term of the capital lease or lease- purchase. Al l assumptions required to perform the lease analysis are subject to OMB approval. Step 1 \u2014Calculate up -front BA. For lease-purchase without substantial private risk; lease -purchase with substantial private risk; and capital lease (including lease -back from public/private partnership with substantial private sector participation): To determine up -front BA (i.e., asset cost), calculate the present value of the lease and other contractually required payments, discounting from the date of the first payment or the beginning of the lease term, whichever is earlier, using the appropriate Treasury interest rate as the discount factor and excluding obligations for identifiable annual operating expenses as described in section 2(b). This BA i s scored when the authority to enter into a contract for the lease-purchase or capital lease first becomes available for obligation. However, if the lease contract provides for multiple deliveries of assets, the up -front BA is sum of the present values of the lease and other contractually required payments for each asset discounted back to the date that the asset is delivered. For example, if the lease contract provides for the delivery of one machine in each of the next five years, the lease and other c ontractually required payments for the machine acquired in the first year would be discounted back to the first year, while the lease and other contractually required payments for the machine acquired in the fifth year would be discounted back to the fifth year, and the total BA recorded up front would be the sum of the present values calculated for each of the five deliveries. Step 2 \u2014Calculate outlays over the period during which the contractor constructs, manufactures, or purchases the asset. For lease-purchase without substantial private risk: Score outlays in proportion to the distribution of the contractor's costs. For example, assume a contractor's costs on a $50 million project are estimated to be $7.5 million the first year, $27.5 million the seco nd year, and $15 million the third year. The analyst should APPENDIX B \u2014BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LEASE-PURCHASES AND LEASES OF CAPITAL ASSETS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 11 of Appendix B apply outlay rates of 15 percent, 55 percent, and 30 percent to the BA calculated in Step 1 for the first, second, and third years, respectively. Total outlays at the end of the construction, manufacture, or purchase period should equal the BA calculated in Step 1. (Note that total outlays will ordinarily exceed the contractor's costs.) For lease-purchase with substantial private risk and capital lease (including lease -back from public/private partnership with substantial private sector participation) : Outlays are not scored during this period. Refer to Step 4 for outlay scoring. Step 3 \u2014Calculate annual BA for the lease payment period. For lease-purchase without substantial private risk; lease -purchase with substantial private risk; and capital lease: Annual BA wil l equal the imputed interest costs calculated using the same Treasury interest rate used to discount the lease and other contractually required payments in Step 1. The interest portion of each periodic payment is the imputed interest cost. In the case of a lease-purchase without substantial private risk, the interest rate should be applied to debt that is initially equal to the up -front BA calculated in Step 1 and that is then amortized over the lease term in accordance with Step 5. Step 4 \u2014Calculate outlays over the lease payment period. For lease-purchase without substantial private risk : Annual outlays are equal to the annual BA (i.e., the imputed interest costs). For lease-purchase with substantial private risk and capital leas e (including lease -back from public/private partnership with substantial private sector participation) : Annual outlays are equal to the lease and other contractually required payments. Step 5 \u2014Calculate agency debt (applies only to lease -purchases without substantial private risk). Agency debt accumulates during the period of construction, manufacture, or purchase of the asset. The increase in debt each year equals the amount of outlays calculated in Step 2. Agency debt is subsequently redeemed over the lease payment period according to an amortization schedule. The amount of debt redemption each year is equal to the lease payment less the imputed interest cost as defined in Step 3. (Debt redemption is not scored as BA or outlays.) Imputed interest costs are scored as BA and outlays and are also scored as interest on agency debt. 5. Reporting to OMB and Treasury Budget execution reports and apportionment requests will reflect budget amounts in accordance with these requirements. Amounts (e.g., budget authority and outlays) will be reported to Treasury on the same basis.

Entry Description Unobligated balance: 1000 Unobligated balance brought forward, Oct 1 For unexpired accounts : Amount of unobligated balance of appropriations or other budgetary resources carried forward from the preceding year and available for obligation without new action by Congress. Do not include special or trust fund amounts and offsetting collections that are not available for obligation because of provisions of law, such as benefit formulas or limitations on obligations (se e section 20.4(f) ). Includes uninvested balances and balances invested in Federal securities (par value), adjusted for unrealized discounts (a negative amount). Includes all unobligated balances (definite appropriations, definite borrowing authority, defi nite contract authority, fund balances) at the start of the year. Include the impact of reductions of these prior year balances enacted on lines 1131, 1133, 1230, 1232, 1520, 1620, 1723, and 1823. If unobligated balances are used to liquidate deficiencies, report the amount used as a negative adjustment on line 1034 and reduce the amount on line 1000 for schedule P. For the SF 133, do not APPENDIX F \u2014FORMAT OF SF 132, SF 133 , SCHEDULE P, AND SBR OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Appendix F Entry Description include any amounts on lines 1034 and 1901 because the SF 133 does not include the unfunded deficiencies section. See exhibit 130M . The amount on this line should be the same as the end of year amounts of the previous fiscal year: On lines 2201, of the September 30 SF 133; In the Treasury Combined Statement Appendix; and In the past year column of the Program and Financing Schedule of the Budget Appendix on line 1941. You must provide line splits on apportionment requests that characterize the unobligated balances in up to two ways. First, in TAFSs that are split a ccounts (e.g. have both discretionary and mandatory funds), the first letter of the line split must be \"D\" to identify balances that are discretionary or \"M\" to identify balances that are mandatory. (See section 120.20 for additional information.) Secon d, you must distinguish whether the balances are estimates or actual balances. You must use a line split of E to indicate the balance is an Estimate or a line split of A to indicate the use of an Actual balance. If the account is apportioned by time peri ods and the difference between the estimate and the actual is within the range of adjustment permitted by section 120.50 , adjust the apportionments accordingly. If the difference is greater, OMB must approve a request for reapportionment before the funds that are greater than the automatic apportionment can be obligated. In cases where you have discretionary estimated balances, the line split would be \"DE\"; for discretionary, actual balances, the line split would be \"DA\". Some agencies further distinguish balances by appending a number to the line split and changing the line stub to indicate the source of the balances. In these kinds of cases, the line split values may be \"DA1\", \"DA2\", and \"DA3\". For no -year accounts and any year (other than the last) of multi - year accounts, unpaid unfilled orders from Federal sources for reimbursable work (e.g., Economy Act) may be carried forward on this line. For expired accounts : Amount of expired unobligat ed balances available for upward adjustments of obligations. In the first expired year, the amount should be the same as the amount of unobligated balances on lines 2201, 2403; or line 2490 of the previous fiscal year 's September 30 SF 133. In the second expired year and thereafter, the amount should be the same as the amount on line 2403 of the previous fiscal year's September 30 SF 133. These balances are available only for valid upward adjustments of obligations that were properly incurred against the account during the unexpired phase.

These may be identified by the financial statement auditors, agency personnel, or others. Include adjustments posted to the agency financial system that are either material or non -material. When reporting to GTAS, agencies will use an attribute to show that their USSGL account balances are not current -year activity \u2014even though these balances would otherwise look like current -year activity. GTAS will use this attribute to crosswalk these US SGL account balances to this adjustment line. OMB and the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) will review the Fund Balance with Treasury (FBWT) component of the adjustments that agencies report to GTAS each quarter. Agencies should generally exclude reclassifications from clearing accounts to other TAFSs, but may consult OMB if they want to include some of these reclassifications as adjustments.

Some laws that make appropriated receipts available for obligation specify the amount appropriated. These are definite appropriation s. Other laws that make appropriated receipts available for obligation do not specify the amount appropriated. These appropriated receipts are indefinite appropriations . For indefinite appropriations of appropriated receipts, refer to lines 1101 and 1201. Appropriations contingent upon authorizing legislation or upon designation as an emergency .\u2014When an appropriations act specifies that all or a portion of the amount appropriated is not available for obligation until specifically authorized by another la w, or are not available for obligation until the President submits a budget request to the Congress designating the amount as an emergency: Include the full amount of the appropriation on line 1100, and Subtract the amount not authorized by law or not designated as emergency requirements by the President on line 1134 (general and revolving funds) or 1135 (special and trust funds) except on the September 30 SF 133. At the beginning of the next fiscal year, any unobligated balance that is still contingent an d would still be available for new obligations if the contingency is met will be included on line 1000 and subtracted on line 1134 (general and revolving funds) or 1135 (special and trust funds) as unavailable until either the authorizing legislation is enacted or the amount is designated by the President. This paragraph does not apply to contingent emergency appropriations enacted in FY 1999 or earlier. Contingent emergency appropriations from FY 1999 and prior years. \u2014If the President designates a contin gent emergency appropriation from FY 1999 or a prior year as emergency requirements, include the amount on this line in the year of the Presidential designation. Appropriations to liquidate debt. \u2014Appropriations that are available to repay amounts borrowed from the Treasury but are not available to incur obligations. Include the appropriation to liquidate debt on line 1100 or 1200 and the repayment to Treasury on line 1136 or 1236, as a negative. Include any excess on line 1029, as a negative.

Include appropriations to liquidate deficiencies on line 1100 or 1200 as a positive amount and on line 1136 or 1237 as a negative amount on schedule P only. If appropriations that are not specifically made available to liquidate deficiencies (and are otherwise available for obligation) are used to liquidate deficiencies, include d the appropriations on line 1100 or 1200 as a positive amount and on line 1901, as a negative amount on schedule P only. Deficiencies are included on lines 7000 through 7020 for schedule P only. This applies to unexpired and expired accounts. Normally, there are no excess amounts because these appropriations are requested after the deficiency is known, whereas, the agencies normally budget for appropriations to liquidate debt and appropriations to liquidate contract authority. Appropriations to liquidate contract authority .\u2014Typically, contract authority is provided to incur obligations in one action by Congress (often in authorizing legislation) and separate appropriations of liquidating cash are provided in appropriations acts. The appropriation to liqu idate is shown as a positive amount on line 1100 or 1200 and as a negative on line 1138 or 1238. Thus, the total budgetary resources on lines 1910 (SF 133), 1920 (SF 132), and 1930 ( schedule P) equal zero. See exhibit 120M. In a few cases, contract auth ority may be provided in order to permit agencies to incur obligations in anticipation of offsetting collections and appropriations to liquidate the obligations may be provided if the anticipated offsetting collections have not been realized. These approp riations to liquidate should be recorded as described above. Include any excess amounts on line 1138 as a negative. Appropriations substituted for borrowing authority .\u2014 Occasionally, portions of appropriations are available to liquidate obligations initial ly incurred against borrowing authority when the borrowing is not exercised. The amounts are available to liquidate obligations but are not available for obligation. Include such portion substituted for borrowing authority on this line. Include an amount equal to the portion of appropriation substituted for borrowing authority on line 1139 or 1239 as a negative. Thus, the budgetary resources on lines 1910 (SF 133), 1920 (SF 132), and 1930 ( schedule P) equal zero. Debt forgiveness appropriation. \u2014An amount that Congress provided equivalent to an inferred appropriation to retire debt as specified in a public law. The amount is shown as a positive amount on line 1100 or 1200 and as a negative amount on line 1136 or 1236. Appropriations of Specific Amounts of which \"Not to Exceed\" a Portion Remains Available Beyond the Remainder of the Appropriation. See details following the description of line 1930.

For mandated non -expenditure transfers provided under a continuing resolution and derived from the general fund of the U .S. Treasury, record the amount on line 1100; and then on line 1121 after the non -expenditure transfer is actually transferred. See line 1121. If this is a special fund account that receives an appropriation from the General Fund of the Treasury, include the general fund appropriation on this line. If this is a trust fund account that receives an appropriation from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, do not include the general fund appropriation on this line. Such amounts are transferred to the trust fund as an expenditure transfer. Consult with your OMB representative. Include amounts for liquidation of contract authority, debt reduction, and liquidation of deficiencies, when applicable. Definite appropriation. \u2014Include the amount specified in law. Indefinite appropriation from other than appro priated receipts. \u2014Include an estimate of the amount to be obligated during the fiscal year. On the September 30 report, reduces the amount on lines 1100 and 1200 for the portion that is not needed to cover obligations. Therefore, the amount certified by a ppropriation warrants for the year, after being reduced by negative warrants issued by the Treasury or end -of-year statements. For upward adjustments against indefinite appropriation derived from the general fund of the US Treasury, request a Treasury ap propriation warrant and show the amount on line 1100 or 1200. Return any recoveries of prior year unpaid obligations to the general fund of the US Treasury on line 1037. Report the amount of emergency appropriations enacted or requested as discretio nary appropriations, including amounts that are contingent on the President submitting a budget request to Congress designating the amount as an emergency.

Include the amounts collected in the current fiscal year on this line. Subtract the amounts that are that are not expected to be available as a negative amount on line 1135 or 1235 and show this amount on the September 30 report. See exhibit 120N . Some receipts were collected in a previous fiscal year and precluded from obligation in a previous fiscal year. Include the amounts expected to become available pursuant to law during the fiscal year on this line. Some receipts are not appropriated. Exclude these amounts from this line. NOTE: In exceptional cases , there is authority in law to invest collections. In such cases, the current year collections and prior year collections (not shown on the SF 132) will not be available for obligation (and will not be included on the SF 132 and SF 133 until needed to inc ur obligations) but will be available for investment. Unlike OMB, Treasury classifies these funds as \"available.\" Appropriation (previously unavailable) 1102 1202 For general funds, amount derived from the general fund of the US Treasury previously repo rted as precluded from obligation on line 1134 or 1234 in a prior fiscal year that becomes available for obligation in a subsequent fiscal year.

Reappropriation 1106 1206 Amount of new budget authority resulting from legislation that extends the availability of funds that have expired or would otherwise expire. Such extensions of availability are counted as new budget authority in the first year of the extended availability (see sections 20.4(h) and 120.65). The losing account has expired; therefore, no reapportionment action is needed for the losing account. For the SF 133, the losing account will include a negative amount on line 1131 or 1230 of the previous year. Use line 1012 for expired unobligated balance transfers that are not reported as new budget authority in the unexpired account. Use line 1010 for the expired account. Since the losing account has expired, no reapportionment action is required. Nonexpenditure transfers: Appropriations transferred to other accounts ( -) 1120 1220 Amount of budget authority enacted for the fiscal year that is actually transferred from the account to other accounts under existing legislation that does not involve an obligation or an outlay.

Use this line to show transfers of unobligated balances authorized by Congress in lieu of appropriations; or result ing from legislation that changes the purpose for which the balances are available. Show transfers resulting from general transfer authority or reorganizations, where the purpose has not changed or on line 1010. For transfers pursuant to existing law of mandatory funding to be used for otherwise discretionary activities, show the transfer on line 1220 in the losing account and on line 1121 in the receiving account, using the appropriate BBEDCA classifications for the respective accounts. The entries on this line are non -expenditure transfers between two Federal Government accounts. (The treatment of non -expenditure transfers is explained in section 20.4(j) (4)). NOTE: All transfers between Federal funds (accounts that are not trust funds; i.e., genera l, special, management, and revolving funds) and trust funds are treated as expenditure transfers.

[schedule P] Line 1910 is used for the SF 133, line 1920 is used for the SF 132, and line 1930 is used for the schedule P. For unexpired acco unts: This amount will differ from the amount on line 1920 on the latest SF 132 to the extent that individual amounts have changed that do not require the submission of a reapportionment request (see section 120.37). For expired accounts : This amount is not available for new obligations. See sections 130.8-130.11 for additional instructions. In a limited number of cases, the following guidance applies to specific Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbols. Affected amounts are included on SF 132 line 1100: Appropriations of Specific Amounts of which \"Not to Exceed\" a Portion Remains Available Beyond the Remainder of the Appropriation. In a limited number of cases, the basic amount of the appropriation is available for one year (or for a f ixed amount of time) and the law permits \"not to exceed\" or \"up to\" a specific amount to be available for a longer period of time or until expended. Initial apportionment requests for these accounts should display the maximum possible amount in the Treasu ry account with the extended availability on anticipated non- expenditure transfers of appropriations (net) line (i.e., 1151) as a positive amount and the balance in the Treasury account with the lesser time availability on anticipated non -expenditure trans fers of appropriations (net) line (i.e., 1151) as a negative amount. Note. \u2014Treasury will warrant the full amount in the one -year account. You should move the funds to the account with the extended fund availability using the SF 1151. See exhibit 120U . If you subsequently determine that the maximum amount is not needed in the account with the extended availability, you should submit a reapportionment request proposing to transfer the funds to the account of lesser time availability. Show this transfe r on SF 132 lines 1120 \"Appropriation transferred to other account (-),\" 1151 \"Anticipated of appropriations (net) (+ or 1010 \"Unobligated balance transferred \"Anticipated non-expenditure transf ers of unobligated balances (net) (+ or - ),\" as appropriate. After OMB has approved the transfer, use the SF 1151 to transfer the funds to the account of lesser time availability. Such transfers are irreversible. That is, once the availability of funds is reduced, subsequent apportionments and SF 1151 may not extend the availability of these funds. Interest on the public debt. For the Interest on the Public Debt account, \"interest\" includes both the interest paid and the change in interest payable for public issues of Treasury debt securities and for certain special issues (i.e., Government account series) of Treasury debt securities\u2014zero coupon bonds and DoD's Education Benefits Fund, Military Retirement Fund, Defense Cooperation Fund, and Medicare -Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund.

This entry will include any excess of budgetary resources realized over amounts estimated to become available for obligation on the latest SF 132, when such amounts exceed the parameters set forth in section 120.37. (Do not use this line for accounts and funds that are not subject to apportionment. Unobligated balances of such accounts will be reported on lines 2301 through 2303.) This balance will be reported as a negative amount if budgetary resources (in cluding estimates through the end of the year) are less than reported on the latest SF 132. If, on the September 30 report, a negative amount is reported on this line, the amount must be offset by remaining balances.

F or accounts exempt from apportionment, the offset must be against lines 2301 - 2303 or an apparent violation of the Antideficiency will have occurred. Unrealized budgetary resources will, in effect, be considered an offset against amounts apportioned (lines 2201 through 2203) or exempt from apportionment (lines 2301 through 2303) rather than an unobligated balance not available for obligation (lines 2401 through 2403). This line will be used for the un -apportioned balance of public enterprise and intragove rnmental revolving funds, as well as trust revolving funds that are subject to apportionment.

HOW DO I TREAT EXTENSIONS OF THE AVAILABILITY OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES? Extensions of the availability of unobligated balances of budget authority are treated as new budget authority (e.g., reappropriations) or balance transfers depending on: The underlying authority to extend the availability; and Whether availability is extended before or after the balances have expired. Based on the factors above, the extensions are shown as follows: (a) Apportionment Reappropriations described in paragraph (a) are reflected for FY 2020 should reflect an estimate of the amount to be reappropriated from the estimated expiring FY 2019 balances. A reapportionment may be required after the actual amount of the expiri ng balances is known. You may wish to reflect these amounts on lines 1134, \"BA: Disc: Appropriations precluded from obligation,\" or 1234, \"BA: Mand: Appropriations precluded from obligation\" until an appropriate time after the required reprogramming notic e has been transmitted to Congress. Balance transfer amounts from expired to unexpired funds, described in paragraph (b) are reflected on line 1012: \" Unob Bal: Expired balance transfer to unexpired acct.\" (b) SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources For the SF 133 for September 30, all expiring balances, including amounts subject to reappropriation or balance transfer in the following fiscal year, should be reflected on either line 2201 \"Unob Bal: Apportioned: Avail Bal: Unapportioned: Other,\" as appropriate. SF 133s prepared for later years should treat reappropriations and balance t ransfers in the same manner as the apportionment in the available columns. For reappropriations, the amounts moved from the expired TAFS to the available TAFS should show as negative amounts on lines 1131 or 1230 (see exhibit 130G ). For balance transfers, the amounts moved from the expired TAFS to the available TAFS should show as negative amounts on line 1012. (Treasury Financial Manual U.S. Government Standard General Ledger Supplement, which contains crosswalks from the U.S. Standard General Ledger to the SF 133 and Program and Financing Schedule, is available at http://www.fms.treas.gov/ussgl/index.html). (c) Schedule P of the President's Budget When the PB20xx President's Budget exercise opens, all amounts expiring on September 30 of the prior year should be reflected on schedule P line 1940 \" Unobligated balance expiring (memorandum)\" in the prior year column. APPENDIX F \u2014FORMAT OF SF 132, SF 133, SCHEDULE P AND SBR Page 64 of Appendix F OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Amounts reappropriated (such as the example in paragraph (a)) should be reflected on line 1106 \" BA: Disc: Reappropriation\" in the current year column. Amounts treated as balance transfers between expired to unexpired funds (such as the example in paragraph (b)) should be reflected on line 1012 \" Unob Bal: Expired balance transf to unexpired acct\" in the PY column. Extensions of the Availability of Unobligated Balances If the authority is provided by... Then the extension is treated as... A standing provision of law enacted before the budget authority was provided. For unexpired funds: BA transfer if the transfer occurs in the same year the resource became available for obligation; balance transfer for transfers of prior year resources. For expired funds: Balance transfer for transfers of prior year resources. A provision enacted in the same law that provides the budget authority. For unexpired funds: BA transfer if the transfer occurs in the same year the resource became available for obligation; balance transfer for transfers of prior year resources. For expi red funds: Balance transfer for transfers of prior year resources. Legislation enacted after the budget authority was provided. For unexpired funds: BA transfer if the transfer occurs in the same year the resource became available for obligation; balance transfer for transfers of prior year resources. For expired funds: Reappropriation if the transfer occurs in the year for which the legislation is enacted; balance transfer for transfers in subsequent years. 13. HOW DO I RECORD REDUCTIONS OF BUDGET AUTHORITY AND UNOBLIGATED BALANCES? If you have a reduction of budget authority or unobligated balance, follow the chart below in recording the reduction of budget authority or unobligated balance. In enacted languag e, the phrase \"reduced by\" is recorded as adjustment to the appropriation line and not separately shown on a reduction (i.e., rescission) line.

WHAT IS THE HIERACHY OF APPLYING MULTIPLE REDUCTIONS TO A TREASURY APPROPRIATION FUND SYMBOL INCLUDED IN AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT AND A SEQUESTRATION ORDER? If more than one discretionary reduction applies to the amount newly appropriated for your Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol (TAFS) included in an enacted appropriations act, apply the reductions in the following sequence: (1) account -specific reduction, (2) agency -wide reduction, (3) appropriations act -wide reduction, and (4) government -wide reduction. For example, if a TAFS has an account -specific rescission of $5M against new budget authority of $400M and $3M against unobligated balances of prior -year appropriations, only subtract the $5M from the $400M and then apply the next reduction to BA of $395M. If a sequestration order that cancels discretionary budgetary resources is i ssued, the sequestration reductions will apply to a TAFS after the account -specific reduction and across-the -board reductions required by the enacted appropriation act have been calculated. (See section 100.3 for more information on sequestration of discretionary resources.) APPENDIX F \u2014FORMAT OF SF 132, SF 133 , SCHEDULE P, AND SBR OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 69 of Appendix F 15. WHEN AND HOW DO I RECORD AN ADJUSTMENT OF AN UNOBLIGATED OR OBLIGATED BALANCE START OF YEAR? If you have discovered an error in the budgetary reporting for a previous fiscal year, you will be required to record the correction (e.g ., adjustment to unobligated balance brought forward, Oct 1) in the current fiscal year as an adjustment to the data for the previous fiscal year, even though the action taken to correct the data occurs in the current year. This is because budgetary transactions must be booked against the fiscal year in which they were incurred so that they can be reconciled to the legal period of availability of the appropriations available at the time. Where necessary, Treasury will backdate the correction to the appropr iate fiscal year, to prevent recording prior fiscal activity as current fiscal year activity. This is accomplished by filing a backdated Treasury document (Statement of Transactions, non -expenditure transfer, or warrant), which shows both the date the cor rection is requested and a prior -year adjustment attribute to backdate the change to the correct period. If a backdated Treasury document must be processed, you are required to submit a request in the exercise (located at https://community.max.gov/x/6YLrHQ ) and identify the appropriate information such as an explanation of why the error happened, affected Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol, the amount of the adjustment in actual dollars, an action plan, and agency contact information. Once you have submitted your request in the exercise and your backdated document to Treasury's Budget Reports Division, you may monitor the status of your request via the exercise. For a backdated Treasury document to be app roved and processed, both Treasury and OMB must provide their concurrence. Correcting an unobligated or obligated balance is done to reflect the amounts that were actually obligated in a previous fiscal year. Such corrections have no effect on violations of the Antideficiency Act (ADA) or any other applicable laws. See section 145 for more information on ADA violations. If an error relates to... And a transaction impacts. . . Where it is determined that there is...

HOW CAN I DETERMINE WHETHER A TRANSACTION SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A RECOVERY? Recoveries can pertain to both paid and unpaid obligations. In general, the basis for determining whether a transaction should be classified as a recovery depends on the specific event and the fiscal year of adjustment. Based on these factors, the table below identifies where it is appropriate to classify a transaction as a recovery of either an unpaid obligation or a paid obligation for a Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbol (TAFS). For further information on recording adjustments as \"Recoverie s of prior year unpaid obligations\" (line 1021), \"Recoveries of prior year paid obligations\" (line or incurred\" (line 2001, 2002, 2003, 2101, 2102, or 2103) in either an unexpired or expired TAFS, refer to Treasury's Bureau of Fiscal Service USSGL accounting transactions at http://www.fms.treas.gov/ussgl.

For errors or mistakes pertaining to a prior year adjustment of a TAFS (i.e., annual, multi-year or no -year Treasury account), you must use a GTAS \"Prior Year Adjustment\" attribute (see section 15 of this Appendix). If you have any questions, please consult your OMB representative. 17. WHAT REPORTING GUIDANCE MUST I COMPLY WITH FOR DISASTER EMERGENCY FUNDING ? OMB Memorandum M -18-08 provides guidance on disaster and emergency funding tracking. Reporting requirements and affected Treasury accounts were specifically identified for the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirement s, 2017 (P.L. 115- 56), the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2017 (P .L. 115- 72), and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115- 123). OMB will assign the GTAS attribute Disaster Emergency Fund Code domain value for each enacted appropriations with disaster or emergency funding. For example, agencies should report funding provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) with the GTAS Disaster Emergency Fund Code as \"C\" and the domain value title as \"Emergency P.L. 115 -123.\" Going forward, to keep the Federal budget and financial communities aware of newly enacted legislation impacting agencies' disaster and emergency reporting requirements, OMB launched a Disaster Emergency Funding Tracking Dashboard MAX budget community page ( https://community.max.gov/x/cYW9V ) that will be used to disseminate information to agencies on future appropriations as disaster reli ef or as emergency requirements are identified. OMB will also identify the affected Treasury accounts in P.L. 115 - 123 and future appropriations on this community page. The dashboard also includes a link for SF 133s published by public law (for appropriat ions designated as disaster or emergency) and a list of impacted TAFSs. APPENDIX F \u2014FORMAT OF SF 132, SF 133 , SCHEDULE P, AND SBR OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 73 of Appendix F 18. HOW ARE ADJUSTMENTS TO BUDGETARY RESOURCES FOR INDEFINITE APPROPRIATIONS DERIVED FROM THE GENERAL FUND OF THE US TREASURY RECORDED ? For situations where indefinite appropriations derived from the General Fund of the US Treasury are provided in annual and multi -year Treasury Appropriation Fund Symbols (TAFSs), these TAFSs may require additional budget authority in a subsequent fiscal year for upward adjustments of pri or year obligations incurred during the unexpired phase. Once additional budgetary resources are requested, show the increase on line 10 40. For unexpired annual, multi -year, and no -year TAFSs, any recoveries of prior year unpaid and paid obligations (lines 1021 and 1033) should be returned to the General Fund of the US Treasury and the same amount with the opposite sign must be shown on line 1037 no later than the end of the fiscal year. For expired annual and multi -year TAFSs, the sum of recoveries of prior year unpaid and paid obligations (lines 1021 and 1033) and adjustments to indefinite prior year appropriations in subsequent fiscal year (line 1040) minus any upward adjustments of pri or year unpaid obligations (line 2180) should be returned to the General Fund of the US Treasury and shown on line 1037 no later than the end of the fiscal year.

HOW CAN I DETERMINE WHETHER BUDGET AUTHORITY SHOULD BE CLASSFIED AS DIRECT OR REIMBURSABLE? Appropriations (derived from the general fund of the U .S. Treasury, special fund receipts, trust fund non - revolving receipts), borrowing authority and contract authority are classified as direct in all fund types. This classification includes nonexpenditure transfers and adjustments to all three types of budget authority. Any obligations recorded against these types of budget authority would have the s ame classification. For spending authority from offsetting collections, all fund types may record amounts classified as reimbursable. For spending authority from offsetting collections classified as direct, the chart below clarifies the fund types that may record them as direct . Any obligations recorded against the spending APPENDIX F \u2014FORMAT OF SF 132, SF 133, SCHEDULE P AND SBR Page 74 of Appendix F OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) authority from offsetting collections would have the same classification. Refer to section 83.5 for details on the variety of offsetting collections.

The intent of the Congress was to modernize the language of the Act, without changing its meaning. This appendix presents a crosswalk between the provisions of law that made up the Antideficiency Act before it was modernized and the current language. The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Pub. L. 116- 1; 31 U.S.C. 1341 no te) amended section 1341 of Title 31 to provide for payment to Federal employees furloughed as a result of a covered lapse in appropriations. THE ANTIDEFICIENCY ACT TITLE 31 \u2014MONEY AND FINANCE The following contains the provisions of the Antideficiency Act, formerly section 3679 of the Revised Statutes, and section 210 of the General Government Matters Appropriation Act, 1958. (Formerly 31 U.S.C. 665, 665a, and 669.) The following provides the section in Title 31 that was enacted without substantive cha nge 665 Appropriation (a) Expenditures or contract obligations in excess of funds prohibited No officer or employee of the United States shall make or authorize any expenditure from or create or authorize an obligation under any appropriation or fu nd in excess of the amount available therein: nor shall any such officer or employee involve the Government in any contract or other obligation, or the payment of money for any purpose, in advance of appropriations made for such purpose, unless such contra ct or obligation is authorized by law. Section 1341: Limitations on expending and obligating amounts (a) (1) Except as specified in this subchapter or any other provision of law, an officer or employee of the United States Government or the District of Columbia government may not \u2014 ( A) make or authorize an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund for the expenditure or obligation; (B) involve either government in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made unless authorized by law; (C) make or authorize an expenditure or obligation of funds required to be sequestered under section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985; or (D) involve either government in a contract or obligation for the payment of money required to be sequestered under section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergen cy Deficit Control Act of 1985 . (2) This subsection does not apply to a corporation getting amounts to make loans (except paid in APPENDIX G \u2014CROSSWALK BETWEEN ANTIDEFICIENCY ACT AND TITLE 31 Page 2 of Appendix G OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) capital amounts) without legal liability of the United States government. (b) Voluntary service forbidden No officer or employee of the United States shall accept voluntary service for the United States or employ personal service in excess of that authorized by law, except in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of prop erty. Section 1342: Limitation on voluntary services An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the District of Columbia government may not accept voluntary services for either government or employ personal services exceeding that author ized by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. This section does not apply to a corporation getting amounts to make loans (except paid in capital amounts) without legal liability of the United States G overnment. As used in this section, the term \"emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property\" does not include ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property. (c) Apportionment of appropriations; reserves; distribution; review (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all appropriations or funds available for obligation for a definite period of time shall be so apportioned as to prevent obligation or expenditure thereof in a manner which would indicate a necessity for deficiency or supplemental appropriations for such period; and all appropriations or funds not limited to a definite period of time, and all author izations to create obligations by contract in advance of appropriations, shall be so apportioned as to achieve the most effective and economical use thereof. Section 1512: Apportionment and reserves (a) Except as provided in this subchapter, an appropriation available for obligation for a definite period shall be apportioned to prevent obligation or expenditure at a rate that would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation for the period. An appropriation for an indefinite period and authority to make obligations by contract before appropriations shall be apportioned to achieve the most effective and economical use. An apportionment may be reapportioned under this section.

Reserves established pursuant to this subsection shall be reported to the Congress in accordance with the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (31 U.S.C. 1400 et seq. ). Section 1512(c): (2) A reserve established under this subsection may be changed as necessary to carry out the scope and objectives of the appropriation concerned. When an official designated in section 1513 of this title to make apportionments decides that an amount reserved will not be required to carry out the objectives and scope of the appropriation concerned, the official shall recommend the rescission of the amount in the way provided in chapter 11 of this title for appropriation requests. Reserves established under this section shall be reported to Co ngress as provided in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 ( 2 U.S.C. 681 e t seq. ).

Except as otherwise specified by the officer making the apportionment, amounts so apportioned shall remain available for obligation, in accordance with the terms of the appropriation, on a cumulative basis unless reapportioned. Section 1512(b): (1) An appropriation subject to apportionment is apportioned by \u2014 (A) months, calendar quarters, operating seasons, or other time periods; (B) activities, functions, projects, or objects; or (C) a combination of the ways referred to in clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph.

APPENDIX H \u2014CHECKLIST FOR FUNDS CONTROL REGULATIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Appendix H APPENDIX H\u2014CHECKLIST FOR FUNDS CONTROL REGULATIONS You must include the following items in the funds control regulations you submit to OMB for approval: 1. Statement of purpose. At a minimum, your regulations should state broadly that their purpose is to prescribe procedures to follow in budget execution and specify basic funds control principles and concepts. Your regulations should state that they: Establish policy with rega rd to the administrative control of funds. Prescribe a system for positive administrative control of funds designed to restrict obligations and expenditures (disbursements) to the amount available in each appropriation or fund account. Restrict both obligations and expenditures from each appropriation or fund account to the lower of the amount of apportionments made by OMB or the amount available for obligation and/or expenditure in the appropriation or fund account. Enable the head of your agency to identify the person responsible for any obligation or expenditure exceeding the amount available in the appropriation or fund account, the OMB apportionment or reapportionment, the allotment or suballotments made by the agency, any statutory limitations, and any other administrative subdivision of funds made by the agency. Provide procedures for dealing with violations of the Antideficiency Act as well as violations of other administrative subdivision of funds that are not violations of the Antideficiency Act , per se . 2. Authority. At a minimum, you should list the following authorities in the regulations: Money and Finance. 31 U.S.C. : Sections -1351, 1511 Sections 1101, 1104- 1108, 3324 (part of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, as amended). Sections 1501- 1502 (part of section 1311 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1950). Sections 1112, 1531, 3511 -3512, 3524 (part of the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950). Title X of Pub . L. 93 -344, found at 2 U.S.C. 681 -688. Part 4 of OMB Circular No. A- 11, \"Instructions on Budget Execution,\" and related OMB guidelines. Other pertinent laws governing your agency's funds and appropriate agency internal regulations, if any. 3. Scope. The regulations should state that all organizations, appropriations, and funds are subject to the provisions contained in them. If you want to make any exemptions, OMB must first approve them. Clearly identify all approved exemptions in the regulations. APPENDIX H \u2014CHECKLIST FOR FUNDS CONTROL REGULATIONS Page 2 of Appendix H OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) 4. Definitions, terminology, and concepts. Your regulations should have a section that specifies that the definitions, terminology, and concepts in OMB Circular No. A -11 apply. You may restrict this to terms that are peculiar to, or have special meaning within your agency, except that you should include the identical definition of the following terms found in OMB Circular No. A -11: apportionment, allotment s, suballotment s, allowances, and allocations. Apportionment means a distribution made by OMB of amounts available for obligation in an appropriation or fund account into amounts available for specified time periods, program, activities, projects, objects, or any combination of these. The apportioned amount limits the obligations that may be incurred. An apportionment may be further subdivided by an agency into allotments, suballotments, and allocations. Allotments are subdivisions of apportionments that are made by the heads of agencies. Suballotments are subdivisions of allotments. Allowances and allocations are subdivisions of suballotments. In some cases, OMB has approved agency funds control regulations that use terms different from the ones defined above but with the equivalent meaning of those definitions. In these cases, continue to follow the OMB approved regulations. Your regulation must specify that violations of allotments and suballotments are violations of the Antideficiency Act. If the agency chooses to and OMB approves, the agency may make allowances and allocations also subject to the Antideficiency Act. In thi s case, the agency must clearly state in its fund s control regulations that obligations and expenditures that exceed allowances and allocations are violations of the Antideficiency Act. To the extent that OMB Circular No. A -11 or Treasury regulations do not provide a definition for a technical term; this section should include a definition for the term that your agency is proposing to use in the regulations. 5. Responsibility and functions of individuals. Your agency regulations should describe those individuals within the agency charged with funds control responsibilities by title or position. At a minimum, they should: List the positions and describe the funds control responsibilities of each. Explain each position' s responsibilities with regard to investigating, reporting, and following up on Antideficiency Act violations, as well as violations of agency limitations that are not violations of the Antideficiency Act. 6. Actions prohibited. At a minimum, include th e following: Violations of the Antideficiency Act. List all the basic actions prohibited by sections 1341, 1342, and 1517(a) of Title 31, U.S. Code (part of the Antideficiency Act), as they are interpreted and applied within your agency. Violations of limitations that do not per se violate the Antideficiency Act. List and briefly describe all your agency's imposed restrictions, including a statement describing the conditions under which violations of these restrictions also violate the Antideficiency Act. APPENDIX H \u2014CHECKLIST FOR FUNDS CONTROL REGULATIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Appendix H 7. Penalties. A. Administrative penalties. The law provides that any officer or employee of the United States who violates the prohibitions of 31 U.S.C. 1341(a), 31 U.S.C. 1342, or 31 U.S.C. 1517(a) w ill be subject to appropriate administrative discipline. Administrative discipline may consist of: Letter of reprimand or censure for the official personnel record of the officer or employee. Unsatisfactory performance rating. Transfer to another position. Suspension from duty without pay. Removal from office. B. Criminal penalties . In addition, t he law provides that any officer or employee of the United States who knowingly and willfully violates the prohibitions shall be fined not more than $5,000, imprisoned for not more than two years, or both. Desc ribe all criminal penalties for violations of the Antideficiency Act, as well as any additional disciplinary measures your agency imposes. In addition, describe penalties for violations of agency limitations and requirements that your agency does not consider subject to provisions of the Antideficiency Act. 8. Reporting violations. At a minimum, your regulations should prescribe procedures for reporting apparent violations to responsible agency officials , the President, the Congress, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) . All violations must be reported immediately upon discovery. Antideficiency Act violations must be reported by letter to the President, through OMB, signed by the head of the agency, and by letter to the Congress and GAO. Any individual who knows of a possible Antideficiency Act violation must report it. Specify who should be notified in your regulations. Even though you take subsequent actions to correct the cause of a violation, it does not eliminate that violation, and you must still report it. 9. Accounting support for funds control systems. Your regulations must specify that the agency accounting system must fully support agency funds control systems. The accounting systems should provide for: Recording all financia l transactions affecting: apportionments; reapportionments; allotments suballotments ; restrictions; financial plans; program operating plans; obligations and expenditures; as well as anticipated, earned, and collected reimbursements. Preparing and reconciling financial reports that display cumulative obligations, and the remaining unobligated balance by appropriation and allotment, and cumulative obligations by budget activity and object class. 10. Apportionment procedures. Normally, you describ e agency procedures for requesting apportionment of funds in other directives or manuals. However, you should include the following as part of the funds control regulations: Briefly describe your agency's procedures for requesting the apportionment of funds. List position(s) and organizations responsible for making the request. APPENDIX H \u2014CHECKLIST FOR FUNDS CONTROL REGULATIONS Page 4 of Appendix H OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Cite the basic internal agency directives covering the apportionment of funds. At your option, you may include general guidance covering apportionment action in connection with the following: Supplementals. Reprogramming. Transfer between accounts. Discuss agency administrative control of funds policies that apply specifically to revolving funds, management funds, and trust funds, including those that are not apportioned. If any of these funds are not subject to the basic provisions of these regulations (see above), describe the procedures used to control them in a separate section. 11. Policy on allotments and suballotments. Include the general policy that allotments and suballotments (or those equivalent terms as specifically defined by your agency in your OMB -approved funds control regulations ) will be established at the highest practical level, and each operating unit will be financed from no more than one subdivision for each appropriation or fund (the Antideficiency Act establishes these objectives). Specify the criteria for changing the allotment structure, and identify who has authority to approve such changes. Emphasize that allotments and suballotments are subject t o the provisions of the Antideficiency Act. Include the following in the section on allotments and suballotments: Function and purpose of allotments and suballotments. Restrictions: The sum of allotment amounts issued will not exceed the apportionment. The sum of suballotment amounts issued will not exceed the allotment amount. The amounts of allotments or other administrative subdivisions will be fixed and will be changed only when authorized by the authority who initially issued the subdivision. Congressional restrictions contained in appropriation acts will be enforced. Other restrictions which your agency may want with respect to administrative subdivisions. Use this Circular as a guide. However, you may establish more stringent requirements for the allotment of anticipated budgetary resources. Allotment procedures: Make allotments and suballotments using formal documents. Identify the officers authorized to issue allotments and suballotments as well as the officers and employees authorized to reduce them. At a minimum, document the following: A. Amount available. B. Funding source (for example, appropriations, reimbursements). APPENDIX H \u2014CHECKLIST FOR FUNDS CONTROL REGULATIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 5 of Appendix H C. Time period of availability. D. The position title of the official responsible and other agency limitations. E. Justification for changes in allotments. (In some cases, changes in allotments will create the need for a reapportionment, which requires OMB approval.) 12. Treatment of anticipated budgetary resources already enacted into law. Your agency 's funds control regulations should state that apportionments may include estimated amounts of \" anticipated \" budgetary resources that are the result of laws already enacted . This is done to reduce routine reapportionments of such amounts as they actually become a vailable. These are presented on the apportionment and SF 133 on the following lines: Anticipated increases (+) in budget authority (including anticipated transfers of new budget authority) into the account and anticipated decreases in budget authority (-) from the account; lines 1151 , transfers of unobligated balances into the account (+) and out of the account ( -); line 1040 Anticipated collections, reimbursements, and other income (+); lines 1740 or 1840 Anticipated expenditure transfers from into the account (+); lines 1740 or 1840 Anticipated recoveries of prior year unpaid obligations (+); line 1041 and Anticipated or 1842 You may choose not to allot a mounts anticipated to increase (+) the total budgetary resources, even though the amount has been apportioned, until the increase actually occurs. Alternatively, you may choose to allot a mounts anticipated to increase the total budgetary resources before the increase actually occurs. If you choose this alternative, then the funds control regulations must require that all officials or employees who receive allotments of anticipated increases in budgetary resources should maintain constant and careful oversight to ensure that these amounts materialize before they incur obligations or expenditures against this type of allotment. The regulations must also require that if actual amounts are less than anticipated, the agency will make appropriate funding adjustments and take other appropriate actions including requesting a reapportionment. The a nticipated decreases (- ) under current law do not become a part of the amount of total budgetary resources available to be apportioned . Since the OMB apportionment will not include these amounts, these amounts must not be allotted. 1 3. Deficiency apportionments. At a minimum, the regulations should state: Apportionments that anticipate the need for a deficiency appropriation or a su pplemental under 31 U.S.C. 1515 wi ll be specifically identified on the apportionment request. To qualify as a deficiency apportionment, the request must be required by: Laws enacted subsequent to the transmittal of the annual Budget for the year to the Congress; APPENDIX H \u2014CHECKLIST FOR FUNDS CONTROL REGULATIONS Page 6 of Appendix H OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Emergencies involving human life, the protection of property, or the immediate welfare of individuals; or Specific authorization by law. When OMB approves a deficiency apportionment and transmits it to the Congress, OMB is merely notifying the Congress that funds appropriated to date are being obligated at a more rapid rate than previously anticipated. This notification does not guarantee that the Congress will approve any part of any associated supplemental requests and does not authorize the use of any amounts not yet provided by the Congress . APPENDIX J \u2014PRINCIPLES OF BUDGETING FOR CAPITAL ASSET ACQUISTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Appendix J APPENDIX J\u2014PRINCIPLE S OF BUDGETING FOR CAPITAL ASSET ACQUISITIONS Introduction and Summary The Administration plans to use the following principles in budgeting for capital asset acquisitions. These principles address planning, costs and benefits, financing, and risk management requirements that should be satisfied before a proposal for the acquisition of capital assets can be included in the Administration's budget. A Glossary describes key terms. OMB has also published the Capital Programming Guide , a supplement to this Circular. The Guide is a basic reference on principles and techniques for planning, budgeting, acquisition, and management of capital assets. Agencies should consult the Guide when preparing their capital plans and developing their budget requests from their capital plans. The principles are organized in the following four sections: A. Planning . This section focuses on the need to ensure that capital assets support core/priority missions of the agency; the assets have demonstrated a projected return on investment that is clearly equal to or better than alternative uses of available public resources; the risk associated with the assets is understood and managed at all stages; and the acquisition is implemented in phased, successive segments, unless it can be demonstrated there are significant economies of scale at acceptable risk from funding more than one segment or there are multiple units that need to be acquired at the same time. B. Costs and Benefits . This section emphasizes that the asset should be justified primarily by benefit -cost analysis, including life -cycle costs; that all costs are understood in advance; and that cost, schedule, and performance goals are identified that can be measured using an earned value management system. C. Principles of Financing . This section stresses that useful segments are to be fully funded with regular appropriations; that as a general rule, planning segments should be financed separately from procurement of the asset; and that agencies are encouraged to aggregate assets in capital acquisition accounts and take other steps to accommodate lumpiness or \"spikes\" in funding for justified acquisitions. D. Risk Management . This section is to help ensure that risk is analyzed and managed carefully in the acquisition of the asset. Strategies can include separate accounts for capital asset acquisitions, the use of apportionment to encourage sound management, and the selection of efficient types of contracts and pricing mechanisms in order to allocate risk appropriately between the contractor and the Government. In addition, cost, schedule, and performance goals are to be controlled and monitored by using an earned value management system; and if progress toward these goals is not met, there is a formal review process to evaluate whether the acquisition should continue or be terminated. As defined here, capital assets are generally land, structures, equipment, and intellectual property (including software) that are used by the Federal Government, including weapon systems. Not included are grants to States or others for their acquisition of capital assets. A complete definition is provided in Appendix 1 of the Capital Programming Guide . APPENDIX J \u2014PRINCIPLES OF BUDGETING FOR CAPITAL ASSET ACQUISTIONS Page 2 of Appendix J OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) A. Planning Investments in major capital assets proposed for funding in the Administration's budget should: 1. Support core/priority mission functions that need to be performed by the Federal Government; 2. Be undertaken by the requesting agency because no alternative private sector or governmental source can support the function more efficiently; 3. Support work processes that have been simplified or otherwise redesigned to reduce costs, improve effectiveness, and make maximum use of commercial, off -the-shelf technology; 4. Demonstrate a projected return on the investment that is clearly equal to or better than alternative uses of available public resources. Return may include: improved mission performance in accordance with measures developed pursuant to the Government P erformance and Results Act (GPRA) Moder nization Act of 2010; reduced cost; increased quality, speed, or flexibility; and increased customer and employee satisfaction. Return should be adjusted for such risk factors as the investment's technical complexity, the agency's management capacity, the likelihood of cost overruns, and the consequences of under - or non-performance; 5. Information technology investments ensure that security is incorporated and funded in the life - cycle planning of the system. OMB Circular A- 130: M anaging Federal Information as a Strategic Resource (July 2016) provides additional detail; 6. R educe risk by: avoiding or isolati ng custom -designed components to minimize the potential adverse consequences on the overall investment; using fully tested pilots, simulations, or prototype implementations when necessary before going to production; establishing clear measures and accountability for investment progress; and securing substantial involvement and buy -in throughout the investment from the program officials who will use the system; 7. Be implemented in phased, successive segments as narrow in scope and brief in duration as practi cable, each of which solves a specific part of an overall mission problem and delivers a measurable net benefit independent of future segments, unless it can be demonstrated that there are significant economies of scale at acceptable risk from funding more than one segment or there are multiple units that need to be acquired at the same time; and 8. Employ an acquisition strategy that appropriately allocates risk between the Government and the contractor, effectively uses competition, ties contract payments to accomplishments, and takes maximum advantage of commercial technology. Prototypes require the same justification as other capital assets. As a general presumption, OMB will recommend new or continued funding only for those capital asset investments that satisfy these criteria. Funding for those investments will be recommended on a phased basis by segment, unless it can be demonstrated that there are significant economies of scale at acceptable risk from funding more than one segment or there are multiple units that need to be acquired at the same time. OMB recognizes that many agencies are in the middle of ongoing investments, and they may not be able immediately to satisfy the criteria. For those investments that do not satisfy the criteria, OMB will consider APPENDIX J \u2014PRINCIPLES OF BUDGETING FOR CAPITAL ASSET ACQUISTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 3 of Appendix J requests to use current year and budget year funds to finance additional planning, as necessary, to support the establishment of realistic cost, schedule, and performance goals for the completion of the investment. This planning could include: the redesign of work processes, the evaluation of alternative solutions, the development of inform ation system architectures, and if necessary, the purchase and evaluation of prototypes. Realistic goals are necessary for agency portfolio analysis to determine the viability of the investment, to provide the basis for fully funding the investment to completion, and to set the baseline for management accountability to deliver the investment within goals. Because OMB considers this information essential to agencies' long -term success, OMB will use this information both in preparing the Administration's budget and, in conjunction with cost, schedule, and performance data, as apportionments are made. Agencies are encouraged to work with their OMB representative to arrive at a mutually satisfactory process, format, and timetable for prov iding the requested information. B. Costs and b enefits The justification of the investment should evaluate and discuss the extent to which the investment meets the above criteria and should also include: An analysis of the investment's total life-cycl e costs and benefits, including the total budget authority required for the asset, consistent with policies described in OMB Circular A -94: Guideli nes and Discount Rates for Benefit -Cost Analysis of Federal Programs (October 1992); An analysis of the risk of the investment including how risks will be isolated, minimized, monitored, and controlled, and for major programs, an evaluation and estimate by the Chief Financial Officer of the probability of achieving the proposed cost goals; If after the planning phase, the procurement is proposed for funding in segments, an analysis showing that the proposed segment is economically and programmatically j ustified, that it is programmatically useful if no further investments are funded, and in this application its benefits exceed its costs; and Cost, schedule, and performance goals for the investment (or the planning segment or useful asset being proposed) that can be measured throughout the acquisition process using a perfo rmance- based management system ( e.g., earned v alue m anagement ). C. Principles of financing Principle 1: Full funding Budget authority sufficient to complete a useful segment of a capital project ( or investment) (or the entire capital project, if it is not divisible into useful segments) must be appropriated before any obligations for the useful segment ( or project or investment) may be incurred. Explanation : Good budgeting requires that appropriations for the full costs of asset acquisition be enacted in advance to help ensure that all costs and benefits are fully taken into account at the time decisions are made to provide resources. Full funding with regular appropriations in the budget year also leads to tradeoffs within the budget year with spending for other capital assets and with spending for purposes other than capital assets. Full funding increases the opportunity to use performance-based fixed price contracts, APPENDIX J \u2014PRINCIPLES OF BUDGETING FOR CAP ITAL ASSET ACQUISTIONS Page 4 of Appendix J OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) allows for more efficient work planning and management of the capital project (or investment), and increases the accountability for the achievement of the baseline goals. When full funding is not followed and capital projects (or investments) or useful segments are funded in increments, without certainty if or when future funding will be available, the result is sometimes poor planning, acquisition of assets not fully justified, higher acquisition costs, cancellation of major investments, the loss of sunk costs, or inadequate funding to maintain and operate the assets. Principle 2: Regular a ppropriations Regular appropriations for the full funding of a capital project (or investment) or a useful segment of a capital project in the budget year are preferred. If this results in spikes that, in the judgment of OMB, cannot be accommodated by the agency or the Congress, see Principle 4 below. Explanation : Principle 1 (Full funding) is met as long as appropriations provide budget authority sufficient to complete the capital project or useful segment or investment. Full funding in the budget year with regular appropriations alone is preferred because it leads to tradeoffs within the budget y ear with spending for other capital assets and with spending for purposes other than capital assets. In contrast, full funding for a capital project (investment) over several years with regular appropriations for the first year and advance appropriations for subsequent years may bias tradeoffs in the budget year in favor of the proposed asset because with advance appropriations the full cost of the asset is not included in the budget year. Advance appropriations, because they are scored in the year they b ecome available for obligation, may constrain the budget authority and outlays available for regular appropriations of that year. Principle 3: Separate funding of planning segments As a general rule, planning segments of a capital project ( or investmen t) should be financed separately from the procurement of a useful asset. Explanation : The agency must have information that allows it to plan the capital project (investment), develop the design, and assess the benefits, costs, and risks before proceedin g to procurement of the useful asset. This is especially important for high risk acquisitions. This information comes from activities, or planning segments, that include but are not limited to market research of available solutions, architectural drawings , geological studies, engineering and design studies, and prototypes. The construction of a prototype that is a capital asset, because of its cost and risk, should be justified and planned as carefully as the investment itself. The process of gathering i nformation for a capital project (investment) may consist of one or more planning segments, depending on the nature of the asset. Funding these segments separately will help ensure that the necessary information is available to establish cost, schedule, and performance goals before proceeding to procurement. If budget authority for planning segments and procurement of the useful asset are enacted together, OMB may wish to apportion budget authority for one or several planning segments separately from procurement of the useful asset. Principle 4: Accommodation of l umpiness or \" spikes\" and s eparate capital acquisition a ccounts To accommodate lumpiness or \"spikes\" in funding justified capital acquisitions, agencies, working with OMB, are encouraged to ag gregate financing for capital asset acquisitions in one or several separate capital APPENDIX J \u2014PRINCIPLES OF BUDGETING FOR CAPITAL ASSET ACQUISTIONS OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Appendix J acquisition budget accounts within the agency, to the extent possible within the agency's total budget request. Explanation : Large, temporary, year -to-year increases in bu dget authority, sometimes called lumps or spikes, may create a bias against the acquisition of justified capital assets. Agencies, working with OMB, should seek ways to avoid this bias and accommodate such spikes for justified acquisitions. Aggregation of capital acquisitions in separate accounts may: Reduce spikes within an agency or bureau by providing roughly the same level of spending for acquisitions each year; Help to identify the source of spikes and to explain them. Capital acquisitions are m ore lumpy than operating expenses; and with a capital acquisition account, it can be seen that an increase in operating expenses is not being hidden and attributed to one -time asset purchases; Reduce the pressure for capital spikes to crowd out operating expenses; and Improve justification and make proposals easier to evaluate, since capital acquisitions are generally analyzed in a different manner than operating expenses (e.g., capital acquisitions have a longer time horizon of benefits and life -cycle costs). D. Risk m anagement Risk management should be central to the planning, budgeting, and acquisition process. Failure to analyze and manage the inherent risk in all capital asset acquisitions may contribute to cost overruns, schedule shortfalls, and acquisitions that fail to perform as expected. For each major capital project (investment), a risk analysis that includes how risks will be isolated, minimized, monitored, and controlled may help prevent these problems. The investment cost, schedule, and performance goals established through the planning phase of the investment are the basis for approval to procure the asset and the basis for assessing risk. During the procurement phase, performance-based management systems (earned value or similar system) must be used to provide contractor and Government management visibility on the achievement of, or deviation from, goals until the asset is accepted and operational. If goals are not being met, performance-based management systems allow for early id entification of problems, potential corrective actions, and changes to the original goals needed to complete the investment and necessary for agency portfolio analysis decisions. These systems also allow for Administration decisions to recommend meaningful modifications for increased funding to the Congress, or termination of the investment, based on its revised expected return on investment in comparison to alternative uses of the funds. Agencies must ensure that the necessary acquisition strategies are i mplemented to reduce the risk of cost escalation and the risk of failure to achieve schedule and performance goals. These strategies may include: Having budgetary resources appropriated in separate capital asset acquisition accounts; Apportioning budget authority for a useful segment; Establishing thresholds for cost, schedule, and performance goals of the acquisition, including return on investment, which if not met may result in cancellation of the acquisition; APPENDIX J \u2014PRINCIPLES OF BUDGETING FOR CAP ITAL ASSET ACQUISTIONS Page 6 of Appendix J OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Selecting types of contracts and pr icing mechanisms that are efficient and that provide incentives to contractors in order to allocate risk appropriately between the contractor and the Government; Monitoring cost, schedule, and performance goals for the investment (or the planning segment or useful asset being proposed) using a performance -based management system (e.g., earned v alue management system); and If progress is not within 90 percent of goals, or if new information is available that would indicate a greater return on investment f rom alternative uses of funds, instituting senior management review of the investment through portfolio analysis to determine the continued viability of the investment with modifications, or the termination of the investment, and the start of exploration f or alternative solutions if it is necessary to fill a gap in agency strategic goals and objectives. Glossary Appropriations, regular annual or advance , provide budget authority that permits Government officials to incur obligations that result in immediate or future outlays of Government funds. Regular annual appropriations are: Enacted normally in the current year; Scored entirely in the budget year; and Available for obligation in the budget year and subsequent years if specified in the language (see \" Availability,\" below) . Advance appropriations may be accompanied by regular annual appropriations to provide funds available for obligation in the budget year as well as subsequent years. Advance appropriations are: Enacted normally in the current year; Scored after the budget year (e.g., in each of one, two, or more later years, depending on the language); and Available for obligation in the year scored and subsequent year s if specified in the language (see \" Availability,\" below ). Availability refers to the period during which appropriations may be legally obligated. Appropriations made in appropriations acts are available for obligation only in the budget year, unless the language specifies that an appropriation is available for a longer period. If the language specifies that the funds are to remain available until the end of a certain year beyond the budget year, the availability is said to be \"multi-year.\" If the language specifies that the funds are to remain available until expended, the availability is said to be \"no -year.\" Appropriations for major procurements and construction projects are typically made available for multiple years or until expended.

No. A -11 (2023) Page 1 of Capital Programming Guide INTRODUCTION The Guide 's Purpose The Capital Programming Guide was originally released in 1997 and this release, Version 3.0, is part of a continuing effort to more routinely update the Guide to remain consistent with new requirements and leading practices. This version reflects developments in capital planning since the publication of the original guide and provides updated best practices and lessons learned regarding more efficient project and acquisition management of capital assets. This guide does not establish new or alter existing policies articulated elsewhere (e.g. in OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission and Execution of the Budget, or other OMB circulars). It does, however, expand the explanation of the concepts in the original guide that were not fully developed. An inter -agency Capital Programming Guide Working Group, consisting of various agency representatives, was convened to author updates and identify examples for the revision. Their invaluable additions, editing, and hard work are commended. Agencies must have a disciplined capital programming process that addresses project prioritization between new assets and maintenance of existing assets, risk management and cost estimating to improve the accuracy of cost, schedule and per formance provided to management, and the other difficult challenges proposed by asset management and acquisition. The purpose of the Capital Programming Guide, herein referred to as the Guide, is to provide professionals in the Federal Government guidance for a disciplined capital programming process, as well as techniques for planning and budgeting, acquisition, and management and disposition of capital assets. At the same time, agencies are provided flexibility in how they implement the key principles a nd concepts discussed. We expect the Guide to be revised as agencies continue to gain experience and develop improved best practices. The Guide is intended to assist Federal Departments, Agencies and Administrations (herein collectively referred to as ag encies) in effectively plan ning, procur ing and us ing these assets to achieve the maximum return on investment. The guidance integrates the various Administration and statutory asset management initiatives (including the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act (Pub. L. No. 111-352), Divisions D and E of Pub. L. No. 104 -106 (the Federal Acquisition Reform Act and the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996, as amended, popularly known as the Clinger - Cohen Act) , and other s) into a single, integrated capital programming process to ensure that capital assets successfully contribute to the achievement of agency strategic goals and objectives. Agencies should use this Guide to help establish a capital programming process within each component and across the organization. Effective capital programming uses long range planning and a disciplined, integrated budget process as the basis for managing a portfolio of capital assets to achieve performance goals with the lowest life -cycle costs and least risk. This process should provide agency management with accurate information on acquisition and life -cycle costs, schedules, and performance of current and proposed capital assets. Without the knowledge of the risks involved, managers at all levels\u2014agency, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congress \u2014cannot make the best decisions for the allocation of resources among the competing investments. Managing the stock of Federal capital assets and planning, budgeting, and acquiring assets is hard work, and it takes time and adequately trained personnel to do it successfully. Large sums of taxpayer funds are involved and the performance of the assets determines, to a large extent, how well the agencies are able to achieve their missions and provide service to the public. Agencies have flexibility in how they implement the key principles and concepts of the Guide. They are expected to comply with existing statutes and guidance (cited in the text where appropriate) for pl anning and funding new assets; achieving cost, schedule, and performance goals; and managing the operation of INTRODUCTION CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 2 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) assets to achieve the asset' s performance and life- cycle cost goals. However, the key principles and importance of thorough planning, risk management, full funding, portfolio analysis, performance -based acquisition management, accountability for achieving the established goals, and cost -effective lifecycle management will not change. In general, OMB will only consider recommending for funding in the President 's Budget priority capital asset investments that comply with good capital programming principles. This Guide does not discuss the entire strategic planning process, only that portion that pertains to the contribution of capital assets. At ea c h stage in the preparation of the Agency Capital Plan, the agency is encouraged to work with OMB 's Resource Management Offices (RMOs). Early inclusion of RMO staff with the Integrated Project Teams, to be discussed further in section I.2.1 , will facilita t e a continuing review and dialogue regarding the agency 's plan in order to avoid unexpected events. This is key in integrating the Planning and Budgeting Phases. The process of submission should be consistent with the annual guidance contained in the OM B Circular No. A-11, as well as with other current OMB guidance. Definition of Capital Asset Capital assets are land (including parklands), structures, equipment (including motor and aircraft fleets), and intellectual property (including software) which are used by the Federal Government and have an estimated useful life of two years or more. Capital assets exclude items acquired for resale in the ordinary course of operations or held for the purpose of physical consumption, such as operating materials and supplies. The cost of a capital asset is its full life -cycle cost, including all direct and indirect costs for planning, procurement (purchase price and all other costs incurred to bring it to a form and location suitable for its intended use), operations and maintenance (including service contracts), and disposal. Capital assets may or may not be capitalized (i.e., recorded on an entity 's balance sheet) under Federal accounting standards. Appendix 1 defines capital assets more fully. Threshold for Capital Programming As defined in OMB Circ ular No. A-11, Part 7 , major acquisitions are capital assets that require special management attention because of their importance to the agency mission; high development, operating, or maintenance costs; high risk; high return; or their significant role in the administration of agency programs, finances, property, or other resources. Major acquisitions should be separately identified in the agency 's budget. For small dollar investments relative to the agency 's budget, the agency may wish to develop a less detailed programming process based on the basic tenets presented in this Guide. A stratified capital programming process involving more or less detail and review based on the size or strategic importance of proposed investments may be appropriate, particularly in large agencies. Agencies should have well documented thresholds clearly disseminated and implemented across the organization. Cap ital Asset Management Infrastructure A formal capital asset management infrastructure is a best practice used throughout industry and by many Government agencies to establish clear lines of authority, responsibility, and accountability for the management of capital assets. An Executive Review Committee (ERC), acting for or with the agency head, should be responsible for reviewing the agency 's entire capital asset portfolio on a periodic basis and making decisions on the proper composition of agency assets needed to achieve strategic goals and objectives within the budget lim its. This committee should be composed of the senior operations executives and the chief information, financial, budget, and procurement officers. In addition to review by the ERC, each project requires an Integrated Project Team(s) (IPT) composed of a qualified program manager and necessary personnel from the user community, budget, accounting, procurement, value management, and other functions to be formed, as appropriate, to: CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE INTRODUCTION OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 3 of Capital Programming Guide (1) establish a baseline inventory of existing capital assets; (2) analy ze and recommend alternative solutions; (3) manage the acquisition if approved; and (4) manage the asset once in use. A sound financial management system is another key ingredient for sound decision making. Agencies may choose to plan for capital assets agency -wide or by bureau or functional area. Many agencies have started to redesign their planning approach for information technology (IT) capital assets by establishing an IT capital asset infrastructure in accordance with the requirements of the Clinger -Cohen Act, Sec. 5122, Capital Planning and Investment Control. In addition, Executive Order 13327 of February 4, 2004, Federal Real Property Asset Management, establishes the Federal Real Property Management Council (FRPC) that tasks Federal Real Property Officers with improving real property asset management within their agencies. When one asset contributes to multiple programs, the linkage to each program should be described. In turn, the annual performance plan should include the performa nce goals for the procurement of the asset, as well as the program 's performance, once the asset is operational. Separate documents are not required. Organization of the Guide This Guide is organized to reflect the three phases of the capital programm ing process: Planning and Budgeting, Acquisition, and Management -In-Use. Each phase is composed of a number of steps. Integration with guidance or source materials relevant to a particular phase and step, as well as a description of reporting requirements or formats, is also described. A Glossary and a list of Selected Capital Programming References are also included. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 5 of Capital Programming Guide I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE Introduction The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) initiated program performance reform for greater service delivery and program effectiveness by encouraging greater accountability throughout the Federal Government, and was updated under the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. It encourages collaboration between OMB and agencies to develop outcome oriented, program specific performance measures. Administrators must ask: Were program goals achieved within budgeted costs and established schedules? Does the program have baselines and ambitious targets for its annual measures? This Guide stresses the importance of all phases in the capital asset life-cycle. By linking planning and budgeting to procurement to the management of capital assets, the resulting all -encompassing roadmap encourages agencies to develop an Agency Capital Plan that provides for the long-range planning of the capital asset portfolio in order to meet the goals and objectives in the strategic and annual plan. The Annual Performance Plans, which describe an agency 's incremental progress toward achieving its strategic goals and objectives, should also clearly demonstrate how capital assets will contribute to this progress. The program or project acquisition life -cycle starts with concept analysis, progressing through technology definition, requirements planni ng, acquisition, and finally through operations and maintenance. Although terminology may differ, government and industry use similar processes. These processes typically include decision points in which executive boards review and approve a program 's entry to the next phase or stage, based on satisfactory completion of exit criteria from the prior phase or stage. Figure 1. The Capital Planning Lifecycle I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 6 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) I.1) STRATEGIC AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE LINKAGE I.1.1) Strategic Planning Capital programming, as guided by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, is an integral part of an agency 's strategic planning process. An effective strategic plan should anticipate changes in the agency 's requirement for technological capabilities, identify major assets that are critical to implement the plan, and define the outcomes these assets will help realize. The plan should also be consistent with the level of future budgetary resources that will be available. See OMB Circular No. A-11, Part 6 , Preparation and Submission of Strategic Plans, for detailed guidance on the requirements for strategic plans. I.2) Enterprise Architecture (EA) A complete Enterprise Architecture consists of a set of interr elated \"reference models\" designed to facilitate cross-agency analysis and identification of duplicate investments, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration within and across agencies. Collectively, the reference models comprise a framework for describing important elements of an EA in a common and consistent way. Through the use of this common framework and vocabulary, agencies can improve the way they manage IT or other portfolios. Figure 2. Component -Based Architecture As agencies continue to utilize EA to model performance, business processes and services, decision makers must create clear line-of -sight relationships between investments in capital assets and specific components in the EA. For example, the business case for a capital asset must document the specific performance measures that are affected by the investment and how those measures are affected. The same clarity should exist for business processes, services delivered and data managed by a capital asset. I.2.1) Integrated Project Team Several acquisition disciplines are essential to planning and managing an acquisition through its life -cycle. The Integrated Project Team (IPT) is established to analyze the performance and capability of the portfolio of assets used by the program. The IPT will vary in size and acquisition disciplines depending on the phase of the program, but must always contain a qualified program manager and contracting officer. At initiation of a major acquisition, the team should consist of the individuals with skills in the following areas: Project Management (PM), Federal Contracting, Cost Estimating, Risk Management, Sustainability, Climate Risk, Scheduling, Users, Budget, Technical Experts, Information Resource Management, Value Management, and Earned Value Management (EVM). Staff with other appropriate skill sets should also participate in the IPT. Agencies should strongly consider co -locating the IPT, especially the PM and contracting CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 7 of Capital Programming Guide professional , who must work closely throughout the project to ensure that the requirements are clearly articulated into a statement of work and that adequate oversight of the contracted work is accomplished. The members of the IPT are the key functional team leaders under the leadership provided by a program manager. The key to success is organization, planning, estimating and budgeting resources, and executing the plan. The IPT must also develop sound cost estimates based on the \"Principles of Government Cost Estimating \" in Appendix 8 and the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide . Figure 3. Integrated Project Team The program manager should be given a charter, whether the work is to be performed by contract or by in-hous e resources, defining the scope of authority, responsibility, and accountability for providing quality analysis to support senior management decision -making during all phases of capital programming. Such leadership by program offices is intended to ensure that capital assets will be designed and ope rated to improve the performance of the program staff who use them \u2014a seemingly self-evident goal, but one many businesses and Government agencies have failed to reach. For example, information systems often are developed by technology or finance specialists alone, without the benefit of an agency-wide review of the system 's requirements and capabilities. Appendix 2 discusses IPTs in more detail. Earned Value Management (EVM) and risk management are management tools used successfully in both the public and private sectors to mitigate risks in developing capital assets. Agencies must develop a level of expertise with both tools that is appropriate to the size and nature of their capital asset portfolio. This expertise may take the form of a full -scale EVM and risk program management office, a center of excellence, or a capability held by one or two focal points within the agency. IPTs must devote the planning time needed to create an adequate Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) at program initiation and keep it current throughout the program execution. Program management use of EVM depends on a well -developed WBS to ensure that a program is completely defined. Program experts, in collaboration with experts in the areas of Cost -Estimating, Procurement, Risk Management, Scheduling, and EVM, need to develop a WBS as a common framework within a given program, but also among related programs and across an organization 's portfolio. I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 8 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Even if the preferred solution has not yet been determined, planning for a progra m WBS must begin promptly upon program initiation during the earliest stage of the Planning Phase. Organizations that manage similar programs often use a standard WBS template to assist in program definition. The WBS when complete is an integrated family tree that defines all the products and services encompassed by the program. While some WBS elements are unique to each program, many are common, such as training, data, and program management. The program WBS established during concept definition will provide the framework for estimating the program 's cost and risk during the pre -systems acquisition planning and development of the program schedule. The cost estimate and program WBS provide the basis for suppliers to extend the Contract WBS to achieve integrated cost, schedule, and technical performance management using EVM during systems acquisitions. I.3) FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS If current assets cannot bridge the gap between planned and actual performance, the IPT should define the gap in terms of performance requirements to be achieved. Depending on the depth of the analysis of program requirements during the first round of strategic planning, the IPT may wish to define more detailed requirements against which they can evaluate options for reducing the performance gap. Functional requirements should not be defined in equipment or software terms, but in terms of the mission, purpose, capability, agency components involved, schedule and cost objectives, and operating constraints. Mission needs are independent of a particular capital asset or technological solution. A needs-based approach allows the agency the flexibility to evaluate a variety of solutions with an open mind. The key is not to limit potential solutions by too narrowly defining requirements. When developing functional requirements, the capabilities of other assets or processes with which the function must interact are a major consideration. Functional requirements should include the following elements: The performance criteria o f the function being acquired, developed, built, etc.; A definition of the common usages of the function; The ranking of each requirement in order of importance; and A decomposition of functional requirements into self -contained features (e.g., climate con trol for housing prisoners might have unique requirements that should be identified). Internal agency users and external customers (e.g., airlines for air traffic control systems, veterans for new benefits processing systems) should participate in the req uirements definition process. It is important to balance the internal user and operator needs with the requirements of the external customers. Other agencies that may have acquired assets to accomplish similar goals or objectives should be identified. Where feasible, large, complex acquisitions that are very difficult to manage should not be pursued on an individual agency basis. Instead, management should look for cross -agency or Government -wide economies to avoid duplication of effort. As part of the requirements definition process, agencies must look at Government -wide programs and systems to see if they will meet most or all agency requirements. To the degree a program or system does not meet agency requirements, agencies should consult with the program management office of the program or system involved to see if and how any unmet needs can be met. Agencies should also consult with any Government -wide Line of Business initiatives that may apply to their area of effort to coordinate planning with the Line of Business involved. One acute danger during this phase is \"specification creep, \" where requirements grow uncontrolled to meet future potential needs or to incorporate emerging technology that would be \" nice\" to have. Emphasis should be placed on core requirements needed to meet the mission needs. Once a solution meets the core requirements, additional functionality can be added in a later stage of the project, if cost -beneficial. These functional requireme nts should be documented in the strategic plan. Modular or spiral development CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 9 of Capital Programming Guide acquisition should be pursued where possible to prevent \" specification creep.\" Projects that are purchased in modules, where the scope is limited to what the market can provide quickly, rather than requiring significant new development efforts with uncertain cost, or delivery goals, can freeze the scope to provide an initial capability that improves the function, with subsequent modules providing for increased capability when the market is ready and scope, cost, and schedule can be more clearly defined. I.4) ALTERNATIVES TO CAPITAL ASSETS I.4.1) Answering the Three Critical Questions With detailed requirements defined, management should answer the Three Critical Questions befo re planning to acquire capital assets. These questions are applicable to all major capital investments. 1. Does the investment in a major capital asset support core/priority mission functions that need to be performed by the Federal Government? If not , end consideration of the investment and eliminate or privatize the function. If so, is there a clear explanation of how the investment supports core/priority mission functions? Are performance measures provided that are included in the agency Strategic Plan, including baseline data and the expected improvement? Is there an explana tion of how the investment will contribute towards meeting a goal? Are the functions inherently governmental functions? IPTs can consult Office of Federal Procurement Policy letter 11-01 \"P erformance of Inherently Governmental and Critical functions. \" IPTs can also consult Subpart 7.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and attachment A of OMB Circular No. A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities (May 29, 2003, as amended) to assist in deciding if a government activity is an inherently governmental function. 2. Does the investment need to be undertaken by the r equesting agency because no alternative private sector or governmental source can better support the function? If not, consider devolving the function to State or local governments; sharing resources within the agency, with another Federal agency, a uni versity, or a not -for-profit organization; or outsourcing to the private sector. For example, medical care can be provided through payments for care in non- profit or private hospitals, rather than directly by Federal agency hospitals. OMB Circular No. A-76 he lps agencies decide through the use of public -private competition whether taxpayers are better served though the continued in- house performance of highl y commercial activities (such as software development) or alternatively, by the best qualified contractor. 3 . Does the investment support work processes that have been simplified or otherwise redesigned to reduce costs, improve effectiveness, and make maximum use of commercial, off -the-shelf technology? If not, management should reengineer business processes first, then search for alternatives, or the agency may issue a very broad statement of the requirements in a solicitation to the private sector and allow the private sector to do the reengineering in proposed solutions. Management should also improve internal processes by cutting red tape, empowering employees, revising or pooling existing assets within the agency or with other agencies, redeploying resources, or offering training opportunities. I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 10 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Analyzing Agency Programs and Investments Consider the kind of capital assets needed and how they will be acquired. Ask Yourself... If the answer is \"No\" then... Is the function of the program central to the agency 's mission? Send to other Federal agency Direct to the private sector Send to State or local government Terminate function Can this agency accomplish this function better than the private sector or other Federal agency? Partner with State or local governments Cross-service with other Federal agencies Contract out to private sector Have work processes been re - engineered to reduce costs to improve effectiveness? Introduce competition Find efficiencies Empower employees and put customers first Figure 4. Decision Tree for Analyzing Agency Programs and Investments If the answer to all Three Critical Questions is yes, management should still consider options other than new acquisitions to reduce the performance gap, such as: Meeting objectives through regulation or user fees; Using human capital rather than capital assets; and Applying grants or other means beyond direct service provision supported by capital assets. I.4.2) Frequent Use of Benefit -Cost or Cost Effectiveness Analysis At many key decision points in the capital programming process, a benefit -cost or cost -effectiveness analysis could be used by senior management to help decide whether the best way to reduce the performance gap is through acquiring a new capital asset, und ertaking a major modification on an existing asset, or by some other method. This analysis should follow the guidance of OMB Circular No. A- 94, \"Gui delines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs \" (October 29, 1992). Guidelines for pursuing alternatives other than a capital asset are not contained in the remainder of this Guide. However, if the alternative chosen is a service contract, many of the analytical techniques and processes suggested in the Guide would be appropriate (see Appendix 8 on Cost - estimating). I.5) CHOOSING THE BEST CAPITAL ASSET Once the decision to acquire a capital asset is made, comparison of the various available asset options is needed to ensure t he acquisition of the best product for the job. Agencies should not undertake planning before a project is funded merely for the sake of compliance. They should plan because it results in better use of scarce resources and improves implementation. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 11 of Capital Programming Guide I.5.1) Evaluate Asset Options With the decision to evaluate the feasibility of acquiring a capital asset, management should provide the IPT with an estimate of the range of budget resources that may be ava ilable for an asset. The IPT should conduct market research to determine the feasibility of various capital asset alternatives that are available in the market to satisfy the requirements. Emphasis should be placed on generating innovation and competitio n from private industry and on the use of commercial items and non-developmental items to meet the mission needs. The IPT should determine: Availability. Can the market provide capital assets that partially or fully meet program requirements? How much of the need can be fulfilled without the need for developing new technologies or incurring other significant risk? Affordability. Are the assets affordable within budget limits? If the full requirement is not affordable, can it be divided into separate modules that are affordable? New technology should be subject to Technical Readiness Level (TRL) and Degree of Difficulty (R&D3) reviews to help determine the risk and potential necessary reserves. Costs & Benefits. For those alternatives that are afford able within budget limits, which are the most cost -beneficial, and should be among the portfolio of proposed assets that the agency head, the President, and the Congress consider for funding? (Value management methodology can provide the \"best value\" alternatives to meet the functional requirements.) Sustainable Design Principles and Climate Considerations . How much have sustainable design principles and climate considerations been incorporated into the requirements identified for the asset? Have sustainability and responses to climate change, both emissions mitigation and climate adaptation, been considered in all aspects of the asset 's life -cycle? Have the risks posed by natural hazards been considered in each phase of the lifecycle? Risk . In addition to applying risk management to the development of a Risk -Adjusted Program Budget and Risk-Adjusted schedule, the agency must assess overall risk of an investment as it chooses the best capital assets to meet the agency 's mission and strategic obj ectives. High risk should be accepted only if it can be justified by high expected returns, and only if a program failure can be absorbed by the agency without loss of service capability or significant effect on budget. Decision thresholds should be set for cost, schedule, and performance expectations of development projects beyond which the return on investment becomes so low that the project should be canceled. Agencies can apply a variety of risk mitigation techniques, including limiting scope, contra ct type selected, and aggressive program management. The process of choosing the best capital asset starts with the development of a strategy to review the market and ends with the development of an acquisition plan that outlines the best approach to acquire the recommended asset. Plans for asset evaluation, operation and maintenance, and disposal should also be developed, with the execution costs included in the Feasibility Analysis. If funding for the proposed asset is approved at the end of the Bu dgeting Phase, these plans will be executed in the Acquisition and Management -In-Use Phases. I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 12 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) I.5.1.1) Asset Availability A program manager supported by thorough market analysis is an educated consumer, and is more likely to complete a program successfully. Availability is assessed by market surveillance and market research, ultimately producing a list of investment alternatives, accompanied with data necessary to assess affordability, benefits, and costs. Market surveillance is an on -going process, one that is not driven by a specific planned acquisition. The IPT technical staff should keep abreast of the latest capabili ties and performance through trade journals, advertisements, sales brochures, etc. Market research is undertaken with respect to a specific planned acquisition; it is the proactive part of market analysis. In market research, the IPT seeks information th rough research of published information, talking to other agencies that have conducted similar market research, and/or going directly to the market for information. I.5.1.2) Market Research Strategy Once a clear agency need has been identified, the IPT should begin with a plan to conduct both market surveillance and market research to ensure that as many alternative solutions as possible are identified for consideration. The plan should define the use of broad area announcements, requests for information, or requests for proposals to solicit information on alternati ve concepts from a broad base of qualified firms. When these documents are issued, contractors should be provided with mission performance criteria, life -cycle cost, and any other factors that the agency will use in the evaluation and selection of the solu tions. Emphasis should be placed on solutions that are currently available (i.e., do not require significant development) with little risk in cost, schedule, performance, and technical obsolescence. This means commercial items (CI) or non -developmental i tems (NDI) where little or no development effort is required are preferred. However, contractors should be encouraged to provide any solution they believe will meet the agency 's needs, including providing the capability contemplated through a service cont ract or lease. The key is to not restrict potential offers by specifying requirements too narrowly. Agencies can, through market analysis, seek preliminary information on alternatives available in the commercial sector. If the information does not pro vide a clear indication that acceptable solutions are available, it may be necessary to award contracts to explore alternative design concepts. These contracts should be of relatively short duration and within defined dollar levels. When market capabilit y is not sufficient to fulfill the agency 's entire performance gap, the IPT should carefully weigh the extent of increased capability that can be obtained quickly within budget limits against the delay in capability improvement, risk of failure, and costs of a development effort to achieve the desired capability. In many cases, evolutionary changes in capability over time are the most cost -effective approach. Timely technical reviews should be made of the alternatives to ensure the orderly elimination of those that are least attractive. There may be instances in which several alternatives offer essentially the same benefits and costs. In those instances, it may be necessary to conduct comparative demonstrations, where the different alternatives are actual ly tested in the operational environment for a period of time, to determine the best product. Agencies should encourage contractors to provide any solution they believe will meet the agency' s needs. The key is to not restrict potential offers by specifying requirements too narrowly. The establishment and use of a structured vehicle allocation methodology (VAM) by Federal agencies ensures that the agency vehicle fleets are not over-costly and both correctly sized in terms of numbers and appropriate for accomplishing agency missions. A VAM provides managers with a standard way to document the objective criteria of a vehicle fleet for a specific entity within an agency and make informed deci sions in fleet acquisition, management, and disposition. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 13 of Capital Programming Guide The IPT should engage potential suppliers in an advisory process in which the Government provides a general description of the scope or purpose of the acquisiti on (such as a Request for Information, which could include a Statement of Objectives) and invites potential offerors to submit information that allows the Government to advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors. By doing this, the Government enables potential vendors to more wisely use their internal resources, such as bid and proposal money or independent research and development funds, to come up with the best solutions for the Government 's needs. This process also enables the Government to refine its acquisition strategy by identifying in advance the extent of competition that can be expected for the acquisition. I.5.2) Develop a Program Baseline The program 's (investment 's) risk -adjusted budget establishes the baseline for reporting to OMB on program performance. The Program Risk-Adjusted Budget (PRB) is formed after determining the Program Budget (PB) and the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB). The appropriate agency official must ensure the PRB is justified based on ri sk, and that the agency will fund the program at that level. The foundation of the Program Budget is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Once the technical scope of work has been described through a WBS, the appropriate experts along with cost and sch edule estimators can use this information to develop cost and schedule estimates. Budgets are assigned to each WBS element, and when time- phased, form the Performance Measurement Baseline. The Performance Measurement Baseline is the total Budget -at-Compl etion (BAC) assigned to summary planning accounts, control accounts and the undistributed budget. Significant investments require a clearly understood process for ensuring that the program budget, expected outcomes, and cost/schedule performance measurements are integrated with risk management. Risk management begins with evaluating the WBS for cost, schedule and technical risk. Risks in each of these areas for each WBS element should be identified, analyzed, and quantified in terms of potential cost to the program. Risk identification involves analyzing program areas and critical technical elements to identify and document the associated risk. Assumptions and constraints also need to be identified and analyzed for cost impact. Risk analysis involves examining each risk issue to determine the probability of the risk occurring and the cost, schedule, and technical consequences if the risk occurs. The cost of the risk occurrence is added to the BAC and the result of this analysis is a risk -adjusted budge t. The program 's milestone schedule should also be adjusted for risk. Measurable WBS elements significant to a project milestone should be analyzed for most optimistic, most pessimistic, and most likely durations. A risk -adjusted schedule will have fi nish dates that reflect the likelihood of a risk event occurring and its associated schedule impact. If schedule delays will affect cost, this information should be reflected in a risk-adjusted cost estimate. I.5.2.1) Changes to the Baseline (Rebaselining ) In general, agencies and their contractors should establish a performance measurement baseline for an investment, to track progress against the baseline and report the cost variance and the schedule variance to senior management at least monthly. While legitimate reasons exist for changing a baseline, as a general rule, changes should be rare. When a change to a baseline is needed, agency governance should review, approve and document the change. A revised baseline should not be used in performance reports until agency governance approves the change. If a change to a baseline is approved, agencies should maintain a record of the original baseline and the rationale for the change. I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 14 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) I.5.2.2) Breach Margins (Variance Thresholds) As part of monitoring progress, agencies are encouraged to establish cost and schedule variance thresholds that will require a formal explanation to the agency when breached. Corrective action should be taken whenever a breach occurs. The breach margins should be set so that when a threshold is crossed, management is informed while there is still time to take corrective action. Agencies have significant latitude when setting a threshold for an investment unless breach margins have been specified in statute, regulation or Fede ral policy. As a general guide, a cost or schedule variance of plus or minus 10% or more should trigger formal reporting. I.5.3) Select the Best Alternative: Benefit -Cost Analysis Once the IPT determines that it has sufficient market information on altern ative solutions, it should compare the initial acquisition cost and the other life -cycle cost elements of the various alternatives. It is critical that the cost estimates are realistic estimates of the final costs and are adjusted to consider risk. When seeking funds during the budget process, the credibility of the costs will be examined, and OMB and the Congress will hold agencies accountable for meeting the schedule and performance goals within the cost estimates. Alternative solutions that are not af fordable within potential budget availability should be dropped from consideration, but documented for comparison purposes. The information needed to determine whether a proposed acquisition is affordable is based on a juxtaposition of three factors: avail ability of potential funding, agency mission objectives the investment will help achieve, and the impact that purchasing the new asset will have on funds available for other agency mission objectives. The selection of the best alternative to compare with other agency projects should be based on a systematic analysis of expected benefits and costs. The fundamental method for formal economic analysis is benefit - cost analysis. OMB guidance on benefit-cost analysis can be found in OMB Circular No. A-94. Benefit - cost analysis includes the following steps: I dentify Assumptions and Constraints . Assumptions are explicit statements used to specify precisely the environment to which the benefit -cost analysis applies. Assumptions reduce complex situations to manageable proportions. Constraints are requirements or other factors that cannot be traded off to achieve a more cost-beneficial approach. Cost estimates involve many assumptions and these assumptions carry risk. Risk should be quantified so that the budget accurately reflects the cost of risk. Identify and Quantify Benefits and Costs. Benefits and costs should be quantified in monetary term s wherever possible. All types of benefits and costs should be included, and should be discussed in a narrative. The level of detail should be commensurate with the size and criticality of the investment. The benefits should be linked to the program goals and needs identified in the previous Planning sections. Benefits and costs should be estimated over the full life-cycle of each alternative considered. Life-cycle costs include all initial costs, plus the periodic or continuing costs of operation and maintenance (including staffing costs), and any costs of decommissioning or disposal. Estimates of costs and benefits should show explicitly the performance and budget changes that result from undertaking the project. Evaluate Alternatives Using Net Present Value. Investment alternatives should be evaluated using the net present value criterion. Potential projects should be ranked according to the discounted value of their expected benefits, less the discounted value of expected costs. (Appropriate disco unting techniques are described in OMB Circular No. A-94.) Qualitative evaluation considerations \u2014su ch as explicit regulatory requirements, conside rations of business strategy, or unquantifiable social benefits or costs\u2014may override quantitative criteria in deciding on the final ranking of projects. The analysis may be supplemented by including other summary measures, like the internal rates of retu rn on the alternative projects or return on assets. Effects on income distribution should be identified for projects that have such effects. Even when the monetary value of benefits or costs cannot be measured, physical quantification may be feasible and CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 15 of Capital Programming Guide should be pursued. When the benefits of alternative investments are the same, cost -effectiveness analysis may be used to rank alternatives. An investment is most cost effective when it has the lowest discounted present value of life-cycle costs for a given stream of annual benefits. When benefits are different, the most cost-effective investment is the one that has the highest discounted net (of cost) benefit. Perform Risk and Sensitivity Analysis. Benefit and cost estimates involve a degree of uncertai nty. Estimates are based on assumptions, and those assumptions carry risk. Risk analysis can be used to identify where uncertainties exist and subsequently quantified so that their cost can be factored into overall cost estimates. Benefits may not be realized as planned, and the risk of this occurring should be factored into cost-benefit analyses. Sensitivity analysis can identify the response of program costs and benefits to changes in one or more uncertain elements of the analysis. Sensitivity analysis should be used to test the response of the investment 's net present value to changes in key assumptions. I.5.4) Develop an Acquisition Strategy The IPT should begin to tailor an acquisition strategy for the program as soon as the best alternative is selected. The acquisition strategy and analysis risks should be part of the information provided to the Executive Review Committee when seeking approval of the project. I.5.5) Risk Management Planning for risk management for the life -cycle is a critical com ponent of program/investment management and begins at project conception. Risk analysis is an integral part of the planning process. An approach for managing risk on the investment should be established early in the Planning Phase. An effective Risk Management Plan addresses the following risk areas: schedule risk; cost risk; technical feasibility; risk of technical obsolescence; dependencies between a new project and other projects or systems; climate risk; procurement and contract risk; and resources risks. Risk Management is continual throughout the life cycle of an investment. Planning for risk and incorporating risk analysis into planning decisions is included in this section of the Guide. Managing risk in the Acquisition Phase and the Management -in-Use Phase is discussed in those sections of this Guide. I.5.5.1) Earned Value Management A critical component of risk management on major investments is the use of EVM. Implemented properly, an EVM system will measure progress against a baseline and provide an early warning of cost overruns and schedule delays. Most likely, a practical application of EVM will involve tailoring the principles to a project 's unique circumstances. When an EVM system is required (see Federal Acquisition Regulation 34.2), the cost and schedule variances should be reported to senior management at least monthly. Appendix 3 provides an example of the calculations. Some project management software tools will perform the calculations with no additional effort. EVM is not tied to any specific development methodology and does not prevent the use of other risk management techniques such as agile development. EVM and agile development are complementary and can be used on the same project. Agile development can be used to incrementally deliver functionality to the customer while EVM provides a standard method for measuring progress. A related process used to mitigate risk is the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) process. The IBR process provides program managers with a thorough understanding of the project plan and any risks associated with the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB). Initial risks identified and their impact on program cost and schedule should be updated based on IBR findings. Risks identified in the IBR are documented, analyzed, and risk -handling plans are developed and are included in an overall program risk register . These I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 16 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) risks are then monitored and acted upon as appropriate. By paying close attention to higher risk WBS elements, program managers are capable of prioritizing areas for management attention. Initial risks identified along with their impacts on program cost and schedule should be updated based on IBR findings and subsequently managed until they are retired. A close watch for new risk should also be maintained and these should be entered into the risk management process. Use of an EVM system will assist in identifying and mitigating project risk. Additionally, projects with broad scope typically involve more risk than those that limit what they are trying to accomplish. I.5.5.2) Planning for Contract Type The agency sho uld strive to use fixed price or fixed price incentive contracts to the maximum extent possible. The ability to use fixed price contracts results from the fact that the capability the agency is seeking is available in the market. The need to use cost type contracts usually means that the capability is not readily available in the market, requiring a risky development effort to be undertaken. For long- duration contracts that include significant development, it may be impossible to estimate the cost of pe rforming the entire contract with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed price or structured incentive contract from day one. As the contract progresses and the ability to estimate the cost of performance increases, the use of such contracts becomes more practical. Therefore, it may be desirable to initiate the work with a small, short-duration time and material or cost plus fixed fee contract for studies or early design, evolve to a cost plus award fee or cost plus incentive fee contract for later design and initial development, and then to a cost plus incentive fee, fixed price incentive, or fixed price contract for the initial and production units once all development work is complete. For such contracts, it also may be desirable to negotiate an estimated cost or price in increments. The initial estimated cost or price would be for the studies or early design. As work progresses, the estimated cost or price should be renegotiated upward at appropriate points in the contract as those costs become more pred ictable. Agencies should make good use of contract type by matching the type of contract to how much is known about the requirement, and the likely accuracy of the agency 's and the contractor 's cost estimates. There are two basic sets of considerations: 1. How much is known about what it will actually take to do the contractor 's part of the project? A. Fixed Price: Does the agency know (and can a contractor reasonably be expected to discover) enough about what it will take for a contractor to do th eir part of the current phase(s) of the project so that the contractor could reasonably set a series of fixed (not hourly, but by task) prices to perform their part? If so, agencies should use fixed price contracting for the requirement. If the only elem ent keeping an agency from being able to do this is moderately significant variations in the price of a key commodity used to make the item, then agencies can adjust for that using Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment. Agencies would then be able to adjust the price paid for an item in accordance with market fluctuations in the price of the key commodity. If agencies don' t know enough about the requirement to reasonably expect a contractor to be able to price it this way, then they should explore Cost Reimbursement. B. Cost Reimbursement (for example, Cost Plus Award Fee): Is the agency at the point where contractors can reasonably give the agency Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimates to do what the agency asks? Is it likely that actual perfor mance of the requirement will be within plus or minus approximately 50 percent of the ROM estimates? If the answer to both questions is yes, the agency should use cost reimbursement contracting to have the contractor meet the requirement. Agencies should use Integrated Baseline Reviews (preferably before contract award) to identify deficiencies in contractor proposals that would impede them from reasonably performing the proposed effort for the proposed price. The contractor would then include in their p roposal the cost of correcting these deficiencies, and thus reflect the true \" probable cost \" of CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 17 of Capital Programming Guide performing the contract. The ultimate goal of the cost reimbursement/IBR process is to yield enough information about what it will actually take to perform the project so that the Government could reasonably use a Fixed Price contract to fill the requirement. C. Time and Materials or Labor Hour: If agencies are still some distance from being able to do either A or B above for a given project, then agencies should consider a small, short duration (less than one year) Time and Materials or Labor Hour type of contract for that project. This type of contract should only be used in the Planning Phase, and only when there is insufficient knowledge about the requirem ent to be able to use a cost reimbursement contract to fill the requirement. Agencies should remember that Integrated Baseline Reviews can and should be used in concert with cost reimbursement contracting to control project costs to a greater degree than is usually the case in Time and Materials or Labor Hour contracts. A \"Term \" Cost Reimbursement contract versus a \" Completion \" type is similar to this and does not require the contractor to complete the tasks. The discussion on the time to use Time and Materials versus Cost Reimbursement needs to make a distinction between Completion and Term CR contracts. See Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.306. 2. How should agencies decide how much goods and services to require in a given contract, task or delivery order? An agency should only require in the contract, task order or delivery order sufficient goods and services to result in the agency receiving complete, useful assets. (A useful asset is defined in the Glossary of this Guide.) Therefore, if f unding was eliminated for the project, the agency would still be able to walk away with, for example, a completed building rather than just a foundation, or software that is complete enough to be useable in and of itself, without having to add software modules to make it useable. Agencies should separately evaluate each piece of contracting support needed for their project in light of the above yardsticks to see what type of contract makes sense. Agencies are often able to combine parts of the contractor support effort that would require the same type of contract for that support. For example, in some initial parts of the requirements definition phase, so little is known about what it will take to do the contractor portions of the requirement itself that any ROM estimate is far enough outside the plus or minus 50 percent that it is closer to a guesstimate than a reliable estimate. For these parts, Time and Materials may be the best contract type to use. Once requirements are defined and as agencies are working on putting together Performance Work Statements, models, prototypes, etc., more is known about what it will take to meet Government requirements. Then estimates tend to become more reliable. With more reliable estimates, agencies are likely in th e plus or minus 50 percent range for estimates, at which point a Cost Plus Award Fee may be the way to go. Once agencies get into production, deployment, and/or maintenance, even more is known about what it will take to meet Government requirements \u2014enough to make it worthwhile to ask a contractor for fixed pricing. The Government then expects contractors and contracting personnel alike to be working in a fixed price contract environment. It is also possible to mix into any of these contract types the abi lity to place later orders, depending on how much is known about when, where, and in what quantities services are to be performed or goods are to be delivered. I.5.5.3) Planning for Competition The acquisition strategy should include how to make the most effective use of competition in all phases of the process. In most cases, competition will yield better value at lower prices. In looking for ways to make the most effective use of competition, agencies should pay special attention to using: (1) perform ance- based contracting, where innovative solutions are sought to meet functional requirements rather than the more traditional method of detailed Government specifications; (2) competitive demonstrations, where the Government allows several competing vend ors to demonstrate their products or prototypes in an operational environment; and (3) solicitation of assets, which permit interoperability with others by featuring open architectures. I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 18 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) I.5.5.4) Planning for Acquisition Management The risk associated with the asset selected for consideration will determine the type of performance-based management system that should be used to monitor contractor performance in achieving the cost, schedule, and performance goals during the contract period. All major acquisitions with development effort will include the requirement for the contractor to use an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) that meets the guidelines in EIA Standard \u2014748 to monitor contract performance. EVMS is normally used on Fixed- Price Incentive contracts and Cost Reimbursement contracts for major acquisitions. EVM shall also be used on Firm -Fixed Price and any other type of contract or task order that meets the major acquisition threshold if that contract or task order contains a significant amount of development effort. I.5.5.5) Integrating Earned Value into Acquisition Strategy The acquisition strategy should make sure any contracts resulting from the acquisition that meet the Major Acquisition Threshold contain requirements for the use of EVM. All contracts with EVM are required to have an In tegrated Baseline Review (IBR) pre - or post -award to finalize the agreement on the baseline and ensure all risks are identified and understood. An IBR, a part of th e overall risk management process, must be accomplished whenever there are major changes to the baseline. Depending on the risk to establishing an achievable performance measurement baseline at time of contract award, the use of an IBR before or after award must be determined. Agencies are expected to achieve at the completion of the contract at least 90 percent of the cost, schedule, and performance goals established at time of contract award. For more information see s ection II.2.4 , Establishing an Earned Value Management System. I.5.6) Allow for Adequate Time to Evaluate Alternatives Sel ecting the most promising capital asset should not be rushed, especially for mission -critical assets. Selecting an alternative without adequate analysis has resulted too often in large dollar acquisitions that have significantly overrun both cost and schedule, while falling short of expected performance. Agencies should not request funds for the production or installation stage of an acquisition until they establish firm goals that have a high probability of successful achievement. I.5.7) Plans for Proposed Capital Assets Once in Use Plans should also be developed for management of the capital asset once in use, including plans for operational ana lysis, operations and maintenance, and disposal. Both assets that are on -hand and those being considered for acquisition will have to be disposed of at some point. These costs may be very large. For example, a building may require demolition, or the production of waste may require large cleanup costs. The costs associated with the operating and disposal of assets should be included in the life-cycle and benefit -cost analysis (see Management -In-Use Phase). Agencies should identify a measurement system for once the asset is in use that provides the cost and performance data needed to monitor and evaluate investments individually and strategically. For example, if an agency makes an advanced technology investment to achieve certain cost savings and quality improvements, the management system should permit the agency to measure whether these improvements occurred and whether operations and maintenance costs are within projections. The measurement system implemented should provide feedback on adherence to stra tegic initiatives and plans. The system should Let competition im prove results through: Using commercially available and non - developmental items Publicizing opportunities widely Applying functional/ performance specifications/targets Limiting burdensome information requirements Using open architectures to enhance interoperability CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 19 of Capital Programming Guide also allow for review of unexpected costs or benefits that result from the investment decision. This tracking system is a critical element of capital programming, for it follows through the operational life -cycle of the asset. One purpose of the measurement system is to help guide future investment decisions (see Management -In-Use Phase). I.5.8) Portfolio Management Capital assets should be compared against one another to create a prioritized portfolio of all major capital assets. Just as an individual invests in a diverse portfolio of securities, agencies invest in a diverse portfolio of capital assets. For the individual investor, returns are measured in dividends or capital gains. While the benefits and costs of capital asset portfolios should be quantified in monetary terms when feasible, agencies also measure return on the basis of outputs and outcomes. For the individual investor, some investments are more risky than others. Similarly, an agency 's capital asset investments have various levels of risk. Sound planning for procurement and operational m anagement can mitigate risk. But all assets, especially those that require extensive development work before they can be put into operation, are inherently risky and should be justified by high return. Agencies should choose a portfolio of capital invest ments that maximize return to the taxpayer and the Government \u2014at an acceptable level of risk. In general, agencies should establish and manage portfolios of programs, projects and other work in accordance with Federal policy and widely accepted standards. The coordinated management of the items in a portfolio should enhance executive decision making and help ensure programs and projects contribute to an agency 's ability to achieve strategic goals and objectives. The process includes the selection, priori tization and monitoring of programs and projects, but it does not include the management of the items in a portfolio. The management of individual items should be addressed in program/project management policy. Portfolio management theory and standards a re readily available from commercial sources and academic literature. The theory is not repeated here. Agencies are encouraged to focus on the practical application of the principles as opposed to the development of portfolio management theory. Most likely, the practical application will involve the tailoring of the principles to an agency 's unique circumstances. All of the items in a portfolio must support strategic plans, goals, objectives and priorities. The strategy and goals drive the selection and prioritization. The selection process should eliminate unnecessary and poorly planned projects. In addition, the risks associated with each item should be evaluated and responses should be developed. The risk management process should reduce threats to the agency objectives. The selection and evaluation should result in a portfolio that is balanced so that the mix of items maximizes the agency 's ability to achieve strategic goals. Annual reviews should include key performance indicators and ensure that the portfolio only contains items that support the mission. In addition to reviewing portfolio performance, each item should be reviewed individually to evaluate its contribution. Items may be added, deleted or reprioritized based on their performan ce and alignment with the strategy. The reviews should also address programs, projects and other work identified as high risk by the Government Accountability Office. One approach to devising a ranked listing of projects is to use a scoring mechanism that provides a range o f values associated with project strengths and weaknesses. Appendix 11 shows examples of how some key risk and return criteria might be scored. These examples are drawn from multiple best practices Agencies should choose a portfolio of capital investments that maximizes return to the taxpayer and the Government \u2014at an acceptable level of risk. I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 20 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) organizations. Higher scores are given to projects that meet or exceed positive aspects of the decision criteria. Additionally, in this example, weights have been attached to criteria to reflect their relative importance in the decision process. To ensure consistency, each of the decision criteria should have operational definitions based on quantitative or qualitative measures. A scoring and ranking process, such as the one depicted in Appendix 11 may be used more than once, and in more than just this step to limit the number of projects that will be considered by an executive decision -making body. An out come of such a ranking process might produce three groups of projects: Likely Winners: One group, typically small, is a set of projects with high returns and low risk that are likely \"winners. \" Likely Drop -outs: At the opposite end of the spectrum, a group of high-risk, low -return projects that would have little chance of making the fina l cut. Projects That Warrant a Closer Look: In the middle is usually the largest group. These projects have eit her a high -return/high-risk or a low -return/low -risk profile. Analytical and decision -making energy should be focused on prioritizing these projects where decisions will be more difficult. At the end of this step, senior managers should have a prioritized list of capital investments and proposals with supporting documentation and analysis. An example of criteria and scoring process to rank capital assets is in Appendix 11 . I.6) THE AGENCY CAPITAL PLAN As part of its strategic plan, each agency is encouraged to have an Agency Capital Plan (ACP) that defines the long -term agency capital asset decisions. The ACP is the ultimate product of the Pl anning and Budgeting Phase and should be the result of an executive review process that reviews the work done in this Phase. The ACP should include an analysis of the portfolio of assets already owned by the agency and in procurement, the performance gap and capability necessary to bridge it, and justification for new acquisitions proposed for funding. I.6.1) Executive Review Process Each agency should establish a formal process for senior management to review and approve the capital assets that make up the ACP before the plan is presented to the agency chief executive for approval. The number of times a capital asset is reviewed by senior management should be based on the associated level of risk involved in the acquisition. The cost of an asset and its importance to achieving the agency mission should also be taken into consideration when defining criteria for executive review. One private sector best practice company requires more documentation and greater analytical rigor if a proposed asset would replace or change an operational system vital to keeping the company running, or if it matched a company -wide strategic goal. Lower-impact proposals that would affect only a particular office or had a non-strategic objective would not be analyzed by senior management in such detail. Senior management should also review acquisitions that are not achieving established goals . I.6.2) Purpose of the Agency Capital Plan The Agency Capital Plan is the principal output of the Planning Phase. It is a dynamic plan that changes to reflect decisions about adding new assets and deleting old or even in -process asset acquisitions that are not meeting goals (i.e., the return on investment does not justify continued funding of the project). It should be the central document, or group of documents, that the agency uses for its capital asset planning. Agencies are encouraged to use a summary of the Agency Capital Plan for budget justifications to OMB, CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 21 of Capital Programming Guide congressional authorizations of projects, and justifications for appropri ations to the Congress. (See OMB Circular No. A-11, Part 2 for budget submission guidance.) Agencies are encouraged to have on hand capital planning documents at various levels of detail, applying each for different purposes. For example, a summary level might be sufficient for the authorization process in the Congress or justifications for the appropriations committees. The same or a different summary might be made available to OMB to support agency budget proposals to, or if requested by, OMB. The most detailed level might remain in the agency for use in developing the summary materials for OMB and the Congress. In this regard, the Agency Capital Plan can be an excellent means of explaining the background for capital asset purchases, as well as their justification, and can be used as a means of answering inquiries related to an agency 's budget submission. Last, the Agency Capital Plan can support an agency 's related salaries and expenses associated with the staffing, operation, and maintenance of its capital asset portfolio. I.6.3) Key Elements of the Agency Capital Plan Agencies are encouraged to include the elements described below in their Agency Capital Plans. This outline and description should not be viewed as a required format. Agencies tha t choose to use a summary of their capital plans to justify funding requests for capital assets are encouraged to work with the Congress, OMB, and other stakeholders to determine what should be included and in what format. The Agency Capital Plan may cont ain the following elements: Statement of agency mission, strategic goals and objectives, and annual performance plans; Description of the Planning Phase; Baseline assessment and identifying the performance gap; Justification of spending for proposed new capital assets; Cost-Schedule and performance goals and changes thereto; Risk-Management Plan; Staff requirements; Timing issues, if involved in a multi -agency acquisition; Plans for proposed capital assets once in use; and Summary of risk management plan. Each of the elements is discussed in detail with a table demonstrating the relationships between strategic pl an, annual plan, and capital plan in Appendix 12. I.7) AGENCY SUBMISSION FOR FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR The Budgeting step of the capital programming process occurs when OMB works with the agencies to devise a funding plan to allocate resources among various priorities. This process begins when the agency starts to incorporate budget concerns into its strategic and annual performance planning, including consultation with OMB staff and perhaps congressional staff. Budgeting is of greater urgency when the agency formally requests budget authority for the asset in its budget submission to OMB for the coming year. Although budgeting should be incorporated to account for all phases of an asset 's life -cycle, the formal budget process really begins during this step of the Planning Phase once the agency requests OMB to include the funding for a program or proj ect in the President' s Budget. The Budgeting Step and the Planning and Budgeting Phase ends when the Congress appropriates funds for the acquisition and OMB apportions the funds to the agency. Agencies are encouraged to work with OMB through the entire Planning and Budgeting Phase to greater increase its likelihood of funding. This is where a long-term capital asset investment and utilization plan I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 22 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) is useful. It greatly assists the decision makers at OMB see where this asset, among others, fits into th e long-term goals of the agency. The plan, as described above, which includes condition analysis, annual performance, and asset inventory, would be familiar with the OMB RMO staff and clearly list out where the asset in question fits into the long term plan. This step differs from the other planning steps in part because the sole decision making authority does not rest within the agency. They are made in part by OMB (whether to include the request in the Administration 's budget proposal to the Congress), and by the Congress (whether to enact budget authority for the acquisition). This section could also be called the \"Justification\" or \" Approval \" section. The agency justifies its proposal to OMB and the Administration, and if approved, the agency and the Administration justify the proposal to the Congress. Return on Investment (ROI) includes consideration of integrity, confidentiality and authenticity, availability and reliability. If an asset does not have all these characteristics, then the chances of realizing the ROI are reduced. Agencies must demonstrate the use of a repeatable framework for considering these aspects in the selection of capital asset investments. The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) is such a framework fo r IT assets. Two key aspects of this framework are: Implementation of security configurations. FISMA requires each agency to determine minimally acceptable system configuration requirements and ensure compliance with them. In addition, agencies must exp lain the degree to which they implement and enforce security configuration. Plan of Action and Milestones. FISMA requires agencies to develop a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial action to address any deficiencies in the information security policies, procedures, and practices of the agency. Agencies must report annually the status of both implementation of security considerations and the Plan of Action and milestones. OMB uses this information to determine the degree to which agencies use the framework and to establish an understanding of the overall level of risk in the Federal IT portfolio. I.7.1) Agency Submission to OMB The agency submission should be consistent with the Principles of Budgeting for Capital A sset Acquisitions, which can be found in Appendix 6 to this Guide and is published annually within OMB Circular No. A-11 as Appendix J . Once submitted, the agency may be called upon to defend the proposal formally in OMB 's agency hearings, or informally in many other ways. The proposal will undergo further scrutiny within OMB, and OMB may request more information from the agency, before the OMB Director makes the budget recommendation to the President. In most cases, the formal submission to OMB will not be the first time OMB or the Congress learns of the proposal, because OMB, and perhaps the Congress, may have been involved in developing the Agency Capital Plan and in approving funding for the Planning Phase. It is a lso not the first time that the agency has been involved in budgeting and justification. Within the agency, budgeting and justification take place among the various programs and bureaus. Projects that cover more than one appropriation account within the agency or are multi-agency projects should have undergone careful planning to determine how the total cost should be allocated among the various accounts. By the time it is proposed to OMB for funding, the project has survived the competition for resource s within the agency and is ready, in the view of the agency head, to compete in a larger and more demanding arena for budgetary resources. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 23 of Capital Programming Guide I.7.2) Criteria for Justification of Spending for Proposed New Capital Assets Although the details will vary depending on the acquisition, there are certain key criteria that OMB will loo k for in the justification. OMB Circular No. A-11, Part 7 , defines the budget submission requirements for both new and in-process acquisitions. A discussion of the key elements of an Agency Capital Plan can be found in s ection I.6.3 of this Guide, with further detail in Appendix 8 and Appendix 12 . The principles incorporate the requirements of the Clinger -Cohen Act of 1996 for justifying budgets for capital assets. The three parts of the justification discussed here are (1) basis for selection of the capital asset (2) principles of financing and (3) strategies for strengthening accountability for achieving goals. I.7.2.1) Basis for Selection of the Capital Asset The basis for selection of the capital asset is taken from the Justification of Spending for Proposed Capital Asset s in Appendix 12 . Illustrations of questions OMB Resource Management Offices (RMO) may ask when reviewing agency submissions are shown below. I.7.2.2) Principles of Financing The following principles of financing should be followed for the acquisition of capital assets. These are fr om Principles of Budgeting for Capital Asset Acquisitions (see Appendix 6). Principle 1. Full Funding. Agencies should request budget authority sufficient to complete a useful segment of a project (or the entire project, if it is not divisible into useful segments). Full funding must be appropriated before any obligations for the useful segment (or projec t) may be incurred. Principle 2. Regular Appropriations and Authority for Multi-Year Contract Authority. Regular appropriations for the full funding of a capital project or a useful segment (or investment) of a capital project in the budget year are pref erred. If this results in spikes that, in the judgment of OMB, cannot be accommodated by the agency or the Congress, see Principle 4 below. Illustrative Agency S tatement of Program Objectives and Related Information: The program is expected to process 50,000 documents next year and will have to process a projected 60,000 documents five years later. Legislation making the documents more complicated is likely to be enacted. Current projections indicate that the number of Federal employees (FTE) must decline by 15 percent between now and then. Illustrative Questions from OMB and Others Regarding Program Objectives: Are the documents important to the agency missio n? What is the basis for the projected increase in the number of documents? What are the assumptions regarding the complexity of the documents and the amount of time needed to process each document? What is the basis for assuming that the number of Fede ral employees will decline? Illustrative Requests from OMB and Others Regarding the Cost, Schedule, and Performance Goals: Provide baseline cost and schedule goals for the acquisition. Explain the agency system for developing the baseline goals and evaluating whether the goals will be met. Explain the performance goals for the asset. Explain the risk that the cost, schedule, and performance goals will not be met and how that risk will be monitored and controlled. I. PLANNING AND BUDGETING PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 24 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Principle 3. Separate Funding of Planning Segments. As a general rule, planning segments (e.g., initial planning, competitive prototypes) should be financed separately from the procurement of a useful asset. Principle 4. Accommodation of Lumpiness or \" Spikes \" and Separate Capital Acquisition Accounts. To accommodate lumpiness or \"spikes\" in funding justified acquisi tions, agencies, working with OMB, are encouraged to aggregate financing for capital asset acquisitions in one or several separate capital acquisition budget accounts within the agency, to the extent possible within the agency 's total budget request. I.7.2 .3) Strategies for Strengthening Accountability for Achieving Goals Failure to achieve the project cost, schedule, and performance goals can have serious consequences on the ab ility of the agency to meet its strategic goals and objectives and can seriously affect the agency budget for many years. In addition to providing the cost, schedule, and performance goals, agencies should describe: how much development work is involved, the procurement strategy that will be used (including use of competition and fin ancial incentives), how the acquisition will be managed (use of IPT and the performance- based management system that will be used to provide visibility into program status), the risks associated with the acquisition, the probability of achieving the goals, and the thresholds for termination of the project. This material can be taken from the ACP, Appendix 12. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE II. ACQUISITION PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 25 of Capital Programming Guide II. ACQUISITION PHASE Introduction Acquisition Planning started with the steps in the previous phase and resulted in the capital plan that justified the funding to acquire the asset. The Acquisition Phase, for purposes of this Guide, begins after the agency has received funding from the Congress for a segment, module, or the entire asset and ends when the asset is delivered and fully operational. Although this section of the G uide addresses issues that arise when the agency intends to satisfy its requirements using outside contractors, most of the principles are equally germane when the work will be performed in -house. The in -house work must be managed with the same rigor as contractor work. In-house operations are expected to achieve the cost, schedule, and performance goals to ensure success of the project, just as with contractors. While a project charter replaces the contract for in -house work, the other requirements for g ood project management, including the use of EVM in accordance with the EIA 748 standard are applicable for development efforts or multiple projects in a program. Where there are both Government development efforts and contractor development efforts in the same program, the data from the two EVM systems must be consolidated at the reporting level for total program management and visibility. If specific EVM and other project management best practices are not deemed necessary for in -house management, the bus iness case for major acquisitions will need to explain why the agency determined the specific management practice was not germane to the in -house operation. Depending on the results of the research into the capabilities of the market to provide the asset, the agency will begin the process to procure the asset. In most cases, the procurement should be for a commercial item involving limited or no development work. When the risk inherent in development is offset by the high expected return, the procurement m ay begin with a development contract. All projects involve risk, even those that seem ordinary and do not involve high technology. Nevertheless, agencies are expected to award contracts which have a high probability of achieving at least 90 percent of the cost, schedule, and performance goals established in the Planning Phase. The requirements to establish realistic goals and manage the acquisition to meet those goals applies to all contracts, including both development and production contracts. The IPT must ensure that the proposals and in -house estimates clearly recognize the amount and impact of risk on cost, schedule, and technical effort. The contract should provide for a reasonable profit if the contractor meets the risk -adjusted cost, schedule, an d performance goals. It should also provide incentives to the contractor only for cost and schedule reductions while maintaining the expected performance, or for performance improvement while maintaining cost and schedule goals, if performance improvement is actually needed to meet agency strategic goals and objectives. Not every project will achieve the cost -benefit expectations of the Planning and Budgeting Phase. If the EVMS and other management tools indicate that the planning expectations are not r ealized during the Acquisition Phase, agencies should undertake benefit -cost analysis to evaluate whether the benefits of completing the project are worth the additional costs, schedule delays, or performance reductions that would be incurred. Assuming th e re-baselined project has an acceptable cost/benefit ratio, the agency must then compare that ratio with other projects within the agency 's portfolio to determine if the re -baselined project merits continued funding. If not, agencies should concede the sunk-costs and terminate the project. Sound acquisition management requires holding managers accountable. By making the decision makers responsible for their decisions, there will be a greater emphasis in the long run on setting realistic goals and on se eing that they are met. Agencies should establish for the IPT, and others as appropriate, a system of incentives to encourage achievement of the project 's baseline goals. These incentives should include rewards (including bonuses), recognition, and cons ideration in both personnel evaluations and promotion II. ACQUISITION PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 26 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) decisions, when performance of IPT personnel contributes to achieving or exceeding the cost, schedule, and performance goals of the acquisition. Incentives are not appropriate if the acquisition does not achieve its baseline goals. II.1) VALIDATE PLANNING DECISION The Acquisition phase implements the planning discussed earlier in this Guide by using the funding provided via the budget process. The specifics of each acquisition are governed by the Acquisition Plan (AP) which documents the planning decisions. Formal written plans that include all of the information described in Phase I and FAR 7.105 are required for all major acquisitions. The FAR and the agency implementation regulations guide the progr am through the acquisition process from requirement need through close out of the final contract. At the beginning of the Acquisition Phase, the IPT should re -examine the mission need. The IPT should also re-examine the climate risks and the applicabi lity of sustainable design principles. Furthermore, it should re -assess the market capabilities to verify the conclusions reached in the Planning Phase as to whether a commercially available asset can be acquired or limited (or full -scale) development work is needed. The amount of development and complexity of integration are usually the greatest risk factor. Therefore, this validation will have a significant impact on what types of risk treatment and mitigation will be necessary. The IPT should review any prior decisions that development work would be necessary, because technical advances that have occurred since the Planning Phase (or even pre-existing capabilities that were overlooked) could render development work unnecessary. Large, complex implementations of COTS solutions should be broken down into manageable components of useful functionality to reduce risk. Alternatively, the IPT may determine that a decision in the Planning Phase for direct procurement is no longer valid and development is nec essary. When such a determination is made, the analysis and recommendations to change direction should be considered and approved through the portfolio planning process before the IPT proceeds with the acquisition. The IPT should also re -examine how it can make the most effective use of competition and financial incentives. For instance, if full-scale development was originally planned, but now only limited development will be necessary, more commercial firms may be willing to compete. Also, it is generally appropriate to use firm fixed-price or fixed -price incentive contracts if the development is limited or nonexistent. Of course, the re-examination of the contracting method will also lead the IPT to re -examine what type of acquisition management system is necessary to ensure adequate progress and accountability. If the scope of work requires development type work, EVM must be the major management system used. For major acquisitions, the use of interagency contracts and Indefinite Delivery/Indef inite Quality contracts should be limited. Major acquisitions are large dollar acquisitions and the maximum amount of competition should be solicited. The IPT must review the WBS to ensure that it completely defines the program scope of work and will provide the basis to extend the Contract WBS to achieve integrated cost, schedule, and technical performance management. The cost estimates and risk assumptions must be reviewed by the systems engineers and cost estimators to ensure the Government has a soun d basis for negotiating the contract. II.2) MANAGE THE ACQUISITION RISK The most important aspect of the Acquisition Phase is managing the risk. The Program/Project Manager must provide for continual risk management throughout the life of the program/project. Risk management should be built into an agency 's Acquisition processes as a variety of risks may arise in each stage of the Acquisition process. Agencies should also carefully monitor the terms and conditions, including pricing, on which risk allocat ions are determined, to ensure that they reflect value for money. To ensure that all the CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE II. ACQUISITION PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 27 of Capital Programming Guide risk is identified by the Government and contractors, integrated baseline reviews are required either prior to award or as soon as possible after award, as appropriate, and whenever there is a major modification to the program or a baseline change is requested. The purpose of this function during the Acquisition Phase is to: 1) Track, manage, and report risks associated with the Acquisition Phase; 2) Develop the risk management requirements for the RFP; and 3) Based upon the winning proposal, identify new risks associated with the Development and Implementation Phases of the project, and develop necessary mitigation/contingency strategies. An appreciation of business risk management at all levels in the organization will help to ensure that the impact on a project is fully understood and monitored throughout its life. It is important that a risk management strategy is established early in a project and that risk is continually addressed throughout the project life cycle. Risk management includes several related actions involving risk: planning, assessment (identification and analysis), handling, and monitoring. The extent of risk management required by an agency will vary from following routine Acquisition processes to a significant undertaking involving a high level of planning, analysis, and documentation. Risk management increases the number of projects that will meet the established goals. Managem ent of risk is an ongoing process throughout the life of the project, as risk will be constantly changing. Before starting any acquisition, the IPT should update the acquisition plan to ensure that the risk management strategies considered in the Planning Phase remain appropriate. Agencies should address considerations of safety, security, and risk management in acquisition strategy meetings, source selections, award fee structures, and project surveillance. Appendix 5 further describes the risk management process. II.2.1 ) Limiting Development The greatest risk factor to successful contract performance is the amount of development that is planned for the Acquisition. Projects requiring full -scale development have the greatest potential to experience cost overruns, schedule delays and a failure to meet performance goals. Therefore, agencies should procure, to the maximum extent practicable, commercial and non -developmental items to satisfy needs. When commercial or non- developmental items are not availab le, agencies should consider pursuing limited development work. Although limited development still poses more risk to successful contract completion than needing no development, it does not endanger the success as much as full -scale development. Full - scale development should normally only be considered when it promises exceptionally high returns for achievement of strategic goals if it is successful. Full -scale development should not be used if it will cause the agency to reduce service or increase costs if it is not successful. There are several ways of mitigating risk, especially the risk that limited or full development presents. One method is to make use of the Nation 's integrated industrial base (i.e., companies with facilities, design and manu facturing processes, and technologies capable of servicing both commercial and Government needs). When limited development is necessary, agencies should make maximum use of commercial assembly lines, technology, components, and processes. Even when ful l-scale development is required, the commercial marketplace has established processes for development work (e.g., design, quality control, and technologies) that the agency can use in its development effort. Furthermore, there are significant advantages if the contractor establishes a market for II. ACQUISITION PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 28 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) the product of the development effort beyond the current need. This approach creates the need for the contractor to plan for future maintenance. In many large, full -scale development efforts, cost precludes selecti ng anyone other than the original developer to maintain the custom solution. Planning for custom solutions must address the risk of having to pay excessive amounts for future maintenance. II.2.2 ) Using Competition and Financial Incentives The effective use of competition and financial incentives is another means to reduce the risk to successful contract completion. In the earliest stages of the acquisition process, the agency should st ill be looking for innovative solutions to meet its needs. Advance Acquisition Planning (AAP) should be used so that the contracting officer has time to perform any necessary market surveys, prepare a clear solicitation, and effectively identify and use av ailable resources. Given the opportunity, industry can be helpful in proposing innovative solutions. This is more likely to be effective if sufficient time is given for a thorough review of the requirement. Requirements in solicitations should be written not as detailed design specifications, but rather as clear performance standards for asset function and performance, including long-term operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, that allow sources to propose various alternative solutions for meeting the agency 's needs. Additionally, making effective use of competition and financial incentives will help the agency obtain better cost, schedule, and performance goals at contract inception. A major barrier to taking advantage of the Nation' s integrated indu strial base can be the burdens and risks imposed by the Government 's demands, in order to ensure price reasonableness, for offerors to submit certified cost data and/or to comply with the Government 's cost accounting standards. Agencies can avoid this problem by using acquisition strategies that rely on competition and fixed -price contracts to ensure that reasonable value is received for the price paid. Creating a monopoly can create problems far beyond an increased procurement price in the current acquisi tion. Whenever the Government lacks viable alternative sources of supply , the agency may lack a realistic means of enforcing contract cost, schedule, and performance goals. Additionally, the lack of viable alternative sources of supply increases the agen cy's risk of being unable to obtain spare parts and O& M services at reasonable prices. Agency acquisition plans should attempt to avoid monopolies through mitigation techniques such as multi - sourcing and using commercial standards (e.g., interfaces and f ootprints that allow for the use of alternative components). Sometimes (e.g., in an extremely large development effort) the nature of an acquisition effectively precludes competition for the foreseeable future. In such circumstances, an agency must take precautions to mitigate the negative effects of the monopoly (e.g., long-term pricing arrangements for system upgrades and maintenance with source code or technical data in escrow in case of a violation). The use of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts awarded to one contractor for a long term project means that the task orders for future work when defined are negotiated in a sole source environment, even though the FAR classifies the contract as competitive. The Pentagon Renovation Program was conducted in stages relati ng to \" wedges\" in the building. The first phase of the renovation did not use a performance- based contract (PBC) and the design plans included 2,600 pages of detailed design specifications. The renovation of wedges 2 through 5 used a PBC and needed just 16 pages to communicate performance- based requirements. For this second part of the project, potential offerors were encouraged to attend the Government 's requirements definitions meetings help identify performance requirements, not detailed specifications. For example, one of the sustainability requirements for restrooms was that wall surfaces should have a 50 year life. This resulted in Corian being proposed in place of the traditional tile because Corian was significantly less costly on a life-cycle basi s. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE II. ACQUISITION PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 29 of Capital Programming Guide Providing stipends to contractors to cover some or all of proposal costs can provide an effective financial incentive to increase competition. The use of a multi -step source selection process is necessary to effectively use stipends. Stipends to non -successful offerors help defray, but rarely come close to fully covering the costs that offerors expend in responding to RFPs. However, providing a stipend strongly encourages the very best companies to put forth their very best proposals. The Government m ay decide to require permission to use design plans as a precondition to receiving a stipend. Experience in construction contracts has shown that where an optional stipend is given to a non-successful offeror in exchange for the right to use the design pl ans, the stipend is generally readily accepted. The availability of a stipend and the terms governing its use must be identified in the RFP. Financial incentives may reduce risk by motivating contractors to meet cost, schedule, and performance goals. F inancial incentives can take the form of additional profit for reducing cost, faster delivery or improved performance. Incentives must be used properly. One way to motivate cost reduction without jeopardizing contract performance is to motivate based on the \"probable cost \" resulting from the IBR. The incentive must be large enough to be meaningful to the contractor. Significantly faster delivery than required. Agencies need to be mindful of three things when working with delivery or performance incenti ves: Such incentives are only paid for delivery that is faster than not only what is called for in the contract, but also what is normally done in the marketplace. For cost reimbursement contracts, the effort to deliver early to earn the delivery incen tive does not drive up the cost of contract performance. The incentive for delivery will not result in delivery before the Government is ready to use the items. Delivery of goods/services that significantly exceeds Government performance requirements. This is when the contractor delivers a good or service that exceeds the performance requirements (other than delivery time) stated in the contract. Agencies need to be mindful of three things here: Agencies should only motivate performance that is signi ficantly above and beyond contract requirements. For cost reimbursement contracts, agencies should also be careful that the effort to exceed Government requirements to earn the incentive does not drive up the cost of contract performance. The incenti ve should not encourage the provision of performance that exceeds the Government 's needs to meet the agency strategic goals and objectives. This would be a waste of resources that could be used elsewhere in the agency where strategic goals and objectives are not being met. The standards for the payment of incentives must be clearly defined in the contract and incentive payments must not be made if the standards are not met. Paying incentives without clear justification, even for award fee incentives, has been identified in GAO reviews as a major problem area in contract administrations. Rationale for Providing Stipends Proposal Development is very costly; Signals the intent that owners are serious about carrying the project forward; Improves the quality of firms which are submitting; and Encourages proposers to give full effort. II. ACQUISITION PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 30 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) For award fee contracts the award standards must be as clear as possible, but the incentive provisions can be for patterns of behavior, rather than specific measures. If performance evaluation requirements are written too narrowly, the agency may not reward sought -after behavior. While the element of subjectivity must be recognized in evaluating award fees, suggested criteria for award fees may include: Quality of work Problem solving Safety Communications Minority business opportunities II.2.3 ) Using Performance -Based Specifications When developing the statement of work for major contracts, the more design and specification detail included by the Government on \"how to \" meet the contract requirements, the more the Government warrants that the specified \" how\" will meet th e performance requirements of the contract; therefore, the more risk the Government assumes for the success of the project. Performance Work Statement (PWS) may reduce the amount of changes and limit the litigation risk. Using PWS encourages competition by allowing offerors to compete based on providing unique and innovative solutions to performance needs, rather than just price. In this way, the Government benefits from a marketplace of potential solutions and may choose the solutions that best meet the agency 's goals within the available budget. The PWS must include the outcome goals of the acquisition. The outcome goals are normally discussed in the Justification s ection (I.) of the business case, and the performance goals section of the business ca se. The use of Performance -Based Specifications ( PBSs ) is a mandatory requirement for all major acquisitions. Failure to use a PBS, unless justified, will result in a poor evaluation of the acquisition strategy in s ection I.G. of the business case when the business cases are being reviewed by management for funding. II.2.4 ) Establishing an Earned Value Management System The third key principle of risk management in the Acquisition Phase is using Earned Value Management in accordance with the guidelines in EIA Standard 748. The solicitation for the contract, or in -house charter, must contain the FAR EVM provisions for pre - or post-award IBRs, as appropriate, and the EVM clause. The process and schedule for contractor and in - house EVM system validation for meeting the EIA 748 standard through EVMS Compliance Recognition documents or a Compliance Evaluation Review where a compliance document does not exist, and periodic systems surveillance must be also be defined in the solicitation. When considering whether to conduct a pr e- or post -award IBR, the IPT should consider that the baseline established with the initial contract award becomes the original baseline for meeting the requirement to achieve 90 percent of the cost, schedule, and performance goals. Any request for a baseline change after initial award that exceeds the 90 percent threshold will require agency head review and OMB approval before the new baseline may be included in the contract. Agencies need to be cautious and ensure that the incentive awards the appropriate behavior. An agency provided an award fee incentive i f a call center picked up telephone calls within two rings and established a system to monitor the requirement. The contractor met the requirement by hiring more low -paid employees to answer calls, but the overall objective of achieving quality was lackin g. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE II. ACQUISITION PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 31 of Capital Programming Guide The Agency EVM process should be consistent with established best practices. For more information see Appendix 3 , Example of Earned Value Concept and Schedule Variance for Capital Assets. II.3) CONSIDER TOOLS Various tools permit agencies to manage risk in the Acquisition Phase. Three such tools are modular contracting, advisory multi-step acquisitions, and competitive demonstrations/prototyping. All of these tools can be used in combination with each other. II.3.1) Modular Contracting Agencies should, to the maximum extent possible, consider breaking large acquisitions into smaller, more manageable segments or modules. Each module must be an economically and programmatically viable (i.e., useful) segment, as defined in the Glossary. A module should include whatever design, development, prototyping, testing, and production are necessary to obtain the identified functionality. However, a module may be a phase such as Planning, or a part of a phase, such as Development and Selection of Prototypes. Each module should be fully funded (see s ection I.7.2). As technology advances and agency priorities change, the design of subsequent modules may incorporate the se improvements. Modular contracting, therefore, is appropriate even in commercial or non- developmental item Acquisitions. Although modular contracting is generally thought of in terms of contracts for information technology (the Clinger -Cohen Act of 1996 requires that IT contracts be completed within 18 months of the issuance of the solicitation, which almost demands modular contracting for IT), this concept is a best practice for other types of capital assets. This concept is also known as spiral develop ment. In addition, in limited or full-scale development efforts, if program progress falls short of expectations, it usually is easier and less expensive to make adjustments using modular contracting. A modular approach allows the agency to attack risk incrementally, thereby making it easier to manage. Projects may include successive modules, where each module depends upon already completed modules. Projects may also be composed of several parallel modules, provided that, if one fails, the others will still provide a cost- beneficial service. The parameters of a module will vary depending upon the type of asset being acquired or the nature of the asset being developed. The following factors, however, should be considered: Separability . A module should be an economically and programmatically separable segment. The module should be fully funded, have substantial programmatic use that is not dependent on any subsequent module, and be capable of performing its principal functions even if no subsequent modules are acquired. Interoperability . Each module should comply with a common architecture or commercially acceptable technology standards. Increments should be compatible and capable of being integrated with other modules. By using common or commer cially acceptable standards, agencies make competition for subsequent modules a more viable option. For IT acquisitions, modules should also conform to the agency 's master information technology architecture regarding interoperability. Performance requirements. The performance requirement of each module should be consistent with the performance requirements of the completed, overall system and should address interface requirements with other increments. MODULAR CONTRACTING Reduces Risk by: Increasing competition among firms Facilitating fixed-price contracting Accommodating changing technology and agency priorities II. ACQUISITION PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 32 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022) In acquiring the first module, the agency should plan for the acquisition of subsequent modules. Contracts should be structured to ensure that the Government is not required to procure additional modules. The following list provides examples of contracting techniques that may be used to acquire subsequent modules: Include Modules in Initial Contract. This technique is most appropriate when product integration may be a problem, subsequent modules can be clearly defined at contract inception, and options can be exercised shortly after contract award. I f there is going to be other than a minimal amount of delay in awarding the subsequent modules, it may not be prudent to include subsequent modules in the initial contract, because agencies would want the flexibility of taking advantage of technology impro vements or changes in agency priorities. New Solicitation. An agency can issue a new solicitation and award a new contract for subsequent modules. This approach is most appropriate when integration will be relatively easy and there is a pool of contractors that could perform the work without a large capital investment. Task and Delivery Order Contracts. Some agencies have awarded IDIQ contracts with task orders issued for each module. These contracts normally are issued because the agency has not defined the work except in broad terms. These contracts cont ain a high degree of risk as the subsequent task order statements of work can be highly influenced by the contractor and the negotiation for scope of work, cost, and schedule goals is done on a sole source basis. Where possible, agencies should enter into multiple award contracts to maintain effective competition throughout the acquisition. In order to reduce the high risk in IDIQ contracts for major acquisitions , agencies should use competitive prototyping or define the first task order in the solicitation and conduct a full IBR on the two most qualified offeror' s proposals before awarding the contract and first task order. Either of these methods will maintain competition through a detailed review of the proposed solution and provide a clear set of risk-adjusted cost, schedule, and performance goals and a PMB that both the Government and contractor believe can be achieved without major changes. The award of this competitive task order will provide the Government with realistic cost information that can b e used as a basis to negotiate the follow-on sole source task orders. Sole Source. When the original contract does not provide for follow -on modules and it is determined that follow -on modules should be awarded to the original source (see FAR 6.302 -1(a) (2) (ii)), an agency may issue a sole source award for subsequent modules to the supplier of a previous module. This approach is appropriate when the benefits of having the incumbent contractor continue the work outweigh the benefits of competition (e.g. , contractor continuity is necessary to ensure good system integration). Pre -award IBRs should be conducted before the award of any sole source contract to ensure the cost, schedule, and performance goals have been thoroughly reviewed and agreed to by both parties. With modular contracting, agencies are better able to manage developmental risk. Accordingly, agencies ar e more likely to be able to use a firm fixed -price or fixed -price incentive contract for the acquisition of each module. As discussed mo re thoroughly in s ection II.4, using a firm fixed - price contract is the preferred contracting method. Modules can often be acquired on a firm fixed-price basis when a large developmental program could not, because modules reduce the risk to cost, schedule , and performance goals that a large developmental program would otherwise have. Modules also can limit the Government 's exposure when contracting on a cost reimbursement basis because the task is smaller and more likely to be accomplished within goals by the contractor. In addition, the Government may terminate the acquisition with smaller sunk costs if it becomes apparent that the threshold goals will not be met. Mo dular contracting, especially when using an open architecture, can also increase the effective use of competition. The contract base for large development efforts tends to be limited to those large companies CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE II. ACQUISITION PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 33 of Capital Programming Guide that have the Government as their major, if not only, buyer. By breaking the acquisition into smaller pieces, the agency is able to make better use of the Nation 's integrated industrial base by making the competition more attractive to smaller firms as well as firms that do predominantly commercial work. This increases both the quantity and quality of the competition. II.3.2) Advisory Mu lti-Step Acquisition Like modular contracting, a multi-step approach has advantages regardless of the amount of development necessary. In a multi -step approach, the agency asks for limited information in the first phase. The requested information typical ly consists of information about past performance and experience, a conceptual outline of the proposed technical approach (versus a particular technical solution), and a rough order of magnitude pricing. Detailed technical and cost proposals are not recei ved in the first phase. After requesting and evaluating the limited information submitted by potential offerors in the first phase, agencies can then advise each potential offeror whether or not it is a realistic contender for award. In general, when the agency does issue the actual solicitation, in the second phase, all responsible sources, even those sources that participated in the first phase but were advised that they were unlikely to be realistic contenders, as well as sources who did not participate at all in the first phase, are allowed to submit proposals and have those proposals fully considered. A third step may be added to allow for a down-select to two offerors where a pre-award IBR will be conducted on each proposal to finalize the cost, schedule, and performance baselines, complete the risk management plan, and select the best offeror for award of the contract. The type and amount of information the IPT requests in the first -phase step depends on the type of acquisition. In commercial and non-developmental item acquisitions with limited or no development, the information requested in the first step can focus on past performance references and commercial catalogs. Such information would give the IPT a good sense of which offerors have demonstrated their success in applying their capabilities on similar projects. Advising prospective offerors of their competitive viability during the first step should limit the number of full technical and cost proposals the IPT receives. Limiting the number of full proposals received should save valuable resources for both the agency and prospective contractors. Prospective offerors' up-front expenditures wi ll be reduced, and they need not expend more resources until after they have been advised of their likelihood of being competitive for the award. A multi -step process may, therefore, encourage more participation by firms that have successfully performed i n the private sector, but because of the high cost, have not previously chosen to compete for Government contracts. Regardless of whether development is required, a multi -step approach allows the acquisition to benefit substantially from the efficient a nd effective communication between sources and agency personnel. These communications will foster the development of requirements and evaluation criteria that allow the best fit between agency needs and marketplace capabilities. Sources that are advised, based on the first - step review, that they are strong competitors should be encouraged to participate in such a due diligence effort. As a general matter, however, because the interchange occurs before issuance of the solicitation for proposals in the se cond step, all interested sources will have the opportunity to participate. If they are not bound by the requirement in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act and the Small Business Act that all responsible sources be allowed to submit offers, agenc ies can restrict participation in the due diligence effort to those offerors selected in the first phase, making it even more beneficial. This is consistent with the definition of budget authority contained in s ection 3(2) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended by the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990. Multi-s tep acquisition provides incentives to offerors to invest more of their own resources to perform due diligence to learn about agency needs and develop innovative high -value solutions. Once an offeror has been told that, based on the first -step review, it is a leading contender to receive the award , and it knows that only a limited number of other offerors are in that position, the offeror has a strong incentive to work II. ACQUISITION PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 34 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022) with the IPT, end -users, and others to obtain good information about the agency 's needs. Offerors will be able to assess well the gaps between the functionality and performance available using existing assets and the functionality and performance desired. There is also a strong incentive to understand what is expected by those who will have to use, maintain, and rely on the new system. This information and understanding can enhance substantially offerors ' ability to submit high value proposals and avoid contract disputes. It is not necessary in the multi -step process outlined above to include firm requirements or evaluation criteria for the second -step solicitation in the initial notice or before due diligence is complete. As a resu lt, the dialogue between prospective offerors and agency personnel can contribute substantially to the development of requirements and evaluation criteria that yield very effective competition. The benefits of competition depend not only on the number of offers received, but also on how likely the offerors are to submit proposals that will meet the agency 's needs and provide good value. It is better to receive three robust offers than ten mediocre ones. By accommodating and targeting marketplace capabilities that are suitable for meeting agency needs, the refined solicitation (that is produced by a multi -step approach) puts offerors in a good position to propose what the agency actually needs and wants and increases the probability of awarding a contract that represents the best value available in, or capable of being developed by, the marketplace. Of course, if the Government believes it is appropriate (e.g., the development work will be substantial) to o ffer further incentives, the Government may award competing prototype contracts with limits on the total costs to be reimbursed by the Government (see II.3.3 , Competitive Prototyping). This type of contracting can be used if the agency decides a pre-award IBR is necessary to establish a firm baseline with a high probability of achieving the cost, schedule, and performance goals for the contract or module before award to prevent the potential need to ask for a baseline change if the IBR is done after award. Th e term \"prototype \" normally means a physical deliverable that can demonstrate actual performance characteristics. For long -duration contracts that include significant development, it may be impractical to proceed all the way through completion of a prototype. In lieu of a prototype, the Government may require an initial detailed design activity that is sufficient to demonstrate the adequacy of the proposed technical approach and enable the accurate estimation of the cost of development. There is no generally preferred contract pricing mechanism for a multi -step acquisition. The pricing mechanism will depend on the type of acquisition. If the acquisition is for a commercial or non-developmental item or for a limited development effort, i t should be a fixed -price effort; if, however, the acquisition is for a full-scale developmental system, a cost reimbursement contract may be necessary if the risk is too great for a fixed-price contract. For development efforts, however, thresholds should be established beyond which the project would not be cost -beneficial and should be considered for termination. II.3.3 ) Competitive Prototyping To mitigate the risk of full-scale or limited development, agencies may use competitive prototyping. In compe titive prototyping, contractors offering alternative system design concepts are selected to develop prototypes of their products. In acquisitions with limited development, the development work can be completed as part of the prototyping effort. When limited development is done as part of the prototyping effort, the contractor would be ready to move to full -scale production after satisfactorily completing the prototype. Whether full -scale or limited development is contemplated, both contractors and the a gency can use the competitive prototyping phase to exchange information. This opportunity gives the contractor a better idea of what the end -users need. Similarly, it allows the agency to learn what the marketplace can provide. As is the case with multi-step acquisitions generally, continuing needs definition and market research in a due diligence effort\u2014conducted with those sources selected to develop prototypes \u2014allows for an effective and CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE II. ACQUISITION PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 35 of Capital Programming Guide efficient information exchange. This exchange will foster achieving the best fit between agency needs and market capabilities. Prototyping also allows the Government to obtain enough information about the design and production to be able to determine the product 's subsequent affordability. A goal of any prototyping and development effort is to get the project developed to the point that the agency can use firm fixed-price contract for production and/or implementation. If full -scale development is contemplated, competitive prototyping can be used to verify that the chosen concepts are sound, to perform in an operational environment, and to provide a basis of selection of the system design concept to be continued into full -scale development, before the agency commits to large scale funding. Prototypes may range from a principal end item or critical subsystem, to a limited and less than complete development model. It is anticipated that the winning concept and contractor of the competitive prototyping evaluation will then move into full -scale development and initial production. In awarding the prototype contracts, agencies may provide different funding amounts to each contractor depending on several circumstances (e.g., particular design, the amount sought, and the concept 's potential). When using competitive prototyping in advance of full -scale development, the competitive prototyping contracts should provide for contractors to develop and submit proposals for full -scale development and initial production by the conclusion of the prototyping effort. When the agenc y is doing development after the prototyping effort, agencies can use fixed-price contracts in which the performance standards may vary to contain the development effort. If only limited development is necessary, a commercial style approach can be used in which the development can be accomplished as part of a fixed -price prototype contract. This approach contains the development risk and is most appropriate in cases where the development is an extension of a commercial item or otherwise existing techno logy (e.g., for products that can be produced on a flexible manufacturing line). Awarding at least two combined prototyping and development contracts provide a strong incentive for contractors to devise the highest value performance-cost tradeoff. In som e cases, the contractor may choose to invest some of its own resources in development, particularly if the item has commercial as well as Government use. As when prototyping is done in advance of development, agencies may provide different amounts of funding to each contractor. As an alternative to the award of multiple combined prototype and development contracts (i.e., when at least two awards are not feasible) an agency can consider whether an upgrade of the current system (presumably requiring no more than limited development) is a realistic option that would provide competitive pressure. A major benefit of the commercial style approach that combines development with prototyping under competitively awarded fixed price contracts is that it can avoid any need for the submission of certified cost data or compliance with Government cost accounting standards for the purposes of determining the initial price or supporting contract payments. Firms doing business in the commercial market view government demands for the submission of certified cost data, compliance with Government accounting standards and the associated burdens and risks to be among the most significant barriers to their participation in government contracting. The commercial style approach , by avoiding the need for such data and accounting, provides increased access to the Nation 's integrated industrial base and the commercial assembly lines, technology, components, and procedures that can serve as the basis for achieving an agency 's functi onal and performance objectives with only limited development. II.4) SELECT CONTRACT TYPE AND PRICING MECHANISM It is incumbent upon the agency IPT to clearly define the performance requirements and estimated costs for major acquisitions before RFPs are issued. This process starts with the development of the WBS to identify the requirements and the use of cost estimators and systems engineers to develop the Government cost II. ACQUISITION PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 36 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) estimate to be used in the contract negotiations. The Government cannot issue broad based statements of objectives without the basic performance standards and allow the contractors to set the scope of work and costs because the Government has not done sufficient market research and requirements definition to establish initial baselines upon which to evaluate offerors ' proposals. This up-front planning work allows the Government to assess the amount of risk to the contractors and select the appropriate contract type to protect both the Government and contractors from a high probability of program failure to achieve cost, schedule, and performance goals. The objective is to negotiate a contract type and price (or estimated cost and fee) that will result in a reasonable contractor risk and provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance. Agencies should make good use of contract type by matching the type of contract to how much risk there is to meeting the requirement. The amount of developmental risk determines how accurate the Government and the contractor 's cost estimates are likely to be. The Government 's preferred contract type is Firm -Fixed Price (FFP), because this contract type is used when the risk involved is minimal or can be predicted with a reasonable degree of certainty. When used fo r acquisitions with minimal risk this type of contract has the greatest probability of successful achievement of its cost, schedule and performance goals. The use of an EVM system on FFP contracts is based on the nature of the work. If this type of contra ct is used when the acquisition has a significant amount of development work, the Government is required to include the FAR EVM requirements in the contract Fixed -Price Incentive contracts and all cost type contracts should be used as appropriate for the type of risk as discussed in FAR Part 16. These contracts should be performance-based and completion type contracts. Earned Value is required on all of these contracts because of their inherent risk. The business case for major acquisitions that use these types of contracts must clearly explain and list the risk that cannot be mitigated and why the risk cannot be mitigated through another approach. The risk should be quantified in the cost, schedule, and performance goals. Time and Materials and Labor Hour Contracts are not appropriate for major acquisitions that have passed the planning stage. They are to be used only when it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate cost with any reasonable degree of confidence. These types of contracts may be imbedded in the prime contract for short duration unquantifiable work, but never used as the primary vehicle for the delivery of products or services. Earned Value is required on these types of contracts if they are used for development work. For long- duration contracts (that cannot be broken into modules) that include significant development, it may be impossible to estimate the cost of performing the entire contract with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed price or structured incentive contract from day one. As the contract progresses and the ability to estimate the cost of performance increases, the use of such contracts becomes more practical. Therefore, it may be desirable to initiate the work with a small, short duration time and material or cost plus fixed fee contract for studies of early design, evolve to a cost plus award fee or cost plus incentive fee contract for later design and initial development, and then to a cost plus incentive fee, fixed price incentive, or fixed price contract for initial and full -scale production once all development work is complete. For such contracts, it also may be desirable to negotiate the cost or price in increments. The initial e stimated cost or price would be for the studies or early design. As work progresses, the estimated cost or price should be renegotiated upward at appropriate points in the contract as those costs become more predictable. II.5) ISSUE THE SOLICITATION Solicitations should make the most effective use of competition. Generally, increased public exposure to agency functional and performance objectives will increase not only the quantity of solicitation, but also the quality of the procurement. Solicitation ex posure is important, especially when trying to expand the supplier base for major asset acquisitions beyond those few firms that regularly sell only to the Government CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE II. ACQUISITION PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 37 of Capital Programming Guide (sometimes so dependent on Government business that a monopoly exists) to include firms w ith significant commercial sales. In addition to notices in the in Federal Business Opportunities and alternative electronic means when available, the IPT should make sure that upcoming or recently released solicitations get announced in trade journals and at related conferences. The solicitation should explain the mission need in terms of functional and performance objectives (i.e., capability targets versus equipment needs), schedule, and operating constraints. To verify that the performance standards are measurable, the IPT shou ld develop a preliminary quality assurance surveillance plan that defines the process for measuring the standard. Performance standards that cannot be measured need to be deleted and another measurable standard developed. Offerors should be free to propose their own technical approach, main design features, sub -systems, and alternatives to schedule, cost, and functional and performance capability goals. In developing the evaluation factors to be considered for award, agencies should make allowances for trade-offs among technical features and between technical features and cost. Market analysis, as di scussed in the Planning and Budgeting Phase, can help an agency better understand the general capabilities and the state-of -the-art available in the marketplace. However, the IPT should not limit competition unduly by making trade-offs between price and technical factors too early in the solicitation and evaluation process. Targets should be considered for inclusion in solicitations in place of mandatory minimum requirements. Market research continues until contract award. It need not be completed pri or to issuing the solicitation; in fact, it may be counterproductive to do so if it results in the adoption of minimum requirements in the solicitation that severely limit the range of possible best value tradeoffs. Market research includes the information that members of the Source Selection Team and IPT gain after receipt of offers, but prior to award, as a result of reviewing offers and communications with offerors. In issuing the solicitation, agencies should consider as an evaluation factor the manner in which the offeror proposes to deal with the various risk considerations. For example, the evaluation strategy in the solicitation should prefer proposals that offer limited or no development over those that offer full -scale development. The solici tation must require the contractor to operate and maintain an earned value management system to manage the acquisition during its performance period. The system must provide, at a minimum, monthly status reports to the agency IPT on the achievement of, or deviation from, the cost, schedule, and performance goals established for the acquisition. The solicitation for all major acquisitions must contain the appropriate FAR EVM provision for either a pre -award IBR or a post -award IBR, and the FAR EVM clause ( see FAR Part 34). In addition, the agency must include the reporting requirements for the agency 's oversight needs. Additional reporting may be necessary to manage programs that are not meeting goals. Non-major acquisitions should use EVM to the extent necessary to ensure the program meets its cost, schedule, and performance goals. The solicitation must also provide for the accomplishment of EVM system acceptance reviews for verifying a previous system acceptance or conducting an acceptance review, as needed. The schedule for system surveillance reviews should also be included. If an agency wanted to buy a specific fleet asset, it might try to discover every capability avail able in the market place and then, before issuing the solicitation, establish which capabilities it wants. A better way is to solicit for that particular asset, including any particular target performance capabilities the agency wants, and wait for the various bid offers to come in before making trade -offs. II. ACQUISITION PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 38 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) IPTs should conduct orientation briefings for industry and allow industry to comment on the acquisition strategy and a draft solicitation. The objectives are to clarify the sol icitation requirements and remove inhibitors to innovative solutions. II.6) PROPOSAL EVALUATION AND NEGOTIATION A Source Selection Team (SST) (whose members come from the IPT) should evaluate proposals based on the evaluation criteria in the solicitation. The SST should determine to what extent each proposal meets the criteria included in the solicitation and compare the proposals to each other based on those determinations. If appropriate, the SST should conduct negotiations with offerors to clarify and improve proposed technical solutions and costs. The team should prepare analyses and recommendations for presentation to senior management. If a pre-award IBR is required, it must be included in the proposal evaluation process during the best value tradeoff analysis. If a pre- award IBR was not contemplated at the time of the solicitation, but the SST determines that the proposals received do not clearly demonstrate that the cost, schedule, and performance goals have a high probability of being met, an IB R can be conducted before the award is made. In selecting from competing alternatives, the reviewers, consistent with the solicitation, should consider: Functional and performance capabilities of the proposed solutions in relation to the mission needs and program objectives, including resources required and benefits to be derived by trade -offs, where feasible, among technical performance, acquisition costs, sustainable design principles, ownership costs, and time to develop and field. The competitors ' relative accomplishment record (past performance). Offeror 's documentation from a Cognizant Contracting Officer or a Cognizant Federal Agency that has conducted a systems acceptance review that the EVM system proposed for use meets the guidelines in EIA Standard 748. The SST should ensure that the documented syste m is compatible with the contemplated contract and that the contractor will actually use it to manage the project. If the offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with the EIA Standard, the offeror 's comprehensiv e plan for compliance must be reviewed to ensure the system will likely be validated in a reasonable time to provide adequate reporting on contract status. The SST must schedule the systems acceptance review within the time established in the contract. The contracting agency should ensure that the documented system is compatible with the contemplated contract and that the contractor will actually use it to manage the project. The contract must set a specific time for the system to be acceptable. For long- duration contracts that include significant development, the effects of competition will drive competing suppliers to make overly optimistic estimates of the cost of performing the contract. If a contract is awarded at an estimated cost or price that is substantially less than the probable cost of performing the contract, the likelihood that the Government will receive the product or service on time and within the cost estimates is unlikely. If the contract requirements were appropriately written to r eflect the true needs of the agency to meet its strategic goals and objectives, a low probable cost of performing the contract will result in the project 's failure to meet essential goals. The evaluation process must require competitors to demonstrate the realism of their proposals to actually achieve the cost, schedule, and performance goals. Agencies are graded on their ability to achieve major acquisition goals, because failure to meet those goals causes budgeting and performance problems for the agency and reflects badly on the agency 's and the project manager 's ability to provide for the commitment to the public to be good stewards of public funds. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE II. ACQUISITION PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 39 of Capital Programming Guide One method to reduce the probability of acquisitions not meeting original goals is to conduct an IBR prior to the award of any contract. An IBR may be conducted on the selected offeror or on the best two offerors. If the IBR is to be conducted on the best two offerors, provision for payment to both for the conduct of the IBRs should be made. The savings from keeping competition in the process until the end of the IBRs will more than cover the cost of conducting the IBRs. Deficiencies identified by the Government evaluation team during the IBR must be conveyed to the competitor, and corrected by proposal revis ions. The estimated cost or price of any resulting contract must include the cost of correcting those deficiencies. II.7) CONTRACT AWARD The Source Selection Authority (SSA) selects the successful contractor. If a trade-off process (see FAR Part 15.101- 1) is used, the award decision should ensure that any higher price paid is worth the perceived benefits, and is within the planned funding level for the project. However, if cost, schedule, or performance parameters proposed by the contractor offering the best value to the Government do not achieve program objectives within funding limitations, the SSA should discuss the funding shortfall with the Executive Review Committee. The Executive Review Committee will then decide if the project 's revised cost-benefit ratio, in comparison with other potential projects, remains large enough, given the new information, to warrant award of the contract. If not, the SSA should terminate the acquisition and evaluate how and why the process failed. II.8) CONTRACT MANAGEMENT The success or failure of capital asset acquisitions to achieve cost, schedule, and performance goals can significantly affect the agency 's ability to maintain budget discipline and achieve its strategic plan. Program managers need visibili ty early on into a contract 's progress to identify any problems. This allows time for contractors and the Government to implement corrective actions before significant deviation from goals . Agency financial management and control systems should have act ivity-based costing capability to accumulate the actual costs of the project and integrate them with performance indicators to give program managers a clear understanding of how resources are connected to results. If corrective actions cannot be implemented to maintain the expected return on investment, the contract can be terminated with limited loss, and planning for another solution may begin promptly. Information from the contractor 's management system should be incorporated in the agency 's financial m anagement and control system. The agency 's system should accumulate the actual costs of the project (including both contract costs and agency program management costs) and integrate them with performance indicators to give program managers a clear underst anding of how resources are connected to results. Appendix 3 provides an example of the earned value management system concept. If a pre -award IBR was not conducted, it is essential that a post -award IBR be performed as soon as practical after contract award. This IBR must be completed no later than six months after contract award. If the post -award IBR results in a change to the cost, schedule, and performance goals, the new baseline must be approved by the ERC and OMB before being implemented. Using EVM, the contractor plans its work using a contractually specified work breakdown structure as the baseline. The objectives, tasks, services, or deliverables that must be produced by the organization are described in the work breakdown structure. The IP T ensures that the contractor plans, budgets, and schedules the work effort in time-phased \"planned value \" increments constituting a performance measurement baseline (time-phased budget). The contractor assigns the planned work for cost accumulation and i ndividual responsibility to control accounts and subsidiary work packages under the cost -control accounts. The sum of the budgets for all the work packages scheduled to be accomplished is the \"planned value \" of the effort. This is called the Budgeted Cost for Work Scheduled. II. ACQUISITION PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 40 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) By integrating the responsible organization and the specific deliverables at the control account or work package level, the project manager can see the relationship between the work and the responsible resources. The program manager can pinpoint both where problems occur and the responsible party. Work that does not earn its planned value can be identified so that corrective actions can be taken and new estimates of budget needs made. As work is completed in the work packages, it is \"earned \" on the same budget dollar basis as it was planned. The sum of the budgets for completed work packages and completed portions of open work packages is the earned value. This is called the Budgeted Cost for Work Performed. The cost actually in curred and recorded in accomplishing the work performed within a given time period is called the Actual Cost of Work Performed. Measuring the amount of work accomplished against the original planned baseline and against actual costs provides critical management visibility on the achievement of, or deviation from, goals. Management systems that only track actual expenditures against planned expenditures fail to provide the key piece of management information \u2014amount of work actually accomplished\u2014needed to make appropriate decisions about the status of the contract. Milestones must be defined in terms of products or functions that are measurable through demonstration or observation such that the percentage of completion can be determined in terms of dollars expended for milestones at certain points in time. Contractor accounting systems should accumulate actual costs of accomplished work, which is compared with earned value, providing a cost variance for the accomplished work and indicating whether the wor k is over- or under -running its plan. Planned value, earned value, and actual cost data provide an objective measure of performance, enabling trend analysis and evaluation of cost estimated at completion at all levels of the acquisition. The EVMS will pr ovide useful information for all levels of the management team. The contractor 's EVMS will provide the following information for analysis: Change control Cost variance Understanding of whether technical objectives are being achieved Variance analysis Performance variance Schedule variance Identification of problem areas at both the organization and work breakdown structure levels. Variance at completion analysis II.9) ACQUISITION ANALYSIS II.9.1) Contract Performance Evaluation The IPT should receive monthly, or more often if necessary, status reports from the contractor on the acquisition. Direct access to the contractor 's EVM system, if negotiated into the contract, can substitute for or supplement formal reporting. If the acquisition is not achieving cost, schedule, or performance goals, the IPT should determine the reasons for the deviations and the corrective actions planned by the contractor. The corrective actions should be evaluated as to whether they are likely to be effective. If the corrective action cannot return the contract within goals before contract completion, it must at least ensure that the deviations will not continue to expand and that the current estimates to complete the contract are realistic. Agencies should establish thr esholds for deviation from goals that require Executive Review Committee notification when exceeded. If the threshold goals will not be achieved at contract completion, the IPT CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE II. ACQUISITION PHASE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 41 of Capital Programming Guide should prepare an analysis of the estimated changes in cost, schedule, and per formance goals and whether the acquisition would remain cost -beneficial and should continue to receive priority in comparison to other projects at the new funding levels. It is important to note that a recommendation to reduce the performance requirements also affects the amount of cost and schedule overruns. Not only has the ability to meet strategic goals and objectives been a ffected, but the costs and schedules are for a lesser amount of work so the deviations must be adjusted upward to reflect the lesser scope of work. The IPT's analysis and recommendations should be evaluated by the Executive Review Committee for a determination to : (1) continue the acquisition (by reallocating or seeking additional funds through OMB); (2) restructure the acquisition with lower goals (and not seek additional funding); or (3) terminate the acquisition. Periodic status reports should be provided by the IPT to the Executive Review Committee on all major acquisitions, even if they are within goals. Because of changin g technology, mandates, and mission, a project within goals may no longer provide the agency with the highest return on the use of the funds. II.9.2) OMB RMO Review OMB 's RMO staff will review status information for all major acquisitions at least once a year, or as necessary, for critical acquisitions and those other major acquisitions that are not projected to achieve established goals. RMOs may request a sample or all of an agency 's Major Acquisition Business Case with the annual budget submission to OMB. OMB reviews the reasons for deviation from goals, the reasonableness of the corrective actions proposed, and the validity of increased cost estimates. OMB considers approving a re -baseline proposal only when the agency has provided justification, based on an IBR, demonstrating the new goals have a high probability of success and that the acquisition will still have a benefit -cost result that justifies continued funding after comparison with the other projects in the portfolio and budget limitations. Acquisitions not meeting objectives that have no acceptable plan for fixing the problems may be recommended for termination and the agency instructed to return to the Pla nning Phase for consideration of alternative solutions. If OMB agrees to the new baseline and the Congress funds it, the project may measure deviations from the new baseline, but all reporting on the project/program must also show the deviations from the original baseline. II.10) ACCEPTANCE Acceptance is the final step in the Acquisition Phase. Upon acceptance of the asset, the asset moves to the Management -in-Use Phase. The IPT should ensure the asset meets the requirements of the contract. Often this will be accomplished through an acceptance test plan. Acceptance testing can be performed during and/or at the end of contract performance. Effective testing will determine whether the agency received the benefits it anticipated and whether the system is acceptable for use in accomplishing the agency 's mission. Agencies should invest adequate resources to ensure that there is a thorough test plan. A thorough plan is one that will accurately deter mine if the contractor 's product meets all of the requirements of the contract. The plan should also determine whether the asset is capable of meeting the program needs and providing the projected benefits which supported the project. If a commercial or non-developmental item is procured, the IPT should consider using commercial quality standards or the contractor 's quality system to ensure acceptability. Where appropriate, independent validation, verification, quality assurance processes, and regressio n testing should be required as part of testing for acceptance. Having established a thorough test plan, managers should ensure it is followed, the tests are performed rigorously, and acceptance does not occur unless each item of the test plan is fully met. Properly conducted II. ACQUISITION PHASE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 42 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) demonstrations evidencing the product 's ability to meet the test plan and program needs and to provide the anticipated benefits are very important. Time should be planned in the contract schedule for such demonstrations. Agencies should also ensure that unacceptable ratings with respect to contract requirements are effective disincentives to a contractor 's poor performance. When appropriate, agencies should withhold payment or fee depending on the contract 's payment mechanisms. Agencies should also make it a policy to use accurate performance ratings in subsequent contract award decisions. If the agency accepts the asset with deviations from the contract requirement, these deviations should be documented, including any considera tion (e.g., reduction in price) received from the contractor as required by the contract. Formal contractor performance evaluations are required to be completed by the IPT at least annually and at completion of the contract. These evaluations are entered into the past performance database used by the agency. The evaluations must reflect an accurate summary of the contractor 's performance in meeting the cost, schedule, and performance goals from the beginning to the end of the contract. When entered in the past performance database they provide a contract performance record that can be used by Government source selection teams when evaluating the contractor 's potential for other contract awards. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE III. MANAGEMENT IN-USE OMB Circular No. A-11 (2022 ) Page 43 of Capital Programming Guide III. MANAGEMENT IN- USE Introduction The Management -In-Use Phase begins after completion of the Acquisition Phase. Effective Management - In-Use requires the continuous monitoring of an a gency 's inventory of capital assets to ensure they are maintained at the right size, cost, and condition to support agency mission and objectives. Management - In-Use is generally the longest phase of the investment or asset life-cycle. Ownership costs, such as operations, maintenance (including service contracts), energy use, and disposition, can often consume more than 80 percent of the total life -cycle costs. Agencies must review, properly plan for, and actively manage their investment during this phase and employ effective measures of an asset 's financial and physical condition and its operational support for the agency mission. This portion of the Guide describes tools that can be used to ensure the continued viability of each capital asset to support the agency mission. Unlike other sections of this guide, the actions in the Management -In-Use Phase can o ccur simultaneously , and some activitie s necessarily occur iteratively. III.1) OBJECTIVES DURING MANAGEMENT -IN-USE Key objectives during the Management -in-Use Phase are: 1) to demonstrate either that the existing investment is meeting the needs of the agen cy, delivering expected value, or that the investment is being modernized and replaced consistent with the agency 's enterprise architecture; and 2) to identify smarter and more cost -effective methods for delivering performance and value. Thus, an operational analysis seeks to examine specific areas such as: Customer Results, Strategic and Business Results, and Financial Performance. The following questions help reveal useful information about each area: Are annual operating and maintenance costs compar able to the estimates developed during the Selection, Planning, and Budgeting Phases? (Financial Performance) Are operational costs to the customer as low as they could be for the results delivered? (Customer Results) Is the asset meeting performance goa ls established during the Selection and Planning Phases? (Customer Results) Is the asset performing in accordance with the sustainable design? (Strategic and Business Result s) Is the asset continuing to meet stakeholder needs? (Customer Results) Does t he asset continue to meet business needs and contribute to the achievement of the organization' s current and future strategic goals? (Strategic and Business Results) Are there smarter or more cost effective ways of deliver the functionality? (Financial P erformance) To ensure sound investment decisions throughout the life of the asset, managers at all levels must use the information derived from these types of questions. III. M ANAGEMENT IN-USE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 44 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) III.2) OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS IS A KEY TOOL IN MANAGEMENT -IN-USE Operational analysis is a method of examining the ongoing performance of an operating asset investment and measuring that performance against an established set of cost, schedule, an d performance goals. An operational analysis is, by nature, less structured than performance reporting methods applied to developmental projects and should trigger considerations of how the investment 's objectives could be better met, how costs could be r educed, and whether the organization should continue performing a particular function. While great emphasis is often placed on meeting the budget, scope, schedule, and goals during the Acquisition Phase, developmental costs are only a fraction of the asset 's total life -cycle costs. Operations is a critical area where improved effectiveness and productivity can have the greatest net measurable benefit in cost, performance, and mission accomplishment. A periodic, structured assessment of the cost, perform ance, and risk trends over time is essential to minimizing costs in the operational life of the asset. Beyond the typical developmental performance measures of cost and schedule performance, an operational analysis should seek to answer more subjective q uestions in the specific areas of: Customer Satisfaction, Strategic and Business Results, Financial Performance, and Innovation In addressing Customer Satisfaction, the analysis should focus on whether the investment supports customer processes as desi gned. The focus is on how well the investment is delivering the goods or services it was designed to deliver. Strategic and Business Results measure the effect the investment has on the perform ance of the organization itself, and should provide a measure of how well the investment contributes to the achiev ement of the organization' s strategic goals. In measuring the Financial Performance of an operating asset, the operational analysis should compare current performance with a pre-established cost baselin e. While financial performance is typically expressed as a quantitative measure, the investment should also be subjected to a periodic\u2014preferably annual \u2014review for reasonableness and cost efficiency. In addition to measuring performance , agencies shoul d look for opportunities to apply new and innovative techniques to the investment. It also demonstrates that the agency has revisited alternative methods o f achieving the same mission needs and strategic goals. Operational analysis is also an opportuni ty to conduct a qualitative analysis of the investment 's performance in a holistic fashion. The analysis should address issues such as greater utilization of technology or consolidation of investments to better meet organizational goals and also include an ongoing review of the status of the risks identified in the investment 's Planning and A cquisition Phases. OMB Circular No. A -123, Management 's Responsibility for Internal Control, emphasizes effectiveness and efficiency of operations as one of its three core objectives. Agencies should ensure that the appropriate controls are in place to make sure that the asset is being managed effectively. For capital investments, the greatest l evel of operational efficiency occurs at the asset or project level. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of operational data collection, whenever possible, an agency should employ an efficient way of collecting and analyzing operating cost and performance data. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE III. MANAGEMENT IN-USE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 45 of Capital Programming Guide Operational analysis may indicate a need to redesign or modify an asset if previously undetected faults in the design, construction, or installation are discovered during the course of operations; if operational or maintenance costs are higher than anticipated; or if the asset fails to meet program requirements. Operational analysis may show a need to apply an improvement methodology, such as value management, to identify better ways for the asset to meet its life- cycle cost and performance goals. Such analysis may also help to identify where faulty operations are eroding the asset 's ability to perform its function. Operational analysis will lose much of its benefit to the capital programming process if early warning indicators do not serve as a trigger mechanism within the agency to take corrective actions. III.3) OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS PROCESS AND OUTCOME The operational analysis process consists pr imarily of tracking and identifying the operational cost and performance of assets in the Management -In-Use Phase of their life cycle. If any of the cost, schedule, or performance variances are 10 percent or more, agencies are to provide a complete analysis of the reasons for the cost overrun or performance gap with planned actions to correct the variance or to share techniques that generated the savings. Agency discussions should address lessons learned, why the problems occurred, or how the savings were realized. If the asset cost or schedule variance is +/ - 10 percent and/or if the performance goals are not being met, then the project requires a more in -depth operational review in which relevant indicators will be applied for analysis purposes. The ou tcome of the analysis may include recommendations to redesign or modify an asset before it becomes a problem or to identify areas where cost of ownership can be reduced . Regardless of the performance of operational indicators, a formal operational analysis is warranted for every steady -state project. Recommendations and evaluations will be consolidated into the project 's operational analysis plan. This plan will be reviewed and updated periodically , as future operational analyses will be conducted yearly or on an as -needed basis. Agencies must submit information about their data collection methods and evidence that the methods used lead to the collection and use of valid and accurate performance data. Only current, complete, accurate, and relevant data can help the agency to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources, compare actual vs. planned results, and provide meaningful feedback to improve the planning process. The collection and verification of accurate asset or investment data should be a priority in establishing the baseline and collecting actual operational data. III.3.1) Continuous Monitoring Whether an asset is newly acquired or already operational, focus should be placed on analyzing each asset 's ability to support the organizational mission. Continuous monitoring of both supply (the assets currently available in the inventory) and demand (the agency 's changing mission requirements) is essential. The resulting gap analysis should be documented in the Enterprise Architecture (EA), Real Property Asset Management Plan, or other strategic planning tool. These tools document the agency 's strategy for integrating capital programming and agency mission requireme nts. The agency should analyze their portfolio of capital assets, set goals and priorities for the optimization of the inventory, explain their use of performance indicators and analysis in decision -making, and develop a strategic timeline outlining improvement initiatives. III. MANAGEMENT IN-USE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 46 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022) III.3.2) Operations and Maintenance Poorly performing assets detract from mission effectiveness by utilizing resources that could be used more effectively to support other mission priorities. If not properly managed, a capital asset 's useful life can be shortened dram atically or prolonged beyond the planned termination date at high cost and risk, thereby reducing the return on the taxpayers ' investment. Each asset should have an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) plan that outlines the procedures and responsibilities fo r scheduled preventive and regular or routine corrective maintenance. The elements of an Operations and Maintenance Plan include: For scheduled preventative maintenance: o Sign-offs to instill personal responsibility, o Training of use staff, and o Tracking of labor and material costs. For predictable corrective maintenance: o Budget expenditure for minor maintenance and repair, and o Maintenance contracts. A 100,000 square foot (sf) office building just outside of Washington, D.C. is separately metered for all utilities. The owner began comparing the facility 's utility costs to properly adjusted private sector benchmarks and discovered that the asset 's electricity costs were $1.20/sf over market averages. The asset mana ger alerts field personnel who are able to study and correct the problem, saving over $120,000 per year in wasted electricity charges. If the building were part of a larger facility or complex of buildings where one electricity meter monitored the entire complex, for accounting purposes the electricity costs would be allocated by square foot across the entire complex of assets (a common occurrence). The $120,000 in wasted electricity costs is no longer easily recognizable, and never raises the red flag for management attention. Executive Order 13327, the Federal Property Reform Management Act (P.L. 114 -318), and the corresponding guidance issued by the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) and the Office of Management and Budget , define s the basic descriptive elements each A gency should know about every asset in their real property inventory. All data is required to be collected at the individual, constructed asset level and reported to the Federal Real Property Profile database, managed by the General Servi ces Administration, on an annual basis. In addition to a number of key inventory data elements, the guidance also identifies performance measures for real property, including: Operating Costs per Square Foot\u2014Costs attributed to recurring maintenance and re pair, utilities, janitorial and roads/grounds expenses. Condition Index (CI) \u2014A m easure of a facility 's condition at a particular point in time. The FCI rating is a ratio of the cost of repair needs of the asset divided by the current replacement value of the asset. Office Space Utilization (Square Feet per Person) \u2014Agen cies report office space utilization in square feet per person to help identify office space that can be used more efficiently, consolidated, or disposed. Anal yzed separately and in com bination with each other, along with other key data points, the performance measures can help the agency determine reinvestment priorities. These and other agency -specific performance indicators and data points are powerful tools that allow agencies to segment their entire asset portfolio in a quantitative, objective manner for analysis. This is discussed further in section III. 4, Asset Disposition. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE III. MANAGEMENT IN-USE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 47 of Capital Programming Guide To ensure efficient operations, relevant and appropriate public and private sector benchmarks should be implemented whenever possible. For example, real property managers should benchmark an asset 's janitorial costs against those of their private sector counterparts. As a reminder, benchmarks should be adjusted to reflect differences in accounting practices (i.e., capitalization thresholds or indirect costs), if necessary. Combined with strategic targets, benchmarks contribute significantly to improved performance management and informed decision-making. Some agencies have implemented computerized mainten ance management systems (CMMS) to manage their preventive maintenance and service call workload. These systems automatically generate and track: Instructions and schedules for preventive maintenance Equipment warranty information and automatically filing claims when appropriate New work orders Service call response time and customer satisfaction Service call history to alert management to potential problem areas The use of these systems allows management to measure operating performance against establish ed goals such as system downtime, preventive maintenance hours, or backlog. Service call history along with other diagnostic tools can help managers proactively identify and correct deficiencies in advance of breakdown, reducing unexpected downtime and re pair costs. III.3.3) Post -Implementation Review and Post -Occupancy Evaluation Whereas operational analysis is a control mechanism during the operational life cycle of an asset, the Post - Implementation Review (PIR) for IT projects and a similar Post -Occupa ncy Evaluation (POE) for construction projects are diagnostic tools to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the agency 's capital planning and acquisition process. The primary objectives of a PIR/POE are: To identify how accurately a capital investment project meets the objectives, expected benefits, and the strategic goals of the agency; To ensure continual improvement of an agency 's capital programming process based on lessons learned; and To minimize the risk of repeating past mistakes by providing quality services to business partners and customers. Both a PIR and a POE evaluate an investment 's efficiency and effectiveness to determine how well the investment achieved the planned functionality and anticipated benefits. The POE also determines if the investment supports the mission efforts and strategic plan as originally identified. It is an essential and valuable component in soliciting customer feedback and incorporating that feedback into improvements to the performance and delivery of the capital investment process. The PIR and POE have a dual focus: They provide assessments of implemente d investments, including an evaluation of the development process; and They indicate the extent to which the agency 's decision -making processes are sustaining or improving the success rate of capital investments. Team membership: The PIR and POE teams sh ould be comprised of individuals not directly involved in the acquisition of the asset. Members can include owners and users of the asset, other personnel, and consultants. III. M ANAGEMENT IN-USE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 48 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) Factors to be considered include: Customer/User Satisfaction Strategic impact and effectiveness Business process support Investment performance Internal Business Project performance Infrastructure availability Standards and compliance Maintenance Evaluations (accuracy, timeliness, program quality, adequacy of information) Employee satisfaction/retention Strategic Impact and Effectiveness System impact and effectiveness Alignment with mission goals Portfolio analysis and management Cost savings Innovation Workforce competency Advanced technology use Methodology expertise To ensure that each asset is evaluated consistently, the organization should have a documented methodology for conducting these reviews. The methodology chosen must be in alignment with the organization' s planning process and must build on the organization' s memor y. The organization should determine whether there may be better cost, benefit, and risk measures that could be established that would improve the monitoring of future projects. A mechanism should also be in place that takes the lessons learned through the PIR or POE and uses th ose lessons to update the Planning and Budgeting Phase decision criteria as well as the Acquisition and Management -in-Use processes. III.3.3.1) Post -Occupancy Evaluation (POE) A Post -Occupancy Evaluation (POE) is usually conducted 12 months after the construction project has been beneficially occupied. The 12 -month review timeframe allows sufficient time for the customer to evaluate systems performance and relevant aspects of project delivery. Agencies, however, may perform the P OE at different times to meet their unique requirements. The POE team reviews the provided information and assesses process successes as well as failures. Areas for improvement are analyzed and improvements to the process are evaluated. Some common POE activities include: Commissioning Completing the POE questionnaire Analyzing the completed questionnaire Interviewing key stakeholders Measuring performance Providing recommendations for process improvements III.3.3.2) Post -Implementation Review (PIR) The Post -Implementation Review (PIR) usually occurs either after a system has been in operation for about six months or immediately following investment termination. The review should provide a baseline to decide whether to continue the system without adj ustment, to modify the system to improve performance or, if necessary, to consider alternatives to the implemented system. Some common elements reviewed during the PIR include: CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE III. MANAGEMENT IN-USE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 49 of Capital Programming Guide Mission alignment IT architecture including security and internal controls Performance measures Project management Customer acceptance Business process support Financial performance Return on investment Risk management Gaps or deficiencies in the process used to develop and implement the initiative Best practices that can be applied to other investments or the capital planning process At a minimum, a PIR team should evaluate stakeholder and customer/user satisfaction with the end product, mission/program impact, and technical capability, as well as provide decision-makers with lessons learned so they can improve investment decision-making processes. Even with the best system development process, it is quite possible that a new system will have problems or even major flaws that must be rectified to obtain full investment benefits. The PIR should provide decision -makers with useful information on how best to modify a system, or to work around the flaws in a system, to improve performance and bring the system further into alignment with the identified business needs. To minimize inadequate returns on low value or high cost IT investments, the agency will conduct periodic reviews of operational systems to determine whether they should be retained, modified, replaced, or retired. With the emergence of new business and process requirements, and new and updated technology, systems should be assessed to determine the extent to which they continue to support the agency 's mission and business objectives. III.4) ASSET DISPOSITION Asset disposition is the cul mination of previous planning, budgeting, and acquisition efforts. But the determination to dispose of a capital asset should not be an afterthought once obsolescence is reached. Agencies have established best practices in the disposition of capital assets, focusing primarily on real property and information technology assets. The methodologies presented are general and may be applicable to the disposition of other types of capital assets, such as motor vehicle, ship, and aircraft fleets. A wide variety o f statutes, regulations, and other authorities govern the disposition of Federal assets. It is important that agencies comply with the applicable authorities . III.4.1) The Decision Process Disposition of an asset is the culmination of the processes discussed earlier in this Guide. Projected costs of asset disposal are critical elements in the planning and budgeting for asset acquisition. The decision to dispose of an asset may be triggered by any number of events; most will be part of a systematic plan formulated in advance that integrates the asset into the agency 's broader Capital Asset Plan. Beginning with mission analysis and planning for the purpose of matching capabilities to mission requirements, and continuing with ongoing analysis, criteri a are established and monitored to determine the condition of the asset and how well it is performing. If an asset becomes uneconomical to keep in service or fails to meet performance criteria, the agency should critically assess the asset to determine wh ether it should be retired, replaced, enhanced, or refurbished. III. M ANAGEMENT IN-USE CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 50 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) The following questions are a starting point to assist agencies in determining whether or not any type of capital asset is a candidate for disposition. It is important that all appropriate s takeholders are involved in the decision process. Does the capital asset still support the mission? Is the asset wholly or partly unneeded? Is the asset being put to optimum use? Is the asset functionally obsolete or has it deteriorated beyond economical repair? Will program changes alter asset requirements? Is the asset used only irregularly for program use? Would a portion of the asset satisfy program needs? Is continued Federal ownership and operation of the property justified in light of its current use? Are operating and maintenance costs excessive? Can the asset be made available for use by others within or outside the Federal community? Are there security or other considerations that outweigh disposition of the asset? III.4.2) Real Property Assets and Information Technology Considerations The two major categories of capital assets are Real Property Assets and Information Technology Systems. Both of these capital asset types have similar life-cycles within the Federal Government. However, both types of assets also have their own unique characteristics and considerations, which are explained in turn below. III.4.2.1) Real Property Assets Executive Order 13327, Federal Real Property Asset Management , issued on February 6, 2004, establishes the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) and addresses many of the opportunities and challenges of asset disposition within the Federal Government. Agencies are expected to dispose of unneeded assets, in accordance with applicable statutes, to ensure that the agen cy real property inventory of assets is maintained at the right size, cost, and condition. Inventories should contain mission-critical and mission -dependent assets that are maintained in the appropriate condition and operated at the right cost. Additiona l Real Property Considerations. In addition to the considerations highlighted above in section III.4.1, the following should also be considered when evaluating real property assets for disposition: Is the asset uneconomical to retain? If so, could it b e sold or exchanged for a more suitable asset with lower maintenance and operating costs, at a price roughly equivalent to the value of the present asset? Considering the cost of acquisition or lease, moving costs, preparation of the new space, operation and maintenance costs, and the increase in efficiency of operations, can net savings to the Federal Government be realized by relocation? What effect does the availability of alternative facilities, if required, have on the foregoing? III.4.2.2) Informa tion Technology Growing demands for performance require increased and sharpened focus on management in use and disposition of information technology assets. Overall IT investments in steady -state assets have increased in each year since 2003. During this same period, investments in development, modernization, and enhancements have trended downward. Agency c apital planning and i nvestment control processes should lead to overall reductions or stabilization in costs during the m anagement -in-use of all c apital assets. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE III. MANAGEMENT IN-USE OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 51 of Capital Programming Guide Additional IT Considerations. In addition to the considerations highlighted above in section III.4.2 , the following should also be considered when evaluating IT assets for disp osition: Does the effect on program performance measures justify the cost to operate and maintain the asset? Is the asset compliant with current security, architectural, and technological standards? III.4.3) Decision Models Agencies are encouraged to use dec ision models to determine if an asset should exit the agency inventory of capital assets. Decision models define and document the decision process, ensuring a consistent application of identified criteria in deciding a course of action. As discussed earlier in this guide, the FRPC developed four performance measures (operating and maintenance costs, utilization index, condition index, and mission -dependency) to facilitate the continuous monitoring of real property assets. Agencies should apply the f our performance measures to segment their portfolio and identify assets that are candidates for disposition. A decision tree is just one of many diagnostic tools available to supplement agency portfolio analysis and provide additional information for deci sion-making. Specific examples of real property and IT assessment models can be found in Appendix 9 . III.4.4) Executing the Asset Disposal Plan The procedure for disposition of an asset will depend upon the type of asset, as well as existing agency guidelines and any laws and regulations governing the disposal of that particular asset ( for example , Executive Order 12999, of April 17, 1996, authorizing Federal agencies to donate excess computers and related peripheral tools directly to schools). Upon de termining that an asset is a candidate for disposition, agencies must consider a broad range of regulatory requirements to ensure that all proper procedures are followed and all alternatives are considered before an asset is disposed. For example, a speci alized contractor following environmental laws monitored by EPA would most likely perform hazardous material disposal, while GSA, following real property regulations, would dispose of an office building. In all cases, relevant subject matter experts, guided by internal policy and applicable laws and regulations, should work closely with agency executives to ensure cost-effective and timely asset disposal. Once the decision to dispose is made, a number of issues must be considered, including how to remove the asset f rom service, planning for transition to a replacement if required, redeployment of the asset elsewhere in the agency where it may continue to provide a benefit greater than the cost, or final removal of the asset from the agency 's inventory. De pending on the type of asset, disposal may be as simple as transferring the item to another agency, turning it over to GSA as excess, or demolishing it and selling it as scrap. Additional methodologies can be found in Appendix 10. The disposition of an asset leads to the phase-out of an obsolete asset, transition to a new asset or significant enhancement to an existing asset. Due to increased risk to agency programs during the transition and the required planning and coordination, the status of the asset necessarily moves from steady state to mixed life cycle. It is important that agency carefully plan s the timing of an asset transition to minimize disruption to programmatic function. For IT systems, transition planning begins immediately upon deployment. After the new system has been acquired, developed, and tested, deployment takes place according to the plan developed early in the Acquisition Phase. The elements of a transition may include: Converting data from the old asset to the new, Operating both the old and new assets concurrently, Validating that the new system has converted old data properly, Ensuring users are trained on the new asset, Keeping the customers informed of transition progress, and III.

CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX OMB Circular No. A-11 (2022 ) Page 53 of Capital Programming Guide APPENDICES APPENDIX 1 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 54 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) APPENDIX 1 DEFINITION OF CAPITAL ASSETS Capital assets are land (including park lands), structures, equipment (including motor and aircraft fleets), and intellectual property (including software) that are used by the Federal Government and have an estimated useful life of two years or more. Capital assets exclude items acquired for resale in the ordinary course of operations or held for the purpose of physical consumption, such as operating materials and supplies. The cost of a capital asset is its full life -cycle costs, including all direct and indirect costs for planning, procurement (purchase price and all other costs incurred to bring it to a form and location suitable for its intended use), opera tions and maintenance (including service contracts), and disposal. Capital assets may be acquired in different ways: through purchase, construction, or manufacture; through a lease -purchase or other capital lease, regardless of whether title has passed to the Federal Government; through an operating lease for an asset with an estimated useful life of two years or more; or through exchange. Capital assets include the environmental remediation of land to make it useful, leasehold improvements , and land rights; assets owned by the Federal Government but located in a foreign country or held by others (such as Federal contractors, State and local governments, or colleges and universities); and assets whose ownership is shared by the Federal Government with other entities. Capital assets include not only the assets as initially acquired but also additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements and reinstallations, and major improvements (but not ordinary repairs and maintenance). Examples of capital assets include the following, but are not limited to them: Office buildings, hospitals, laboratories, schools, and prisons; Dams, power plants, and water resources projects; Motor vehicles, airplanes, and ships; Satellites and space exploration equipment; Information technology hardware, software and modifications; Department of Defense (DOD) weapons systems; and Environmental restoration (decontamination and decommissioning efforts). Capital assets may or may not be capitalized (i.e., recorded on an entity 's balance sheet) under Federal accounting standards. Examples of capital assets not capitalized are DOD weapons systems, heritage assets, stewardship land, certain assets acquired for environmental cleanup efforts, and some software. Capit al assets do not include grants for acquiring capital assets made to State and local governments or other entities (such as National Science Foundation grants to universities). Capital assets also do not include intangible assets such as the knowledge resulting from research and development (R&D) or the human capital resulting from education and training, although capital assets do include land, structures, equipment (including fleet), and intellectual property (including software) that the Federal Governm ent uses in R&D and education and training. Agencies are encouraged to use the capital programming process or elements thereof in planning for expenditures not covered by this definition, to the extent that they find it useful. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 2 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) Page 55 of Capital Programming Guide APPENDIX 2 INTEGRATED PROJ ECT/PROGRAM TEAMS (IPTs) Agencies should apply an integrated project and process development (IPPD) approach to manage capital assets, using Integrated Project Teams (IPTs) assigned, as appropriate, to manage the various capital programming phases or major acquisition programs within the agency. The approach of having specific teams that are accountable for managing all or specific parts of the capital programming process for large projects enjoys a successful track record in industry and Government. A program manager with the appropriate level of knowledge, skills, and experience shall normally lead the IPT. The program manager should understand user needs and constraints, and demonstrate the ability to manage large projects to achieve cost, schedule, and performance goals. This manager should have sufficient tenure and interest in the project to provide continuity and to ensure personal accountability for her or his actions. Continuity reinforces accountability. Program managers and other senior IPT staff (e.g., contracting officer who should be assigned to the IPT from its inception and remain at least through the Acquisition Phase) should commit to remain with the project for four years or the completion of the Acquisition Phase whichever is earlier , or at least until: (a) the phase that is underway is completed, or (b) a milestone during the phase is completed where accountability for success or failure to achieve goals may be assessed. When possible, senior members of the IPT should be encouraged to remain with the project from the Baseline Assessment Step of the Planning Phase into the Management -In-Use Phase. The program manager should be provided with a written charter defining the team 's responsibilities, budget constraints, and the extent o f authority and accountability for accomplishing project objectives. The charter should be updated as necessary, but at least at the start of each phase, and should be based on decisions of the Executive Review Committee. Program managers should be given sufficient funding to establish an IPT to meet the charter. To keep the project moving on a tight schedule, management layers between the program manager and senior management should be limited to ensure accountability for the program manager and timely decisions from above. The members of the IPT should be dedicated to the project and responsible to the program manager for the duration of their assignment to the IPT. Where services of team members are not needed on a full -time basis, support to the IPT should take priority over other duties. This is necessary to maintain the continuity for good management and team accountability. The team should be cross-functional, as necessary, to accomplish the various tasks of the project. The members should ref lect the user community and the project 's stakeholders and should have a core knowledge of project management, value management, budget, finance, sustainable design, climate risk and procurement. APPENDIX 3 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 56 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022) APPENDIX 3 EXAMPLE OF EARNED VALUE CONCEPT Earned value is a management technique that relates resource planning to schedules and to technical, cost, and schedule requirements. All work is planned, budgeted, and scheduled in time -phased \"planned value \" increments constituting a cost and schedule measurement baseline. There are two major objectives of an earned value system: To encourage contractors to use effective internal cost and schedule management control systems, and To permit the Government to be able to rely on timely data produced by those systems for determining product -oriented contract status. The example shown here illustrates how the earned value concept works. The analysis begins with a baseline schedule showing how much work is planned for each time period. The subsequent sections show how to calculate the deviation from the planned schedule (schedule variance) and the deviation from the planned cost (cost variance). Baseline. For this hypothetical example, the baseline plan (planned value increments) in Table 1 shows that 6 work units ( A-F) would be completed at a cost of $100 for the period covered by this report. Table 1. Baseline Plan Work Units A B C D E F Total Planned Value ($) 10 15 10 25 20 20 100 Schedule Variance . As work is performed, it is \" earned \" on the same basis as it was planned, in dollars or other quantifiable units such as labor hours. Planned value compared with earned value measures the dollar volume of work planned vs. the equivalent dollar volume of work accomplished. Any difference is called a schedule variance. In contrast to what was planned, Table 2 shows that work unit D was not completed and work unit F was never started, or $35 of the planned work was not accomplished. As a result, the schedule variance shows that 35 percent of the work planned for this period was not done. Table 2. Schedule Variance Work Units A B C D E F Total Planned Value ($) 10 15 10 25 20 20 100 Earned Value ($) 10 15 10 10 20 0 65 Scheduled Variance 0 0 0 -15 0 -20 -35 = - 35% Cost Variance. Earned value compared with the actual cost incurred (from contractor and agency accounting systems, not through estimation techniques) for the work performed provides an objective measure of planned and actual cost. Any difference is called a cost variance. In this example, a negative variance means more money was spent for the work accomplished than was planned. Table 3 shows the CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 3 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022) Page 57 of Capital Programming Guide calculation of cost variance. The work performed was planned to cost $65 and actually cost $91. The cost variance is a negative 40 percent. Table 3. Cost Variance Work Units A B C D E F Total Earned Value ($) 10 15 10 10 20 0 65 Actual Cost ($) 9 22 8 30 22 0 91 Cost Variance 1 -7 2 -20 -2 0 $ -26 = - 40% Spend Comparison. The typical spend comparison approach, whereby contractors report actual expenditures against planned expenditures, is not related to the work that was accomplished and is not a valid measure of program status. Table 4 shows a simple comparison of planned and actual spending which indicates the program is under running by 9 percent. When compared to the schedule and cost variance examples under an earned value system, the management information provided below gives a false indication of true program pe rformance. Table 4. Spend Comparison Approach Work Units A B C D E F Total Planned Value ($) 10 15 10 25 20 20 100 Actual Cost ($) 9 22 8 30 22 0 91 Variance 1 -7 2 -5 -2 20 $9 = 9% References: Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) Standard 748 Earned Value Management Systems APPENDIX 4 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 58 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022) APPENDIX 4 ACCOUNTING FOR CAPITAL ASSETS The Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 6, Accounting for Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), revised by SFFAS No. 23, Eliminating the Category of National Defense Property, Plant and Equipment, and SFFAS 29 Heritage Assets a nd Stewardship Land, establishes standards for capital assets. These standards were issued by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, in which OMB subsequently published guidance in its OMB Circular No. A-136, F inancial Reporting Requirements (revised May 2023). O ne significant objective of financial accounting standards is to support assessment of operating performance. Financial reporting should provide information to determine: (1) the cost of providing specific programs and activities, including the composition of these costs and changes over time; (2) financial inputs in relation to a program 's outputs; and (3) the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government 's management of its assets. To facilitate meeting these information needs, PP&E has been divided into two categories: general PP&E , and Stewardship PP&E, consisting of heritage assets and stewardship land. For general PP&E (i.e., PP&E used to produce general Government goods and services), SSFAS 6 supports these information needs by allocating costs\u2014including cleanup costs \u2014of general PP&E to the periods in which the assets are used through historical cost depreciation methods. The cost is allocated to the period when it is incurred. Managerial cost accounting standards, established by SFFAS 4, Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the Federal Government, will result in these period costs being tied to outputs. In addition, def erred maintenance reporting will provide financial statement users with information on the condition and management of assets. The Stewardship PP&E category consists of assets whose physical properties resemble those of general PP&E that are traditionally capitalized in financial statements. However, due to the nature of these assets, (1) valuation would be difficult, and (2) matching costs with specific periods would not be meaningful. The standards provide for a different type of reporting. SFFAS No.8, Supplementary Stewardship Reporting, superseded by SFFAS 29, requires that information on Stewardship PP&E be reported in a manner that highlights their long -term -benefit nature and demonstrates accountability over them. SFFAS 29 reclassified all heritage assets and stewardship land information as basic except for condition and deferred maintenance information, which is classified as required supplementary information (RSI). SFFAS 29 requires that entities reference a note on the balance sheet that discloses information about heritage assets and stewardship land, but no asset dollar amount should be shown. Each agency 's financial system needs to have the capability to accumulate, recognize, and distribute the cost of an agency 's activities such as the costs of major acquisitions and other major programs within the agency that need to provide visibility to senior management on their total costs. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 5 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 59 of Capital Programming Guide APPENDIX 5 RISK MANAGE MENT The aim of risk management is to ensure that risks are identified at project inception and their potential impacts allowed for and accepted, where possible, so that the risks or their impacts are minimized. Risk management is an integral part of project m anagement on the project. Risk management processes are utilized from project initiation through development, maintenance and operations, and end only when the project/system is shutdown or retired. A risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project objective. Risk is one of those words that immediately conjures up an image of something bad, but it is important to remember that risk can provide positive benefits as well as negative ones. Risk management is the systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and responding to project risk. The need to manage risk increases with the complexity of the investment. It is an ongoing process that r equires continuous risk identification, assessment, planning, monitoring, and response. It is the responsibility of everyone on the IPT. It implies control of possible future events and is proactive rather than reactive. Risk planning This is the pro cess of developing and documenting an organized, comprehensive, and interactive strategy, the methods for identifying and tracking the risk issues, developing risk handling plans, performing continuous risk assessments to determine how risks have changed, and assigning adequate resources. Projects should develop a Risk Management Plan that: Establishes the purpose, objective, and goals of the project, Assigns responsibility for specific areas, Describes how risks will be assessed, Defines the risk rating approach, Establishes monitoring metrics, Defines how risk will be monitored throughout the project life -cycle, and Assesses risk. This process involves identifying and analyzing program areas and critical technical process risks to increase the likeliho od of meeting cost, performance, and schedule objectives. Risk identification is the process of examining the program areas and each critical technical process to identify and document the associated risk. The following common areas of risk are consistent with OMB risk requirements. Technology\u2014Lack of expertise, software and hardware maturity or immaturity, installation requirements, customization, O&M requirements, component delivery schedule/availability, uncertain and changing requirements, desi gn errors and/or omissions, technical obsolescence. Project Schedule and Resources\u2014Scope creep, requirement changes, insufficient or unavailable resources, overly optimistic task durations, and unnecessary activities within the schedule, critical deliverables or reviews not planned into the schedule. Business\u2014Poorly written contracts, market or industry changes, new competitive products become available, creating a monopoly for future procurements.

Integration Risks Project Team Risks Requirements Risks Cost Risks Project Management Risks Risk analysis is the process of examining each identified risk issue or process to refine the description of the risk, isolate the cause, and determine the effects. The cost of a risk event occurring can be quantified by determining its expected value (probability X i mpact). These costs must be included in cost estimates. A risk register should be developed and maintained. The table below provides a means by which risk identification can be easily captured, documented and analyzed. Risk Priority Risk Category Date Identified Risk Description Risk Rating Risk Response Strategy Status Risk handling is the process that identifies, evaluates, selects, and implements options in order to set risk at acceptable levels given program constraints and objectives. This includes the specifics on what should be done, when it should be accomplished, who is responsible, and associated cost and schedule. Risk handling options include assumption, avoidance, control (also known as mitigation), and transfer. The most desirable handling option is chosen, and then a specific approach is developed for this option. Risk monitoring is the process that systematically tracks and evaluates the performance risk handling actions against established metrics throughout the acquisition process and provides inputs to updating risk handling strategies, as appropriate. After encou ntering problems on a program, the IPT should document any warning signs that, with hindsight, preceded the problem, what approach was taken, and what the outcome was. This will not only help future programs, but could help identify recurring problems in existing programs. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 6 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 61 of Capital Programming Guide APPENDIX 6 PRINCIPLES OF BUDGETING FOR CAPITAL ASSET ACQUISITIONS Introduction and Summary The Administration plans to use the following principles in budgeting for capital asset acquisit ions. These principles address planning, costs and benefits, financing, and risk management requirements that should be satisfied before a proposal for the acquisition of capital assets can be included in the Administration 's budget. The principles are organized in the following four sections: A. Planning. This section focuses on the need to ensure that capital assets support core/priority missions of the agency; the assets have demonstrated a projected return on investment that is clearly equal to or bett er than alternative uses of available public resources; the risk associated with the assets is understood and managed at all stages; and the acquisition is implemented in phased, successive segments, unless it can be demonstrated there are significant econ omies of scale at acceptable risk from funding more than one segment or that there are multiple units that need to be acquired at the same time. B. Costs and Benefits. This section emphasizes that the asset should be justified primarily by benefit -cost analysis, including life -cycle costs; that all costs are understood in advance; and that cost, schedule, and performance goals are identified that can be measured using an earned value management system. C. Principles of Financing. This section stresses that useful segments are to be fully funded with appropriations; that as a general rule, planning segments should be financed separately from procurement of the asset; and that agencies are encouraged to aggregate assets in capital acquisition accounts and take other steps to accommodate lumpiness or \" spikes\" in funding for justified acquisitions. D. Risk Management. This section is to help ensure that risk is analyzed and managed carefully in the acquisition of the asset. Strategies can include separate accounts for capital asset acquisitions, the use of apportionment to encourage sound management, and the selection of efficient types of contracts and pricing mechanisms in order to allocate risk appropriately between the contractor and the Government. In addition, cost, schedule, and performance goals are to be controlled and monitored by using an earned value management system, and if progress toward these goals is not made, there is a formal review process to evaluate whether the acquisition should continue or be terminated. As defined here, capital assets are generally land, structures, equipment (including fleet), and intellectual property (including software), and weapon systems that are used by the Federal Government. Not includ ed are grants to States or others for their acquisition of capital assets. A complete definition is provided in Appendix 1 . A. Planning Investments in major capital assets proposed for funding in the Administration' s budget should: 1. Support core/prior ity mission functions that need to be performed by the Federal Government; 2. Be undertaken by the requesting agency because no alternative private sector or governmental source can support the function more efficiently; 3. Support work processes that ha ve been simplified or otherwise redesigned to reduce costs, improve effectiveness, and make maximum use of commercial, off -the-shelf technology; APPENDIX 6 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 62 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022) 4. Demonstrate a projected return on the investment that is clearly equal to or better than alternative uses of available public resources. Return may include: improved mission performance in accordance with measures developed pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act; reduced cost, increased quality, speed, or flexibility; and increased customer and employee satisfaction. Return should be adjusted for such risk factors as the investment 's technical complexity, the agency 's management capacity, the likelihood of cost overruns, and the consequences of under - or non- performance; 5. For information technology investments, be consistent with Federal and agency enterprise architectures which: integrate agency work processes and information flows with technology to achieve the agency 's strategic goals, reflect the agency 's technology vision, specify standard s that enable information exchange and resource sharing while retaining flexibility in the choice of suppliers and in the design of local work processes, and ensure that security is built into and funded as part of the enterprise architecture in accordance with OMB Memorandum M -00-07, Incorporating and Funding Security in Information Systems Investments (February 28, 2000); 6. Reduce risk by: avoiding or isolating custom -designed components to minimize the potential adverse consequences on the overall investment; using fully tested pilots, simulations, or prototype implementations when necessary before going to production; establishing clear measures and accountability for investment progress; and securing substantial involvement and buy -in throughout the investment from the program officials who will use the system; 7. Be implemented in phased, successive segments as narrow in scope and brief in duration as practicable, each of which solves a specific part of an overall mission problem and delivers a measurable net benefit independent of future segments, unless it can be demonstrated that there are significant economies of scale at acceptable risk from funding more than one segment or there are multiple units that need to be acquired at the same time; and 8. Employ an acquisition strategy that appropriately allocates risk between the Government and the contractor, effectively uses competition, ties contract payments to accomplishments, and takes maximum advantage of commercial technology. Prototypes require the same justification as other capital assets. As a general presumption, OMB will recommend new or continued funding only for those capital asset investments that satisfy these criteria. Funding for those investments will be recommended on a phased basis by segment, unless it can be demonstrated that there are significant economies of scale at acceptable risk from funding more than one segment or there are multiple units that need to be acquired at the same time. OMB recognizes that many agencies are in the middle of ongoing investments, and they may not be able immediately to satisfy the criteria. For those investments that do not satisfy the criteria, OMB will consider requests to use funds to finance additional planning, as necessary, to support the establishment of realistic cost, schedule, and performance goals for the completion of the investment. This planning could include: the redesign of work processes, the evaluation of alternative solutions, the development of information system architectures, and if necessary, the purchase and evaluation of prototypes. Realistic goals are necessary for ag ency portfolio analysis to determine the viability of the investment, to provide the basis for fully funding the investment to completion, and setting the baseline for management accountability to deliver the investment within goals. Because OMB considers this information essential to agencies' long-term success, OMB will use this information both in preparing the Administration' s budget and, in conjunction with cost, schedule, and performance data, as apportionments are made. Agencies are encouraged to wo rk with their OMB representative to arrive at a mutually satisfactory process, format, and timetable for providing the requested information. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 6 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 63 of Capital Programming Guide B. Costs and Benefits The justification of the investment should evaluate and discuss the extent to which the in vestment meets the above criteria and should also include: An analysis of the investment 's total life -cycle costs and benefits, including the total budget authority required for the asset, consistent with policies described in OMB Circular No. A-94 (October 1992); An analysis of the risk of the investment (including how risks will be isolated, minimized, monitored, and controlled), and for major pr ograms, an evaluation and estimate by the Chief Financial Officer of the probability of achieving the proposed cost goals; If after the Planning Phase, the procurement is proposed for funding in segments, an analysis showing that the proposed segment is e conomically and programmatically justified, that it is programmatically useful if no further investments are funded, and that in this application its benefits exceed its costs; and Cost, schedule, and performance goals for the investment (or the planning segment or useful asset being proposed) that can be measured throughout the acquisition process using a performance based management system (e.g., earned value management). C. Principles of Financing Principle 1: Full Funding Budget authority sufficient to complete a useful segment of a capital project (investment), or the entire capital project, if it is not divisible into useful segments, must be appropriated before any obligations for the useful segment (or project or investment) may be incurred. Explanation: Good budgeting requires that appropriations for the full costs of asset acquisition be enacted in advance to help ensure that all costs and benefits are fully taken into account at the time decisions are made to provide resources. Full funding with regular appropriations in the budget year also leads to tradeoffs within the budget year with spending for other capital assets and with spending for purposes other than capital assets. Full funding increases the opportunity to use performance -based fixed price contracts, allows for more efficient work planning and management of the capital project (or investment), and increases the accountability for the achievement of the baseline goals. When full funding is not followed and capital projects (or investments) or useful segments are funded in increments, without certainty if or when future funding will be available, the result is sometimes poor planning, acquisition of assets not fully justified, higher acquisition costs, cancellation of major inves tments, the loss of sunk costs, or inadequate funding to maintain and operate the assets. Principle 2: Regular and Advance Appropriations Regular appropriations for the full funding of a capital project or a useful segment (or investment) of a capital project in the budget year are preferred. If this results in spikes that, in the judgment of OMB, cannot be accommodated by the agency or the Congress, see Principle 4 below. Explanation: Principle 1 (Full Funding) is met as long as appropriations provide budget authority sufficient to complete the capital project or useful segment or investment. Full funding in the budget year with regular appropriations alone is preferred because it leads to tradeoffs within the budget year with spending for other capital assets and with spending for purposes other than capital assets. In contrast, full funding for a capital APPENDIX 6 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 64 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) project (investment) over several years with regular appropriations for the first year and advance appropriations for subsequent years may bias tradeoffs in the budget year in favor of the proposed asset because with advance appropriations the full cost of the asset is not included in the budget year. Advance appropriations, because they are scored in the year they become available for obligation, may constrain the budget authority and outlays available for regular appropriations of that year. Principle 3: Separate Funding of Planning Seg ments As a general rule, planning segments of a capital project (investment) should be financed separately from the procurement of a useful asset. Explanation: The agency must have information that allows it to plan the capital project (investment), deve lop the design, and assess the benefits, costs, and risks before proceeding to procurement of the useful asset. This is especially important for high risk acquisitions. This information comes from activities, or planning segments, that include but are not limited to market research of available solutions, architectural drawings, geological studies, engineering and design studies, and prototypes. The construction of a prototype that is a capital asset, because of its cost and risk, should be justified and pl anned as carefully as the investment itself. The process of gathering information for a capital project (investment) may consist of one or more planning segments, depending on the nature of the asset. Funding these segments separately will help ensure t hat the necessary information is available to establish cost, schedule, and performance goals before proceeding to procurement. If budget authority for planning segments and procurement of the useful asset are enacted together, OMB may wish to apportion b udget authority for one or several planning segments separately from procurement of the useful asset. Principle 4: Accommodation of Lumpiness or \" Spikes \" and Separate Capital Acquisition Accounts To accommodate lumpiness or \" spikes \" in funding justified capital acquisitions, agencies, working with OMB, are encouraged to aggregate financing for capital asset acquisitions in one or several separate capital acquisition budget accounts within the agency, to the extent possible within the agency 's total budget request. Explanation: Large, temporary, year -to-year increases in budget authority, sometimes called lumps or spikes, may create a bias against the acquisition of justified capital assets. Agencies, working with OMB, should seek ways to avoid this bias and accommodate such spikes for justified acquisitions. Aggregation of capital acquisitions in separate accounts may: Reduce spikes within an agency or bureau by providing roughly the same level of spending for acquisitions each year; Help to identify t he source of spikes and to explain them. Capital acquisitions are more lumpy than operating expenses, and with a capital acquisition account it can be seen that an increase in operating expenses is not being hidden and attributed to one -time asset purchases; Reduce the pressure for capital spikes to crowd out operating expenses; and Improve justification and make proposals easier to evaluate, since capital acquisitions are generally analyzed in a different manner than operating expenses (e.g., capital acquisitions have a longer time horizon of benefits and life -cycle costs). CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 6 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 65 of Capital Programming Guide D. Risk Management Risk management should be central to the planning, budgeting, and acquisition process. Failure to analyze and manage the inherent risk in all capital asset acquisitions may contribute to cost overruns, schedule shortfalls, and acquisitions that fail to perform as expected. For each major capital project (investment), a risk analysis that includes how risks will be isolated, minimized, monitored, and controlled may help prevent these problems. The investment cost, schedule, and performance goals established through the Planning Phase of the investment are the basis for approval to procure the asset and the basis for assessing risk. During the Procurement Phase, performance-based management systems (earned value management system) must be used to provide contractor and Government management visibility on the achievement of, or deviation from, goals until the asset is accepted and operational. If goals are not bein g met, performance-based management systems allow for early identification of problems, potential corrective actions, and changes to the original goals needed to complete the investment and necessary for agency portfolio analysis decisions. These systems a lso allow for Administration decisions to recommend meaningful modifications for increased funding to the Congress, or termination of the investment, based on its revised expected return on investment in comparison to alternative uses of the funds. Agencie s must ensure that the necessary acquisition strategies are implemented to reduce the risk of cost escalation and the risk of failure to achieve schedule and performance goals. These strategies may include: Having budgetary resources appropriated in separate capital asset acquisition accounts; Apportioning budget authority for a useful segment; Establishing thresholds for cost, schedule, and performance goals of the acquisition, including return on investment, which if not met may result in cancellation of the acquisition; Selecting types of contracts and pricing mechanisms that are efficient and that provide incentives to contractors in order to allocate risk appropriately between the contractor and the Government; Monitoring cost, schedule, and performance goals for the investment (or the planning segment or useful asset being proposed) using a performance -based management system, e.g., earned value management system. If progress is not within 90 percent of goals, or if new information is available that would indicate a greater return on investment from alternative uses of funds, instituting senior management review of the investment through portfolio analysis to determine the continued viability of the investment with modifications, or the termin ation of the investment, and the start of exploration for alternative solutions if it is necessary to fill a gap in agency strategic goals and objectives. APPENDIX 7 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 66 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) APPENDIX 7 VALUE MANAGEMENT The value management methodology (also known as value analysis, value engineering, value planning, etc.) should be considered for use in the Planning and Budgeting, Acquisition, and Management -In-Use Phases of capital programming. The value methodology uses a systematic job plan to identify essential functions necessary to accomplish an activity, analyze those functions, and generate alternatives to secure them at their greatest worth on a life-cycle benefit -to-cost basis. By following the process defined in the job plan, the use of the value methodology will facilitate the selection through evaluation and analysis of the \"best value\" alternative for t hose functions. The process provides plans and actions to acquire and implement the selected alternatives. The IPT may employ the use of the value management methodology in several ways including a professional value management specialist as a member of the team, using team leaders trained in the value management methodology, or using value specialists (either agency employees or industry consultants) to perform studies. Planning Phase This process has seven elements which define capital asset needs in terms of the performance and functional requirements necessary to meet an agency 's strategic goals. The seven elements are: 1. Selection of the Function/Process to be studied. 2. Determination of why the function is performed. The need for the function itse lf may be questioned by asking: \"What does it do? \" 3. Information gathering. This is the collection and assembly of all necessary information concerning the selected study item. This provides an understanding of what is to be accomplished through the performance of the function and provides answers to the questions: \"What does it cost? \" and \"What is the function worth? \" 4. Development of alternatives. This is the single most important element of the process. The use of free imagination, tempered with experience, will develop the best ideas. In initial brainstorming sessions, all ideas, even the wildest, should be duly reco rded and encouraged. Many times, the most progressive, breakthrough ideas, with the greatest payoff, will come from near or beyond the edge of the current function paradigms in the area being studied. This element provides answers to the question, \" What are the different ways this function can be performed? \" 5. Analysis of alternatives. The purpose of this analysis process is to eliminate those ideas that are technically or financially unfeasible in order to permit the selection of alternatives for further feasibility testing based on the resulting cost estimates. This element will answer the question, \"What is the cost of the selected alternative? \" 6. Feasibility testing and function verification. This determines that the selected alternative can perform the required function and is technically feasible. A viable alternative must provide the essential function performance and be capable of being implemented. This element answers three questions for each selected alternative: \" Is the alternative feasible? \"; \"Does the alternative provide the essential function? \" and \"Does the alternative meet the definition of function worth? \" 7. Implementation and follow -up. This is the selection of the final alternative, documentation of the decision, and preparation of the necessary implementation plans. Integrating schedules and funding requirements documents into the agency capital plan is part of this element. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 7 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 67 of Capital Programming Guide Procurement Phase The agency should include the FAR Part 48, Value Engineering, requirements in its contracts and actively encourage the contractor(s) to identify potential cost savings, along with schedule and performance enhancements. Management -In-Use Phase The use of statistical process control, Pareto analysis, and the value management function analysis methodology can be used to analyze performance data to determine whether the asset is meeting cost and performance goals, and can help identify if there are better ways for the asset to meet its life -cycle cost and performance goals. The IPT may perform the value management function by including a professional value management specialist as a member of the team, using team leaders trained in the value management met hodology, or using value process facilitators (either agency employees or commercial consultants) to perform the value management studies. APPENDIX 8 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 68 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022 ) APPENDIX 8 COST ESTIMATING Introduction Credible cost estimates are vital for sound management decision making and for any program/capital project to succeed. Early emphasis on cost -estimating during the planning phase is critical to successful life cycle management of a program/project. Becau se requirements and approaches vary based on the agency 's mission, agencies have to develop a cost estimating capability \u2014collecting, managing, and sharing cost data that best meets their mission needs. This Appendix is based on the Government Accountabi lity Office 's (GAO) guide to their auditors on how to evaluate an agency 's cost estimating process, and the reliability and validity of the data used to develop the cost estimates. Following these guidelines will help agencies to meet most cost estimating requirements. Individual cost estimating guides are also available from, or are in use by, several Government agencies, including several DOD Service branches, NASA, and the Department of Energy. Cost Estimating and Its Role in Managing Capital Assets A disciplined Cost Estimating process provides greater information management support, more accurate and timely cost estimates, and improved risk assessments that will help to increase the credibility of capital programming cost estimates. Cost Estimation touches on various disciplines such as accounting, economics, management science, engineering, statistics, probability, and more. Combining these disciplines and using them effectively produces sound cost estimates which can be used in preparing annual budgets, developing net present value or other return on investment estimates, improving life cycle management of various capital assets with more reliable performance baselines and earned value management, evaluating alternatives through cost -benefit analysis, assessing risk, and so forth. Types of Government Cost Estimates Capital cost estimating attempts to predict future capital expenditures even though not all factors and conditions of the investment are fully defined. There are many different types of cost estimates that agencies develop for various purposes and at diffe rent phases of the life cycle. For each type of estimate, bases (ground rules) and assumptions are spelled out. Some key challenges in performing the estimates are: insufficient data are available; the program scope is not fully defined; the availability of resources is not definitive; and risks are not fully determined. The following are types of cost estimates used in the program life- cycle: Conceptual Cost Estimate: This is used early in the Planning Phase of the acquisition life cycle and is often based on a one -to-one comparison with an existing system similar to the system being proposed. Preliminary Cost Estimates: This is used as more details are available and for preparing budgets. Detailed or Engineering Cost Estimates: This is a bottom -up estimate using the detailed WBS structure to price out discrete components, such as material, design hours, labor, off the shelf software, etc. Definitive Cost Estimate: This is used late in the acquisition life cycle during the Project Control Phase, based on actual cost data, available from the same system at an earlier time. The Earned Value Management concept is used to arrive at the Estimate at Completion (EAC). Life Cycle Cost (LCC) Estimate : This estimate provides the total cost to the Government of acquisition and ownership of the system over its full life time. It includes the cost of development, acquisition, support, and (where applicable) disposal. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 8 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 69 of Capital Programming Guide Independent Cost Estimate (ICE): This estimate is based on the same scope as the LCC, except that it is prepared by an independent review team using independent data sources and cost estimating approaches. Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE): This estimate is prepared for evaluating and validating contractor proposals presented during the Acquisition Phase. This is prepared from the offeror' s point of view and is based on the scope of work outlined in the solicitation. Techniques of Cost Estimating Many techniques can be used for cost estimating, from simple arithmetical calculations, to com plex mathematical models with numerous variables. Some of the techniques (as defined by DOD - DAU) are: Analogy: Used early in the acquisition life cycle based on a one-to -one comparison with an existing system similar to the system you are designing. Parametric: Uses statistical analysis from a number of similar systems and their relationship to your system. Engineering: A bottom -up estimate using the detailed WBS structure to price out discrete components, such as material, design hours, labor, etc. Extrapolation -from -actual -costs: Method used late in the acquisition life cycle after actual cost data are available from the same system at an earlier time. Cost Estimating Methodology To keep the estimate current, accurate and valid, the cost estimat ing process is continuously updated, based on the latest information available. As the project matures, the availability of valid data increases. The major steps in the cost estimating process are as follows: Based on preliminary project scope, prepare a high level Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) \u2014 generally three levels deep. Define the Ground Rules and Assumptions including technical, economic, schedule, business, and other factors. These assumptions need to be realistic, and continuously reviewed and updated as the scope of the project becomes better defined with the passage of time. Develop Data: Collect, identify, and analyze data for the cost estimate. Data (accurate, relevant, and correct confidence level) is the most important piece of the cost estimate, is time consuming to prepare properly, and includes cost drivers for the cost estimate and risk. Agencies need to develop the capability to collect, identify, and analyze data from various sources such as previous in -house projects, outside part ies (professional organizations, vendors, and others engaged in the industry), various procurement/contract data, project management data, accounting/financial management systems, and other sources. Most data are in raw form and must be normalized using l earning curves and other methods so that they are comparable and consistent. The normalized data are then adjusted to make them useable for the specific project. All data, including any adjustments made, should be thoroughly documented so an audit trail is established for verification purposes. Select/Construct Cost Model: Select the most appropriate tool/model or create a model to estimate the cost. Document factors that influence the selection process such as data and resource availability, schedule, and cost. Develop the Estimate: Based on the Ground Rules and Assumptions, and using the normalized/adjusted data, develop the cost estimate and the level of confidence using the various risk factors. Perform the sensitivity analysis: Once the estimate i s developed, decision makers want and need to know how sensitive the total cost estimate is to changes in the data input. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the major cost drivers for the estimate. Sensitivity analyses determine h ow the different ranges of estimates affect the estimates. Cost drivers are those variables APPENDIX 8 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 70 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2022) that, when changed in value, create the greatest changes in cost. Generally, many initial assumptions made in the early phases of a project 's definition will, in later phases, be found to be inaccurate. Develop Contingency Reserve: Based on the confidence level, a contingency allowance is used to cover the items of cost which are not known exactly at the time of the estimate. A Preliminary Estimate generally has a confidence level of 70 percent while a Definitive Estimate will have a confidence level of 90 percent. Contingency allowances of 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, would be added to the preliminary estimate and definitive estimate. Document Cost Estimate: Explain the cost estimating process used, and document how the cost estimates were prepared so that the quality of the estimate could be determined. Perform a peer review. Proper documentation will increase credibility, facilitate information sharing, and make these estimates usable in the future. Update Cost Estimate: On a regular basis, keep the cost estimates current. Such quality data are needed for decision -making using \"what if \" models and to project the impact of alternative decisions. Application of Cost Estimating Capital budget estimates: Using these estimating techniques and processes, agencies can develop more reliable and accurate capital budget estimates for funding acquisition programs with realistic schedules. This may be s ubmitted to OMB in a business case during the agency budget submission cycle. Cost and benefit studies: Through cost and benefit studies, agencies can determine the best investments meeting the agency mission, goals, and objectives. Life Cycle Cost: The project 's Life Cycle Cost helps management to make the right decision. Project Management: Determines the project 's PMB and identify risks which are managed through the EVM technique and through pre -award or post -award IBRs. Risk Analysis: Cost estim ates at various stages of the program identify the nature of the risk and its impact on the program. As the program matures, uncertainties are reduced as the design and development processes are known. Therefore, through the use of EVM, risks are managed. Management reserves are defined for the use by the Program Manager. Conclusion: Understanding the type of estimating technique is important for providing a useful estimate to the decision makers. Cost estimates are key elements of a project plan, so project personnel expend considerable effort preparing them. They provide the basis for assessing the total requirement and the recommended phasing of budgets. Obtaining accurate cost estimates can be difficult for complex projects which involve new techno logies and require extensive time to complete. While managers sometimes feel pressured to provide optimistic estimates in order to obtain project go -ahead approval, a poor cost estimate can create an un - executable plan. A project with an inaccurate cost estimate undermines the process for developing an optimal portfolio of capital projects, and when the funding shortage becomes apparent may lead to significant de -scoping or termination of the project.

Initiating a disposition program for the asset portfolio ensures that managers are able to properly identify assets that may no longer support the mission and are potential candidates for disposal, thereby freeing up reso urces for other uses. This applies to all assets, whether owned, leased, or acquired through another means. Asset Prioritization Prioritizing assets based on their importance to mission is one of the most significant criteria used in both focusing re investment funds and finding candidates for disposition. The adjacent diagram shows an example of a distribution of assets graphed by their importance to mission and their condition. Graphical representations such as this scatter diagram can be a useful tool in segmenting and presenting asset portfolios. Other performance indicators such as cost or utilization can also be used for portfolio analyses such as finding opportunities for consolidation. The use of the tools such as this Asset Priority Index (API), help managers identify the most important assets, and therefore provides a logical continuum for which to direct limited funding. In addition, the use of the API is not only important in developing deferred maintenance and component renewal projects; it is equally important when planning for operations, recurring maintenance, and preventive maintenance and changes in asset status (e.g., expansion, consolidation, and disposal). The area highlighted in the adjacent chart shows where an asset no lo nger supports the mission of the site or bureau or that has reached the end of its useful life. It is at this point in an asset 's life -cycle that a manager should consider asset disposition. In this part, the disposition of an asset is considered which can result in the disposal of an asset and removal from the inventory, or retention of the asset with a change in its status within the inventory. Traditionally, many agencies ' disposal programs consist of waiting for field offices to alert management of a vacant facility. Under the concept of continuous monitoring, the disposition of an asset should be a proactive process that occurs at the portfolio level. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 9 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 73 of Capital Programming Guide IT Assessment Models A similar approach can be utilized for continuous monitoring of IT assets. The results can be used to identify candidates for disposition. The business case for disposal is clear: resources are limited. Inefficient and underutilized assets waste those limited resources, detracting from an agency 's ability to fund c apital improvements and deferred maintenance for those assets critical to supporting the agency mission. APPENDIX 10 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 74 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) APPENDIX 10 FEDERAL SUSTAINABILITY Statutes and executive orders have established a wide range of requirements and goals related to facility energy and water efficiency, high-performance buildings, renewable energy consumption, purchasing, and other aspects of managing Federal facilities and operations. Therefore, agencies should review the following executive orders and ensure that the policy, goals, and requirements are integ rated into their capital planning process. Executive Order (E.O.) 14008, \" Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad \" ( January 27, 2021), establishes a policy to lead the Nation' s effort to combat the climate crisis by example - specifically, by aligning the management of Federal procurement and real property, public lands and waters, and financial programs to support robust climate action. E.O. 14057, \"Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability\" (December 8, 2021), establishes a policy for the Federal Government to lead by example in order to achieve a carbon pollution- free electricity sector and net -zero emissions economy -wide. The E.O. sets out a whole-of-government approach to demonstrate how innovation and environmental stewardship can protect our planet, safeguard Federal investments against the effects of climate change, respond to the needs of all of America's communities, and expand American technologies, industries, and jobs. Real Property Asset Management Applying sustainable building principles to the design and operation of Federal real property assets supports the policy goals of E.O. 14008, such as the increased energy and water efficiency of United States Government installations, buildings, and facilities. Agencies should consult the Guiding Principles for Sustainable Federal Buildings and Associated Instructions issued by the Council on Environmental Quality for additional guidance and technical resources. Agencies may also use third -party building certification systems or standard s identified by GSA 's Office of Federal High -Performance Buildings. Electronic Asset Management Agencies should ensure that appropriate management strategies for electronic assets are implemented in accordance with statutory requirements and Executive Bran ch policies. Specifically, agencies should acquire equipment that meets all applicable requirements for energy efficiency; identify and implement best practices for life-cycle management of electronic equipment in order to minimize consumption of energy and supplies; and ensure that equipment is appropriately managed in accordance with Federal guidance on reuse, donation, transfer, sale, de-manufacturing, and recycling of electronics.

Typically, the process uses a weighted average to calculate a numerical grade. The process allows agencies to rank and compare different types of investments and select the ones that provide the best value. However, a mathematical process may not capture all of the considerations for every investment. Also, depending on the investment, quantitatively grading some of the decision criteria may be difficult. If a numerical grade does not capture all of the relevant considerations, the grade could be used as one input to the selection process that would help inform management decisions. An exampl e that illustrates the concept is below. Agencies may use different criteria and weights that are tailored to their unique circumstances. TEMPLATE FOR EVALUATING PROPOSED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS Overall Risk Factors Grade Weights for Risks Sum = 100% Investment Size - How large is the proposed investment, especially in comparison to the overall budget? 1______5______10 Large Small 25 Project Longevity - Do projects adopt a modular approach that combines controlled systems development with rapid prototyping techniques? Are projects as narrow in scope and brief in duration as possible to reduce risk by identifying problems early and focusing on projected versus realized results? 1______5______10 Non-Modular Modular 25 Technical Risk - How will proposed assets be integrated into existing ones? Will proposed investment take advantage of commercially available and non - developmental items? How will the complexity of the asset 's design effect the development of the proje ct? 1______5______10 Experimental Established Custom Industry Standard 25 Climate Risk - Will the risk to the investment from acute events (hurricanes, floods, wildfires) or gradual changes in the climate (sea level rise) be managed appro priately? 1______5______10 High Risk Low Risk 25 Sum of Overall Risk Factors Overall Return Factors Weights for Returns Sum = 100% Business Impact or Mission Effectiveness - How will the asset contribute toward improvement in organizational performance in specific outcome -oriented terms? 1______5______10 Low High 20 Custom Needs - How well does the asset address identified internal and/or external customer needs and demands for increased service quality and timeliness or reductions in costs? 1______5______10 Low High 15 Quantitative Analysis - Is the benefit -cost analysis reliable and technically sound? 1______5______10 Risky Estimates Known Benefits 15 Organizational Impact - How broadly will the asset affect the organization (e.g. , the number of offices, users, work processes and other systems)? 1______5______10 Low High 20 APPENDIX 11 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 76 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) TEMPLATE FOR EVALUATING PROPOSED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS Expected Improvement - Is the asset to be used to support, maintain , or enhance operational systems and processes (tactical) or designed to improve future capability (strategic)? Are any projects required by law, court ruling, Presidential directive, etc.?

This is a summary of the analysis done in Step I. Description of the Planning Phase The Agency Capital Plan should describe its planning process and the phase's key decision points. It should include: a description of the Executive Review Process discussed in s ection I.6.1. of the Guide; the role of the IPT; and decision points in the process to determine whether assets should be acquired and whether the acquisition should be terminated if cost, schedule, and perf ormance goals are not met. Baseline Assessment and Identifying the Performance Gap This section of the Agency Capital Plan should be a summary of the work done in section 2. It should help lay the groundwork for justifying the need for new acquisitions . Examining the existing portfolio. An examination of the existing portfolio of assets is encouraged in order to identify capital assets currently in use and in procurement that can help meet program objectives. This analysis will be the basis for assessing where there are gaps and whether funding for new assets should be proposed. The analysis should ensure that the assets are linked to mission needs. The analysis should be across programs and bureaus to identify cross-servicing, and should be over a mu lti-year horizon to ensure a dynamic analysis that anticipates future changes. Identifying the performance gap. This section should identify the performance gap. The gap identifies the agency objectives that cannot be met with existing assets and other resources. Asset inventory and current condition information should be made available here. Justification of Spending for Proposed New Capital Assets Agencies are encouraged to include in their Agency Capital Plan a section that justifies proposed spen ding on new capital assets, using the criteria described in this Step and expanded upon in Appendix 6, Principles of Budgeting for Capital Asset Acquisitions. The main elements of these principles are incorporated in the suggested sections of the justification discussed below. Agencies should feel free to use other justification criteria as well. As a general presumption, OMB will recommend new or continued funding only for those capital asset investments that satisfy these criteria. Funding for those projects will be recommended on a phased basis by segment, unless it can be demonstrated that there are significant economies of scale at acceptable risk from funding more than one segment or that there are multiple units that need to be acquired at the same time. Basis for Selection of the Capital Asset This section should justify the selection of the proposed asset. APPENDIX 12 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 78 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Statement of program objectives and functional requirements. This statement should be a summary of the analysis done in s ections I.1 through I .3 as it relates to the proposed asset. The statement should identify program objectives from the annual performance plan, the performance gap, and the functional requirements for the asset. These requirements should be defined in terms of the mission, purpose, capability, agency components involved, schedule and cost objectives, and operating constraints. The requirements should not be defined in terms of equipment or software. Explanation of alternative ways of meeting the program objectives. This should be a summary of the analysis in s ection I.4, Alternatives to Capital Assets. It should review alternatives to meeting the program objective by means other than acquisition of the asset and explain why these alternatives were rejected. Expl anation of why the acquisition of the proposed asset is the best alternative. This section should justify why the proposed asset is the best alternative for meeting the program objectives. It should summarize the analysis that appears largely in s ection I.5, Choosing the Best Capital Asset. The explanation should be based on a benefit -cost analysis, including an analysis of life-cycle costs and an analysis of how best to identify, monitor, manage, and control risk. The explanation should also include the baseline cost, schedule, and performance goals that will be the basis for the budget request and tracking of achievement of goals . Budget projections and financial forecasts. This section should draw from the elements above to give a year-by -year forecast of total projected budget authority and outlays for the asset to ensure that all relevant costs are understood in advance. The request should provide for full funding (see section I.7.2.2 , Principles of Financing). This section should also discuss per f ormance measures relevant to the asset, tied to agency mission and performance goals and objectives, and address cost - effectiveness. St rategies for Strengthening Accountability for Achieving Goals Once the acquisition is funded, the IPT is accountable for achieving the project cost, schedule, and performance goals that are the basis used to obtain approval to acquire the asset. This section should discuss the strategies that will be used to manage the project during the Procurement Phase. These strategies should include: Having budget authority apportioned for a useful segment, if appropriate; Selecting types of contracts and pricing mechanisms that are efficient and provide incentives to contractors in order to allocate risk appropriately between the contractor and the agency; Monitoring cost, schedule, and performance goals for the project \u2014or the useful segment being proposed\u2014using an earned value management system (Earned value is described in Appendix 3); Establishing thresholds for cost, schedule, and performance goals of the acquisition, including return on investment, which, if not met, may result in termination of the acquisition; Management actions if progress is not within 90 percent of goals, or if new information is available that would indicate a greater return on investment from alternative uses of funds (senior management revi ew of the project should be instituted to determine the continued viability of the project with modifications, or the termination of the project, and the start of exploration for alternative solutions if it is necessary to fill a gap in agency strategic goals and objectives); and Proactive risk management approach and a process for identifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks throughout the life -cycle of the investment. CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 12 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 79 of Capital Programming Guide Staff Requirements This section should discuss the management staff, both in-house and contracted, needed by the agency to manage the Acquisition Phase and the operations and maintenance staff projections, both in-house and contractor, for the Management-in-Use Phase. Timing Issues, if Involved in a Multi -Agency Acquisition Agencies are encouraged to explore multi -agency acquisitions where feasible. This section should discuss the timing of the support to be provided to the acquisition by the various agencies involved in the acquisition. These include the timing of fund tra nsfers to the lead agency and the timing of use of the asset by the various agencies. Plans for Proposed Capital Assets Once in Use The Agency Capital Plan should discuss the costs associated with the asset' s procurement, management -in- use, and ultima te disposal, and how these costs will be tracked by program managers. Summary of Risk Management Plan Planning, budgeting, and procurement of capital assets is not always a smooth process. In spite of careful planning, there are normally disruptions t o the process, and the analysis of alternative ways of meeting program objectives should respond to disruptions quickly. The risk management plan developed in section I.5.5 should be summarized in the Agency Capital Plan. (This example is hypothetical, a nd does not represent the program or activity of any Federal agency.)

CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 13 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 81 of Capital Programming Guide APPENDIX 13 CLIMATE CONSIDERATIONS During each phase of the lifecycle, business sponsors and program managers should be able to demonstrate how climate considerations are integrated in risk management and decision making. Risk management plans should include mitigation strategies for specific climate risks. Agencies may tailor the integration to their unique circumstances, but wi dely accepted standards should be followed as much as possible. Managing climate risks should be a routine part of the capital planning process and facility assessments. Comprehensive risk management includes managing the risk to the asset from acute ev ents (hurricanes, floods, wildfires) and incremental changes (sea level rise, aridification ), as well as the effect the asset has on the environment (greenhouse gas emissions). Tradeoffs may be necessary , but in general t he integration of climate consider ations into capital planning will help the agency achieve its mission under changing conditions . Example of a Checklist for Screening Non -IT Major Acquisitions To assist agencies, an example of a checklist to screen non -IT major acquisitions for climate considerations is below. It includes guidance for each phase of the lifecycle. The checklist is only an example. Agencies may use their own tools to screen for climate adaptation and greenhouse gas emissions. *** START OF EXAMPLE *** Agency Name Review Board Name Climate Risk Checklist for Screening Non -IT Major Acquisitions Protecting Federal capital assets and limiting the Federal G overnment 's fiscal exposure by better managing climate change risks is a priority and included on the GAO High Risk List. This checklist requests that [ Agency Review Board Name ] review non -IT major acquisitions to verify that climate risks have been appropriately considered and accounted for in the decision -making process. Typically, the non-IT major acquisitions revie wed include acquisitions of assets that are critical to the mission, assets with a high dollar value, and assets that may be able to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, as well as other investments that may be vulnerable to climate risks and difficult or expensive to modify or relocate. The National Climate Assessment (NCA) discusses two responses to climate change : (1) climate adaptation , and (2) emissions mitigation. Both responses are leveraged as part of a comprehensive risk management strategy. Climate adaptation is a risk management activity that can require changes in traditional agency management, decision -making, and operations. Climate adaptation involves \" adjustment i n natural or human systems in anticipation of or response to a changing environment in a way that effectively uses beneficial opportunities or reduces negative effects. \" Fourth National Climate Assessment , vol. 2, ch. 28 . Adaptation should take place cont inuously and enhance an agency 's ability to achieve strategic goals. APPENDIX 13 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 82 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) An asset 's embodied and operational GHG emissions and their effect on the environment must also be managed and mitigated in accordance with current laws, regulations, and policy. Emiss ions mitigation involves those \" activities, investments and projects intended to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and ultimate impacts of human activity on the planet 's atmosphere, physical processes, and biosphere. \" Fourth National Climate Assess ment , vol. 2, ch. 29. During a review, business sponsors and program managers should be prepared to identify the lifecycle phase and demonstrate how climate information was integrated in risk management and decision -making. The intended outcome is to ensure that agencies address and incorporate appropriate climate science and projections in order to manage risks over the expected lifecycle of the asset. Scope of Reviews An asset can be reviewed from multiple perspectives. During a review, both program management and the climate should be considered. Reviews should be coordinated with relevant senior management , such as the Chief Sustainability Officer, Senior Real Property Officer, Chief Acquisition Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Senior Climate Change Adaptation Official, or designees, to ensure alignment with agency plans and goals. Part 1 of the review is from the perspective of program management. During Part 1, the [ Agency Review Board Name ] will ensure the climate has been considered in the strategies, analyses, and decisions generated by the program management process. Part 2 of the review is from the perspective of responses to climate risks. During Part 2, the [ Agency Review Board Name ] will ensure that relevant climate-related risks to the asset, as well as strategies to reduce GHG emissions, are identified and integrated into investment planning and management . Part 1: Program Management Considerations The documents, analyses and decisions reviewed depend on the current phase of the asset 's lifecycle. Reviews for assets being planned or constructed will differ from reviews of assets that are operational. Items that should be reviewed for each phase are listed below. Planning and Budgeting Phase During the planning and budgeting phase, the [ Agency Review Board Name ] verifies climate considerations will be addressed during the entire useful life of the asset. Analyses and documentation should explicitly address the impact of climate risks and demonstrate appropriate responses. Review board decisions and recommendations should consider the costs and benefits of the responses , including not only the economic factors but also the trade -offs and/or co-benefi ts of environmental and social factors. During a review, business sponsors and program managers should be able to demonstrate that responses to climate risks, in both adaptation actions and emission mitigation strategies, are included in the following.

The asset 's contribution to an agency 's strategic and climate risk management goals should be considered in assessments of value as well as review board decisions and recommendations. Metrics and baselines should be established to measure the performance of an asset and to manage climate risks. During a review, business sponsors and program managers should be able to demonstrate that responses to climate risks (both climate adaptation and emissions mitigation) are included in the following. Post Implementation Review (PIR) Performance metrics Operational analysis Corrective actions Asset disposal and decommissioning Lessons learned Part 2: Responses to Climate Change Considerations The climate can impact an asset 's near and long-term pe rformance. The observed and expected changes in climate include changes in the intensity, duration, frequency, and geographical distribution of both acute (event -driven) and chronic risks (those due to longer -term shifts in climate patterns) , as well as the GHG emissions of the asset. Ongoing due diligence by the [ Agency Review Board Name] is vital to determine the relevance of particular risks, assess vulnerabilities and opportunities, develop responses to climate risks, and achieve desired outcomes. Applicability and Relevance The [ Agency Review Board Name ] will ensure climate risks are mitigated as much as possible. During a review, program managers should be able to demonstrate that each of the following risks has been considered , and that the risks relevant to the asset are included in the risk management plan. In general, potential risks include: Extreme Weather. Assets may be affected by acute events, such as hurricanes, floods, extreme heat, and wildfires, that are already common i n the current environment or are expected to occur with increased frequency. Widely accepted standards, such as those published by the International Standards Organization (ISO), should be reviewed and applied as much as possible. APPENDIX 13 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 84 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Strengthening an asset or complying with standards may increase costs but reduce the risk of interrupting the delivery of services to the public. Incremental Changes. The asset should be protected against gradual changes and chronic conditions in the environment, such as sea level rise or persistent drought, and the expected future climate. If the asset is expected to have a long service life, adaptations to compensate for risks that were not considered at the time of construction may be needed. If renovations extend the service life , then adaptations may be needed to ensure reliable performance throughout the lifecycle. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions. An asset 's GHG emissions should be reviewed for compliance with applicable laws, regulations and policies. Widely accepted standards, such as ISO 14064, should be used as much as possible. The standard s should include criteria for identifying GHG sources as well as criteria for monitoring and documenting GHG project performance. Reducing GHG emissions may increase initial costs but help agencies achieve long - term climate goals. The [ Agency Review Board Name ] will also ensure program managers review and apply relevant agency plans and widely accepted standards and guidance, such as - Agency Plans a nd Guidance Federal Agency Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plans, https://www.sustainability.gov/adaptation/ Federal Agency Sustainability Plans, https://www.sustainability.gov/performance.html Selecting Climate Information to Use in Climate Risk and Impact Assessments: Guide for Federal Agency Climate Adaptation Planners, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Guide - on-Selecting -Climate - Information-to -Use-in Management Standard (FFRMS), see E.O. 13690 Guidelines for Implementing Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, and Executive Order 13690, Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard a nd a Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input https://www.fema.gov/floodplain - management/intergovernmental/federal -flood-risk - management -standard U.S. Army Corps ECB 2018 -14 Guidance for Incorporating Climate Change Impacts to Inland Hydrology in Civil Works Studies, Designs and Projects https://www.wbdg.org/ffc/dod/engineering-and -construction-bulletins -ecb/usace- ecb-2018-14 U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 17 Highways in the River Environment - F loodplains, Extreme Events, Risk and Resilience 2 nd Ed.

During a review, program managers should be prepared to discuss specific risks and mitigation strategies. The risk register should be readily available and should list each risk, its probability of occurrence, the consequences if the risk is realized, and mitigation strategy as shown in the example below. In general, climate risk management should be driven by current data. Program Managers are encouraged to use climate data information available, such as the Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation (CMRA) Portal. Example of climate risks in a risk register. Risk Probability Consequences Risk Mitigation Extreme weather (hurricanes and flooding) High Interruption of site access and services to the public. Modify buildings to comply with the ASCE -24-14 standard. Elevate critical equipment. APPENDIX 13 CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 86 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Extreme heat High Reduced viability of equipment to operate or perform effectively. Test and incorporate new technologies or adapt existing equipment to extreme heat. Water scarcity - ground water High Reduced viability of equipment to operate or perform effectively. Test and incorporate new technologies or adapt existing equipment to reduce water use. Migration of wildfire smoke High Building closure and equipment damage. Incorporate new technologies or adapt existing equipment to ASHRAE guidance. Outcomes of Responses to Climate Risks In general, forward -looking climate information should be incorporated into non- IT major acquisitions. Evaluation of the exposur e to climate risks and comprehensive risk management will mitigate the possibility of disruption to the mission, the supply chain, or the deliver y of critical products and services to the public. Federal assets should be able to perform r eliably over thei r intended service life under changing conditions , whether the changes are acute events or long -term shifts in climate patterns. GHG emissions should also be managed effectively in accordance with applicable laws, regulations , and policies. Effective responses to climate risks address both climate adaptation and GHG emissions. *** END OF EXAMPLE *** CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE APPENDIX 13 OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 87 of Capital Programming Guide GLOSSARY Appropriations . An appropriation provides budget authority that permits Government officials to incur obligations that result in immediate or future outlays of Government funds. Regular annual appropriations. These appropriations are: Enacted normally in the current year; Scored entirely in the budget year; and Available for obligation in the budget year and subsequent years if specified in the language (see \" Availability,\" below). Availability. Appropriations made in appropriations acts are available for obligation only in the budget year unless the language specifies that an appropriation is available for a longer period. If the language specifies that the funds are to remain available until the end of a certain year beyond the budget year, the availability is said to be \"multi- year. \" If the language specifies that the funds are to remain available until expended, the availability is said to be \" no-year. \" Appropriations for major procurements and construction projects are typically made available for multiple years or until expended. Assets. Tangible or intangible items owned by the Federal Government which would have probable economic benefits that can be obtained or controlled by a Federal entity (adapted from SFFAS No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, and Kohler 's Dictionary for Accounting ). Baseline Goals . Baseline cost, schedule, and performance goals will be the standard against which actual work is measured. Cost and schedule goals . The baseline cost and schedule goals should be realistic projections of total cost, total time to complete the project, and interim cost and schedule goals. The interim cost and schedule goals should be based on the value of work performed or a co mparable concept. Appendix 3 illustrates the earned value concept for establishing cost and schedule goals, one of several concepts that could be used. Performance goals . A target level of performance against which actual achievement or progress can be compared, preferably expressed as a tangible, measurable objective or as a quantitative standard, value, or rate. This can include goals containing key milestones or goals framed as a position relative to the past or relative to peers. Illustrative major milestones in establishing goals . Illustrative major milestones in establishing or proposing revised baseline goals could be: o Agency mission analysis, process design, and requirements development; o Agency submission and justification to OMB; o Approval for inclusion in the Administration' s budget proposal to the Congress; o Enactment of appropriations; o Before and after the contract or contracts are signed; and o Other times after the contracts are signed, depending on circumstances. Budget Authority . Budget authority (BA) is the authority provided by Federal law to incur financial obligations that will result in outlays. Most budget authority for acquisitions is in the form of appropriations; other types are contract authority, authority to borrow, and spending authority from offsetting collections. This definition of budget authority is consistent with the definition contained in section 3(2) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended by the Omnibus Budget and GLOSSARY CAPIT AL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 88 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Reconciliation Act of 1990 and codified at 2 U.S.C. 622(2)(A) . Section 20.4 of OMB Circular No. A-11 explains budget authority in more detail. Capital Assets. See Appendix 1. Capital Programming. See OMB Circular No. A-11, Part 7 definition on page 2. Capital Project and Useful Segments of a Capital Project . The total capital project, or acquisition of a capital asset, includes useful segments that are either planning segments or useful assets. Planning segments . A planning segment of a capital project provides information that allows the agency to develop the design; assess the benefits, costs, and risks; and establish realistic baseline cost, schedule, and performance goals before proceeding to full acquisition of the useful asset (or canceling the acquisition). This information comes from activities, or planning segments, that include but are not limited to market research of available solutions, architectural drawings, geological studies, engineering and design studies, and prototypes. The process of gathering information for a capital project may consist of one or more planning segments, depending on the nature of the asset. If the project includes a prototype that is a capital asset, the prototype may itself be one segment or may be divisible into more than one segment. Useful asset . A useful asset is an economically and programmatically separate segment of the asset or whole asset that may be procured to provide a useful asset for which the benefits exceed the costs, even if no further funding is appropriated. The total capital asset procurement may include one or more useful assets, although it may not be possible to divide all procurements in this way. Illustrations follow: Illustration 1. If the construction of a building meets the justification criteria and has benefits greater than its costs without further investment, then the construction of that building is a \" useful segment. \" Excavation is not a useful segment because no usef ul asset results from the excavation alone if no further funding becomes available. For a campus of several buildings, a useful segment is one complete building if that building has programmatic benefits that exceed its costs regardless of whether the oth er buildings are constructed, even though that building may not be at its maximum use. Illustration 2 . If the full acquisition is for several items (e.g., aircraft), the useful segment would be the number of complete aircraft required to achieve benefit s that exceed costs, even if no further funding is available. In contrast, some portion of several aircraft (e.g., engines for five aircraft) would not be a useful segment if no further funding is available, nor would one aircraft be a useful segment if t wo or more are required for benefits to exceed costs. Illustration 3 . For information technology, a module (the information technology equivalent of \" useful segment \") is separable if it is useful in itself without subsequent modules. The module should be designed so that it can be enhanced or integrated with subsequent modules if future funding becomes available. Commercially Available Off -The-Shelf (COTS) Item. Any item, other than real property, that is of a type customarily used by the general public for nongovernmental purposes, and that has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; is sold, leased, or licensed in substantial quantities in the com mercial marketplace; and is offered to the Government, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold, leased, or licensed in the commercial marketplace. Cost . Defined in SFFAC No. 1, Objectives of Federal Financial Reporting , as the monetary value of resources used. Defined more specifically in SFFAS No. 4, Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the Federal Government, as the monetary value of resources used or sacrificed or liabilities CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE GLOSSARY OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023) Page 89 of Capital Programming Guide incurred to achieve an objective, such as to acquire or produce a good or to perform an activity or service. Depending on the nature of the transaction, cost may be charged to operations immediately (i.e., recognized as an expense of the period) or to an asset account for recognition as an expense of subsequent periods. In most contexts within SFFAS No. 7 , Accounting for Revenue and Other Financing Sources , \"cost\" is used synonymously with expense. See also, \" Full Cost.\" Efficiency measures. While outcome measures provide valuable insight into program achievement, more of an outcome can be achieved with the same resources if an effective program increases its efficiency. Agencies are encouraged to develop efficiency measures. Efficiency gains may be described as maintaining a level of performance at a lower cost, improving performance levels at a lower cost, improving performance levels at the same cost, or improving performance levels to a much greater degree than costs are increased. Simply put, efficiency is the ratio of the outcome or output to the input of any program. Full Cost . All direct and indirect costs to any part of the Federal Government of providing goods, resources, and services ( OMB Circul ar No. A-25: User Charges (July 8, 1993)). The total amount of resources used to produce the output. More specifically, the full cost of an output produced by a responsibility segment is the sum of: (1) the costs of resources consumed by the responsibili ty segment that directly or indirectly contribute to the output; and (2) the costs of identifiable supporting services provided by other responsibility segments within the reporting entity and by other reporting entities (SFFAS No. 4, Managerial Cost Accou nting Concepts and Standards for the Federal Government ). Funding . There are two types of funding for projects: (1) Full funding means that appropriations are enacted that are sufficient in total to complete a useful segment of a capital project (investment) before any obligations may be incurred for that segment. When capital projects (investments) or useful segments are incrementally funded, without certainty if or when future funding will be available, it can result in poor planning, acquisition of a ssets not fully justified, higher acquisition costs, projects (investments) delays, cancellation of major projects (investments), the loss of sunk costs, or inadequate funding to maintain and operate the assets. Budget requests for full acquisition propose for full funding. (2) Incremental (annual) funding means that appropriations are enacted that only fund an annual or other part of a useful segment of a capital project (investment). OMB or the Congress may change the agency 's request for full finding t o incremental funding in order to accommodate more projects in a year than would be allowed with full funding. Information Technology . Section 5002(3) of the Clinger -Cohen Act defines information technology as follows: \"(A) The term 'information technology ', with respect to an executive agency means any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment, that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the executive agency. For purposes of the preceding sentence, equipment is used by an executive agency if the equipment is used by an executive agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with the executive agency which (i) requires the use of such equipment, or (ii) requires the use, to a significant extent, of such equipment in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product. (B) The term 'information technology ' includes compute rs, ancillary equipment, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services), and related resources. (C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), the term 'information technology ' does not include any equipment that is acquired by a Federal contractor incidental to a Federal contract. \" Information Technology Systems for National Security . Section 5142 of ITMRA defines a national security system as follows: GLOSSARY CAPIT AL PROGRAMMING GUIDE Page 90 of Capital Programming Guide OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) \"(a) DEFINITION. \u2014In this subtitle, the term 'national security system ' means any telecommunications or information system operated by the United States Government, the function, operation, or use of which\u2014 (1) involves intelligence activities; (2)involves cryptologic activities related to national security; (3) involves command and control of military forces; (4)involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or (5)subject to subsection (b), is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions. (b) LIMITAT ION. \u2014Subsection (a)(5) does not include a system that is to be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications). \" Integrated Project Team (IPT). Integrated Project Team means a multi -disciplinary team led by a project manager responsible and accountable for planning, budgeting, procurement and life -cycle management of the investment to achieve its cost, schedule, and performance goals. Team skills include: budgetary , financial, capital planning, procurement, user, program, architecture, earned value management, security, and other staff as appropriate. Life-cycle Costs. Life -cycle costs of an asset are all direct and indirect initial costs, including planning , procurement, development, construction, and other costs; all periodic or continuing costs of operation and maintenance; and costs of decommissioning and disposal. Nation 's Integrated Industrial Base. The Nation 's integrated industrial base includes those com panies with facilities, design and manufacturing processes, and technologies capable of servicing both commercial and Government needs. Non-Developmental Item (NDI) . Any previously developed item of supply used exclusively for governmental purposes by a Federal agency, a State, or local government that requires only minor modifications or modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace. Outcome Measure. Outcomes describe the intended result of carrying out a program or act ivity. Outcome measure indicates progress against achieving the intended result of a program. Indicates changes in conditions that the Government is trying to influence. Outlay . The issuance of checks, disbursement of cash, or electronic transfer of fund s made to liquidate a Federal obligation. Outlays also occur when interest on the Treasury debt held by the public accrues and when the Government issues bonds, notes, debentures, monetary credits, or other cash -equivalent instruments in order to liquidat e obligations. Also, under credit reform, the credit subsidy cost is recorded as an outlay when a direct or guaranteed loan is disbursed. Output Measure . A type of measure, specifically the tabulation, calculation, or recording of activity or effort usu ally expressed quantitatively. Outputs describe the level of activity that will be provided over a period of time. Outputs refer to the activities or products of a program. While output measures can be useful, there must be a reasonable connection between outputs used as performance indicators and outcomes. Agencies should select output measures based on evidence supporting the relationship between outputs and outcomes, or in the absence of available evidence, based on a clearly established argument for the logic of the relationship. Performance budget. A budget presentation that clearly links performance goals with costs for achieving a target level of performance. In general, a performance budget links strategic goals with related long -term and annual performance goals (outcomes) with the costs of specific activities to influence these outcomes about which budget decisions are made. The Performance Budget/Annual Performance Plan is either used CAPITAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE GLOSSARY OMB Circular No. A -11 (2023 ) Page 91 of Capital Programming Guide to structure or is a part of the agency 's budget submission t o OMB and the agency 's Congressional Budget Justification. Performance Measurement . A means of evaluating efficiency, effectiveness, and results. A particular value or characteristic used to measure progress toward goals, and also used to find ways to improve progress, reduce risks, or improve cost -effectiveness. Portfolio. A set of programs, projects or other work grouped together to meet strategic goals and objectives. Program Risk -Adjusted Budget (PRB). The total budget that represents the amount of resources and schedule expected to be needed to cover the risk of cost and schedu le overruns to meet a 90 percent probability of project/program success. It is an amount held at a level above the program level to be released to the program when needed to cover risk that was not identifiable through an IBR, but that history indicates will cause cost and schedule overruns from the Performance Measurement Baseline through no fault of the program management process. Program. An ongoing initiative composed of a group of projects and other work managed in a coordinated way to obtain bene fits not obtained from managing them individually. Project . A temporary endeavor to create a unique product or service with a start date, a completion date, and a defined scope. Strategic Goal. A statement of aim or purpose that is included in a strateg ic plan. Strategic goals articulate clear statements of what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission, and address relevant national problems, needs, and challenges. Each performance goal should relate to the strategic goals of the agency. Support Costs. Costs of activities not directly associated with production. Typical examples are the costs of automation support, communications, postage, process engineering, and purchasing. Target. Quantifiable or otherwise measurable characteristic that tells how well or at what level a program aspires to perform. "}
