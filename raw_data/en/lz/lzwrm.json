Section 221(b) of the act added this requirement to Section 202(f) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended: (3) On or before January 15 of each year, the Director, after consultation with the appropriate committees of the House and the Senate, shall submit to the Congress a report listing (A) all programs and activities funded during the fiscal year ending September 30 of that calendar year for which authorizations for appropriations have not been enacted for that fiscal year, and (B) all programs and activities for which no authorizations for appropriations have been enacted for the fiscal year beginning October 1 of that calendar year. The conference report on the Balanced Budget Act states that the purpose of the requirement is \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adopt authorizing legislation that must be in place before the thirteen regular appropriation bills can be considered.\" The content of this report consists of two appendixes. Appendix A summarizes programs that have received fiscal year 1990 appropriations, but which lack specific authorizations of appropriations for that year. Appendix B lists programs whose specific authorizations of appropriations will expire by the end of fiscal year 1990. The listings include data on all public laws enacted during the First Session of the 101st Congress. The information on authorizations is contained in CBO's Legislative Classification System (LCS). The information on amounts appropriated for fiscal year 1990 is from CBO's estimates of the current level of federal spending. 2 EXPIRING LEGISLATION January 15, 1990 PROGRAMS FUNDED IN FISCAL YEAR 1990 WITHOUT AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS Appendix A summarizes programs and activities that have received fiscal year 1990 appropriations, but which lack authorizations of appropriations for that year. The Congress at one time provided explicit authorizations of appropriations for the programs listed, but the authorizations expired and have not been renewed. Appendix A shows the last funding level authorized for each of these programs. Where the appropriate fiscal year 1990 appropriation bills or the legislative history provided explicit funding levels for programs listed in Appendix A, the amounts are shown. When no explicit amounts were provided (as when a small program was funded at an unidentified level in a large appropriation account), the Appendix notes that no amounts are available, and no dollar figures are shown. Two characteristics of the information in Appendix A should be noted. First, even if the fiscal year 1990 appropriation for a program or activity was not authorized, the agency normally may obligate and spend the funds. Second, Appendix A may not list every program and activity funded in fiscal year 1990 without an authorization. CBO does not track expiring authorizations that do not explicitly authorize appropriations, such as the Veterans Administration's authority to provide respite care. CBO also does not track unauthorized earmarks in appropriation acts. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the amounts appropriated in FY 1990 for programs and activities without authorizations by House and Senate authorizing committees, respectively. Table 3 summarizes the funding levels for programs that once had explicit authorizations of appropriations, listing the amounts by public law. Major Unauthorized Programs Nearly $31.3 billion of the $55.5 billion in fiscal year 1990 appropriations summarized in Appendix A are for programs whose most recent authorizations of appropriations expired at the end of fiscal year 1989. The largest of these programs are the Department of Housing and Urban Development's housing and community development programs and the Farmers Home Administration's rural housing programs ($14.8 billion), and the activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration other than the international space station ($10.6 billion). Other programs in this category January 15, 1990 INTRODUCTION 3 include foreign relations activities of the State Department and other agencies ($4.3 billion) and the Department of Education's vocational education programs ($0.9 billion). The other $24.2 billion in unauthorized fiscal year 1990 appropriations are for programs whose authorizations expired before the 101st Congress. In this category, unauthorized funds for international security and development and foreign assistance programs totalled $10.7 billion. The 99th Congress authorized funding for those programs through fiscal year 1987. Over $5.9 billion are for the Department of Justice. The annual authorization for most of the Department's programs has not been enacted since 1979. Over $5.0 billion of the unauthorized funds are for civilian Department of Energy (DOE) programs. Annual authorizations for these programs are required by law, but funding for most of them was last authorized, through fiscal year 1984, by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Competitiveness Act of 1989 reauthorized DOE renewable energy programs for fiscal years 1991 through 1993. 4 EXPIRING LEGISLATION January 15, 1990 TABLE 1.

The listing indicates by public law the amounts authorized to be appropriated for expiring programs and activities. Tables 4 through 7 provide aggregate information on the expiring authorizations of appropriations listed in Appendix B. Table 4 shows the number of laws that will expire before fiscal year 1991, classified by the amounts they authorize to be appropriated for fiscal year 1990. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the expiring laws by House and Senate authorizing committees, respectively. Shown for each committee are the number of expiring laws under its jurisdiction and the total authorizations for fiscal year 1990. Table 7 lists the expiring laws that authorize fiscal year 1990 appropriations greater than $50 million. Major Expiring Authorizations Many of the expiring laws listed in Appendix B are annual authorizations. The largest of these include statutes that authorize fiscal year 1990 funding for the Department of Defense, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ocean and coastal programs, the government's intelligence agencies, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. International Trade Commission, and Defense Production Act programs. Also expiring before fiscal year 1991 are two-year authorizations for Nuclear Waste Policy Act programs, the National Institutes of Health, other Department of Health and Human Services health programs, the Department's developmental disabilities programs and grants for mental health demonstration projects, the Commerce Department's export promotion programs, and McKinney Act programs for the homeless. Expiring three-year authorizations include those for Head Start and other human services programs of the Department of Health and Human Services. January 15, 1990 INTRODUCTION 9 TABLE 4.
