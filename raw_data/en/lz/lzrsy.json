Central to this debate is quantifying the contribution of adolescents and children to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the potential impact of vaccinating these age groups. In this study, we present a novel SEIR mathematical disease transmission model that quantifies the impact of different vaccination strategies on population-level SARS-CoV-2 infections and clinical outcomes. The model employs both age- and time-dependent social mixing patterns to capture the impact of changes in restrictions. The model was used to assess the impact of vaccinating adolescents and children on the natural history of the COVID-19 pandemic across all age groups, using the UK as an example. The base case model demonstrates significant increases in COVID-19 disease burden in the UK following a relaxation of restrictions, if vaccines are limited to those 18 years and vulnerable adolescents (12 years). Including adolescents and children in the vaccination program could reduce overall COVID-related mortality by 57%, and reduce cases of long COVID by 75%. This study demonstrates that vaccinating adolescents and children has the potential to play a vital role in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, and subsequent COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, across all ages. Our results have major global public health implications and provide valuable information to inform a potential pandemic exit strategy.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-10-15", "cleaned_text": "Significantly Reduces COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality across All Ages: A Population-Based Modeling Study Using the UK as [1](#B1-vaccines-09-01180)]. It has been estimated that at least one in five people infected with COVID-19 experience persistent ill health following the acute phase of infection. This condition is typically referred to as long COVID; it includes both ongoing symptomatic COVID-19, with signs and symptoms continuing for 4 to 12 weeks after acute COVID-19, as well as post-COVID-19 syndrome, with signs and symptoms that develop during or after acute COVID-19 continuing for more than 12 weeks, and which cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-01180)]. [1](#B1-vaccines-09-01180)]. The success of vaccination programs depends upon multiple factors, including vaccine efficacy, the speed of vaccine rollout and uptake rates, the emergence of new variants, patterns of social mixing and, critically, population vaccination strategies. In countries where an increasing percentage of adults are fully vaccinated, but where children and adolescents are not, debate persists as to the population relevance of the high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents, and the role of vaccinating younger age groups in controlling the pandemic. In the UK, vaccination of those over the age of 12 years is, as of 30 July 2021, limited to vulnerable individuals and those in households with immunocompromised members; mass vaccination of children and adolescents is not currently planned [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-01180)]. [4](#B4-vaccines-09-01180), [5](#B5-vaccines-09-01180)]. Based on these results, Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine has been approved for adolescents 12 years in the US, as well as in European Union member states and in the UK [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-01180), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-01180), [8](#B8-vaccines-09-01180)]. Moreover, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recently adopted a positive opinion, recommending marketing authorization for Moderna's vaccine to include adolescents 12 years [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-01180)], with other nations following suit. [10](#B10-vaccines-09-01180), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-01180), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-01180)]. Such mathematical models have become a central tool in the control of COVID-19 in many countries; they can provide short- and long-term forecasts regarding the future direction of the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide a framework for evaluating the potential impact of different vaccination strategies. The most relevant mathematical models relating to the spread of a pandemic are compartmental models, with the population divided into different population groups based on their infection status (e.g., susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered), and with assumptions being made about the rate of transfer from one group to another. Here, we use a novel Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model to quantify the impact of COVID-19 variants on disease and transmission, using the UK as an example due to the country's high COVID-19 vaccination rates in adults, the high prevalence of the delta variant, and the lifting of all COVID-19 restrictions as of 19 July 2021. We evaluated the impact of returning to pre-pandemic levels of social mixing in the UK from 19 July 2021 on future COVID-19 pandemic dynamics. In addition, we assessed the population level impact of extending the vaccination program to all adolescents, as well as to all adolescents and children, on SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, hospitalization, mortality, and rates of long COVID. 2. Methods 2.1. Disease Transmission Model Overview [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-01180-f001)), structured to evaluate transmission within nine incremental age bands of 10 years each, from 0 years old to 79 years old, and an additional age group comprising those 80+ years old. [supplementary appendix (Supplementary Methods, Tables S1-S9, Figures S1 and S2)](#app1-vaccines-09-01180). 2.2. Scenarios Evaluated [Tables S10-S12 and Figures S3-S5](#app1-vaccines-09-01180)illustrate the vaccine coverage and rate of uptake applied for each scenario: BC, BCA, and BCAC, respectively. 2.3. Sensitivity Analysis 3. Results [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-01180-f002)). [Table 1](#vaccines-09-01180-t001)). Extending vaccinations to also include adolescents and children would be expected to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections to approximately 2 million (26% reduction) and 736,000 (64% reduction), respectively, over the same period. Hospital admissions and deaths would decrease to approximately 101,000 (21% reduction) and 10,500 (18% reduction), (60% reduction) and 5500 (57% reduction), respectively, (BCAC). An additional 80,000 cases of long COVID would be expected to occur between July to December 2021, with the potential to be reduced to 58,000 (27% reduction) and 20,000 (75% reduction) when extending vaccination to adolescents and children, respectively. [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-01180-f003)). While the mortality rate in children <18 years is low (20 cases would be expected under the base case scenario), the BCAC vaccination strategy would be expected to reduce overall COVID-related mortality by 57%. [Figure 4](#vaccines-09-01180-f004)illustrates the patterns of benefit across age groups associated with extending vaccination to children, with children and adolescents principally benefiting from fewer long COVID cases (approximately 40,000), and older people (>60 years) having fewer deaths (approximately 4000). The pattern of hospitalizations avoided is also noteworthy, with adolescent vaccination contributing to a reduction of approximately 5700 events in the age group, which, in absolute terms, is greater than any single adult age group. [Table 1](#vaccines-09-01180-t001)). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses also highlight the impact associated with reduced vaccine coverage. Under the BC scenario, infections would be expected to increase from 2.7 million to 3.0 million and 3.1 million for vaccine coverage of 100%, 75%, and 50%, respectively. These additional infections would be associated with a corresponding increase in hospitalizations, deaths, and long COVID cases ( [Table 1](#vaccines-09-01180-t001)). 4. Discussion [13](#B13-vaccines-09-01180)]. Our model supports the assertions of these experts, and demonstrates a significant, expected increase in the COVID-19 disease burden over the coming months as the population moves towards pre-pandemic levels of social mixing. However, despite the lifting of restrictions, reported cases in the UK fell in late July/early August. This observation has been postulated to be due to a variety of factors: the success of vaccines and NHS test-and-trace processes, a reduction in testing, a continuation of the vast majority of individuals maintaining social distancing and face coverings despite legislative changes, or the natural transmission break that occurred as adolescents and children entered summer vacation. For the two weeks prior to 'Freedom Day', up to 10% of adolescents and children were absent from school after confirmed COVID-19 contact [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01180)]. This break in the viral transmission at schools among unvaccinated adolescents mimics our modelling of the impact from vaccinating this population, without adolescents and children missing their vital educational experience. Additionally, it highlights that, once children return to school, if a viral reservoir remains in the community, then there is likely to be an additional, larger wave of COVID-19 cases; this demonstrates the need to take a population-based approach to COVID-19 management. Our study demonstrates that this burden can be reduced by 35% if the current UK vaccination program is extended to all adolescents 12 years. These results align with those from a recent Australian modelling study, which evaluated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination under a range of coverage levels, vaccine efficacies, and age-groups, and which demonstrated that a high vaccination coverage of 90% in both adults and adolescents was required to mitigate COVID-19 transmission without implementing lockdown measures [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-01180)]. Furthermore, a study of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in Israel provide observational evidence that, as well as protecting individuals who have been vaccinated, COVID-19 vaccination provided indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals; for every 20% point increase in the proportion of individuals who were vaccinated, the positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately two-fold [ [16](#B16-vaccines-09-01180)]. [17](#B17-vaccines-09-01180), [18](#B18-vaccines-09-01180), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-01180)], a small number of children present with a multisystem inflammatory state with an associated mortality rate of 1-2% [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-01180), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-01180), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-01180)]. Furthermore, evidence is emerging that children may experience long COVID symptoms, similar to adults, which can lead to high morbidity and limitations in daily functioning [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-01180), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-01180), [25](#B25-vaccines-09-01180)]. In adults, there is clear evidence of post-COVID damage to the lung, heart, kidneys, and brain. The ONS reported that 15% of young adults aged 16-29 years experience long COVID symptoms, with at least 35% reporting it affecting their work or education beyond 3 months [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-01180)]. It would be unlikely if this did not extend, to some degree, to lower age groups. Additionally, adolescents and children are affected by the indirect effects of COVID-19, for example, the interruption of schooling, the impact on mental health, increased social inequalities, and in a worst-case scenario, the loss of a parent or grandparent [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-01180)]. [28](#B28-vaccines-09-01180)]. However, there have been no recorded deaths due to myocarditis and pericarditis, and almost all cases have made a spontaneous, complete recovery. Even if we were to assume a doubling of risk in adolescents compared to adults >20 years (8 per million), extrapolation onto the adolescent population results in 37 excess cases in the UK (which would resolve spontaneously), compared to the several thousand hospitalizations and 23 deaths of adolescents prevented by vaccination. [29](#B29-vaccines-09-01180), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-01180)]. Assuming these trials report no unexpected adverse events, our model predicts a greater population-wide benefit by extending the vaccination program to children than was observed in adolescents. Given the increased mixing patterns, the difficulties in maintaining physical distance, and the poor adherence to face coverings, this approach has double the impact of vaccinating those over the age of 12 (73% vs. 26%, respectively). This benefit translates into a 75% reduction in long COVID, a condition that we do not yet fully understand the longer-term impact of. Limitations 5.
