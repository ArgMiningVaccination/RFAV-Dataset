It occurs when the skin loses moisture fast and becomes dehydrated, which can lead to the skin itching, flaking, and developing a rough texture. Common causes for dry skin include: In addition to external factors, some conditions can cause excessively dry skin, such as dermatitis, psoriasis, diabetes and thyroid disease. Although there are over-the-counter treatments for dry skin, lots of us prefer to use natural remedies to promote better skin health, and to avoid coming into contact with harsh chemicals (that can sometimes make dry skin worse). In this article, we're helping you get started by sharing our top natural remedies for dry skin. Coconut oil acts as a sealant, which helps trap water into the skin to keep it moist. In addition, coconut oil is rich in fatty acids that help to nourish the skin, to improve elasticity and moisture. If you're looking to purchase coconut oil that you can use on your skin and hair, buy organic and non-hydrogenated [coconut oil](https://www.healthline.com/health/coconut-oil-moisturizer#what-to-look-for), or opt for a product that contains a high amount of coconut oil extract. To use? Simply scoop up a small amount and massage it into your dry skin. Aloe vera is another crowd favourite. Just like coconut oil, it functions as a moisturiser that can hydrate dry skin. However, it also contains antioxidants that can help repair damaged skin cells and promote collagen production \u2014 which helps new cells to grow and replace dead skin cells, as well as [gives structure, strength and elasticity to your skin](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23089-collagen). [To use aloe vera](https://www.wikihow.com/Extract-Aloe-Vera), extract the gel from the plant by cutting off one of the outermost leaves, and carefully slicing away the skin. This will reveal slabs of clear aloe vera gel that can be applied directly to the skin. You can also use aloe vera as a hair mask to promote healthy hair growth. Honey is a natural humectant, which means it helps [attract water from the air or from deeper in the skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/what-is-a-humectant#:~:text=Humectants%20are%20substances%20that%20attract,but%20many%20industries%20use%20them.). In addition to this, honey contains nutrients and antioxidants that are thought to [promote skin cell regeneration, reduce redness and add moisture](https://uk.gisou.com/blogs/blog/honey-for-dry-skin#:~:text=Another%20quick%20and%20easy%20way,cleanse%20and%20moisturise%20dry%20skin.). It is no surprise then, that honey is a fantastic natural remedy for dry skin. Simply massage raw honey directly into your skin in a circular motion to hydrate and exfoliate skin, and promote elasticity and firmness. Cucumber contains antioxidants and vitamins that can help to promote overall skin health. It's important to note that cucumber is 96% water, and water alone isn't enough to moisturise your skin. However, mixing cucumber with coconut oil, aloe vera and honey can help to further hydrate and soothe the skin. If you're looking for a natural exfoliant, colloidal oats can help to remove dead skin cells \u2014 in fact, it's so effective that it's found in a lot of cosmetic products. This is because, alongside both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, oatmeal helps to create a protective barrier to keep the skin from losing excess water, and staying moisturised for longer. Although you can mix oatmeal with water to form a paste, and gently apply it to your skin, the most popular method is having an oatmeal bath. All you need is plain ground oats and a bathtub, where you can experiment with getting the oats to water ratio right, which you can then soak in. Dry brushing involves using a dry, natural bristle [body brush](https://www.wildandstone.com/products/natural-body-brush), to massage and exfoliate skin. This helps to lift and remove dead skin cells, and unclog pores to help eliminate toxins, which promotes softer, smoother and younger looking skin. In addition, dry brushing can boost lymph flow and lymphatic drainage, increase circulation, and leave us feeling energised (because it stimulates the nervous system). To dry brush, stroke the skin in long, sweeping motions, working your way upwards on limbs and in circular motions on the torso and back. You should use lighter pressure on sensitive areas, such as the abdomen and neck. Do this before or after a shower, and follow with a moisturiser (homemade or otherwise) to lock in hydration. Although simple, dry brushing is highly effective for dry skin. Want to learn more?
