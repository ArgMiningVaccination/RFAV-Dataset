In collaboration with generous donors, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) is investing an estimated $4.9 million in vital pancreatic cancer research through its competitive peer -reviewed 2017 Research Grants Program - including 17 grants to 21 researchers at 12 institutions across t he country. Cancer Progress Spotlighted in the News In early June , nearly 40,000 clinical oncologists, cancer researchers and other healthcare and industry professionals convene d in Chicago for the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting - the world's largest clinical oncology meeting. On June 16, an article was published in Parade that highlights celebration -worthy announcements from this year's ASCO meeting. Hundreds of 'Purple People' Step Up, Stand Tall, Act Boldly on Capitol Hill Our nation's capital was covered in purple on Tuesday, June 20, on the 10th anniversary of National Pancreatic Cancer Advocacy Day. That's because more than 650 passionate advocates, including more than 100 pancreatic cancer survivors, were on Capitol Hill to urge their members of Congress to make cancer research a national priority. All 50 states were represented, and thousands more from every state called their senators and representative to echo t hat same message. Take a look at a few highlights from the historic event. U.S. Congressional Leaders Wage Hope Together to Supp ort Pancreatic Cancer Research On June 20 , congressiona l leaders came together with bi partisan support for cancer research during the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's 10th annual Advocacy Day in Washington D.C. Medscape Highlights Pancreatic Cancer and Precision PromiseSM in Recent Feature Medscape published a feature story detailing the science behind pancreatic cancer. The article recounts the devastating statistics of the disease and highlights the advancements being made despite many challeng es. At the heart of the article is PanCAN's revolutionary Precision PromiseSM initiative that is bringing together integral members of the pancreatic cancer community to accelerate research progress for the disease. Why a Pancreatic Cancer Call Center? A recent NPR piece highlighted an important topic: cancer call centers.

BIOLOGY OF CANCER RAS Proteins and Their Regulators in Human Disease Journal : Cell Institution(s) : Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick, MD , and others Corresponding author(s) : Frank McCormick Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author : Frank Mc Cormick, PhD, FRS: recipient, 2010 Fredman Family Foundation - Innovative Grant and member, Emeritus Scientific and Medical Advisory Board Major finding : RAS proteins are binary switch es, cycling between ON and OFF states during signal transduction. These switches are normally tightly controlled, but in RAS -related diseases, such as cancer, RASopathies, and many psychiatric disorders, mutations in the RAS genes or their regulators rende r RAS proteins persistently active. The structural basis of the switch and many of the pathways that RAS controls are well known, but the precise mechanisms by which RAS proteins function are less clear. All RAS biology occurs in membranes: a precise 7 under standing of RAS' interaction with membranes is essential to understand RAS action and to intervene in RAS -driven diseases . Expanding the Scope of Electrophiles Capable of Targeting K -Ras Oncogene s Journal : Biochemistry Institution(s) : University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, and others Corresponding author(s) : Gordon Mills, David Kwiatkowski or Chad Creighton Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author : Kenneth Scott, PhD: recipient, 2014 Career Development Award Major finding : Molecular alterations involving the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (including mutation, copy number, protein, or RNA) were examined across 11,219 human cancers representing 32 major types. A substantial f raction of cancers showed high mTOR pathway activity without an associated canonical genetic or genomic alteration, including cancers harboring IDH1 or VHL mutations, suggesting multiple mechanisms for pathway activation . A Pan -Cancer Proteogenomic Atlas of PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway Alterations Journal : Cancer Cell Institution(s) : Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX , and : Kevan Shokat Action Netwo rk-affiliated author : Lynn McGregor, PhD: recipient, 2015 KRAS Fellowship Major finding : With a goal of targeting oncogenic K -Ras variants (e.g., G12D) by expanding the types of amino acids that can be targeted by covalent inhibitors, the authors survey a set of electrophiles for their ability to label carboxylates. Their results both demonstrate the ability of a noncatalytic cysteine to react with a diverse set of electrophiles and emphasize the importance of proper spatial arrangements between a covalen t inhibitor and its intended nucleophile. They hope that these results can expand the range of electrophiles and nucleophiles of use in covalent protein modulation . Alterations in Mucins Across Cancers Journal : Oncotarget Institution(s) : University of Ne braska Medical Center, Omaha, NE Corresponding author(s) : Pankaj Singh Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author : Pankaj Singh, PhD: recipient. 2013 Career Development Award Majo r finding : The authors' study presents a comprehensive analysis of genomic alterations in mucins and their corresponding roles in cancer progression .

They have identified cis-eQTLs representing potential functional regulatory variants in the pancreas and generated a rich data set for further studies on gene expression and its regulation in pancreatic tissues. KIF15 Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Proliferation via the MEK -ERK Signalling Pathway Journal : British Journal of Cancer Institu tion(s) : Renmin Hos pital of Wuhan University, Wuhan , Chin a, and others Corresponding author(s) : Jianxin Jiang Major finding : This study identified KIF15 as a critical regulator that promotes pancreatic cancer proliferation, broadening our understanding of KIF15 function in tumorigenesis . Nature and Nurture: What Determines Tumor Metabolic Phenotypes? Journal : Cancer Research Institution(s) : Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, M A, and others Corresponding author(s) : Matthew Vander Heiden Major finding : These data argue that some cancer metabolic phenotypes are defined by cancer tissue -of-origin and environment and that these features constrain the influence of genetic mutations on me tabolism. A better understanding of the factors defining tumor nutrient utilization could be exploited to help improve cancer therapy . ETIOLOGY Ambry to Present New Data Showing That up to 30% of Cancer Risk Carriers Are Missed by Current Testing Guidelines at the 2017 ASCO Meeting ASCO abstract Meeting : 2017 American Soci ety of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting Institution(s) : Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Cambridge, MA , and others Lead author(s) : Mary Linton Bounetheau Peters Major finding : Preliminary show that 6.6% of unselected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients carry a germline mutation in a gene known to increase PDAC risk and 4.3% have a mutation in genes not previously linked to PDAC. Existing testing criteria did not identify 30% of carriers. Continued refinement of guidelines i s necessary to align genetic testing with inherited PDAC risk . EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND PROGNOSIS Pancreatic Cyst Fluid Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A and Carcinoembryonic Antigen : A Highly Accurate Test for the Diagnosis of Serous Cystic Neoplasm Pancreatic Cancer Action Network Latest News blog article: New Study Identifies Tes t to Diagnose Benign Pancreatic Cysts Journal : Journal of the American College of Surgeons Institution(s) : Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN Corresponding author(s) : C. Max Schmidt Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author : C. Max Schmidt, MD, PhD, MBA, FACS: recipient, 2003 Career Development Award 9 Major finding : Although VEGF -A alone is a highly accurate test for serous cystic neoplasms (SCN) , the combination of VEGF -A with CEA approaches the gold standard for pathologic diagnosis, importantly avoiding false positives. Patients with a positive test indicating benign SCN can be spared a high -risk surgical pancreatic resection . Pancreatic Cysts - Part 1: Using the A merican Gastroenterological Association Guidelines for the Management of Pancreatic Cysts -A Practical Approach Journal : Pancreas Institution(s) : University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI Corresponding author(s) : James Scheiman Major finding : The recent publication of evidence -based guidelines by the American Gastroenterological Association for the management of the incidental pancreatic cyst has stimulated considerable discussion among clinicians and researchers.

The authors' RNA -Seq analysis suggests that ASI reduce the malignant potential of cancer c ells and stimulate the immune microenvironment in primary PDAC . Differential and Joint Effects of Metformin and Statins on Overall Survival of Elderly Patients with Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: A L arge Population -based Study Journal : Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention Institution(s) : Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey , New Brunswick, NJ, and others Corresponding author(s) : Xiang -Lin Tan Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated auth or: Gloria Petersen, PhD: recipient, 2017 Early Detection Targeted Grant and member, Scientific & Medical Advisory Board Major finding : The authors' findings suggest potential benefits of statins on improving survival among elderly pancreatic ductal adeno carcinoma patients; further prospective studies are warranted to corroborate the putative benefit of statin therapy in pancreatic cancer. Although more studies are needed to confirm our findings, their data add to the body of evidence on potential anti -cancer effects of statins . Chemoradiation JAMA Oncology Institution(s) : Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, O R Corresponding author(s) : Gina Vaccaro or Charles Lopez Major finding : Randomized clinical trials to date have failed to demonstrate a clear b enefit in locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer patients for reasons including underpowered trials, poor accrual, lack of optimal systemic therapy or radiation therapy, and lack of radiation quality control. Moreover, a significant limitation of chemoradiation remains the disease biology itself\u2014namely, the high prevalence of occult metastatic disease, rendering many patients unlikely to benefit from a local therapy approach . Delivery of Meaningful Cancer Care: A Retrospective Cohort Study Assessing Cost and Benefit with the ASCO and ESMO Frameworks Journal : The Lancet Oncology Institution(s) : University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada , and others Corresponding author(s) : Christopher Bo oth Major finding : The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) have developed frameworks that quantify survival gains in light of toxicity and quality of life to assess the benefits of cancer therap ies. The authors applied these frameworks to a cohort of contemporary randomized controlled trials to explore agreement between the two approaches and to assess the relation between treatment benefit and cost. They found that t here is only fair correlation between these two major value care frameworks, and negative correlations between framework outputs and drug costs. Delivery of optimal cancer care in a sustainable health system will necessitate future oncologists, investigators, and policy makers to reco ncile the disconnect between drug cost and clinical benefit . Exosomes Facilitate Therapeutic Targeting of Oncogenic KRAS in Pancreatic Cancer Journal : Nature Institution(s) : University of Texa s MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, T X, and others Corresponding author(s) : Raghu Kalluri Major finding : Treatment with engineered exosomes (known as iExosomes) suppressed cancer in multiple mouse models of pancreatic cancer and significantly increased o verall survival.
