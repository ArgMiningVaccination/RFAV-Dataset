NUNM's ND School is a 4-Year Accredited Medical School The first two years being very similar to allopathic medical school. You will be enrolled in anatomy, biochemistry, immunology, microbiology, pathology and physiology courses. In the first year, you will enter our community healthcare clinics in an observational capacity and begin your preceptorships with a licensed practitioner who will supervise your clinic shifts. Unlike Allopathic Medical Programs, Our Students Take Over 170 Hours in Nutrition Naturopathic students study the microbiome, and incorporate nutrition into every diagnosis. Naturopathic medical education also differs in that NDs avoid symptom suppression as it can interfere with the healing process, and instead work to determine the root cause of symptoms. In addition to being trained as primary care physicians, NDs use \"Nature Cure\" or traditional naturopathic medicine modalities to activate the body's capacity for self-healing and self-regeneration, which supports the healing process and leads to improving the state of overall health.
