When used for meditation, prayer, and sacred rituals, essential oils can be powerful tools to: - Create an atmosphere of peace, balance, and serenity - Promote relaxation - Clear mental clutter - Increase focus - Elevate feelings of positivity - Encourage insightfulness - Reduce negative energy - Eliminate negative self-talk By the way, many people use essential oils to treat illnesses and conditions.

Some women have a dedicated space in their homes. However, that is not always feasible or practical for most of us. Whether it is your kitchen table, porch, bedroom, or your she-shed, take a few minutes to set up a calm, inviting space. If this is for a women's circle, then the Circle Guide or Hostess chooses the location and prepares it for the gathering. Essential oils can be used in many ways for spiritual practices, but the most common way is through aromatherapy. Interestingly, aromatherapy works primarily through your sense of smell and absorption through the skin and pulse points. Choose the Right Oil for the Occasion and Intention It is important to choose the right essential oils for the occasion or intention. So why is that important? Well, different essential oils have different properties and can evoke different emotions. For example, sage is known for its purification properties. On the other hand, lavender promotes relaxation and inner peace, and peppermint increases focus and concentration. Some of the ways to use aromatherapy for meditation and sacred rituals include: - Inhaling a few drops - Using an essential oil diffuser - Spraying mists into the air - Lighting scented candles - Burning cleansing herbs Inhale a Few Drops Sprinkle a few drops of essential oils on a folded tissue or cotton ball. Then, inhale a few drops slowly and deeply several times before meditating. If this is for a women's circle, prepare enough for the group, and place them in an attractive bowl. They can be prepared ahead of time and stored in a zipped plastic bag. Use an Essential Oil Diffuser An essential oil diffuser is a device that disperses essential oils into the air. An electric diffuser uses water and a few drops of essential oils. Some automatically shut off after 30 or 60 minutes. However, others need to be unplugged. For safety reasons, follow the manufacturer's instructions. A reed diffuser uses short, smooth sticks (reeds or bamboo skewers), which are placed in a glass container. The essential oils are blended with white rubbing alcohol, a carrier oil, or water. Now, you don't want to miss this. Use reeds when using carrier oils and bamboo skewers when using distilled water. The reeds absorb the fragrance and then release it into the air. A reed diffuser will last several weeks. If this is for a women's circle, two or three diffusers may be needed, depending on the size of the space. Use Sprays or Mists Sprays or mists are one of the safest and most versatile ways to use essential oils. Indeed, people often spray them on soft surfaces such as pillows, cushions, and blankets. Additionally, they are sprayed in the air as an aura smudge. If you're unfamiliar with smudging, it is a ritual of cleansing the energy of a room or object. Aura smudge sprays are available online and at health food stores. You can also make your own. Many believe a smudge spray helps to prepare their energy and mind for meditation. Sage and palo santo are often used for smudging. Use Scented Candles Scented candles help to set the mood of any room. Rather than choose a candle based on its smell, choose it based on the mood you want to create or change. For the best experience, burn a candle for 30-60 minutes before the event. Indeed, this allows the wax to melt properly. It also provides enough time for the fragrance to disperse and fill the room. If this is for a women's circle, create a few groups of candles, and place them strategically around the room. Plug In a Himalayan Salt Lamp While not an essential oil, [Himalayan salt lamps](https://amzn.to/3Xl7VJD) add to the ambiance of a meditation space or women's circle.

Using a [ salt lamp helps to](https://www.saltremedy.net/10-reasons-to-have-a-himalayan-salt-lamp-in-every-room-of-your-home/): - Clean the air - Increase energy levels - Improve mood - Increase focus - Reduce static electricity - Neutralize electromagnetic radiation Best Essential Oils for Meditation and Sacred Rituals Sacred Rituals and Purification Many sacred rituals and meditation practices use cleansing and blessing herb bundles, resins, and incense sticks.
