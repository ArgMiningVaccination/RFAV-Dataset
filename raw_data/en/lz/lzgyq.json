National Institutes of Health liethelda, Maryland1976DHEW PubWatiOn No (NIH) 76 256 o PREFACE 'There are relatively few institutions that cancl:\\irnto have witnessed two-thirds of ourn tion's`history. Founded only 60 years afterthe\\ birth \\of our country (1836) the NationalLibrary Of Medicine has been intimatelyinvolyed with both Federal and private healthprograms as a major collector and distributorof health related information. It is my hopethat those in the health community, for whomthis report is intended, will come tocrealizewhat an irreplaceable treasure they possess intheir National Library of Medicine..Not only has the Library been a regularcontributor to the medical literature (havingissued. some 10 million copies -of IndexMedicus since 1879), but has beerfa movingforceindeveloping new modalities forinformation dissemination. This amalgama-tion of traditional functions and services withnew technology is a theme the reader willencounter over and over in each chapter.In honor of the Bicentennial celebrationthe Library will have a speCial\u00b0 exhibit onAmerican medical literature. On display willbe early treasures from our collection includ-ing a teller from George Washington recom-mending two doctors to the Medical Depart-ment of the Army. The exhibit will be open.throughout 19''5, and I invite those interestedin the nation's medical history to visit theLibrary and view it.Finally, I wish to acknowledge that what-evergreatnesstheLibraryhas achievedthroughout its history is not because of aphysical collection of texts and journals, butthe result of vision and effort on the part of adedicated and loyal staff. American medicinecan indeed be proud of their accomplish-ments. Martin M. Cummings, M.D.DirectorNational Library of MedicineBethesda, Maryland .

OFTHE AMERICAN MEDICAL tATERATURE1776 written. and printed in whatnow the United States HisA Brief Rule ta guide the\",'ContinORPeOpie Of - New- EnglandOrder.: Anierican medicine was exclusively on ideas, practices, andpublications imported from Europe. Ameri-can medical, culture generated little, scientificpublication and meager communication otherthan by word of mouth or letter. -For, thatmatter,'.there were few discoveries or inven-tionsto obe,,reported. Most public health_.triatters, were dealt with in the public press.Medical library facilities were commensurate,) with the state of\\ the literature. Although therewerea_leivrivate collections, it was not until763 thatthefirst real American meditalibntry came into existence at the Pennsylva-'ia -Hospital.sin Europe, where thefirstscientific journals were published by learned societies,the' Americanscientificliterature was an,outgroWth of theemerging scientific organiza-tions.-Their proceedings soon dominated thefield of scientific- publishing. One of theseorganizations, the American PhilosophicalSociety founded in 1743, was the first .lo -use aCommittee as an 'editorial review mechanism ,in- the selection -of- manuscripts_ forpublicar_don. This peetr review has survived to thepreient and represents a. great contribution. tothe quality of 'publications.The first American medical journal, Medi-cal Reposkory, was published in New. York in1797, more than a c-enturt . after Thacher's'publication, In1.804,thesuccessof the .Medical Repository led Dr. John RedmanCo : :eto publish_ the Philadelphia MedicalMuseum. In 1820 PhysicalSciences. waspublished by' Dr. the Edin-ew, \"In the four quarters of theglobe, who rea book? or goes to an American play? or looks at an eric.picture or statue? What does the world yet oweto American:: physicians or surgeons?\" This.statement was a challenge to Chapman andWas carried on the title pi ge of th journal aslong as he remained, the editor. In 1828 thisperiodicalmerged By 1876, when there were 46 medicaljournals-published-hrtheldnited-States;John,:ShaW BillingS felt that the American Journalwas the Only periodical of real merit becauseof its editorial policies, selection of original\"articles, and the presence of criticism andreviews.John Shaw 'Billings SirWilliam Osier (1849-1919), two Billings was. undoubtedly our coun-.-greatestbibliographer and librarian.Osier, the Canadian_ transplant, became ourmost notable medical teacher and clinician.Billings' creation of the Index-Catalogve andIndex Medicus remains one of America'sgreatest contributions tomedicine; Osler'sPrinciples and Practice of Medicine was thebest systematic textbook during this period..Osier, discussing the importance of themedical library in the continuing education ofthe physician wrote, \"'For the general practi-tioner a wellsed library one- of the fewcorrectives -oft e- prematute senility_which isso apt to over ke him. Self-centred, self-taught, he leads a olitary life, and unless hisevery-day experienis controlled by carefulreading or by the att 'don of a medical societyit soon ceases toobe ohe slightest value andbecomes a mere accret on of _facts, without correlation. , ItIS, astonishing with,how IDuring ourpresentcenturVavirtual explosion of medical Itas\\occurred._The of new disciplines in basic fc -rnediairideitteto-accompapyclinical-practice__.was clearly _reflected in the numbers and the-titles of new scientific books and journals.Before 1900, American physicians and scien-tists often Submitted manuscripts for publica-tion in foreign journals. After.the turn of thecentury most Arnericani,attempted to publishtheir scientific and clinical observations in theAmerican literature: In any examination OfAmerican medicine one Must distingUiShbetween the large amount of uncritical andanecdotal writing which ,,characterized the18th and 19th centuries and the more scientificand 'technical writing which has'appeared inthe 20th century. Although the former givesimageofmedicine as a reflection 'Ol-thecivilizattohe-timea_the latter more clearly-portrays the evolution !or-geterrtifie---ideas.concepts, and inventions. When. it becamegenerally accepted- that ...,,search was incorn-.plete until published, there was a further.increase in the a rate.---that-it-was-soon-necessary-to-increasegrettthe number of abstract journals.In recent years there has been a change inthe format as well as the character of medicalliteratUre. A relatively new type of publicationemerged, after. World War, II when Medicalnewsletters and controlled circulation medicalmagazines wereintrodUced. Supported largelyby advertising, they began to licompete with-1.3 more conventional medical iiodicals for thetime and attention the b sy practitioner.Much of the informationppears inlay language' making it easy t re nonscholarlyor nonscientific health prof ssional to scanquickly the highlights of in dical advances.For those who later seek and study the fullmedical reports this form of writing serves auseful alerting purpose.MediCal textbooks have a so changed incharacter.Itisrare that to inanyfieldor _textbooks by a large number oC centributors whoprepare chapters for inclusion in large textscompiled and edited by experts in the field.Thisreflectsthecomplexityof modern medicine and has served to make texts moreauthoritative' and timely..The critical review which has served as ameans of analyzing and selec.ively synthesiz-ing information has not flourished in thiscentury.AlthoughmostPhysiciansand scientists seek information in this form theyare apparently Unwilling or unable to preparecarefully documented objective reviews them-selves.Thisisaserious Shortcoming ofmodern scierice. Gresterefforts are -needed tosupport and Writing by recog-nized leaders of American medicine.Sir 'Theodore Fox, former editor of Lancet,has described2 the present inadequate methodsof transmitting medical information as .a crisisin communications. He characterized the roleof medical journals in tc:rmsi sugges1 that .they have outliVed their usefulness. It isbecoming apparent that we are approachingthe period when the conventional journal willbe replaced by more efficient, timely, and lesscostly mechanisms for information transfer. Amedical press designed to record significantmedical events and observations will probablycontinue but it will be associated with othermore dynamiC. audiovisual and electronicmeans of communication. Physicians and'Icts will have several options availablefor dissernrittrion-of-theidinclings and will nolonger be solely dependent upon tre-wPritt_word (or_ priority. _or, presKronick, in a stud0 of the history of earlyscientificjournals,questions' whether thedevelopinent of new communications technol-ogy adversely affects scholarship. Perhaps itdoes; however, it also makes the disseminationof new knowledge much easier and thus has\"more social utility. It is important thereforethat a new bibliographic apparatus, evolveconcurrently with the proliieratiOn 'of newcommunications media. If this is done theintegrity of the \"literature\" can be maintainedeven though it appears in radically new anddifferent formats.. Libraries are rising to the challenge bytransforming themselves from' passive reposi-tories of printed matter to active centers ofbiomedical information. The National Li-brary of Medicine now employs computers,audiovisual techniques, photographic meth-ods, television,,and satellites for disseminatingnot just bibliographic data but more completebiomedicalinformationalmessages.The \"literature\" thus will be expanded to includeinformation in many forms and formats andWill be :delivered rapidly to those_ who wish itor , the celebration, \"Atthe commencement Of the Revolutionary Warwe had one' medical book by an Americanauthor,threereprints, -and- about.,,),wentypamphlets.\"4 Today the National Library ofMedicine holds 1.5 million items and about 30percent of the medical journals being pub-lishedoriginateintheUnited States ofAinerica. No doubt within the next severaldecades it will be possible for all medicalinformation to be transmitted with great speedand accuracy to -any ,physician located any-Where-ciii Earth. The major problem will be toselect the most appropriate information forthe prOblem at hand. To deal with this,medical educators must teach students whereto get the information they need rather thanattempt to force theM just to memorize theinformation itself. Man's brain, remarkableand versatile as' itis; simply will not becapable of acquiring and indefinitely retain-ingvast amount of new knowledgegenerated by the biomedical sciences. REFERENCES1.

With RoCkefellerfunds,asurveyteam organized.: bythe American Librarl, Association reviewed theLibrary's operations nncl,programs, made several recommendations.- for improving theIndex-Catalogue.- The medical profession's interest in theLibrary had steadily risen with the growth ofwartime research. Surgeon General Norman_______LT.-Kirk-had-appointed a nuntber:of advisers tothe Library who; in October 1944, held theirfirst meeting as an Association of HonoraryConsultants. The Consultants, took an imme-diate interest in the redirectidn of the Library'sprograms, including the future of its medicalindexing activities.Serious considerationofthiiprobtem, 'hoWever, was to be the task the.dhair-manship of Dr. Lewis Weed, was charged with.the responsibility of :studying the .indexingrequirements of modern medical science andthe ability of the Libraries two indexingpublicationstosatisfy -them. To insureconcurrent consideration of was-made-anex-officio a fact-fir capabili-ty,a contract was 'negotiated with JohnsHopkins University.This contract established the Welch MedicalIndexing Project, headed. by Dr. Sanford V.__1..arkey..:One_of_the-earliest-interestsighown bythe Consultants' and Library manageinent__alike had been the potential application of:automatic data processing -equipment-to thepublication of indexes.

PresidentLyndon B. Johnson, in his preamble to thgPanel's.1966 report, stated: \"The Panel on of retOrnmendatithis..Among theseisthe recommendation that.there be. established, by the Department ofHealth, Education, and Welfare, a, computer- .based facilityto. cope with the flood oftoxiCologiCal information and to make itquickly, avaibble .: .\"Toxicological information was defined asAll information descriptive of the effects ofChemicals onlivingorganisMs. ortheir component subsystems.\" The Panel membersfound was .generatedand needed by' many segments ofsociety including universities, industries, andstate and 'Federal governments; that this information was widely dispersed thrOughthousands of journals of clinical medicine,pathology, biochemistry, microbiology, etc.;that a significant fraction of this informationis neither abstracted nor indexed; and that alarge portion7exists only in report's that areunavailable to the general investigator.Experience during the intervening 10 yearshas proven that the. Panel's analyses of some ofthe basic problems of toxicology and itsinformation support systems were pertinent.These problems have increased(in magnitude.While in 1966 there was much-Concern with .the potential adverse effects or. nil drugs,society isnow,even more concerned with thebiological effects of many newand not sonewchemicals to which man and his lifesupport systems are exposed. This concerncontinues to shift from compounds that causeacute adverse reactions to those that havelong-term deleteriPuS effects. A toxicologicalinformation.prograrn must provide methodsto make the results of toxicological investiga-tions qtuckly,_accurately, ana widely availableco those experts who perform researehmakeregulatory decisions, and monitor the enyi-,ronment. It must help to.prevcnt. unknowingduplication of expensive. labPra tory work.The Toxicology InforthatiOn Program wasplaced in the National Library. The Libraryhas three attributes to accommodat' such aneffort: (1) it is the world's largest archive inbiomedicine; (2) it has\"as noregulatory functionsand, therefore, can be neutral in any disputebetween Federal agencies and industry; and (3it is at the forefront of practically all thosetechnologicaldevelopments on which a growing information program must depend.Development of the ProgramThe Toxicology Information Program 'staffbegan its work 'with three questions: (I) Whowere the scientists active .in toxicology andrelated areas of science? (2) What types oftoxicology iiiformation did these scientistsneed? (3) What information resources were.available to this user community? During1967-1971; the following activities were ini- tiated to answer these questions.A computerized \"Roster of was ,pre - pared;it contained information ibout3,200 scientists.An on-line retrieval file incorporating thedata from a survey of \"User Needs forToxicologicalInformation and Data\"_was created for in-house applications andused to develop some subsequent projectsof the Program,The National Referral Center for Scienceand Technology of the Library of Con-gress, under a Library contract, created a\"Directory of Information Resources inthe United States: General Toxicology.\"The University of Pittsburgh analyzedabout 25,000 primary journals for theircontent of toxicological information tocreate a \"core\" list-of journal sources..To literature awarenessservice,theToxicityBibliography,a toxicology subset of the Library's MEDLARSdata base has contract withthe :National of an advisory group toinclude experts in'toxicology and pharmacol-' ogy serving for till !e-year terms..\"..28 27 ;the. first years of the Program the2..d raw of growth of resources andas not realized.

A third method ofbringing informatio to users was ,throughthe establishment of an retriev service based on the journal literature oftoxicology. This service is called TOXLINE.While a was natural:to follow the*\"MED-LINE model\" for toxicology, this could onlybeup-toa-certain point. In MEDLaS,themedicalliterature had astruciured, computerized system With a controlled, journalliSt; vocabulary, and display format. Thissystem lent itself readily for conversion to theon-line retrievalservice which eventuallybecame MEDLINE: However, these elementsof structure and control are not as readilyavailable for the literature of toxicolOgy. That-literaturels-not onlydiiperse'd over a largenumber of primary 4-urna Is, but it is alsocontained in secondi..y sources that coverbiomedicine (e:g., Chemical Abstracts, Biolog-ical Abstracts, Index. Medina). Therefore, itwas decided to proceed by extracting \"toxicol-ogy' subsets\" \u00a3rom the computer-readableversions of .such almost all with abstracts_ and/orindexingterms,and ChemicalAbstracts Service (CAS) Registry numbers. TOXLINEinformationisderived, fromfivemajor secondary archival of Medicine: ToxicityBibliography, from 1968.Environmental (formerly Pesticides Abstracts ,,,,Sulletin), from1966.Hayes File on Pesticides, 1940-1966. At the present time, TOXLINE serves 84commercial, 58- academic, 26gciVernmeifif:--and 2 miscellaneous users (170 total) for an average usage of 340 connect hours (1200Searches) each month.Future plans for. TOXLINE call for enrich-ing the basic files ,not only' with additionalabstracts from Chemical Abstracts and Biolog-ical,AbstraCtsbutalsowithspecialized literature files covering the areas of teratogene-sis, carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, drug interac-tion, drug interference with laboratory tests,and the biological aspects of drug. abuse., --One of the important -entry .points -intotoxicological data files is by the chemicalsubstance involved. Proper identificatioh ofthe substance .In'these--data bases becoMesessential. Such identification is not .al%Vays easy. or straightforward. beCause chemicalsubstances are often known by many differentnames. A new on-line chemical dictionary. file,calledl'CHEMLINE, hasbeen, created' toprovide the TOXLINE user with capabilitiesfor searches that combine thechemiCal substance concepts with biologicaleffects concepts. This file is derived from theChemical :'Abstracts Service (CAS). RegistryNomenclature.Files and contains-records forall CAS Registry.

The Commission recornMended speCific programs to strengthen thisalarmingly weak link, noting that libraries are,.interwoven into the basic 'fabric of research,teaching, and practice in a manner indispen-sable to progress, and that adequate libraryresources are essential to the nation's healthefforts. The National Library of Medicine wasdesigned as the logical point for planning,'?'developing, and managing these programs.The. Comtnission recommended to the Presi-dent that the .Department of Health, Educa-,.uon, and Welfare propose broadly conceived',.andadequately'fundedle'gislationwhich would authoriZe the -National Library of Medicine to undertake extramural functionSdesigned to assist the nation's medical libra-ries.andtodevelop new and improvedcommunication systems.

The Library wasencouraged to Conduct, forward-looking re-search to increase the effectiveness of medicallibrary service throughout the nation.The Commission stressed the Urgent need-for long-range planning for an effectivenetwork and notedthatexistinglibrary resources :were grossly, inadequate, for the . purpose.

Although much wasstill unknoWn in 1965 about the status andspecific n eds of the nation's health libraries,it was es imated that more than $100 mil-lion wo 1.4 be required to bring the re- sources o these libraries-up to recommendedstrength. The Resource Grant Program couldnot attept to meet this total need, nor wasthis Ms ntention. In the first five years of thelegisla on, less than $12 million was madeavaila Ie. During this same period the volumeof hlth information continued- to expand rapidly; 'the cost of informational materialsrose sharply; and as new programs in healthcare, research, and education were created,there was a considerable increase -in the demand for library services. .The Resource Grant Progra service through the a quisition of'resources. To accomplish this oal the law provided a formula system of gr nts in whichtheinitial award was based/ on previouslibrary expenditures. In additi h, an \"iinpact -. philosophy\" was adopted in hich priorityfunding would go to libras serving thelargest number of people. Considering theformulastructureoftheant and the philosophy of funding prior ty, it is obviousthat a majority of funds w nt, to the largermedical school libraries sie these had thelargest baseofinstitutio alsupport and served the largest number o users. In spite of--the-limitation of the form, la approach, theprogram had a substantial/ impact with morethan 400 libraries receiving support of almOst$12 million. /By 1970, when the Medical Library Assist-ance Act was renewed and amended, consider-ably more was known about-the health sciencelibrary Populatibn. The time had arrived totransfer emphasis to programs of serviceimprovement land to provide a stimulus forthe \"have-notT librariesthose which couldnot participate in the/original program.

It is a way ofhelping a medical library with the start-upcosts of a new medical library service. As withtheImprovementGrant,animportant criterionfor review of the Project Gramproposalisthe planforthepost-grant continuation of the project.The types of activities funded With theProject Grant mechanism are varied. Since itis not financially feasible for each medicallibrary to acquire all health science, informa-tion, various kinds of cooperative efforts arcbeing explored. One method by which smallhospital libraries can stretch their informationdollar is to form a consortium for the sharingof resources. An example of such a cooperativeeffort is a group -of community hospitals insuburban Boston that have formed, with theassistance of a Resource project Gram, aConsortium., for Information Resource \\toplan,develop, and eVakiatecoordinated information resources.Learning Resource Centers are, being estab-lished in libraries with grant assistance. Suchcenterscontainaudiovisualmaterials, computer-assisted instruction programs, self-teaching modules, and a, number of otherdiverse educational technologies. Funds wereawarded to the College of Medicine andDentistry in New Jersey to create an audiovis-ual center to serve not only the .faculty andstudents of the College but also the healthprofessionals throughout the entire Region IIof the Regional Medical Library system.Projects have also been funded to developautomated systems for library technical serv- ices.For example,attheUniversity of California, Los Angeles, Various aspects of the library's Operations, suclv as the serial record,have been automated and the software pack-ages developed there have. been .adapted byother institutions.Both types of Resource Grant ar Onsidered an, integral part of the Regions edical Library system. The basic philosophy this system is resource sharing ,and the ResOurceprogram is supportive of this concept. \\\\Regional Medical Libraries \\GN The Regional Medical 1.1 rat% system the country.It \\isa\\ means of assistinghealth .researchers,'educators, ' practitioners, and students, at all levels and inall health disciplines,, with their informationneeds. There are 1! regions, each administered ./ 56by a Regional Medical I.ibrary.'The mel for the network is hierarchical,with each higher-level facility acting as theprimary s urce of information material to theechelonow. The foundation of the networkis the \"baSic unit\" level, predominantly thelibraries of the nation's hospi61s, which arethe primary entry points' into the network forthe majority of health-workers. The next levelinthehierarchical chain consists of 125 \"resource libraries\"those institutions withMore comprehensive informational resourcesthat can be shared with institutions at the..basic unit level. /Usually these are medicalschool libraries. The backup facility for theseparticipating resource libraries within eachregion is the next level ip the system, theRegional Medical Library. As each region'sprimary health information source, the Re-gional Medical' Library has the additionalresponsibilityfor planning a c Adinatedsystem of library services within the region.The fourth level, the backup resource for theRegional Medical Libraries and the totallibrary network is the National Library ofMedicine.The conceptof anationalinteractive Regional Medical Library network was devel-oped in response to trends which began tosurface in the early1960s. The National.Library of Medicine and its advisors were thencreating programs which were significant'departures from the, traditional archival roleof national libraries.Although medicallibraries had alreadyestablished a reputation for coordination, andsharing, they had no organized arena withinwhich the full potential of this beneficialpracticecould berealized.Consequently.confronted with requests for new and. in-creased services, libraries began to turn moleand more to the source which was identified, bythe Congress as the \"libraries' library:\" Thus.there began to develop a dependency on the- .National Library of Medicine, .a.dependencywhich might have led to the evolution of amonolithicmedicallibraryresource and information system. This growing dependen-cy, if permitted to continue, could only haveeventually accelerated the deterioration ofinformation services and local informationcenters. As an alternative to a monolithicnational system,the National Libary ofMedicine committed itself to the developmentof a network of libraries which would extend,not only to the major prOfessional scx '.ety andmedical schoollibraries,but even to the . \"doctor's reading a small ruralhospital.' .In 1964 a Presidential Conritnission recom-mended that \"a legislative proposal should bedeveloped and enacted providing for the THE REGIONAL MEDICAL L2BRARY NETWORK support. andstimulationofaNational Medical Libraries Network.\" The Commis-sion concluded that an important solution tothe inadequacies of scientific communicationswas aflexible, network:based program ofplanning, stimulation, and coordination \"toassureallareas and all medical schools,scientists, and practitioners of the benefit ofeffectiveaccesstoallmedical data andinformation.\" In October 1965 the MedicalLibrary Assistance Act authorized a programof grants for the establishment of RegionalMedical Libraries.Given the unknowns in our informationabout existing resources and services, initialplanning, both national' and regionally, wasadifficult' ta.k. The Library ofAmerican Media alColleges,the AmericanHospital Associatiot, the Medical LibraryAssociation, and other groups and personsrepresenting the sources and users of healthscience information. The program was initiat-ed in October 1967, when the first RegionalMedical Library grant was awarded to the Countway.Library of Medicine in Boston. . Almost three years after the first grant, in July1970, another award to'cornplete the establish-ment of the geographic network was made tothe Health Science Library of the University.of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Thus,including the National Library of Medicine,which serves as Regional 'Medical Library forthe Mid-Atlantic states,there are, now 11Regional Medical Libraries covering all 50states.Each Regional MediCal Library providesnetwork management and coordination ofinformation services within the region andparticipates with other Regional 'MedicalLibraries and with the National Library ofMediCineinplanning forAninteractive cooperating network. The basic philosophy ofthe Regional MedicalLibrary systemis resource sharing. In order to advanCe thisconcept on a nationalbasis, emphasis isplaced on developing a program of coordinat-ed information services which will be respon-siveto.-userneedsasdetermined- by' acontinuing assessment of these needs. A keyelement 'in the' success, of these efforts is an interinstitutional commitment for the effec-tive and efficientutilization of major re-sources. This common commitment requiresan examination and a rational resolution ofthe issues of cooperative acquisitions and-cooperative technical services. Current plan-ning involves the rechanneling of the fiscalresources of libraries into activities whichfacilitate cooperative development.Since the Regional Medical Library pro-gramisdesignedto support health caredelivery, education, and research, planningmust begin with identifying the needs of thecommunity, and must provide an administra-tive structure and decision-Making processwhich are responsive to those needs. Assum-ing that these goals are attained, any legiti-mate health enterprise in the region.should beable to look to theRegional.Medical Libraryas its information arm and feel confident thatits,views will get carefuLconsideration in thedecision-making process.'Research and DemonstrationResearch, development, and demonstrationgrants are a significant portion of the medicallibrary assistance program. Research Supporthas been concerned primarily with the fieldsand specialties of the health informationprocess. It was recognized that critical needsfor betteraccess,to information by the nationalhealth community required basic research andtechnical development While new processes,techniques. and methods needed investiga-tion, it also became clear that successful workhad to become part of the general informationsystemfairlyquickly.Accordingly, withrenewalof,legislation in 1970 and 1974, theCongress added authority for demonstrationprojects' so that the benefits of new methodscould be exhibitedin,actual. operating situa-tions.Project to link a medical library (University of Cincinnati)with patient. care weas was supported by NIA grant. .ksek..4 58Members of' the National Library of Medi-cinepeerreviewgroups conductedtwoconferences, in October 1974 and May 1975, to'discuss current trends in information scienceresearch. The suggestions and advice fromthese conferences helped to establish researchgoals for the future.

Speakers at theconferences agreed that better understandingof decision-making processes and means bywhich those processes could be augmentedand improved through computer assistancemight yield, considerable returns in improvedpatient-care and 'health education.In the years from 1966 through . 1974, theNational-LibraryofMedicineawarded$8,677,000 for 105 separate research projects.During 1975, 11 new prbjects were begun:Withtotal awards of $1,315,000. Significant projectsinclude an operations research study at theHouston AcademV ofMediCine-Texas Medical Center Library and a project at theUniverSity of Minnesota to explore and adaptthe minicomputer to medical librar opera-tions.TrainingCollecting,and disseminating informationand documentsrequiresHighlyqualified;personnel.

One trainingproject,at _Stanford University, supported'_interdisciplinary graduate education in in for-ination,systems research.

The Library' does try to assist on atechnical consultation basis. Although it doesnot provide foreign felloWships or: have aformal training program, it is responsive to - requests for the specialized training of phsi-cians and information specialists who havebeen designated to direct a national in fcirma-;ion activity in their own Country.Two.specificarrangementshavebeen developed with Egypt. and Iran. In' October1974 the 'Assistant Secretary for Health, HEW.'and the Minister of Health of 'Egypt 'held aU.S.-Egyptian Joint Working Group meetingon Medical Cooperation. As a direct result ofthis meeting, the. Chairman of the Board ofRegents and the Library's Assistant Directorfor International Programs met with Egyptianofficials to -discuss potential collaboration inbiomedical information. In July 1975 thesecond meeting of the. full Joint Working.Group met in, Washington, D.C., at whichtime the Assistant Secretary, HEW; and theMinister of Health of Egypt agreed that bothparties recognize that biomedical informationis -anecessary component of biomedical-research, education, and the delivery' of healthservices. It was also agreed, to explore cooper- ativearrangements whichwillresultin improvedbiomedicalcommunicationsbetweenand withinbothcountries.In particular, experiences will be shared whichrelateto. the development of a nationalbiomedicalinformationresource and anoperational national medical library system. At the request of the Minister of Science andHigher Education . ofIran,theAssistant Director for International Programs served as a consultant to Iran to assist in, the planningof, a national medical library and also indetermining What bilateral cooperative rela-tionships could be developed between theImperial Medical Center of Iran and the U.S.National Library of Medicine.

Its energies arefocuged on assisting Ivnthe. undergraduateeducation of health professionals and, morerecently, extending its services to continuingeducation in partnership with the Library'sLister Hill National Center for BiomedicalCommunications. The Audiovisual Centerhad ifs '-feginning early in World War II whena program of malaria control in war areas wasestablished in Atlanta, Georgia. This programprovided training for scientists and techni-cians needed for a massive malaria eradicationeffort. inthe southeastern United.

By 1949, the scope oft,audiovisual production led to the creation of adivision to provide audiovisual materials for 74 73 'r all 'agencies of the Public Health Service.When CDC -new multi-building cc iplex near Emory University in1960, the Production Division was renamedthe Medical Audiovisual Branch and housedin a, modern facility designed and equippedfor a wide variety of audiovisual development'and distribution activities.Three years later, the branch v;as renamed\\the Public Health Sei vice, Audiovisual FacilityWith responsibility.-to.\"serve as the focal pointfOr the 'production, utilization, and distribu-tion of all audiovisual forms in support of themission of the Public Health Service andalliedgovernmentalorganizations.

Underlying recenteducationalrationaleisthe concept _that-------\"learning is a Jcicess-tharcan- be-treated in ca manner,, by predesigning specificlearning' experiemes for the acquisition ofspecific competencies. Inherent in this conceptis the conviction that it should be geared to the'attainment of performance capabilities by thelearner; rather than the tradition4lof content by the teacher. ,There is also agrowing emphasis on quality control andvalidatedprogtamswithinsistencethat instructional -programs. be. tested and revisedUntil they can be shown to work in repeatedapplications.The incorporation Of the;t; principles intolearning programs which make full use.of thecommunication capabilities of modern media. systems can promotesignificant changes inthe training of health professionals. Some ofthe major characteristics and goals of this newapproach. are:Health science Careers will be consideredunique, arid the need for !'customized\"learning progranis to make instructionmore suitable for indiVidual learningstyles will 'be recognized.Leatning centers will provide the spaces,media, materials, and other resourcesrequired -,to implement individualizedprogramsStudents will have flexibility inscheduling begin healtienCeS schoolAccurate descriptions of criterion com-.petencies will enable the student to --check on his- progress and measure hisprofessiOnal growth.

The cost oflarge\\ host computers, needed by many current \\ CALprogramofferings,canbeasignificant deterrent. Computer-based educational mate:rials are writtenin many languages anddialects. There is a need for language stand-ardization.The needs of practicing health professionalsfor postgraduate education are great. Preserva-tion- of professional competence is -one goal.To address thiS goal, the Computer Technol-ogy Branch of the Lister Hill Center is planningcollaborativeprojectswiththe American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons,the American Academt. of Emergency RoomPhysicians, and the Department of Pediatricsof the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital ofNew York City. The objective underlying allof the current activities in CAI is to facilitatethe ease of production and use and evaluation o;ae nsO of 'computer-based learning materials andthereby maks the wider of computerlbasededucational programs an attractive option:Computer Technflogy Researchand DevelopmentA current activity with great promise is thedevelopment within the National Library- ofMedicine of a. training laboratory designed toconsolidate computer-based medical educa-tional resources in a single area toprovide:Centralized review of course matetitl.,.,'and comparison of modalities:'Development of per review techniques;Evaluation of various techniques forproducing CAI materials:A learning ofprograms byareaphysicians andstudents; state-of-the-art-equipment area;A and develop-mentusingminicomputersand microprocessors in..upport of var-iouslibraryandeducationalfunctions.Three equipment items which will be placedin the training laboratory require furthercomment.

Thedesktop equipment item known as a \"micro-processor laboratory\" will be oriented towardsresearch in. tailored editing and file mainte-nance design, .in code conversion, and in datacommunications. An interactive,terminal willbe installed to permit experiments involvingmultiple users. Postgraduate lifetime representsinus aggregate averylarge educational responsibility:There exists a vast\u00b0-array of educational opportunities havingvaried sponsorship and effectiveness. Despiteall of these, there also,exists a disturbing sense.that current efforts'in continuing postgradu-,ate education are relatively ineffectual, ineffi-ci2nk, or of ,less than desirable 'quality orapplicability. Is there a place where the ListerHill Center can make a meaningful contribiption? In what type of laboratory os. clinicalsetting should experiments in postgraduateeducation be conducted? What experimentalprotocols are apprdpriate? Who should design Speech therapy session on file New Hampshire VerinontMedical Interactive Television NetWork (INTERACT).oithe experiments? The answers to these ques-tions are being sought 'and should give theLister Hill Center 'ptiorities to ,be used inallocating its resources.Yourplanningactivitiesweredirectly relatedtotheCenter's concernforthe development postgraduate educationalmaterials: 1.The Associationfor Hospital Medica!Education was supported in a national surveyof community hospitals and hospital consor-tia to determine the nature of the resourcesavailable for postgraduate educational pro-grams.

Employees are encouragedto bring their concerns to the elected repre-sentatives who form'. the Committee.At present, the Committee is reviewing the EEOprogram's effectiveness in each of the programareas, and the involvement of minority staff inprofessional meetings.In the area of promotions, with 28 percentof the workforce minority employees, minori-ty promotions have gone from 27 percent ofthe total promotions in 1970 to a high of 60percent__ in 1973, a positive influence of the197r conferente: In 'FY_.- 1975 a drop to 42percent occurred.

Here, a leveling off is alsoexpected.Progress has been made in minority hiringdue in part to an increase in EEO awareness,among Library supervisors and staff. Recenthiringsof ilE10 significanceinclude two librarians, two adminiStrative officers, oneengineer (all minority members), two femalecomputer operators, and a male secretary.Several of these positions have been. in thehigher grades.Some positions were created as a result ofjob engineering and restructuring whichprovided greater responsibility and opportu-nity for minbrity employees. Among these/nwere an administrative trainee position estab-lished in 1972 in the Office of Administra-tion, and an in-house training program for five library technicians interested in qualify-ing as librarians. In addition, attempts are being made to attract more minority librariansinto the highly competitive Library AssociateTraining Program.The Library participates in the variousHEW Upward Mobility Programs. Theseinclude: Project Stridea program combin-ing college and Upward-Mobility Collegeacollege degree and precollege preparatoryprogram on the campus of the NationalInstitutes of Health. The Library has threestudents enrolled in Project Stride, one in Project Access, and 23 in the Upward MobilityCollege. Four Library employees have receivedcollege degrees through the Upward MobilityCollege.An annual EEO awards ceremony was-instituted in 1972 to recognize employees whohave demonstrated outstanding accomplish-ments in fostering equal employment oppor-tunity objectives. During this ceremony theDirector. presents highlights of the Library'sEEO program and announces his support ofrecommendations hefeelswillassistthe Library to reach its EEO objectives.
