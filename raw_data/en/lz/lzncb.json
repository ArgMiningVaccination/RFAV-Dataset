Board of Chiropractic Examiners is closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation, coordinating with the state and local governments, and working with our stakeholders to protect the health of Californians. We appreciate your patience as we work on implementing new technologies to work remotely and adhere to social distancing guidelines. We apologize in advance for any delays in reaching our staff or potential delays in our processing times. The Board understands the ability to care for your patients is a priority. Due to the numerous inquiries we've received by our licensees, we are providing the following information in response to the most Frequently Asked Questions. The best general guidance will continue to come from the [California Department of Public Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx), the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), and the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). Frequently Asked Questions 1. Should My Practice Remain Open? The Board does not have authority to close businesses or practices solely as a result of COVID-19. We strongly encourage you to assess whether your practice is an essential job function as outlined by the Governor and follow the guidelines from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html). Check with your local county health department to determine what activities are also considered essential and non-essential. 2. My Exam Was Canceled. What Does that Mean? Board of Chiropractic Examiners will be working to ensure that expedited exam processing will occur when they return and will be looking at ways to mitigate delays. PSI is actively working to reschedule exams and has an online tool that applicants can use to reschedule an exam. The Board of Chiropractic Examiners reminds all licensees to be particularly mindful and respectful that this is a time of high anxiety for all Californians. We encourage any other inquiries to be sent through email to [chiro.info@dca.ca.gov](mailto:chiro.info@dca.ca.gov) as the response time may be faster. "}
