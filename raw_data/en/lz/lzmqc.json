PROPANE PRODUCES 43% fewer greenhouse gas emissions THAN GRID-GENERATED ELECTRICITY, BASED ON NATIONAL AVERAGES. A Clean Energy Solution for Tomorrow - Available Today Propane is a low-carbon fuel alternative, producing far fewer emissions than the equivalent amount of electricity generated from the U.S. grid. Plus, it won't contaminate soil or groundwater because it's non-toxic and non-poisonous. And propane's environmentally friendly benefits don't end there \u2014 major advances are being made today for more renewable propane in the future, sourced from used cooking oil and other waste products, for a carbon-neutral fuel that adds no new carbon to the atmosphere when burned. Lower Emissions that Fuel Your Bottom Line Whether used to heat water for your family, power a farm, or run a fleet of mowers, propane produces significantly fewer emissions than diesel, gasoline, or even electricity. In fact, using propane produces 43% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than using an equivalent amount of electricity generated from the grid. That's good for the environment, but because propane is so efficient and is employed directly at the point of use, its reduced emissions are also good for your bottom line \u2014 propane autogas, for example, reduces more emissions per dollar spent than any other fuel. A Diverse Energy Mix Is a Reliable Energy Mix No single energy source can solve every environmental challenge. Propane can complement solar and wind systems to reduce emissions while providing reliability \u2014 especially during challenging weather conditions. Low-emissions propane is a crucial part of meeting the challenge of creating a more environmentally friendly future, along with renewables and other clean sources of energy. With its power, reliability and versatility, propane is an essential part of a diverse mix enabling cleaner fuels to be used in industries ranging from landscaping to home construction. And with important innovations on the horizon, propane will serve the needs of future generations with even more sustainable solutions.
