Nutritional deficiencies can impedewound healing, and several nutritional factors required for wound repair may improve healing time and wound outcome. Vitamin A is requiredfor epithelial and bone formation, cellular differentiation, and immune function. Vitamin C is necessary for collagen formation, properimmune function, and as a tissue antioxidant. Vitamin E is the major lipid-soluble antioxidant in the skin; however, the effect of vitamin E onsurgical wounds is inconclusive.

Adequate dietary protein is absolutelyessential for proper wound healing, and tissue levels of the amino acids arginine and glutamine may influence wound repair andimmune function. The botanical medicines Centella asiatica and Aloe vera have been used for decades, both topically and internally, toenhance wound repair, and scientific studies are now beginning to validate efficacy and explore mechanisms of action for thesebotanicals. To promote wound healing in the shortest time possible, with minimal pain, discomfort, and scarring to the patient, it isimportant to explore nutritional and botanical influences on wound outcome. (Altern Med Rev 2003;8(4):359-377)Nutritional Support for Wound Healing Douglas MacKay, ND, and Alan L. Miller, ND Introduction Wound healing involves a complex series of interactions between different cell types, cytokine mediators, and the extracellular matrix. The phases of normal wound healing include he-mostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remod- eling. Each phase of wound healing is distinct, although the wound healing process is continu-ous, with each phase overlapping the next. Be- cause successful wound healing requires adequate blood and nutrients to be supplied to the site ofdamage, the overall health and nutritional status of the patient influences the outcome of the dam- aged tissue. Some wound care experts advocate aholistic approach for wound patients that consid- ers coexisting physical and psychological factors, including nutritional status and disease states suchas diabetes, cancer, and arthritis. Keast and Orsted 1 wittily state, \"Best practice requires the assess-ment of the whole patient, not just the hole in thepatient. All possible contributing factors must be explored.\" Wound repair must occur in a physiologic environment conducive to tissue repair and regen- eration. However, several clinically significant factors are known to impede wound healing, in-cluding hypoxia, infection, tumors, metabolic dis- orders such as diabetes mellitus, the presence of debris and necrotic tissue, certain medications, and Douglas J.

In addition, increased metabolic demands are made by the inflammation and cellular activity in the healing wound, which may require increasedprotein or amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. 2 The objective in wound management is to heal the wound in the shortest time possible,with minimal pain, discomfort, and scarring to the patient. At the site of wound closure a flexible and fine scar with high tensile strength is desired.Understanding the healing process and nutritional influences on wound outcome is critical to suc- cessful management of wound patients. Research-ers who have explored the complex dynamics of tissue repair have identified several nutritional cofactors involved in tissue regeneration, includ-ing vitamins A, C, and E, zinc, arginine, glutamine, and glucosamine. Botanical extracts from Aloe vera, Centella asiatica, and the enzyme brome- lain from pineapple have also been shown to im- prove healing time and wound outcome. Eclectic therapies, including topical application of honey,sugar, sugar paste, or Calendula succus to open wounds, and comfrey poultices and hydrotherapy to closed wounds are still in use today. Althoughanecdotal reports support the efficacy of these eclectic therapies, scientific evidence is lacking. The Four Phases of Wound Healing Tissue injury initiates a response that first clears the wound of devitalized tissue and foreign material, setting the stage for subsequent tissuehealing and regeneration. The initial vascular re- sponse involves a brief and transient period of vasoconstriction and hemostasis. A 5-10 minute period of intense vasoconstriction is followed by active vasodilation accompanied by an increase in capillary permeability. Platelets aggregatedwithin a fibrin clot secrete a variety of growth fac- tors and cytokines that set the stage for an orderly series of events leading to tissue repair. The second phase of wound healing, the inflammatory phase, presents itself as erythema, swelling, and warmth, and is often associated withpain. The inflammatory response increases vascular permeability, resulting in migration of neutrophils and monocytes into the surroundingtissue. The neutrophils engulf debris and microorganisms, providing the first line of defense against infection. Neutrophil migration ceases after the first few days post-injury if the wound isnot contaminated. If this acute inflammatory phase persists, due to wound hypoxia, infection, nutritional deficiencies, medication use, or otherfactors related to the patient's immune response, it can interfere with the late inflammatory phase. 3 In the late inflammatory phase, monocytes converted in the tissue to macrophages, which di- gest and kill bacterial pathogens, scavenge tissue debris and destroy remaining neutrophils. Mac-rophages begin the transition from wound inflam- mation to wound repair by secreting a variety of chemotactic and growth factors that stimulate cellmigration, proliferation, and formation of the tis- sue matrix. The subsequent proliferative phase is dominated by the formation of granulation tissue and epithelialization. Its duration is dependent on the size of the wound. Chemotactic and growthfactors released from platelets and macrophages stimulate the migration and activation of wound fibroblasts that produce a variety of substancesessential to wound repair, including glycosami- noglycans 4-sulfate, dermatan These form an amorphous, gel-like connective tissue matrix necessary for cell migra- tion. New capillary growth must accompany the advancing fibroblasts into the wound to pro- vide metabolic needs. Collagen synthesis andcross-linkage is responsible for vascular integrity and strength of new capillary beds. Improper cross-linkage of collagen fibers has been respon-sible for nonspecific post-operative bleeding in patients with normal coagulation parameters. 4 Early in the proliferation phase fibroblast activity is limited to cellular replication and migration. Around the third day after wounding the growing mass of fibroblast cells begin to synthesize andsecrete measurable amounts of collagen. Collagen levels rise continually for approximately three weeks. The amount of collagen secreted during this period determines the tensile strength of the wound.Alternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 4 2003 Page 361 Review Wound Healing The final phase of wound healing is wound remodeling, including a reorganization of new collagen fibers, forming a more organized lat-tice structure that progressively continues to in- crease wound tensile strength. The remodeling process continues up to two years, achieving 40-70 percent of the strength of undamaged tissue at four weeks. 2Figure 1 summarizes the phases of wound healing and nutrients that impact the various phases.Figure 1. Nutrient Impacts on the Phases of Wound Healing Wounding Calendula succus - topical antimicrobial Hemostasis Drugs, herbs, vitamins, amino acids, or minerals that effect blood-clotting mechanisms should be avoided prior to surgery. Inflammatory Phase Vitamin A - enhances early inflammatory phase Bromelain and adequate protein intake - prevent prolonging inflammatory phase Vitamin C - enhances neutrophil migration and lymphocyte transformation Proliferative Phase Vitamin C - necessary for collagen synthesis Centella asiatica - promotes type-1 collagen synthesis Glucosamine - enhances hyaluronic acid production Vitamin A - promotes epithelial cell differentiation Zinc - required for DNA synthesis, cell division, and protein synthesis Calendula succus and Aloe vera - support formation of granulation tissue Remodeling Protein deficiency - inhibits wound remodelingPage 362 Alternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 4 2003 Wound Healing Review Vitamins and Minerals Essential to Wound Healing Vitamin A Vitamin A is required for epithelial and bone tissue development, cellular differentiation, and immune system function. Substantial evidence supports the use of vitamin A as a perioperativenutritional supplement. 5 In addition to facilitating normal physiological wound repair, Ehrlich and Hunt have shown vitamin A reverses the cortico-steroid-induced inhibition of cutaneous and fas- cial wound healing. 6-8 A has also corrected non-steroid induced, post-operative immune de-pression 9 and improved survival in surgically-in- duced abdominal sepsis.10 Levenson et al suggest vitamin A benefits the wound by enhancing theearly inflammatory phase, including increasing the number of monocytes and macrophages at the wound site, modulating collagenase activity, sup- porting epithelial cell differentiation, and improv- ing localization and stimulation of the immune response. 10,11 Animal studies show vitamin A may in- crease both collagen cross-linkage and wound- breaking strength. Greenwald et al inflicted sur-gical flexor profundus damage and immediate re- pair on adult chickens. They found chickens that ate a diet supplemented with vitamin A (150,000IU/kg chicken chow) demonstrated wound-break- ing strength more than double that of controls fed standard chicken chow. 12 In addition, rats with dorsal skin incisions and concurrent comminuted femoral fractures exhibited delayed cutaneous healing. Supplemental vitamin A enhanced woundhealing in these animals, demonstrated by in- creased breaking strength of the dorsal skin inci- sions in rats fed supplemental vitamin A comparedto the non-supplemented group. The authors be- lieve the improved wound healing is a result of an increased rate of collagen cross-linkage. 13 Levenson and Demetrio recommend vi- tamin A supplementation of 25,000 IU daily be- fore and after elective surgery.14 Research supports perioperative vitamin A supplementation in pa- tients known to be immune depleted or steroid treated. Surgical patients with sepsis and thosewith fractures, tendon damage, or vitamin A defi- ciency may also benefit from perioperative vita- min A supplementation. Additional research is necessary to establish the effectiveness of univer-sal perioperative vitamin A supplementation in healthy individuals. Concern among some practitioners re- garding the potential toxicity of higher doses of vitamin A has led to uneasiness about using it perioperatively. The vast majority of toxicity caseshave occurred at daily vitamin A dosages of 50,000-100,000 IU in adults over a period of weeks to years. 15 Short-term supplementation of 25,000 IU daily appears to be safe for most non- pregnant adults. Caution must be exercised in supplementing vitamin A in patients for whom theanti-inflammatory effect of steroids is essential, such as in rheumatoid arthritis or organ transplants, as well as in pregnant women and women of child-bearing age. 5 Vitamin C Ascorbic acid is an essential cofactor for the synthesis of collagen, proteoglycans, and other organic components of the intracellular matrix of tissues such as bones, skin, capillary walls, andother connective tissues. Ascorbic acid deficiency causes abnormal collagen fibers and alterations of the intracellular matrix that manifests as cuta-neous lesions, poor adhesion of endothelium cells, and decreased tensile strength of fibrous tissue. 16 Clinical manifestations of ascorbic acid deficiency include bleeding gums, poor immunity, easy bruis- ing and bleeding, and slow healing of wounds and fractures.17 Ascorbic acid is necessary for the hy- droxylation of proline and lysine residues in procollagen, which is necessary for its release and subsequent conversion to collagen. Hydroxypro-line also stabilizes the collagen triple-helix struc- ture. 18 In addition to collagen production, ascor- bic acid enhances neutrophil function,19 increases angiogenesis,20 and functions as a powerful anti- oxidant.21 Although ascorbic acid is required for reparation of damaged tissue, researchers have demonstrated the benefit of vitamin C only in vi- tamin C-deficient individuals using low doses ofAlternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 4 2003 Page 363 Review Wound Healing ascorbic acid.22 In a study by Hodges et al, four subjects (ages 33-44) were depleted of vitamin C for 99 days to induce scurvy. On day 100, a 5-cm incision was made in the left thigh of each subjectand they began the oral administration of 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg ascorbic acid daily. Healing was mea- sured by histological and electron microscopetechnique. It was shown that 4 mg daily of vita- min C was just as effective as 32 mg daily for wound healing in these vitamin C-deficient sub-jects. 22 The efficacy of using vitamin C to improve wound healing in non-deficient individuals re- mains uncertain. It should be noted, however, thateven the highest dose in this study (32 mg) is be- low the RDA for vitamin C. Higher doses and larger differences between doses might haveyielded more significant differences. Humans lack the ability to store vitamin C, and certain populations are more likely to bedeficient in ascorbic acid, including the elderly, alcoholics, drug abusers, and under-nourished in- dividuals. 23 Subclinical vitamin C deficiency is being recognized increasingly in the general popu- lation. Published cases show that restricted eating patterns, prolonged hospitalization, severe ill-nesses, and poor dietary intake in both children and adults cause deficiency with significant clini- cal consequences. 4,24-26 In one study 12 patients with post-surgical diffuse hemorrhage, each ex- hibiting normal coagulation parameters, were found to have low plasma ascorbic acid levels.Each patient received 250-1,000 mg oral vitamin C daily. Within 24 hours of vitamin C administra- tion there was no further evidence of bleeding orneed for subsequent blood transfusions in any pa- tient. The authors concluded vitamin C deficiency should be included in the differential diagnosis fornonspecific bleeding in surgical patients. 4 In mammals, ascorbic acid is necessary for a normal response to physiological stressors,with the need for ascorbic acid increasing during times of injury or stress. 27 Studies have shown the physiological stress of intense exercise generatesexcess reactive oxygen species (ROS), increasing the demand on the antioxidant defense system. 28- 30 A similar elevation of ROS has been noted within wounds; therefore, substances that increase tissue antioxidants are thought to benefit healing.31-33Events leading to wounds, including trauma and surgery, are perceived as physiological stressors that have also been correlated with a decrease in plasma ascorbic acid.34,35 Thus, the acute stress experienced by trauma or surgery patients may unmask marginal vitamin C deficiencies, leading to deficiency symptoms. Cutaneous healing wounds have been found to have lower ascorbic acid content than intact tissue. Levels of vitamin C were comparedto normal skin in two-, four-, seven-, and 14-day- old wounds in animals. Vitamin C levels decreased approximately 60 percent post-wound and had notexhibited full recovery by day 14. 36 In addition, low levels of antioxidants, including ascorbic acid, accompanied by elevated levels of markers of freeradical damage have been detected in elderly rat cutaneous wounds exhibiting delayed healing. Eighteen-month-old wounded male rats were com-pared to 3-4 month-old rats pre-wound and seven days post-wound. Normal skin of aged and young rats showed no difference in ascorbic acid con-tent; however, a 59-percent decrease in ascorbic acid content was observed in wound tissues of aged animals compared to its content in youngadult wounds. 37 Rasik and Shukla propose the de- lay in wound healing of older rats is at least par- tially a result of increased free radical damage.37 The programmed sequences of the cellu- lar and molecular processes occurring during wound repair are also dependent on immune func-tion. Infection resulting from impaired immunity is one of the most commonly encountered and clinically significant impediments to wound heal-ing. 3 In addition, cellular immunity and dysregulation of cytokines can impair wound heal- ing.38 Ascorbic acid has been shown to improve immune function in humans.39-42 Human volun- teers who ingested 2-3 exhibited motil-ity to chemotactic of lym- phocyte 43 Neutrophil motility and lymphocyte transformation were also stimulatedby 1 g intravenous ascorbic acid in six healthy volunteers. Alterations in these activities were re- lated to serum ascorbic acid levels.Page 364 Alternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 4 2003 Wound Healing Review The combined effect of ascorbic acid on collagen synthesis, antioxidant status, and immunomodulation make it an appropriate supple- ment for wound repair protocols. Research pro-vides evidence for the use of low doses of vitamin C in vitamin C-deficient individuals, but many practitioners believe larger doses of ascorbic acidin non-deficient individuals are indicated for op- timal wound repair. Levenson and Demetriou re- commend supplementing 1-2 g ascorbic acid dailyfrom wound onset until healing is complete. 14 Such doses may be justified due to the lack of adverse effects at these levels44 combined with the poten- tial for deficiency in certain individuals. In addi- tion, the transient increase in metabolic require- ments for vitamin C resulting from the physiologicstress of trauma or surgery and the metabolic re- quirement of vitamin C for collagen synthesis are indications for higher doses of vitamin C in non-deficient individuals. Zinc Approximately 300 enzymes require zinc for their activities. Zinc is an essential trace min- eral for DNA synthesis, cell division, and protein synthesis,45 all necessary processes for tissue re- generation and repair. Zinc deficiency has been associated with poor wound healing and decreased breaking strength of animal wounds,46 which can result from decreased protein and collagen syn- thesis during healing found in zinc-deficient ani- mals.47 Senapati and Thompson found zinc levels were 50-percent higher in muscle and skin from abdominal wounds of rats during wound healing, but mild deficiency reduced this accumulation.48 Zinc demands are thought to be the high- est from time of wounding throughout the early inflammatory phase. Sequential changes in zincconcentrations were studied in the incisional wound model in the rat. Zinc levels increased from wounding and peaked on the fifth day - at a timeof high inflammation, granulation tissue forma- tion, and epidermal cell proliferation. 49 Zinc con- centrations returned to normal by the seventh day,when inflammation had regressed. It has been sug- gested that increased local demand for zinc result- ing from surgery and wounding exposes otherwisemarginal zinc deficiencies in humans. 48Perioperative zinc supplementation is re- commended for zinc-depleted patients.23 Data is lacking to show zinc supplementation improves healing in non-deficient individuals; however, zincdeficiency in humans is widespread, and injured and stressed individuals are more prone to devel- oping deficiencies. Ehrlich et al suggest zinc islost in significant amounts after surgery because of fistulas, stress, and diarrhea. 50 Zinc deficien- cies have also been identified in individuals withdeep partial- or full-thickness burns and chronic venous leg ulceration. 51,52 Further research is needed on the efficacy of zinc supplements for wound healing. Justifica- tion for perioperative zinc supplementation in- cludes the absence of adverse effects at moderatedoses (15-30 mg daily) and evidence that zinc deficiency impairs wound healing. Zinc supple- mentation of 15-30 mg daily is recommendedperioperatively to prevent unmasking of marginal deficiencies. Higher levels of zinc supplementa- tion may be necessary in patients with malnutri-tion, malabsorption, chronic diarrhea, or other risk factors of zinc deficiency. Vitamin E Vitamin E is popular among consumers for skin care and to prevent scar formation. It func- tions as the major lipophilic antioxidant, prevent-ing peroxidation of and resulting in more stable cell membranes. The antioxidant-membrane stabilizing effect of vitamin E also includes stabi-lization of the lysomal membrane, a function shared by glucocorticoids. 53 Systemic vitamin E and glucocorticoids inhibit the inflammatory re-sponse and collagen synthesis, thereby possibly impeding the healing process. The effect of vita- min E on wound healing is complex; it may havealternate effects in different types of wounds and in the presence of other nutrients, as well as dif- ferent functions for water soluble versus lipidsoluble preparations of vitamin E. Animal studies of vitamin E supplemen- tation on surgical wounds show conflicting results.Greenwald et al showed flexor tendon repair in chickens treated with vitamin E had breaking strength less than half that of controls measuredAlternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 4 2003 Page 365 Review Wound Healing after days 7 and 45 from surgical repair.12 Another animal study showed impaired collagen synthesis in rats treated with vitamin E after wounding.54 The researchers cite the glucocorticoid-like effect of vitamin E as the cause of the negative results. However, these effects are mitigated by vitamin A, as vitamin A is a lysomal destabilizer that re-verses several of the deleterious effects of gluco- corticoids. 8 Paradoxical results found by Galeano et al showed a hydrophilic vitamin E preparation positively impacted delayed wound healing in dia- betic mice. Increased breaking strength and col-lagen content of the wound was found in treated animals. These authors speculate inhibition of lipid peroxidation accounted for the positive results. 55 In addition, prophylactic administration of vita- min E has been shown to increase breaking strength and normalize healing of wounds exposedto preoperative irradiation 56 and to decrease the development of intraperitoneal adhesions in ani- mals.57 Since the discovery of vitamin E as the major lipid-soluble antioxidant in skin, it has been used topically for a wide variety of skin lesions.Anecdotal reports claim topical vitamin E is valu- able for speeding wound healing and improving cosmetic outcome of burns and other wounds, in-cluding surgical scars. Such claims are disputed by two human clinical trials. In a double-blind study of 15 patients with surgically-inducedwounds, emollient lotion and emollient lotion mixed with vitamin E were applied to healing wounds. The wounds were randomly divided into two parts and the different topical applications were applied to the same half of each wound twice daily. Physicians and patients independently evalu-ated the scars for cosmetic appearance on weeks 1, 4, and 12. In 90 percent of cases, topical vita- min E either had no effect, or actually worsenedthe cosmetic appearance of scars. 58 In addition, 33 percent of the patients studied developed con- tact dermatitis to topical vitamin E. A response tothis study, published in Dermatologic Surgery , pointed out that d-alpha tocopherol is an extremely unstable compound, rendering details of its source,formulation, storage condition, and stability overtime critical to interpretation of this study. It was also noted that breakdown products and contami- nants could account for the inflammatory response encountered. 59 In a second, larger blinded study, the effects of topical steroids, vitamin E, or the base cream carrier for these substances on scar outcome of 159 post-operative patients wereevaluated. Both topical steroids and topical vita- min E failed to impact scar thickness, range of motion, or ultimate cosmetic appearance. 60 The available data on vitamin E and wound healing could lead to several possible con- clusions: (1) systemic vitamin E may have a nega-tive impact on surgical wounds due to its lysoso- mal-stabilizing properties; (2) vitamin A may miti- gate these negative effects; and (3) hydrophilic andhydrophobic preparations of vitamin E may have different actions related to wounds. The benefit of topical vitamin E on surgical wound healingand scar formation remains inconclusive and, al- though anecdotal reports support topical use of vitamin E for scar therapy, research shows it mayhave a negative effect on scarring and wound out- come. Other Dietary Supplements and Wound Healing Bromelain Bromelain is a general name given to a family of proteolytic enzymes derived from Ananas comosus , the pineapple plant. Through- out the 1960s and 1970s a series of studies found the effects of orally administered bromelain in- clude the reduction of edema, bruising, pain, andhealing time following trauma and surgical pro- cedures. 61-64 More recently, researchers from the Czech Republic found that patients with long bonefractures administered a proteolytic enzyme com- bination containing 90 mg bromelain per tablet had less post-operative swelling compared to pa-tients given placebo. 65 Fractures were treated by surgically inserting rods through the long axis of the fractured bone (intramedullary fixation) or byconstructing an external framework of pins and rods going through the skin and muscle to con- nect to the fractured bone (external fixators). Thetreatment group was given three 90-mg tabletsPage 366 Alternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 4 2003 Wound Healing Review three times daily for three days after surgery and, subsequently, two tablets three times daily for two weeks. On the fourteenth post-operative day the limb volume of the treatment group was reducedby 17 percent compared with nine percent in the control group. The total number of analgesics con- sumed by the treatment group was also signifi-cantly reduced in comparison to the control group. 65 Studies by Tassman et al show bromelain reduced swelling, bruising, pain, and healing time in patients following dental surgeries.63,66 In a double-blind study of dental surgery patients, bro-melain was found to decrease swelling to 3.8 days, compared with seven days in patients given pla- cebo. In addition, duration of pain was reduced tofive days in the treatment group, compared to eight days in the placebo group. 63 In an uncontrolled trial, bromelain was reported to positively influence swelling, pain at rest and during movement, and tenderness in pa- tients with blunt injuries to the musculoskeletalsystem. 67 Although bromelain has been shown to reduce post-operative and trauma-related pain, this is probably related to its anti-inflammatory actionrather than a direct analgesic effect. 68 Aside from its documented anti-inflam- matory activity, bromelain is of interest to surgeonsbecause of its ability to increase resorption rate of hematomas. Bromelain's influence on hematoma resorption was demonstrated using artificially in-duced hematomas in humans. Hematomas in the treatment group resolved significantly faster than controls when oral bromelain was given at the timeof hematoma induction and for seven days there- after. 69 Seltzer investigated two different doses of bromelain in patients undergoing rhinoplasty. Fifty-three patients were randomized to receive either one of two doses of bromelain or placebo.In patients receiving placebo, swelling and ecchy- mosis persisted for seven days, compared to two days in both bromelain groups. 70 However, a ran- domized trial of 154 facial plastic surgery patients receiving either 400 mg bromelain daily or pla- cebo for one day before and four days after sur-gery found no statistically significant differences in edema between the two groups. 71Tassman et al noted that, while post-sur- gical oral bromelain administration was effective in reducing pain, swelling, and healing time, a protocol using pre- and post-surgical bromelainis recommended. 63 Studies have shown bromelain prevents aggregation of blood platelets in patients with high platelet aggregation values, which hasled to recommendations by physicians and sur- geons to avoid oral bromelain prior to any surgi- cal procedure. In one human trial, bromelain wasadministered orally to 20 volunteers with a his- tory of heart attack or stroke, or with high platelet aggregation values. Bromelain decreased plateletaggregation in 17 of the subjects and normalized values in eight of the nine subjects who previously had high aggregation values. 72 Contrary to this, other human studies have shown oral bromelain to be free of any significant effects on clotting parameters.73,74 In one study, 47 patients with vari- ous disorders leading to edema and inflammation found no significant effects of oral bromelain (40 mg four times daily for one week) on bleeding,coagulation, and prothrombin time. It is noteworthy that the studies pertain- ing to bromelain and platelet aggregation are over30 years old. The potential benefit of pre- and post- surgical oral bromelain on hematoma resorption, pain, inflammation, and healing time justifies theneed for concise, well-designed clinical trials evaluating different doses of bromelain on clot- ting parameters. Until further data is available re-garding bromelain's action on platelets, oral bro- melain administration should be withheld or used with caution before surgery. Glucosamine Hyaluronic acid is an important part of the extracellular matrix and one of the main gly-cosaminoglycans secreted during tissue repair. Production of hyaluronic acid by fibroblasts dur- ing the proliferative stage of wound healing stimu-lates the migration and mitosis of fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Glucosamine appears to be the rate-limiting substrate for hyaluronic acid synthe-sis. 75 In vitro studies suggest the mechanism of glucosamine on repair processes involves stimu- lation of the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans andAlternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 4 2003 Page 367 Review Wound Healing collagen.76 Animal studies have shown the con- tent of glycosaminoglycans within the site of par- tially ruptured muscles increased maximally fivedays after trauma and decreased thereafter. 77 This suggests the timing of glucosamine supplementa- tion may determine its therapeutic impact onwounds. Clinical trials using glucosamine for perioperative support are lacking. However, theadministration of oral glucosamine both before aswell as the first few days after surgery or trauma might enhance hyaluronic acid production in the wound, promoting swifter healing and possiblyfewer complications related to scarring. Protein and Wound Healing Adequate protein intake is essential for proper wound healing.

Rats fed a diet deficient in protein exhibited de- creased wound integrity and strength versus con-trol animals. 80 In a study of 108 human patients with experimental wounds, individuals with either low serum protein or serum albumin had signifi-cantly weaker wounds than those with normal pro- tein values. 81 Protein calorie malnutrition increases morbidity and mortality in the surgical/trauma patient. Many studies have found hospitalized patients in a state of malnutrition at admission.Thus, it is important to increase protein intake to optimize healing and immune function, and to prevent post-surgical complications in these indi-viduals. 82-84 Protein supplementation of elderly pa- tients with liquid protein formulas significantlyenhanced healing of pressure ulcers. The change in ulcer area was significantly correlated with the amount of protein in the diet. 85 The surgical or trauma patient exists in a state of metabolic stress, with the severity of the stress depending on the severity of the woundedstate. An injured patient requires more protein than a non-injured patient because of the increased metabolic activity of wound healing, acute-phaseprotein production in response to stress, and amino acid mobilization from muscle used for hepatic gluconeogenesis. In a non-injured state, adults require ap- proximately 0.8 g dietary protein/kg body wt/day. Elderly patients have a higher protein requirement(1-1.2 g/kg body wt/ day) due to a decreased abil- ity to synthesize proteins. The surgical/trauma patient can require significantly more protein.Minor surgery may not significantly increase the protein requirement; however, if the patient is al- ready protein malnourished, wound healing willbe adversely affected unless dietary protein intake is increased. Major surgery can increase protein requirements 10 percent, while a patient withmultiple traumas may need 75-percent more pro- tein. Burn wounds cause tremendous metabolicstress and have the greatest impact on protein re- quirements, increasing protein need 75-100 per- cent. 86 Table 1 summarizes nutrients recom- mended for perioperative nutritional support. Amino Acids in Wound Healing It is well accepted that sufficient protein is necessary for wound healing. This appears to be due to the increased overall protein need for tissue regeneration and repair. Researchers haveinvestigated the effects of specific amino acids on the healing process and determined that arginine and glutamine appear to be necessary for properwound healing. Arginine Arginine is a non-essential amino acid that plays a key role in protein and amino acid synthe- sis. It is acquired from the diet and derived en- dogenously from citrulline in a reaction catalyzedby the enzyme arginine synthetase. Adequate tis- sue arginine appears to be essential for efficient wound repair and immune function. 87 Arginine (17 g/day) was given to 30 eld- erly patients (>65 years of age) who sustained an experimental surgical injury. Supplemented pa- tients demonstrated significantly greater hydroxy- proline (a sign of collagen deposition) and pro- tein accumulation at the wound site, compared tonon-supplemented controls. Lymphocyte re- sponse, signifying greater immune activity, was elevated in the supplemented group, as was insu-lin-like growth factor-1, which is a control mol- ecule for wound repair. 88 Other studies have found similar results.89,90 Glutamine Glutamine is used by inflammatory cells within the wound for proliferation and as a source of energy.91,92 Fibroblasts use glutamine for these same purposes, as well as for protein and nucleic acid synthesis. Because optimal functioning of these cells is paramount to the healing process,glutamine is a necessary component of the pro- cess of tissue repair. Glutamine is a non-essential amino acid that can become a \"conditionally es-Alternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 4 2003 Page 369 Review Wound Healing sential\" amino acid in certain circumstances, including tissue injury.93 Glutamine is released from skeletal muscle fol- lowing injury or surgery, which can cause a rela-tive deficiency of glutamine in skeletal muscle and the gut, asintestinal uptake is fre- quently diminished as well. Studies utilizing oral glutamine pre- and post-surgery, and in burnpatients, have shown mixed results. Oral feed- ing of glutamine in sur-gery patients did not af- fect plasma glutamine or nitrogen turnover. Intra-venous an ala- nine-glutamine dipeptideshowed consistently better post-operative results, as seen by significantly decreased length of hos- pital stays (average of four days or less). 92 A sig- nificantly smaller incidence of pneumonia, bacte- remia, and sepsis was noted in patients with trauma given enteral glutamine feedings.94 Whether glutamine supplementation will enhance wound healing in less severely injured individu- als is not known.

Supplementation with this mixture resulted in significantly greater woundcollagen deposition than in 17 controls not supple- mented. 95 Table 2 summarizes nutrients recom- mended or trauma and Aloe vera Centella asiatica and Aloe vera have been used for decades as folk remedies for burns, wounds, and scars. Improved wound healing hasbeen reported from topical or internal application of these two botanical medicines. Continued use of these plants as healing agents has led to scien-tific investigation of their efficacy as wound heal- ing agents. Centella asiatica (gotu kola) has been documented to aid wound healing in several sci- entific studies. 96-99 One of the primary mechanisms of action of Centella appears to be the stimulationof type-1 collagen production. 100 Animal studies have consistently shown topical application of Centella asiatica to a sutured wound significantly increased the breaking strength of the wound.96,99,101,102 Asiaticoside, a saponin extracted from Centella asiatica, is thought to be one of itsTable g/kg body weight daily1,500 mg daily Recommended from wounding until healing is complete.Page 370 Alternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 4 2003 Wound Healing Review active constituents. Shukla et al showed a 0.2-per- cent asiaticoside solution applied topically twice daily for seven days to punch wounds in guinea pigs resulted in 56-percent increase in hydroxypro-line, 57-percent increase in tensile strength, in- creased collagen content, and better epithelializa- tion compared to controls. Using the same punchwound model the researchers demonstrated an oral dose of 1 mg/kg for seven days produced a 28- percent reduction in wound area and a significantincrease of tensile strength and hydroxyproline content of the wound. 102 Topical treatment with Aloe vera has been shown to improve healing in frostbite and electri- cal injury in animals.103,104 In addition, Aloe vera has improved the healing of wounds in both nor-mal and diabetic rats. 105,106 Topical application and oral administration of Aloe vera to rats with heal- ing dermal wounds increased the collagen con-tent of the granulation tissue as well as the degree of cross-linkage. Collagen increased 93 percent with topical treatment and 67 percent with oraltreatment compared to controls. The increase was attributed to increased stimulation by Aloe vera of collagen synthesis or increased proliferation offibroblast synthesis of collagen, or both. 107 In a similar study, the effects of oral and topical Aloe vera on full thickness dermal wounds in rats ex- hibited an increase in glycosaminoglycan compo- nents of the extracellular lev-els. 107 Aloe vera and Centella asiatica have been widely used for a host of curative purposes in-cluding facilitating wound repair. In spite of their wide use as folk remedies the biochemical basis for their action or influence on tissue repair is justbeginning to be understood. Human clinical trials are needed to determine safety and benefits of perioperative oral administration of these botani-cals. Topical application of both Aloe vera and Centella asiatica extracts to healing wounds or surgical scars appears to be safe and facilitatesimproved wound repair.Eclectic Wound Therapies Humans have always been faced with the dilemma of how to treat wounds. Many diverse and interesting approaches to wound management have been applied throughout medical history.Thirty years ago physicians believed pus in a wound was laudable and anxiously awaited its arrival; 108 surgeons today attempt every conceiv- able means to prevent its presence. Although sci- entific validation is absent, some wound-care therapies applied by eclectic physicians are stillconsidered valuable and effective therapies today. Honey and sugar or sugar paste have been used to treat wounds for decades. Both are con-sidered to be antimicrobial and have been associ- ated with scarless healing in some cavity wounds. 109 Hyaluronic acid consists of disaccha- ride chains made from modifications of the monosaccharide glucose. One possible mechanism in scar prevention is that glucose in honey or de-rived from sugar may be converted into hyaluronic acid at the wound surface, forming an extracellu- lar matrix that promotes wound healing. 109 Fetal wounds heal without scar formation and the ex- tracellular matrix of fetal wounds is rich with hy- aluronic acid and lacks excessive collagen.109 The glucose in honey or derived from sugar may fa- cilitate a balance between hyaluronic acid and collagen, similar to that found in fetal wounds. Preparations of fresh juice from Calen- dula officinalis preserved in alcohol, known as Calendula succus, are used topically to promotewound healing. Naturopathic doctors utilize Cal- endula succus to cleanse wounds after minor sur- gical procedures and throughout the healing pro-cess. External Calendula succus is listed in The Complete German Commission E Monographs for promoting wound healing. Topical application isthought to have anti-inflammatory and granulatory action. 110 Knitbone and bruisewort are common names for Symphytum officinalis (comfrey) that give clues to its traditional uses. The active ingre- dient in comfrey is thought to be allantoin, whichis reported to promote cell division and the growth of connective tissue, bone, and cartilage. Com- frey poultices are applied externally on intact skinAlternative Medicine Review Volume 8, Number 4 2003 Page 371 Review Wound Healing for bruises, sprains, and fractures. Medical litera- ture regarding comfrey is limited to its potentialliver toxicity when taken internally. However, many anecdotal reportsclaim comfrey is ex- tremely effective at pro- sprains, tures. External applica- tion to intact skin doesnot appear to have the same toxicity concerns as internal consumption. Table 3 summa- rizes botanicals and other topical treatments forwound healing. Adequate tissue perfusion, blood flow,and oxygen levels are re- quired for wound heal- ing. Tissue perfusion de-livers oxygen and nutri- ents to regenerating tissue. The fibro- blasts and the enzymatic hydroxylation of prolineand lysine residues on the forming collagen chains are dependent, in part, on the availability of oxy- gen. 111 Hydrotherapy utilizes external hot and cold applications of water to manipulate the quantity of blood flow through a given tissue. Adequate blood flow brings oxygen, nutrients, and red andwhite blood cells to target tissues. This basic physi- ological manipulation of blood flow can support the wound healing process. Hydrotherapy is aninexpensive and powerful adjunct to wound care; however, there are some limitations to applying hydrotherapy to open wounds, burns, and in pa-tients with peripheral neuropathies. Discussion Wound healing proceeds quickly and ef- ficiently in a physiologic environment conducive to tissue regeneration and repair. Nutritional sta- tus of patients at the time of trauma or surgeryinfluences the biochemical processes necessary for the phases of normal healing to occur. Undernour- ished or malnourished individuals heal less effi- ciently and are at greater risk for complicationsduring and after surgery. Part of treating the whole patient and not just the \"hole in the patient\" is appreciating the complex interactions and the nu-trients involved in the wound-healing process. The relationship between malnutrition and poor wound healing is well documented, 112-114 while the impact of optimal levels of dietary and supplemental nu- trient intakes for wound healing is relatively un- known. Promotion of good nutrition is recom- mended, particularly in populations at risk for marginal and frank nutritional deficiencies, includ-ing the elderly, 115 severely injured,116 smokers,117,118 patients with maldigestion or poor assimilation,3 and hospitalized patients119 before elective surgery.

Several journal reviews cite a high prevalence of complementary and alterna- tive medicine (CAM) use by surgical patients.120- 126 The authors of these articles caution against the use of CAM therapies because of potential adverse reactions, the most common being poten- tial vitamin, mineral, herb, or amino acid interac-tions with platelet aggregation or anesthetics or other pharmaceuticals given perioperatively. 124-126 The potential benefit of nutrients is seldom dis- cussed. Evidence exists that vitamins A and C, glutamine, glucosamine, cial to wounded or surgical patients; however, many patients will be advised to avoid them. Moreextensive, well-defined, blinded clinical trials to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and drug interactions of these potential beneficial substances are needed. From the current available data it would appear that an adequate protein supply, as well as supplementation of 25,000 IU vitamin A, 1-2 gvitamin zinc, 3-15 g arginine, 3-15 g glutamine, and 1,500 mg glucosamine per day prior to and after surgery would benefit adult pa-tients. Wounded patients could also benefit from these nutrients from wounding until healing is complete. Post-operative topical application ofAloe vera and Centella asiatica extracts may fa- cilitate the creation of a flexible, fine scar with high tensile strength at the wound site. In addi-tion, 750-1,000 mg bromelain post-operatively may reduce edema, bruising, pain, and healing time following trauma and surgical procedures.Several eclectic wound therapies have survived through the centuries and are still in use today. Scientific research is needed to validate safety andefficacy of these eclectic therapies. References 1. Keast D, Orsted H.
