Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 30 Client Eligibility How can I verify a patient's eligibility ? Providers must verify that a patient has Washington Apple Health coverage for the date of service, and that the client's benefit package covers the applicable service. This helps prevent delivering a service the agency will not pay for. To verify eligibility, follow this two -step process: Step 1. Verify the patient's eligibility for Washington Apple Health . For detailed instructions on verifying a patient's eligibility for Washington Apple Health, see the Client Eligibility, Benefit Packages, and Coverage Limits section in the agency's Provider One Billing and Resource Guide . If the patient is eligible for Washington Apple Health, proceed to Step 2 . If the patient is not eligible, see the note box below. Step 2. Verify service coverage under the Washington Apple Health client's benefit package. To determine if the requested service is a covered benefit under the Washington Apple Health client's benefit package, see the agency's Program Benefit Packages and Scope of Services web page . Note: Patients who wish to apply for Washington Apple Health can do so in one of the following ways : 1. By visiting the Washington Healthplanfinder's website at : www.wahealthplanfinder.org 2. By calling the Customer upport 627-9604 3. By mailing the application to : Washington Healthplanfinder PO Box 946 Olympia, WA 98507 In-person application assistance is also available. To get information about in- person application assistance available in their area, people may visit www.wahealthplanfinder.org or call the Customer Support Center. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 31 Are clients e nrolled in an agency -contracted managed care organization (MCO) eligible ? Yes. Many a gency clients are enrolled in one of the a gency's contracted managed care organizations (MCO s). For these clients, managed care enrollment will be displayed on the client benefit inquiry screen in ProviderOne . Clients enrolled in an a gency -contracted MCO must obtain services thr ough their MCO, unless otherwise noted. Note: A client's enrollment can change monthly. Providers who are not contracted with the MCO must receive approva l from both the MCO and the client's primary care provider (PCP) prior to serving a managed care client. Send claims to the client's MCO for payment. Call the client's MCO to discuss payment prior to providing the service. Providers may bill clients only in very limited situations as described in WAC 182- 502-0160 . Effective July 1, 2017, not all Apple Health clients were enrolled in a BHO/FIMC/BHSO On July 1, 2017, some Apple Health clients were not enrolled in a BHO/FIMC/BHSO program. For these clients, substance use disorder ( SUD) services are covered under the fee -for-service (FFS) program. Effective January 1, 2017, some fee -for-service clients who have other primary health insurance were enrolled into managed care On January 1, 2017, the agency enrolled some fee -for-service Apple Health clients who have other primary health insurance into an agency -contracted managed care organization (MCO). This change did not affect all fee- for-service Apple Health clients who have other primary health insurance. The agency continues to cover some clients under the fee -for-service Apple Health program, such as dual -eligible clients whose primary insurance is Medicare. For additional information, see the agency's Managed Care web page , under Providers and Billers. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 32 Effective April 1, 2016, i mportant changes to Apple Health These changes are important to all providers because they may affect who will pay for services. Providers serving any Apple Health client should always check eligibility and confirm plan enroll ment by asking to see the client's Services C ard and/or using the ProviderOne Managed Care Benefit Information Inquiry functionality (HIPAA transaction 270). The response (HIPAA transaction 271) will provide the current managed care organization (MCO) , fee-for-service, and Behavioral Health Organization (BHO) information. See the the agency's Regional Resources web page . New MCO enrollment policy - earlier enrollment Beginning April 1, 2016 , Washington Apple Health (Medicaid) implemented a new managed care enrollment policy placing clients into an agency -contracted MCO the same month they are determined eligible for managed care as a new or renewing client. This policy eliminates a person being placed te mporarily in fee -for-service while they are waiting to be enrolled in an MCO or reconnected with a prior MCO. New clients are those initially applying for benefits or those with changes in their existing eligibility program that consequently make them eligible for Apple Health Managed Care. Renewing clients are those who have been enrolled with an MCO but have had a break in enrollment and have subsequently renewed their eligibility. Clients currently in fee -for-service or currently enrolled in an MCO are not affected by this change. Clients in fee -for-service who have a change in the program they are eligible for may be enrolled into Apple Health Managed Care depending on the program. In those cases, this enrollment policy will apply. How does this pol icy affect providers? Providers must check eligibility and know when a client is enrolled and with which MCO. For help with enrolling, clients can refer to the Washington Healthplanfinder's Get Help Enrolling page. MCOs have retroactive authorization and notification policies in place. The provider must know the MCO's requirements and be com pliant with the MCO's new policies. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 33 Behavioral Health Organization (BHO) The Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) manages the contracts for behavioral health (mental health and substance use disorder (SUD)) services for nine of the Regional Service Areas (RSA) in the state, excluding Clark and Skamania counties in the Southwest Washington (SW WA) Region. BHOs replaced the Regional Support Networks (RSNs). Inpatient m ental health services continue to be provided as described i n the inpatient section of the Mental Health Services Billing Guide . BHOs use the Access to Care Standards (ACS) for mental health conditions and American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria for SU D conditions to determine client's appropriateness for this level of care. Fully Integrated Managed Care (FIMC) For clients who live in a fully integrated managed care (FIMC) region, all physical health services, mental health services, and drug and alcohol treatment are covered and coordinated by the client's agency -contracted managed care organization (MCO). The Behavioral Health Organization (BHO) will not provide behavioral health services in these counties. Clients living in an FIMC region will enr oll with an MCO of their choice that is available in that region. If the client does not choose an MCO, the client will be automatically enrolled into one of the available MCOs, unless the client is A merican Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN). Clients currently enrolled in one of the available MCOs in their region may keep their enrollment when the behavioral health services are added. Effective July 1, 2017, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) clients living in an FIMC region of Washington must choose to enrol l in one of the agency -contracted MCOs available in that region; or they may choose to receive all these services through Apple Health fee -for-service (FFS) .

Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 53 Face -to-face visit requirements for pregnant women The Clinic al Practice Guideline, Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence : 2008 Update demonstrated that efficacious treatments for tobacco users exist an d should become a part of standard caregiving. Two components of counseling are especially effective, and clinicians are expected to use these when counseling pregnant patients making a quit attempt: Practical counseling (problem solving/skills training ) Social support delivered as part of treatment The guideline recommends that a practitioner should follow the \"5 A's\" of treating tobacco dependence, which include: Ask, A dvise, A ssess, Assist, and A rrange follow -up. For patients not ready to make a quit attempt, clinicians should use a brief intervention designed to promote the motivation to quit. Content areas that should be addressed can be captured by the \"5 R's\": Relevance, Risks, R ewards, Roadblocks, and Repetition. Research suggests that the \"5 R's\" enhance future quit attempts. Providers must document the client's pregnancy status and e stimated date of c onfinement in the medical record. Additionally, the provider must establish and document the client's motivation to quit tobacco use and provide an appropriate intervention based on client's readiness to change. If a tobacco user currently is unwilling to make a quit attempt, clinicians should use the motiva tional treatments shown in the g uideline to be effective in increasing future quit atte mpts. For each visit, the provider needs to document the time and interventions used aimed at tobacco cessation. Promotion of the motivation to quit for pregnant women All patients entering a health care setting should have their tobacco use status asses sed routinely. Clinicians should advise all tobacco users to quit and then assess a patient's willingness to make a quit attempt. For patients not ready to make a quit attempt at the time, clinicians should use a brief intervention designed to promote the motivation to quit. Patients unwilling to make a quit attempt during a visit may lack information about the harmful effects of tobacco use and the benefits of quitting, may lack the required financial resources, may have fears or concerns about quitting, or may be demoralized because of previous relapse. Such patients may respond to brief motivational interventions that are based on principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), a directive, patient -centered counseling intervention. There is evidence that MI is effective in increasing future quit attempts; however, it is unclear that MI is successful in boosting abstinence among individuals motivated to quit smoking. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 54 Clinicians employing MI techniques focus on exploring a tobacco us er's feelings, beliefs, ideas, and values regarding tobacco use in an effort to uncover any ambivalence about using tobacco. Once ambivalence is uncovered, the clinician selectively elicits, supports, and strengthens the patient's \"change talk\" (e.g., reas ons, ideas, needs for eliminating tobacco use) and \"commitment language\" (e.g., intentions to take action to change smoking behavior, such as not smoking in the home). MI researchers have found that having patients use their own words to commit to change is more effective than clinician exhortations, lectures, or arguments for quitting, which tend to increase rather than lessen patient resistance to change. The four general pri nciples that underlie MI are: ( 1) express empathy, (2) develop discrepancy, (3) roll with resistance, and (4) support self -efficacy. Specific MI counseling strategies that are based on these principles are listed in Strategy B1 . Because this is a specialized technique, it may be beneficial to have a member of the clinical staff receive training in motivational interviewing. The content areas that should be addressed in a motivational counseling intervention can be captured by the \"5 R's\": relevance, risks, rewards, roadblocks, and repetition ( Strategy B2 ). Research suggests that the \"5 R's\" enhance future quit attempts. Providers must provide client educational materials on the benefits of not using tobacco products and document this in the client's record. Provider t ypes for providing face -to-face smoking cessation counseling for pregnant women Office -based practitioners (physicians, registered nurse practitioners, Physician -Assistants- Certified), Psychologists, Pharmacists , and Licensed Midwives (LM). Benefit l imitations for providing face -to-face smoking cessation counseling for pregnant women A cessation counseling attempt occurs when a qualified physician or other Medicaid- recognized practitioner determines that a beneficiary meets the eligibility requirements and initiates treatment with a cessation counseling attempt. Face -to-face cessation counseling attempts are defined and limited as follows: An attempt is defined as up to four cessation counseling sessions .

Critical care is the direct delivery and constant attention by a provider(s) for a critically ill or critically injured patient. A critical illness or injury acutely impairs one or more vital organ systems such that there is a high probabi lity of imminent or life threatening deterioration in the patient's condition. Critical care involves high complexity decision making to assess, manipulate, and support vital system function(s); to treat single or multiple vital organ system failure; and/or to prevent further life threatening deterioration of the patient's condition. Providing medical care to a critically ill, injured, or postoperative patient qualifies as a critical care service only if both the illness or injury and the treatment being p rovided meet the above requirements. Critical care is usually, but not always, given in a critical care area, such as the coronary care unit, intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, respiratory care unit, or the emergency care facility. Services for a patient who is not critically ill but happens to be in a critical care unit are reported using other appropriate E/M codes.

To report the total duration of time spent by a physician providing critical care services to a critically ill or critically injured client, even if the time spent by the physician on that date is not continuous. For any given period of time spent providing critical care services, the physician must devote his or her full attention to the client and cannot provide services to any other patient during the same period of time. Note: Surgery, stand -by, or lengthy consultation on a stable client does not qualify as critical care.

If the service is provided through store and forward technology, there must be an associated office visit between the client and the referring health care provider. Using telemedicine when it is medically necessary enables the health care practitioner and the client to interact in real -time communication as if they were having a face -to-face session. Telemedicine allows agency clients, particularly those in medically underserved areas of the state, improved access to essential health care services that may not otherwise be available without traveling long distances. The agency does not cover t he following services as telemedicine: Email, audio only telephone, and facsimile transmissions Installation or maintenance of any telecommunication devices or systems Purchase, rental, or repair of telemedicine equipment Who is eligible for tele medicine ? Fee-for-service clients are eligible for medically necessary covered health care services delivered via telemedicine . The referring provider is responsible for determining and documenting that telemedicine is medically necessary. As a condition of payment, the client must be present and participating in the tele medicine visit. Clients under the Family Planning, TAKE CHARGE, First Steps, and School -Based Health Care Services programs are eligible for telemedicine through fee- for-service. The agency will not pay separately f or tele medicine for services covered under a n agency - contracted managed care plan. Clients enrolled in an agency -contracted managed care organization (MCO) are identified as such in ProviderOne. MCO enrollees must have all services arranged and provided by their primary care providers (PCP). Contact the MCO regarding whether or not the plan will authorize tele medicine coverage for services covered under the plan. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 78 When does the agency cover telemedicine? The agency covers telemedicine when it is used to substitute for a n in-person face -to-face, hands -on encounter for only those services specifically listed in this telemedicine section. Clients enrolled in an agency -contracted MCO must contact the MCO regarding whether or not the plan will authorize telemedicine coverage . Originating site (location of client) What is an originating site? An originating site is the physical location of the eligible agency client at the time the professional service is provided by a phys ician or practitioner through tele medicine . Approved originating sites are: Clinics Community mental health/chemical dependency settings Dental offices Federally qualified health center (FQHC) Home or any location determined appropriate by the individual receiving service Hospitals (inpatient and outpatient) Neurodevelopmental centers Physician or other health professional's office Rural health clinics (RHC) Schools Skilled nursing facilities Is the originating site paid for tele medicine ? Yes. The originating site is paid a n originating site facility fee per completed transmission. The agency does not pay the originating site facility fee to the client in any setting. How does the originating site bill the agency for the originating site facility fee? Hospital outpatient : When the originating site is a hospital outpat ient agency, payment for the originating site facility fee will be paid according to the maximum allowable fee schedule. To receive payment for the originating site facility fee, outpatient hospital providers must bill revenue code 0780 on the same line as HCPCS code Q3014. Hospital i npatient , skilled nursing facility, home, or location determined appropriate by the individual receiving service : There is no payment to the originat ing site for the originating site facility fee in these settings . Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 79 Critical access h ospitals : When the originating site is a critical access hospital outpatient agency, payment is separate from the cost -based payment methodology. To receive payment for the originating site facility fee, critical access hospitals must bill revenue code 0789 on the same line as HCPCS code Q3014. FQHCs and RHCs: When the originating site is an FQHC or RHC, bill for the originating site facility fee using HCPCS code Q3014. This is not considered an FQHC or RHC service and is not paid as an encounter. Physicians' or other health professional offices: When the originating site is a physician's office, bill for the originating site facility fee using HCPCS code Q3014. Other s ettings: When the originating site is an approved telemedicine site, bill for the originating site facility fee using HCPCS Q3014. If a provider from the originating site performs a separately identifiable service for the client on the same day as teleme dicine , documentation for both services must be clearly and separately identified in the client's medical record. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 80 Distant site (location of consultant) What is a distant sit e? A distant site is the physical location of the health care professional providing the health care service to an eligible agency client through tele medicine . What services are covered using tele medicine ? The agency reimburses medically necessary covered services through telemedicine when the service is provided by a Washington Apple Health provider and is within their scope of practice. How does the distant site bill the agency for the services delivered through telemedicine ? The payment amount for the professional service provided through tele medicine by the provider at the distant site is equal to the current fee schedule amount for the service provided. Use the appropriate CPT codes with modifier GT or modifier 95 (via interactive audio and video telecommunications system) when s ubmitting claims to the agency for payment. Both of these modifiers are acceptable to indicate synchronized telecommunication. The agency may discontinue the GT modifier at a later date. Effective January 1, 2017, a new point of service ( POS) code 02 has been created for physic ians or practitioner s providing T elehealth services fr om a distant site. The POS 02 code is the location where health services are provided through telecommunication technology. The POS 02 code does not apply to the orig inating site. Modifiers GT (via interactive audio and video telecommunications systems) and GQ (via an asynchronous telecommunications system) are still required when billing for Medicare Telehealth services. If you bill for T elehealth services with POS code 02 but without the GT or GQ modifier, your claim will be denied . Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright Association 81 Anesthesia (WAC 182- 531-0300 ) anesthesia CPT \u00ae code s 00100- 01999 to bill for anesthesia services paid with base and time units. Do not use the surgical procedure code with an anesthesia modifier to bill for the anesthesia procedure. The agency pays for CPT code 01922 for noninvasive imaging or radiation therapy when either of the following applies : The client is 17 years of age or younger . There are client -specific reasons why the procedure cannot be performed without anesthesia services. Documentation must be kept in the client's medical record. The agency pays providers for covered anesthesia services performed by one of the following: Anesthesiologist Certified registe red nurse anesthetist (CRNA) Other provider s who have a contract with the a gency t o provide anesthesia services For each client, th e anesthesia provider must do all of the following : Perform a pre -anesth etic examination and evaluation Prescribe the anesthesia plan Personally participate in the most demanding aspects of the anesthesia plan, including, induction and emergence Ensure that any procedures in the anesthesia plan that he or she does not perform are done by a qualified individual as defined in program operating instructions Monitor the course of anesthesia administration at frequent intervals Remain physically present and a vailable for immediate diagnosis a nd treatment of emergencies Provide indicated postanesthesia care The anesthesia provider may direct no more than four anesthesia services concurrently. The anesthesia provider may not perform any other services while dir ecting these services, other than attending to medical emergencies and other limited services as allowed by Medicare policy. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 82 The anesthesia provider must document in the client's medical record that the medical direction requirements were met. Providers do not need to submit documentation with each claim to substantiate these requirements. Anesthesia time begins when the anesthesia provider starts to physically prepare the client for the induction of anesthesia in the operating room area or its equivalent . When there is a break in continuous anesthesia care, blocks of time may be summed as long as there is continuous monitoring of the client within the blocks of time. An example of this includes, but is not limited to, the time a client spends in an anesth esia induction room or under the care of an operating room nurse during a surgical procedure. Anesthesia time ends when the anesthesia provider or surgeon is no longer in constant attendance (i.e. when the client can be safely placed under postoperative supervision). Do not bill CPT codes 01953 or 01996 with an anesthesia modifier or with the time in the \"units\" field. The agency has assigned flat fees for these codes. The agency does not adopt any ASA RVG codes that are not included in the CPT book. Bill all anesthesia codes according to the descriptions published in the current CPT book. When there are differences in code descriptions between the CPT book and the ASA RVG, the agency follows CPT code descriptions. The agency does not pay providers f or anesthesia services when these services are billed using the CPT surgery, radiology, and/or medicine codes with anesthesia modifiers. Continue to use appropriate anesthesia modifier with CPT codes. Exception: Anesthesia providers l CPT pain m anagement/ other s ervices procedure codes that are not paid with base and time units. These services are paid as a procedure using RBRVS methodology. Do not bill time in the unit field or use anesthesia modifiers. When billing for sterilizatio n, details regarding anesthesia are located in the Sterilization Supplemental Billing Guide . When multiple surgical procedures are performed during the same period of anesthesia, bill the surgical procedure with the greatest base value, along with the total time in whole minutes. When more than one anesthesia provider is present, the agency pays each provider 50% of the allowed amount. The agency limits payment in this circumstan ce to 100% of the total allowed payment for the service. Providers must report the number of actual anesthesia minutes (calculated to the next whole minute) in the app ropriate field on the claim . The agency calculates the base units. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 83 Note: When billing f or Medicare crossovers, remember that Medicare pays per the base units and the agency pays per minute of anesthesia. When billing a Medicare crossover on a Direct Data Entry (DDE) claim , bill the agency using minutes in the unit field. When billing a Med icare crossover on a HIPAA 837P transaction, bill units the same as if billing Medicare. Regional anesthesia Bill the agency the appropriate procedure code (e.g. epidural CPT code 62326) with no time units and no anesthesia modifier. The agency determi nes payment by using the procedure's maximum allowable fee, not anesthesia base and time units. Local nerve block CPT code 64450 (other than digital and metacarpal) for subregional anatomic areas (such as the hand, wrist, ankle, foot and vagina) is included in the global surgical package and is not paid separately. Other The agency does not pay separately for moderate sedation. The agency considers moderate sedation as bundled with the procedure code. Patient acuity does not affect payment levels. Qualifying circumstances (CPT codes 99100, 99116, 99135, and 99140) are considered bundled and are not paid separately. The agency follows Medicare's policy of not paying surgeons for anesthesia services. Claims for anesthesia services with modifier 47 will be denied. Under Medicare's payment policy, separate payment for local, regional, or digital block or general anesthesia administered by the surgeon is not allowed. These services are considered included in the RBRVS payments for the procedure. When bi lling for anesthesia services using CPT unlisted anesthesia code 01999, providers must attach documentation (operative report) to their claim indicating what surgical procedure was performed that required the anesthesia, in order to receive payment. The ag ency will determine payment amount after review of the documentation. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 84 Teaching anesthesiologists The agency pays teaching anesthesiologists for supervision of anesthesiology residents as follows: When supervising one resident only, the teaching anesthe siologist must bill the agency the appropriate anesthesia procedure code with modifier AA . Payment to the teaching anesthesiologist will be 100% of the allowed amount. When supervising two or more residents concurrently, the teaching anesthesiologist must bill the agency the appropriate anesthesia procedure codes with modifier QK . Payment to the teaching anesthesiologist will be 50% of the allowed amount for each case supervised. Physician fee schedule payment for services of teaching physicians General rule: If a resident physician participates in providing a service in a teaching setting, physician fee schedule payment is made only if a teaching physician is present during the key portion of any service or procedure for which payment is sought. Surgical, high -risk, or other complex procedures: The teaching physician must be present during all critical portions of the procedure and immediately available to furnish services during the entire service or procedure. Surgery: The teaching physician's presence is not required during opening and closing of the surgical field. Procedures performed through an endoscope: The teaching physician must be present during the entire viewing. Evaluation and management services : The teaching physician must be pr esent during the portion of the service that determines the level of service billed. (However, in the case of evaluation and management services furnished in hospital outpatient departments and certain other ambulatory settings, the requirements of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7415.174 apply.) Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 85 Anesthesia for dental General anesthesia is allowed when provided by an anesthesiology provider in a hospital for dental admissions. To bill for dental anesthesia provided in a hospital , providers must use CPT anesthesia code 00170 with the appropriate anesthesia modifier. See the agency's Dental -Related Services Billing Guide for information on billing for office - based anesthesia for dental procedures. Note: Bill the agency directly for dental anesthesia for all clients, including those enrolled in an agency -contracted managed care organization . Anesthesia for maternity (WAC 182- 531-0300(9) ) The agency pays a maximum of 6 hours (360 minutes) of anesthesia for labor and delivery time (CPT codes 01960, 01961, 01967 and 01968) per delivery, including multiple births and/or cesarean section delivery. Exception: The following obstetrical anesthesia codes are not subject to the 6 - hour (360 minute) limitation: CPT codes 01962- 01966 or 01969. When billing more than one time -limited anesthe sia code, the total time may not exceed 6 hours (360 minutes). Bill the applicable CPT anesthesia code with applicable modifier and time. To determine time for obstetric epidural anesthesia during normal labor and delivery and C -sections, time begins with insertion and ends with removal for a maximum of 6 hours per delivery. CPT codes 01968 and 01969 are anesthesia add -on codes to be used for cesarean delivery and cesarean hysterectomy following anesthesia given for a planned vaginal delivery. An additional base of 3 is allowed for 01968 and an additional base of 5 is allowed for 01969, in conjunction with the base of 5 for 01967. The time involved with each portion of the procedure should be reported with the appropriate CPT code. For example: When a ph ysician starts a planned vaginal delivery (CPT code 01967) and it results in a cesarean delivery (CPT code 01968), both of these procedures may be billed. However, if both an anesthesiologist and a certified registered nurse assistant (CRNA) are involved, each provider bills only for those services he/she performed. The sum of the payments for each procedure will not exceed the agency's maximum allowable fee. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 86 Anesthesia time for sterilization is added to the time for the delivery when the two procedures ar e performed during the same operative session. If the sterilization and delivery are performed during different operative sessions, the time is calculated separately. Anesthesia for radiological procedures (WAC 182- 531-0300 (2) and (7)) General anesthesia is allowed for radiological procedures for children and/or noncooperative clients when the medically necessary procedure cannot be per formed unless the client is anesthetized. Providers must use the anesthesia CPT code 01922 when providing general anesthesia for noninvasive imaging or radiation therapy. Do not bill the radiological procedure code (e.g., CPT code 71010) with an anesthesi a modifier to bill for the anesthesia procedure. When using CPT code 01922 for noninvasive imaging or radiation therapy , one of the following must be met : The client must b e 17 years of age or younger. A statement of the client- specific reasons why the p rocedure cannot be performed without anesthesia services must be kept in the client's medical record and made available to the agency on request. Anesthesia payment calculation for services paid with base and time units The agency's current anesthesia conversion factor is $21.20. Anesthesia time is paid using one minute per unit . Total anesthesia payment is calculated by adding the base value for the anesthesia procedure with the actual time. Bill time in total minutes only, rounded to the next whole mi nute. Do not bill the procedure's base units. The following table illustrates how to calculate the anesthesia payment: Payment Calculation A. Multiply base units by 15. B. Add total minutes to value from step A. C. Divide anesthesia conversion factor by 15, to obtain the rate per minute. D. Multiply total from Step B by the rate per minute in Step C. Anesthesia conversion factor is based on 15- minute time units . Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 87 Surgery (WAC 182- 531-1700 ) The agency requires prior authorization for selected surgical procedures. Providers must check the Physician -Related Services Fee Schedule for those surgical services that requir e either prior authorization ( PA) or expedited prior authorization ( EPA ). Smoking cessation Nicotine use is a strong contraindication to spine surgeries. Patients undergoing cervical fusions and repeat fusions for radiculopathy are required to abstain f rom nicotine for four weeks before surgery. The agency covers smoking cessation which can include free counseling and prescription drugs. See Behavior Change Intervention - Smoking Cessation . Pain management services Pain management services and selected surgical services that are commonly performed by anesthesiologists and CRNAs are not paid with anesthesia base and time units. These servi ces are paid using the agency's assigned maximum allowable fee for the procedure code. When billing for pain management and other services that are payable using the agency's assigned maximum allowable fee, do not use anesthesia modifiers. The agency denies claims for these services bi lled with an anesthesia modifier. Two postoperative procedures for pain management are allowed during the same inpatient stay. Only one (1) unit may be billed per procedure. Do NOT bill time.

Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 203 Maternity Care and Delivery Elective deliveries The agency does not reimburse for early elective deliveries. An early elective delivery is def ined in WAC 182- 500-0030 as any nonmedically necessary induction or cesarean section before 39 weeks gestation. An early elective delivery is considered medically necessary if the mother or fetus has a diagnosis listed in the Joint Commission's current t able of Conditions Possibly Justifying Elective Delivery Prior to 39 Weeks Gestation (WAC 182- 533-0400). If the client meets the medical necessity criteria, bill using E PA #870001375 . This EPA also needs to be used for clients who deliver naturally prior to 39 weeks. If the early elective delivery does not meet medical necessity criteria , the agency will pay only for the antepartum and postpartum professional services. When billing, these services must be unbundl ed. The agency will not pay for the delivery services. For all deliveries for a client equal to or over 39 weeks gestation, bill using EPA #870001378 . This applies to both elective and natural deliveries for clients equal to or over 39 weeks gestation . Prenatal assessments not covered The agency does not cover prenatal assessments. If a client is seen for reasons other than routine antepartum or postpartum care, providers must bill using the appropriate Evaluation and Management ( E/M) procedure code with a medical diagnosis code. E/M codes billed with the appropriate ICD diagnosis codes Z33.1, Z34.00, Z34.80, or Z34.90 will be denied if listed as the principal diagnosis . Exception: Providers must bill E/M codes for antepartum care if only 1- 3 antepartum visits are done. For information regarding family planning services, including long- acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), see th e Family Planning Billing Guide . Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 204 Confirmation of pregnancy If a client presents with signs or symptoms of pregnancy and the purpose of the client's visit is to confirm the pregnancy, bill this visit using the appropriate level E/M code, if the obstetrical (OB) record is not initiated. If the OB record is initiated at this visit, then the visit is considered part of the global OB package and must not be billed separately. If some other sour ce has confirmed the pregnancy and the provider wants to do his/her own confirmation, bill this visit using the appropriate level E/M code if the OB record is not initiated. If the OB record is initiated at this visit, the visit is considered part of the g lobal OB package and must not be billed separately. If the purpose of the client's visit is to confirm the pregnancy and the OB record is not initiated, bill using the diagnosis code(s) for the signs and/or symptoms the client is having [e.g. suppressed menstruation (ICD diagnosis code N92.5 or N93.8 )]. Do not bill using the pregnancy diagnosis codes (e.g. Z33.1, Z34.00, Z34.80, or Z34.90) unless the OB record is initiated at this visit. If the OB record is initiated at this visit, the visit is considered part of the global package. See obstetrical ultrasounds in this guide . The agency does not pay separately for CerviLenz . It is considered bundled into the practice expense. Global (total) obstetrical (OB) care Global OB care (CPT codes 59400, 59510, 59610, or 59618) includes all the following: Routine antepartum care in any trimester Delivery Postpartum care If the provider furnishes all of the client's antepartum care, perform the delivery, and provide the postpartum care, the provider must bill using one of the global OB procedure codes. Use HCPCS code 0500F along with the appropriate billing code on the first prenatal visit. The agency is tracking the date a cl ient begins receiving obstetrical care (date the OB record is initiated). Note this date by entering HCPCS code 0500F with the appropriate ICD diagnosis codes Z33.1, Z34.00, Z34.80, or Z34.90 on the claim. Note: When billing global Obstetrical Services, the place of service code must correspond with the place where the child was born (for example: 25). Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 205 When more than one provider in the same clinic (same group NPI) sees the same client for global maternity care, the agency pays only one provider for the g lobal (total) obstetrical care. Providers who are in the same clinic who do not have the same group NPI must not bill the agency the global (total) obstetrical care procedure codes. In this case, the OB services must be unbundled and the antepartum, delivery, or postpartum care must be billed separately. Note: Do not bill the agency for maternity services until all care is completed. Unbundling obstetrical care In the situations described below, providers may not be able to bill the agency for global OB care. In these cases, it may be necessary to unbundle the OB services and bill the antepartum, delivery, and postpartum care separately, as the agency may have paid another provider for some of the client's OB care, or a provider may have been paid by another insurance carrier for some of the client's OB care. When a client transfers to a practice late in the pregnancy... If the client has had antepartum care elsewhere, the subsequent provider must not bill the global OB package. Bill the antepartum car e, delivery, and postpartum care separately. The provider that had been providing the antepartum care bills for the services that he/she performed. Therefore, if the subsequent provider bills the global OB package, that provider is billing for some antepar tum care that another provider has claimed. - OR - If the client did not receive any antepartum care prior to coming to the provider's office, bill the global OB package. In this case, the provider may actually perform all of the components of the global OB package in a short time. The agency does not require this provider to perform a specific number of antepartum visits in order to bill for the global OB package. If a client moves to another provider (not associated with the providers practice), moves out of the area prior to delivery, or loses the pregnancy... When physician A has seen the client for part of the antepartum care and has transferred the client to physician B for care, and physician B is billing separately for the antepartum care being delivered, physician B enters \"transfer of care\" in the Claim Note section of the electronic claim. Physician B bills only those services actually provided to these clients. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 206 If a client changes insurance during pregnancy... Often, a client is fee- for-service at the beginning of pregnancy and enrolled in an agency managed care organization for the remainder of the pregnancy. The agency is responsible for paying only those services provided to the client while the client is on fee- for-service. The managed care organization (MCO) pays for services provided after the client is enrolled with the plan. The agency encourages early prenatal care and is actively enrolling new clients into the Healthy Options program. If a client is on fee-for-service and is enrolling in a Healthy Options plan at the beginning of her pregnancy, consider billing the first visit as a secondary confirmation of pregnancy using ICD diagnosis code N92.5 or N93.8 with the appropriate level of offic e visit as described under the Confirmation of Pregnancy section. When a client changes from one plan to another, bill those services that were provided while the client was enrolled with the original plan to the original carrier, and those services that were provide d under the new coverage to the new plan. The provider must unbundle the services and bill the antepartum, delivery, and postpartum care separately. For clients who move in and out of managed care and fee for service, use TH and CG modifiers to unbundle t he codes. Antepartum care Per CPT guidelines, the agency considers routine antepartum care for a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy to consist of: Monthly visits up to 28 weeks gestation. Biweekly visits to 36 weeks gestation. Weekly visits until delivery. Antepartum care includes: Initial and subsequent history. Physical examination. Recording of weight and blood pressure. Recording of fetal heart tones. Routine chemical urinalysis. Maternity counseling, such as risk factor assessment and referrals. Necessary prenatal laboratory tests may be billed in addition to antepartum care, except for the following tests (CPT 81002, 81003, Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 207 Coding for antepartum care only If it is necessary to unbundle the OB packa ge and bill separately for antepartum care, bill as follows: If the client had a total of one to three antepartum visits, bill the appropriate level of E/M service with modifier TH for each visit, with the date of service the visit occurred and the appropriate diagnosis. Modifier TH : Obstetrical treatment/service, prenatal or postpartum If the client had a total of four to six antepartum visits, bill using CPT code 59425 with a \"1\" in the units box. Bill the agency using the date of the last antepartum visit in the to and from fields. If the client had a total of seven or more visits, bill using CPT code 59426 with a \"1\" in the units box. Bill the agency using the date of the last antepartum visit in the to and from fields. Do not bill antepartum care only codes in addition to any other procedure codes that include antepartum care (i.e. global OB codes). When billing for antepartum care, do not bill using CPT E/M codes for the first three visits, th en CPT code 59425 for visits four through six, and then CPT code 59426 for visits seven and on. These CPT codes are used to bill only the total number of times the client was seen for all antepartum care during her pregnancy, and may not be billed in combination with each other during the entire pregnancy period. For those clients who have non- maternity -related issues and diagnosis(es), the provider should use the appropriate E&M code with the modifier GB. Note: Do not bill the agency until all antepartum services are complete. Hospital care for pregnant women can be billed concurrently. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 208 Coding for deliveries If it is necessary to unbundle the OB package and bill for the delivery only, bill the agency using one of the following CPT codes: 59409 (vaginal delivery only) 59514 (cesarean delivery only) 59612 [vaginal delivery only, after previous cesarean delivery (VBAC)] 59620 [cesarean delivery only, after attempted vaginal delivery after previous cesarean delivery (attempted VBAC)] If a provider does not furnish antepartum care, but performs the delivery and provides postpartum care, bill the agency one of the following CPT codes: 59410 (vaginal delivery, including postpartum care) care) postpartum 59622 (attempted VBAC, including postpartum care) Coding for postpartum care only If it is necessary to unbundle the OB package and bill for postpartum care only , bill the agency using CPT code 59430 (postpa rtum care only). If a provider furnishes all of the antepartum and postpartum care, but does not perform the delivery, bill the agency for the antepartum care using the antepartum care only codes, along with CPT code 59430 (postpartum care only). Do not bill CPT code 59430 (postpartum care only) in addition to any procedure codes that include postpartum care. Postpartum care includes office visits for the six week period after the delivery and includes family planning counseling and contraceptive managem ent. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 209 Billing with modifiers For those clients who have either a non -maternity related issue or a high -risk medical condition, the provider should use the appropriate E/M procedure code with modifier GB. Nonsupervision, not part of global, medical di agnosis is always primary. Modifiers GB CG TH UA All of these modifiers must be used with E/M only Nonsupervision , not part of global, high risk medical condition or condition unrelated to the pregnancy, which is always primary reason for the visit. Do not use a supervision diagnosis code . Supervision when client is in and out of managed care Supervision of the client when the provider treats client for less than four visits and unbundles care Supervision with additional visits beyond global (for high-risk pregnancy) Multiple providers for OB care X Providers seeing client for medical reasons o ther than current pregnancy X High risk pregnancy and all prenatal OB care X Client moves from managed care to/from FFS X Perinatologist visit for pre - existing condition and client is now pre gnant (visit is outside of OB care/o utside of OB bundle) X Antepartum care and/or postpartum care if only 1-3 visits X Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 210 Additional monitoring for high-risk conditions When providing additional monitoring for high -risk conditions in excess of the CPT guidelines for normal antepartum visits, bill using E/M codes 99211- 99215 with modifier UA. The office visits may be billed in addition to the global fee only after exceed ing the CPT guidelines for normal antepartum care. Providers must bill with a primary diagnosis that identifies that the high risk condition is pregnancy related. A condition that is classifiable as high -risk alone does not entitle the provider to additional payment. Per CPT guidelines, it must be medically necessary to see the client more often than what is considered routine antepartum care in order to qualify for additional payments. The additional payments are intended to cover additional costs incurred by the provider as a result of more frequent visits. For example: Client A is scheduled to see her provider for her antepartum visits on January 4, February 5, March 3, and April 7. The client attends her January and February visits, as scheduled. However, during her scheduled February visit, the provider discovers the client's blood pressure is slightly high and wants her to come in on February 12 to be checked again. At the February 12 visit, the provider discovers her blood pressure is still sl ightly high and asks to see her again on February 18. The February 12 and February 18 visits are outside of her regularly scheduled antepartum visits and outside of the CPT guidelines for routine antepartum care since she is being seen more often than once per month. The February 12 and February 18 visits may be billed separately from the global antepartum visits using the appropriate E/M codes with modifier UA, and the diagnosis must represent the medical necessity for billing additional visits. A normal p regnancy diagnosis (i.e . Z33.1, Z34.00, Z34.80, or Z34.90) will be denied outside of the global antepartum care . It is not necessary to wait until all services included in the routine antepartum care are performed to bill the extra visits, as long as the e xtra visits are outside of the regularly scheduled visits. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 211 Labor management Providers may bill for labor management only when another provider (outside of the first provider's group practice) performs the delivery. If a provider performed all of the client's antepartum care, admitted the client to the hospital during labor, delivered the baby, and performed the postpartum care, do not bill the agency for the hospital admission or for labor management. These services are included in the global OB package. If, however, a provider performed all of the client's antepartum care and admitted the client to the hospital during labor, but another provider (outside of the first provider's group practice) takes over delivery, the global OB package must be unbundled a nd the providers must bill separately for antepartum care, the hospital admission, and the time spent managing the client's labor. The client must be in active labor and admitted to a hospital when the referral to the delivering provider is made. To bill for labor management in the situation described above, bill the agency for one of the hospital admission CPT codes 99221- 99223 with modifier TH . In addition to the hospital admission, the agency pays providers for up to three hours of labor management usin g prolonged services CPT codes 99356- 99357 with modifier TH . Payment for prolonged services is limited to three hours per client, per pregnancy , regardless of the number of calendar days a client is in labor, or the number of providers who provide labor management. Labor management may not be billed by the delivering provider, or by any provider within the delivering provider's group practice. Note : 1. The a gency pays for prolonged services CPT codes for labor management only when the provider performs the hospital admission and labor management services on the same day. 2. The hospital admission code and prolonged services code(s) must be billed on the same claim with the same dates of services. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 212 High -risk deliveries Delivery includes management of uncomplicated labor and vaginal delivery (with or without episiotomy, with or without forceps) or cesarean section. If a complication occurs during delivery resulting in an unusually complicated, high- risk delivery, the agency pays providers an additional add -on fee. Bill the high -risk add -on fee by adding modifier TG to the Modifier TG : Complex/high level of care The ICD diagnosis code must clearly demonstrate the medical necessity for the high -risk delivery add -on (e.g. a diagnosis of fetal distress). A normal delivery diagnosis is not paid an additional high- risk add -on fee, even if the mother had a high- risk condition during the antepartum period. Bill only ONE line of service (e.g. 59400 TG) to receive payment for BOTH the delivery and the high- risk add- on. DO NOT bill the delivery code (e.g. 59400) on one line of the claim and the high- risk add- on (e.g. 59400 TG) on a second line of the claim. A physician who provides stand- by attendance for hig h-risk delivery can bill CPT 99360 and resuscitation CPT code 99465, when appropriate. Note: The agency does not pay an assistant surgeon, RNFA, or co- surgeon for a high-risk delivery add -on. Payment is limited to one per client, per pregnancy (even in the case of multiple births). Consultations If another provider refers a client during her pregnancy for a consultation, bill the agency using consultation CPT codes 99241- 99245. If an inpatient consultation is necessary, bill using CPT codes 99251 - 99255 or for a follow -up bill using CPT codes 99231- 99233. The referring physician's name and NPI must be listed in the Referring Physician field on the claim. If the consultation results in the decision to perform surgery (i.e. a cesarean section), the agency pays the consulting physician for the consultation as follows: If the consulting physician does not perform the cesarean section, bill the agency the appropriate consultation code. If the consulting physician performs the cesarean section and does the consultation two or more days prior to the date of surgery , bill the agency the appropriate consultation code with modifier 57 (e.g. 99241 -57). The agency does not pay the consulting physician if the following applies: Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 213 If the consulting physician performs the cesarean section and does the consultation the day before or the day of the cesarean section , the consultation is bundled within payment for the surgery. Do not bill the agency for the consultation in this situation . Bill the agency for cons ultations using an appropriate ICD diagnosis code. The medical necessity (i.e. sign, symptom, or condition) must be demonstrated. The agency does not pay providers for a consultation with a normal pregnancy diagnosis code (e.g. Z33.1, Z34.00, Z34.80, or Z34.90). The agency pays consulting OB/GYN providers for an external cephalic version (CPT code 59412) and a consultation when performed on the same day. General obstetrical payment policies and limitations The agency pays a mu ltiple vaginal delivery (for twins, triplets, etc.) at 100% for the first baby. When billing for the second or third baby, bill using the delivery -only code (CPT code 59409 or 59612) for each additional baby. Payment for each additional baby will be 50% of the delivery -only code's maximum allowance. Bill each baby's delivery on a separate line. Identify on the claim as \"twin A\" or \"twin B,\" etc. The agency pays for multiple births by cesarean delivery at 100% for the first baby. No additional payment will be made for additional babies. Physician assistants -certified (PA -C) must bill for assisting during a C -section on their own claim using modifier 80, 81, or 82 to the delivery -only code (e.g. 59514- 80). The claim must be billed using the PA -C's NPI. Physician assistants (PA) must bill for an assist by adding modifier 80, 81, or 82 to the delivery -only code (e.g. 59514- 80). RNFAs assisting at C -sections may only bill using CPT code 59514 or 59620 with modifier 80. To bill anesthesia during delive ry, see Anesthesia for Maternity .

Services are designed to help pregnant women and their newborns gain access to medical, social, educational and other services. MSS and ICM provide a variety of services in the home or clinic throughout pregnancy and up to the infant's first birthday. For information on MSS/ICM, see the agency's Maternity Support Services/Infant policy. Exceptions: The agency pays for counseling visits when billed with an E/M service on the same day when: The client is being seen for a medical probl em and modifier 25 is billed.

The drug is for a medically accepted indication as defined in WAC 182- 530-1050 . The drug is not excluded from coverage (see WAC 182- 530-2000 Covered - Outpatient drugs, devices, and drug related supplies) . The manufacturer has a signed drug rebate agreement with the federal Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Exceptions to the drug r ebate requirement are described in WAC 182- 530-7500 which describes the drug rebate program. For more information, see the agency's Prescription Drug Program Billing Guide .

Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 239 Drug p ricing The agency follows Medicare's drug pricing methodology of 106% of the Average Sales Price (ASP). If a Medicare fee is unavailable for a partic ular drug, the agency prices the drug at a percentage of the Average Wholesale Price (AWP). The agency updates the rates each time Medicare's rate is updated, up to once per quarter. Unlike Medicare, the agency effective dates are based on dates of service, not the date the claim is received. For HCPCS codes where Medicare does not establish a rate, the agency determines the maximum allowances for covered drugs using the following methodology: 1. For a single -source drug or biological, the AWP equals the AWP of the single product. 2. For a multi- source drug or biological, the AWP is equal to the median AWP of all of the generic forms of the drug or biological, or the lowest brand- name product AWP, whichever is less. A brand -name product is defined as a product that is marketed under a labeled name that is other than the generic chemical name for the drug or biological. 3. After determining the AWP according to #1 and #2 above, the agency multiplies the amount by 0.84 to arrive at the fee schedule maxim um allowance. National drug code format All providers are required to use the 11- digit National Drug Code (NDC) when billing the agency for drugs administered in the provider's office. National Drug Code (NDC) - The 11 -digit number the manufacturer or labeler assigns to a pharmaceutical product and attaches to the product container at the time of packaging. The 11 -digit NDC is composed of a 5- 4-2 grouping. The first 5 digits comprise the labeler code assigned t o the manufacturer by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA). The second grouping of 4 digits is assigned by the manufacturer to describe the ingredients, dose form, and strength. The last grouping of 2 digits describes the package size. ( WAC 182- 530-1050 ) The NDC must contain 11- digits in order to be recognized as a valid NDC. It is not uncommon for the label attached to a drug's vial to be missing leading zeros. For example: The label may list the NDC as 123456789when, in fact, the correct NDC is 01234056789. Make sure that the NDC is listed as an 11 -digit number, inserting any leading zeros missing from the 5 -4-2 groupings, as necessary . The a gency will deny claims for drugs billed without a valid 11- digit NDC.

The agency follows Medicare's drug pricing methodology of 106% of the Average Sales Price (ASP). If a Medicare fee is unavailable for a particular drug, the agency continues to price the drug at 84% of the Average Wholesale Price (AWP). Preparation of the chemotherapy drug is included in the payment for the administration of the drug. Bill number of units used based on the description of the drug code. For example, if 250 mg of Cisplatin (J9062) is given to the client, the correct number of units is five (5). Note: See Unlisted Drugs for information on when it is necessary to bill the agency for a chemotherapy drug using an unlisted drug code. Billing for single -dose vials For single -dose vials, bill for the total amount of the drug contained in the vial(s).

For example : If a total of 150 mg of Et oposide is required for the therapy, and two 100 mg single dose vials are used to obtain the total dosage, then the total of the two 100 mg vials is paid. In this case, the drug is billed using HCPCS code J9181 (Etoposide, 10 mg). If the agency's maximum a llowable fee is $4.38 per 10 mg unit, the total allowable is $87.60 (200 mg divided by 10 = 20 units x $4.38). The agency pays for justified waste when billed with the JW modifier, for Medicare crossover bills only.

In this case, the drug is billed using HCPCS code J9110 (Cytarabine, 500 mg). If the agency's maximum allowable fee is $23.75 per 500 mg unit, the total allowable is $47.50 [750 mg divided by 500 = 2 (1.5 rounded) units x $23.75].

The Department of Health (DOH) and the Health Care Authority (the agency) receive funding from the TCF to help support provider groups involved in t he state's trauma care system. The agency uses its TCF funding to draw federal matching funds. The agency makes supplemental payments to designated trauma centers and pays enhanced rates to physicians/clinical providers for trauma cases that meet specifi ed criteria. The enhanced rates are available for trauma care services provided to a fee- for-service Medical Assistance client with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of: (a) 13 or greater for adults. (b) 9 or greater for pediatric patients ( age 14 and younger ). (c) Less than (a) or (b) for a trauma patient received in transfer by a Level I, II, or III trauma center. Beginning with dates of service on and after July 1, 2012, physicians/clinical providers also receive enhanced rates for qualified trauma care services pr ovided to managed care enrollees who meet trauma program eligibility criteria. Client eligibility groups included in TCF payments to physicians Claims for trauma care services provided to the following client groups are eligible for enhanced rates: Medicaid (Title XIX) CHIP (Title XXI) Medical Care Services (Aged, Blind, and Disabled (ABD) Apple Health for Kids (Children's Health) Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 264 Client eligibility groups excluded from TCF payments to physicians Claims for trauma care services provided to the f ollowing client groups are not eligible for enhanced rates: Refugee Assistance Alien Emergency Medical Family Planning Only/TAKE CHARGE Services excluded from TCF payments to physicians Claims for the following services are not eligible for enhanced rates: Laboratory and pathology services Technical Compone nt (TC)- only radiology services Services unrelated to a client's traumatic injury (e.g., t reatment for chronic diseases) Services provided after discharge from the initial hospital stay, except for inpatient rehabilitation services and/or planned follow -up surgery related to the traumatic injury and provided within six months of t he date of the traumatic injury Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 265 TCF payments to physicians Enhanced rates for trauma care (WAC 182- 531-2000 ) To receive payments from the TCF, a physician or other clinician must: Be on the designated trauma services resp onse team of any Department of H ealth (DOH) - designated or DOH -recognized tr auma service center. Submit all information to the TCF that the agency requires to monitor the trauma program. The agency makes a TCF payment to a physician or clinician: When the provider submits an eligible trauma claim with the appropriate trauma indi cator within the time frames specified by the agency . On a per -claim basis. Each qualifying trauma service or procedure on the provider's claim is paid at the agency's current fee -for-service rate, multiplied by the appropriate payment enhancement percentage at a rate of 2 \u00bd times the agency's current fee -for-service rate for qualified trauma services, or other payment enhancement percentage the agency deems appropriate. Labora tory and pathology services and procedures are not eligible for payments from the TCF and are paid at the agency's current fee -for-service rate. For an eligible trauma service, payment is currently calculated as follows: Trauma care payment = Base rate x 275% Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 266 Criteria for TCF payments to physicians Physicians and clinical providers receive TCF payments from the agency: 1) For qualified trauma care services. Qualified trauma care serv ices are those that meet the ISS specified in subsection (3) below. Qualified trauma care services also include inpatient rehabilitation and surgical services provided to Medical Assistance clients within six months of the date of the qualifying injury whe n the following conditions are met: (a) The follow -up surgical procedures are directly related to the qualifying traumatic injury. (b) The follow -up surgical procedures were planned during the initial acute episode of care (inpatient stay). (c) The plan for the follow -up surgical procedure(s) is clearly documented in the medical record of the client's initial hospitalization for the traumatic injury. 2) For hospital -based services only, except as specified in (4). 3) Only for trauma cases that meet the ISS of: (a) Thirt een or greater for an adult trauma patient (a c lient age 15 or older). (b) Nine or greater for a pediatric trauma patient (a client younger than age 15). (c) Less than 13 for adults or 9 for pediatric patients for a trauma case received in transfer by a Level I, II, or III trauma service center. 4) On a claim -specific basis. Services must have been provided in a designated trauma service center, except that qualified follow -up surgical care within six months of the initial traumatic injury, as described in subsection (1) above, may be provided in other approved care settings, such as Medicare -certified ambulatory surgery centers. 5) At a rate determined by the agency. The enhanced rates are subject to the following limitations: (a) Laboratory and pathology charges are no t eligible for enhanced payments from the TCF. Laboratory and pathology services are paid at the lesser of the agency's current FFS rate or the billed amount. (b) Technical component only (TC) charges for radiology services are not eligible for enhanced rates when billed by physicians. (These are facility charges.) Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 267 (c) The rate enhancement percentage is subject to periodic adjustments to ensure that total payments from the TCF for the state fiscal year will not exceed the legislative appropriation for that fiscal year. The agency has the authority to take whatever actions are needed to ensure it stays within its TCF appropriation. TCF payments to providers in transferred trauma cases When a trauma case is transferred from one hospital to another, the age ncy makes TCF payments to providers as follows: If the transferred case meets or exceeds the appropriate ISS threshold ( ISS of 13 or greater for adults, and 9 or greater for pediatric clients), both transferring and receiving hospitals and physicians/clinicians who furnished qualified trauma care services are eligible for increased payments from the TCF. The transfer must be to a higher level designated trauma service center, and the transferring hospital must be at least a level 3 hospital. Transfers from a higher level to a lower level designated trauma service center are not eligible for the increased payments. If the transferred case is below the ISS threshold, only the receiving hospital and the physicians/clinicians at the receiving facility who furn ished qualified trauma care services are eligible for increased payments from the TCF. The transferring hospital and clinical team are paid the regular rates for the services they provided to the transferred client with an ISS below the applicable threshol d. Billing for trauma care services To bill for qualified trauma care services, physicians and clinical providers must add the trauma modifier ST to the appropriate procedure code line. Enter the required ST modifier into the modifier field of the claim to receive the enhanced payment . Note: The ProviderOne system can accommodate up to 4 modifiers on a line, if multiple modifiers are necessary. Claims for trauma care services provided to a managed care enrollee must be submitted to the client's managed care plan. Claims for trauma care services provided to a fee- for-service client must be submitted to the agency. The payment for a trauma care service provided to a managed care enrollee will be the same amount for the same service provided to a fee- for-service client. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 268 Adjusting trauma claims The agency considers a provider's request to adjust a claim for the purpose of receiving TCF payment (e.g., adding the ST modifier to a previously billed service, or adding a new procedure with the ST modifier to the claim) only when the adjustment request is received within one year from the date of service on the initial claim. See WAC 182- 502-0150 (11). A claim which included a trauma serv ice may be submitted for adjustment beyond 365 calendar days when the reason for the adjustment request is other than TCF payment (e.g., adding lab procedures, correcting units of service). Note: The agency takes back the original payment when processing an adjustment request. Electronic claims get a Julian date stamp on the date received, including weekends and holidays. When a trauma care service that was billed timely and received the enhanced rate and is included in a claim submitted for adjustment after 365 days, the agency will pay the provider the regular rate for the service when the adjustment is processed, and recoup the original enhanced payment. All claims and claim adjustments are subject to federal and state audit and review requirements. Injury severity score (ISS) Note: The current ISS qualifying score is 13 or greater for adults, and 9 or greater for pediatric clients (through age 14 only). The ISS is a summary severity score for anatomic injuries. It is based upon the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) severity scores for six body regions: Head and neck Face Chest Abdominal and pelvic contents Extremities and pelvic girdle External The ISS values range from 1 to 75. Generally, a higher ISS indicates more serious injuries.

This modifier is not to be used to report procedure(s) complicated by adhesion forma tion, scarring, and/or alteration of normal landmarks due to late effects of prior surgery, irradiation, infection, very low weight or trauma. For informational purposes only; no extra allowance is allowed. 23: Unusual Anesthesia : For informational purposes only; no extra allowance is allowed. 24: Unrelated Evaluation and Management (E/M) by the Same Physician During a Postoperative Period : The physician may need to indicate that an evaluation and management service was performed during a postoperative p eriod for a reason(s) unrelated to the original procedure. This circumstance may be reported by adding the modifier 24 to the appropriate level of E/M service. Payment for the E/M service during postoperative period is made when the reason for the E/M service is unrelated to original procedure. 25: Significant, Separately Identifiable Evaluation and Management Service by the Same Physician on the Day of a Procedure : The physician may need to indicate that on the day a procedure or service identified by a C PT\u00ae code was performed, the client's condition required a significant, separately identifiable E/M service above and beyond the usual preoperative and postoperative care associated with the procedure that was performed. This circumstance may be reported by adding the modifier 25 to the appropriate level of E/M service. Payment for the E/M service is the billed charge or the agency's maximum allowable, whichever is less. 26: Professional Component : Certain procedures are a combination of professional and technical components. When only the professional component is reported, the service is identified by adding modifier 26 to the procedure code. TC: Technical Component : Certain procedures are a combination of professional and technical components.

For surgical procedures typically performed on both sides of the body, payment for the E/M service is the billed charge or the agency's maximu m allowable, whichever is less. For surgical procedures that are typically performed on one side of the body, but performed bilaterally in a specific case, payment is 150% of the global surgery fee for the procedure. 51: Multiple Procedures : When multiple surgeries are performed at the same operative session, total payment is equal to the sum of the following: 100% of the highest value procedure; 50% of the global fee for each of the second through fifth procedures. More than five procedures requir e submission of documentation and individual review to determine the payment amount. 52: Reduced Services : Under certain circumstances, a service or procedure is partially reduced at the physician's discretion. Under these circumstances, the service provi ded can be identified by its usual procedure number and the addition of the modifier 52, signifying that the service is reduced. This provides a means of reporting reduced services without disturbing the identification of the basic service. Using this modi fier does not reduce the allowance to the provider. Note: Modifier 52 may be used with computerized tomography procedure codes for a limited study or a follow -up study. 53: Discontinued Procedure : Under certain circumstances, the physician may elect to terminate a surgical or diagnostic procedure. Due to extenuating circumstances, or those that threaten the well -being of the patient, it may be necessary to indicate that a surgical or diagnostic procedure was started but discontinued. Use of modifier 53 i s allowed for all surgical procedures. Modifier 53 is a payment modifier when used with CPT code 45378 and HCPCS codes G0105 and G0121 only. It is information only for all other surgical procedures. 54, 55, 56 - Providers providing less than the global su rgical package should use modifiers 54, 55, & 56. These modifiers are designed to ensure that the sum of all allowances for all practitioners who furnished parts of the services included in a global surgery fee do not exceed the total amount of the payment that would have been paid to a single practitioner under the global fee for the procedure. The payment policy pays each physician directly for that portion of the global surgery services provided to the client.

Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 334 Site-of-Service Payment Differential How are fees established for p rofessional services performed in facility and n onfacility settings? Based on the Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) methodology, the a gency's fee schedule amounts are established using three relative value unit (RVU) components: work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. The a gency uses two levels of practice expense components to determine the fee schedule amounts for reimbursing professional services. This may result in two RBRVS maximum allowable fees for a procedure code. These are: Facility setting maximum allowable fees (FS Fee) - Paid when the provider performs the services in a facility setting (e.g., a hospital or ambulatory surgery center) and the cost of the resources are the responsibility of the facility. Nonfacility setting maximum allowable fees (NFS Fee) - Paid when the provider performs the service in a nonfacility setting (e.g., office or clinic) and typically bears the cost of resources, such as labor, medical supplies , and medical equipment associated with the service performed. Some services, by nature of their description, are performed only in certain settings and have only one maximum allowable fee per code. Examples of these services include: Evaluation and management ( E/M) codes which specify the site- of-service (SOS) within the description of the procedure codes (e. g., initial hospital care) Major surgical procedures that are generally performed only in hospital settings How does the SOS p ayment policy affect provider payments? Providers billing professional services are paid at one of two maximum allowable fees, depending on where the service is performed. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 335 Does the a gency pay providers differently for services performed in facility and n onfacility settings? Yes. When a provider performs a professional service in a facility setting, the a gency makes two payments - one to the performing provider and another to the facility. The payment to the provider (FS Fee) includes the provider's professional services only. A separate payment is made directly to the facility where the service took place, which includes payment for necessary resources. The FS Fee excludes the allowance for resources that are included in the payment to the facility. Paying the lower FS Fee to the performing provider when the facility is also paid eliminates duplicate payment for resources. When a provider performs a professional service in a nonfacility setting, the a gency makes only one payment to the performing provider. The payment to the provider (NFS Fee) includes the provider's professional services and payment for necessary resources. When are professional services paid at the facility setting maximum allowable fee? Providers a re paid at the FS Fee when the a gency also makes a payment to a facility. In most cases, the a gency follows Medicare's determination for using the FS Fee. Professional services billed with the following place of service codes are paid at the FS Fee: FACILITY SETTING Place of Service Code Place of Service Description 06 Indian Health Service - provider based 08 Tribal 638 - provider based 19 Off Campus -Outpatient Hospital 21 Inpatient Hospital 22 Outpatient Hospital 23 Emergency Room - Hospital 24 Ambulatory Surgery Center 25 Birthing Center 26 Military Treatment Facility 31 Skilled Nursing Facility Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 336 FACILITY SETTING (cont.) Place of Service Code Place of Service Description 34 Hospice 51 Inpatient Psychiatric Facility 52 Psychiatric Facility Partial Hospitalization 53 Community Mental Health Center 56 Psychiatric Residential Treatment Center 61 Comprehensive Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility 62 Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility Note: All claims submitted to the a gency must include the appropriate Medicare two-digit place of service code. The a gency will deny claims with single -digit place of service codes. Due to Medicare's consolid ated billing requirements, the a gency does not make a separate payment to provider s who perform certain services in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. The facilities are paid at the NFS Fee. Some therapies, such as physical therapy services are always paid at the NFS Fee. When are professional services paid at the nonfacility setting maximum allowable fee? The NFS Fee is paid when the a gency does not make a separate payment to a facility, such as when services are performed in a provider's office or a client's home. In most cases, the a gency follows Medicare's determination for using the NFS Fee. Professional services billed with the following place of service codes are paid at the NFS Fee: NONFACILITY SETTING Place of Service Code Place of Service Description 04 Homeless Shelter 05 Indian Health - Free Standing 07 Tribal 638 - Free Standing 11 Office 12 Home 13 Assisted Living Facility 14 Group Home 15 Mobile Unit 20 Urgent Care Facility 32 Nursing Facility Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 337 NONFACILITY SETTING (cont.)

The a gency will deny claims with single -digit place of service codes. Which professional services have a SOS p ayment differential? Most of the services with an SOS payment differential are from the surgery, medicine, and E/M ranges of CPT codes. However, som e HCPCS, CPT radiology, pathology, and laboratory codes also have an SOS payment differential. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 338 Fee S chedule I nformation Maximum allowable fees for all codes, including CPT \u00ae codes and selected HCPCS codes, are listed in the fee schedule. In the fee schedule, the a gency identifies procedure codes that may require prior authorization. However, this list may not be all -inclusive. Prior authorization, limitation s, or requirements detailed in a gency billing guides and Washington Administrative Code (WAC) remain applicable. The a gency's fee schedules are available for on the agency's Professional billing guides and fee schedules web page and the Hospita l reimbursement web page.

Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 340 The place of service (POS) 11 (office setting ) in the Place of Service field . Medicare and Medicaid policy prohibit the hospital from billing a facility fee in this circumstance. The agency will reimburse the clinic the nonfacility setting fee. This single claim comprises the total payment for the services rendered If DOH has designated the clin ic as a hospital -based entity , for the a gency to reimburse the clinic and the associated hospital for services provided to clients eligible for Washington Apple Health (Medicaid) , the following must happen: The clinic must submit to the a gency a professional electronic claim containing both: The professional fees in the Submitted Charges field . POS 22 (outpatient setting) in the Place of Service field . The hospital must submit to the agency an electronic institutional claim with the facility fees the Total Claim Charge field .

How do I resolve issues with gender indicator when billing for transgender clients? For gender to procedure mismatch: for transgender female with male genitalia For a transgender client, providers must include a secondary diagnosis on the claim that indicates the client is transgender ( F64.1, F64.8, F64.9). The secondary diagnosis may be in any diagnosis field on the claim. Use of the secondary diagnosis allows the gender -specific procedures to be processed through the agency's claims system. Without the secondary diagnosis code, the claim may be denied. Example situation: A client self -identifies as a female b ut still has male specific body parts. This client then gets a routine prostate exam. This bill would deny for a male -only procedure being billed on a female client. However, if a diagnosis such as gender identity disorder was listed as the secondary diagnosis, the claim would then be processed for payment. Physician -Related Services/ Health Care Professional Services CPT \u00ae codes and desc riptions only are copyright 2017 American Medical Association 341 Providers must list the secondary diagnosis ( F64.1, F64.8, F64.9) on the claim in these circumstances. If a claim is denied for a gender mismatch, visit the agency's Contact Us web page . Note: Providers should encourage transgender clients to update the ir gender listed on their Washington Apple Health account by contacting the agency's Medical Eligibility Determination Services (MEDS) t oll free 855- 623-9357. ProviderOne gender indicator does not match claim gender indicator Such as when a client presents as a female but ProviderOne has the male gender indicator in file. The provider should check the client's gender in ProviderOne when verifying coverage. If a mismatch is found, the provider should encourage the client to upda te the gender field to their preferred gender. The client can do this by calling the agency's Medical Eligibility Determination Section toll- free 1 -855-623-9357. How does the provider notify the agency of a date of birth or gender mismatch? If a provide r finds that a client's date of birth or gender is incorrect, the provider should email the following information to the agency 's Contact Us web page . TCN # A comment that the client is tr ansgender ProviderOne client ID Client's name Date of birth Gender at birth Gender identified as at the time service provided How does a client update their gender field?
