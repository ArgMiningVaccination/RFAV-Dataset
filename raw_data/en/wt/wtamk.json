[[99]](#cite_note-99) By mid-March 2021, The Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Bulgaria and Ireland had suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine due to worries over six cases of a \"rare combination\" of blood clots with lowered blood platelets, see [embolic and thrombotic events after COVID-19 vaccination](/wiki/Embolic_and_thrombotic_events_after_COVID-19_vaccination). The temporary halt was against the advice of the European Union's medicines regulator who said the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh any potential risks. [[100]](#cite_note-100) EMA issued a statement on 18 March 2021 stating that no association between vaccination with AstraZeneca vaccines and clot-related cases had been found, but this could not be ruled out and further investigations were being carried out.

[[105]](#cite_note-105) [[106]](#cite_note-106) In a statement the following day, the EMA confirmed the link, but continued to recommend the vaccine, saying the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks. [[107]](#cite_note-107) [[108]](#cite_note-108) Later, a Scottish vaccine efficacy study confirmed the validity of this statement, showing an 88 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization after the first dose of Vaxzevria from the fourth week onwards. [[109]](#cite_note-109) The European Medicines Agency also identified, over time, the development of the rare neurological disease [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS)](/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome) as a possible side effect of Vaxzevria. By the time of the EMA's decision in September 2021, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was unlikely to have occurred, with only 833 cases of GBS reported in 8 months following the administration of 592 million doses of the vaccine.

[[128]](#cite_note-129) Controversies[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=AstraZeneca&action=edit\u00a7ion=27)] Following 2008 Sichuan earthquake[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=AstraZeneca&action=edit\u00a7ion=28)] AstraZeneca's reputation in China was tarnished following the failure of its Chinese subsidiary to timely donate to relief efforts following the [2008 Sichuan earthquake](/wiki/2008_Sichuan_earthquake). [[129]](#cite_note-:11-130): 121 Typically, donations for disaster relief in China are made through funds established through the Chinese [Ministry of Civil Affairs](/wiki/Ministry_of_Civil_Affairs) and its subordinate organization the [Red Cross Society of China](/wiki/Red_Cross_Society_of_China). [[129]](#cite_note-:11-130): 121 AstraZeneca had a corporate rule prohibiting foreign subsidiaries from making donations to local governments and the company construed this rule as prohibiting donations for Sichuan earthquake relief efforts. [[129]](#cite_note-:11-130): 121 AstraZeneca's Chinese subsidiary received major backlash for its failure to donate. [[129]](#cite_note-:11-130): 121 While corporate approval was ultimately given for the Chinese subsidiary to donate, the approval came after long delay. [[129]](#cite_note-:11-130): 121 Seroquel[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=AstraZeneca&action=edit\u00a7ion=29)] In April 2010, AstraZeneca settled a tam](/wiki/Qui_tam) lawsuit brought by [Stefan P. Kruszewski](/wiki/Stefan_P._Kruszewski) for US$520 million to settle allegations that the company defrauded [Medicare](/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)), [Medicaid](/wiki/Medicaid), and other government-funded health care programs in connection with its marketing and promotional practices for the blockbuster atypical antipsychotic, [Seroquel](/wiki/Seroquel). According to the settlement agreement, AstraZeneca targeted its illegal marketing of the anti-psychotic Seroquel towards doctors who do not typically treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, such as physicians who treat the elderly, primary care physicians, pediatric and adolescent physicians, and in long-term care facilities and prisons. [[130]](#cite_note-131) In March 2011, AstraZeneca settled a [lawsuit](/wiki/Lawsuit) in the United States totalling US$68.5 million to be divided up to 38 states. [[131]](#cite_note-132) Nexium[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=AstraZeneca&action=edit\u00a7ion=30)] The company's most commercially successful medication is [esomeprazole](/wiki/Esomeprazole) (Nexium). The primary uses are treatment of [gastroesophageal reflux disease](/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease), treatment and maintenance of [erosive esophagitis](/wiki/Erosive_esophagitis), treatment caused by [Helicobacter of [gastric ulcers](/wiki/Gastric_ulcers) in those on chronic [NSAID](/wiki/NSAID) therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with [Crohn's disease](/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease). When it is manufactured the result is a mixture of two [mirror-imaged molecules](/wiki/Enantiomer), R and S. Two years before the omeprazole patent expired, AstraZeneca patented S-omeprazole in pure form, pointing out that since some people metabolise R-omeprazole slowly, pure S-omeprazole treatment would give higher dose efficiency and less variation between individuals. [[132]](#cite_note-133) In March 2001, the company began to market [Nexium](/wiki/Esomeprazole), as it would a brand new drug. [[133]](#cite_note-134) The (R)-enantiomer of omeprazole is metabolized exclusively by the enzyme CYP2C19, which is expressed in very low amounts by 3% of the population. Treated with a normal dose of the enantiomeric mixture, these persons will experience blood levels five-times higher than those with normal CYP2C19 production. In contrast, esomeprazole is metabolized by both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, providing less-variable drug exposure. [[134]](#cite_note-135) While omeprazole is approved only at doses of up to 20 mg for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux, [[135]](#cite_note-136) esomeprazole is approved for doses up to 40 mg. [[136]](#cite_note-137) In 2007, [Marcia Angell](/wiki/Marcia_Angell), former [editor-in-chief](/wiki/Editor_in_chief) of the [New England Journal of Medicine](/wiki/New_England_Journal_of_Medicine) and a lecturer in [social medicine](/wiki/Social_medicine) at the [Harvard Medical School](/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School), said in [Stern](/wiki/Stern_(magazine)), a German-language weekly newsmagazine, that AstraZeneca's scientists had misrepresented their research on the drug's efficiency, saying: \"Instead of using presumably comparable doses [of each drug], the company's scientists used Nexium in higher dosages. They compared 20 and 40 mg Nexium with 20 mg [Prilosec](/wiki/Prilosec). With the cards having been marked in that way, Nexium looked like an improvement - which however was only small and shown in only two of the three studies.\" [[137]](#cite_note-138) Bildman fraud, sexual harassment and faithless servant clawback[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=AstraZeneca&action=edit\u00a7ion=31)] On 4 February 1998, Astra USA sued Lars Bildman, its former president and chief executive officer, seeking US$15 million for [defrauding](/wiki/Fraud) the company. [[138]](#cite_note-139) The sum included US$2.3 million in company funds he allegedly used to fix up three of his homes, plus money the company paid as the result of the EEOC investigation. Astra's lawsuit alleged Bildman sexually harassed and intimidated employees, used company funds for [yachts](/wiki/Yacht) and prostitutes, destroyed [documents](/wiki/Document) and [records](/wiki/Business_record), and concocted: \"tales of [conspiracy](/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)) involving ex- [KGB](/wiki/KGB) [agents](/wiki/Espionage) and competitors. This was in a last-ditch effort to distract attention from the real wrongdoer, Bildman Bildman had already [pleaded guilty](/wiki/Pleaded_guilty) in Court](/wiki/US_District_Court) for failing to report more than US$1 million in income on his [tax returns](/wiki/Tax_return_(United_States)). [[139]](#cite_note-guiltyplea-140) In addition, several female co-workers filed personal sexual-harassment lawsuits against Bildman. [[140]](#cite_note-141) In April 1998, Bildman was sentenced to 21 months in prison three months after he pled guilty to filing false Federal tax returns. [[141]](#cite_note-142) [[139]](#cite_note-guiltyplea-140) In February 1998, AstraZenaca's U.S. affiliate Astra U.S.A. agreed to a $10 million settlement after an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation which started in May 1996 found that sexual harassment against female employees. [[142]](#cite_note-sexualharrasment-143) 120 former female employees of Astra were interviewed during the inquiry, with about 80 of them being identified as able to file claims. [[142]](#cite_note-sexualharrasment-143) Astra U.S.A. also issued a statement of apology for the hostile work environment. [[142]](#cite_note-sexualharrasment-143) In Astra USA v. Bildman, 914 N.E.2d 36 (Mass. 2009), applying New York's [faithless servant](/wiki/Faithless_servant) doctrine, the court held that a company's employee who had engaged in financial misdeeds and sexual harassment must \"forfeit all of his salary and bonuses for the period of disloyalty\". [[143]](#cite_note-auto6-144) The court held that this was the case even if the employee \"otherwise performed valuable services\", and that the employee was not entitled to recover restitution for the value of those other services. [[143]](#cite_note-auto6-144) [[144]](#cite_note-145) The decision attracted a good deal of attention by legal commentators. [[145]](#cite_note-auto9-146) CAF\u00c9 study[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=AstraZeneca&action=edit\u00a7ion=32)] In Markingson [committed suicide](/wiki/Death_of_Dan_Markingson) while enrolled in Bioethics [Carl Elliott](/wiki/Carl_Elliott_(philosopher)) noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state mental institution. [[146]](#cite_note-mj-147) A 2005 FDA investigation cleared the university. Nonetheless, controversy around the case has continued. A [Mother Jones](/wiki/Mother_Jones_(magazine)) article [[146]](#cite_note-mj-147) resulted in a group of university faculty members sending a public letter to the university Board of Regents urging an external investigation into Markingson's death. [[147]](#cite_note-148) Transfer mispricing[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=AstraZeneca&action=edit\u00a7ion=33)] In 2010, AstraZeneca agreed to pay \u00a3505 million to settle a UK tax dispute related to [transfer mispricing](/wiki/Transfer_mispricing). [[148]](#cite_note-149) Conflicting commitments to the UK and the EU[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=AstraZeneca&action=edit\u00a7ion=34)] In August 2020 AstraZeneca declared towards the European Commission and the EU member states: - \"13.1. AstraZeneca represents, warrants and covenants to the Commission and the Participating Member States that: [...] (e) it is not under any obligation, contractual or otherwise, to any Person or third party in respect of the Initial Europe Doses or that conflicts with or is inconsistent in any material respect with the terms of this Agreement or would impede the complete fulfilment of its obligation under this Agreement;\" [[149]](#cite_note-150) However, the UK [Secretary of State for Health and Social Care](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health_and_Social_Care), [Matt Hancock](/wiki/Matt_Hancock), declared in March 2021 that the United Kingdom had been given \"exclusivity\" and that the EU's treaty was \"inferior\". [[150]](#cite_note-151) [[151]](#cite_note-152) After placing the order for AstraZeneca's vaccine, the European Commission mistakenly assumed that it had enough vaccines and initially ordered only 200 million doses from Pfizer-BioNTech when the manufacturers offered 500 million doses to the EU in November 2020. [[152]](#cite_note-153) However, the contract that AstraZeneca reached with the UK was very similar to that it reached with the EU, and it also contained the phrase \"best reasonable efforts\"; the UK contract was signed on 28 August 2020, a day after the contract with the EU. [[153]](#cite_note-154) The key difference seems to be that AstraZeneca entered into a preliminary agreement with the U.K. back in May 2020 which arranged for \"the development of a dedicated supply chain for the U.K.\" [[154]](#cite_note-155) The failure to produce the vaccine in the anticipated quantities contributed to the low vaccination rates of vulnerable populations of the European Union at the beginning of the outbreak of more virulent variants of [SARS-CoV-2](/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2) in early 2021. [[155]](#cite_note-156) China comments[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=AstraZeneca&action=edit\u00a7ion=35)] In May 2023, AstraZeneca's China president said that the company aims to be a \"patriotic\" company in China that Report (Form 20-F)\"](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000901832/000110465923023818/azn-20221231x20f.htm).
