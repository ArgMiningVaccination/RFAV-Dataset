{"title": "Natural Capital Coalition", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2022-01-31", "cleaned_text": "of the Natural Capital Coalition, a global multi stakeholder open source platform to support the development of methods for natural capital valuation in business. Its aim is to achieve a shift in corporate behaviour to preserve and enhance, rather than deplete the earth's natural capital. CDSB was also part of the WBCSD-led Project Coordination Group developing the Natural Capital Protocol. The Project Coordination Group brought together all the consortium members to discuss progress and issues as they arose. The [Natural Capital Protocol](http://www.naturalcapitalcoalition.org/projects/the-natural-capital-protocol.html) enables companies to integrate their relationship with nature into strategic and operational decision-making, developing internal processes and management actions. It does this by harmonising the many different natural capital approaches, directing businesses towards the methods that they need in order to generate credible and actionable information related to natural capital impacts and dependencies. The Protocol is an internally focused tool helping business prepare for future reporting and disclosure. It does not provide guidance on external reporting or disclosure. The [CDSB Framework](../what-we-do/reporting-frameworks/environmental-information-natural-capital.html) for reporting climate change and environmental information is an externally focussed tool to help companies provide clear, concise and consistent information to investors, by considering the characteristics and requirements of the information they present, and connecting an organisation's environmental performance to its overall strategy, performance and prospects. The Framework does not cover operational decision-making, internal processes, or offer guidance on management's actions; it is a tool to help companies report on these. By helping business measure and value their impacts and dependencies, providing rigorous, reliable, context specific information, the Natural Capital Protocol and the CDSB Framework support and enhance opportunities for business to report decision-useful, actionable information to capital markets. These actions can revolutionise decision making to foster more resilient capital markets, realise sustainable development goals and promote the sustainable use of natural capital.
