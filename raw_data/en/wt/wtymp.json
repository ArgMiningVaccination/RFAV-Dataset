By following the diet requirements the participants are more easily able to purify the physical body, stimulating their innate ability to self-heal. Adhering to the diet shows one's respect to the medicine and will allow one to go deeper into their journey with the plant spirit. The 'Icaros', medicine songs, sung by the shamans will also be able to be more fully integrated into the body and spirit of the participant. Although the strictness of the dieta may vary according to different lineages of shamanism, it is best to maintain the basic diet requirements to ensure one's health and effective journeys with Ayahuasca. We strongly recommend that our participants begin to adjust their diets at least two weeks prior to the retreat. Yet, the more time given to following the diet guidelines will cleanse and prepare the body further, enabling a deeper and more profound experience with Ayahuasca. - Definitely eliminate all pork and red meat two weeks prior. Fish and chicken are ok, preferably organic. - Definitely no alcohol two weeks before or after the retreat, yet the more time the better as it will allow your body to detox further. - Definitely no recreational drugs for at least 4 weeks before and after the retreat - if not adhered to, one may run the risk of psychological or energetic damage. - Cut back heavily or best eliminate highly salted & fried foods, caffeine, fermented foods and beverages, refined sugars, gluten and dairy two weeks before and after the retreat. Consuming healthy salt (ex: pink Himalayan salt) is good to keep in the diet. - It is fine to keep healthy oils and fats in your diet such as avocado, nuts, seeds, coconut oil, flax oil, virgin olive oil, etc. - We recommend eliminating recreational cannabis for 2-3 weeks before and after the retreat to make energetic space for Ayahuasca to work with you. - No sexual activity of any kind one week before and after the retreat. - Avoid reading or watching anything with trauma or violence. - We encourage you to take advantage of the time leading up to the retreat to delve deeper into the preparation of this journey by engaging in any/all of the following: meditation, exercise, yoga, writing, intention setting, being out in nature, inspirational reading, expression through art, organic vegetable juicing, cleansing/detoxing, water fasting, etc. - Some medications have contraindications with Ayahuasca, especially antidepressants and blood pressure medications. Please fully disclose any medications being taken in our intake form. We will give specific protocols to come off the medications safely or help assist with other options of healing if these medications cannot be eliminated.
