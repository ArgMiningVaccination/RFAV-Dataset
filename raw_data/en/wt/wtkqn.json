The Non-U.S. Merck Be nefit Plan shall reta in all Assets and L iabilities related to Merck Retained Employees, Former Employees and Post-Distr ibution Organon Employees (subject to Section 4.01(c)). Except as othe rwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties, assets will be allocated between the plan s based on the proportion of Li abilities borne by each pla n.

The period of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Committee , provided that the period for all Stock Options shall not exceed ten years from the grant, provided further, however, that , (i) in the event of the death of an Optionee prior to the expiration of a Nonqualified Option, such Nonqualified Option may, if the Committee so determines, be exercisable for up to 11 years from the date of the grant, (ii) the Committ ee may provide in a grant agreement that the term of any Stock Option shall be exte nded during any period that such Stock Opti on may not be exercised under any applicable law or during an applicable blackout period, and (i ii) an ISO granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder will no t be exercisable after the e xpiration of five years from the date of grant. The Com mittee may, subsequent to the granting of any Stock Opti on, extend the term thereof, but in no event shall the extended term exceed ten yea rs from the original grant date (11 in case of a grantee's death). (c) Exercise of Stock Option and Payment Therefore. No shares shall be issued until full paym ent of the option price has been made. The option price may be paid in cash or, if th e Committee determines, in shares of Comm on Stock (by tendering previously acquired S hares, either actually or by attestati on, or by the Company withholding sh ares otherwise issuable in conne ction with the exercise of t he Option), a combination of cash and shares of Common St ock, or through a cashless exer cise procedure that allows grantees to sell immediate ly some or all of the shares underlying the exercised portion of the Opti on in order to generate sufficient cash to pay the option pric e. If the Committee approves the use of shares of Co mmon Stock as a payment method, the Committe e shall establish such conditions as it d eems appropriate for the use of Common Stock to exercise a Stock Opti on. Stock Options awarded under th e Plan shall be exercised thr ough such procedure or program as the Committe e may establish or define from time to ti me, which may include a designated broker tha t must be used in exercising such Stock Options. (d) First Exercisable Date. The Committee shall determine how and when shares covered by a Stock Opti on may be purchased. The Committee may establish waiting periods, the dates on which Stock Options become exercisable or non-forfeitable and, subject to paragraph (b) of this section, exercise periods. The Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any Stock Option or portion thereof. (e) Termination of Employment. Unless determined otherwise by the Committee, upon the terminati on of a Stock Option grantee's employment (for any reason other th an gross misconduct), Stock Option privileges shall be limited to the shares that were immed iately exercisable at the date of such termination. The Committee, how ever, in its discretion, may provi de that any Stock Options outs tanding but not yet exercisable upon the termination of a Stock Option grantee's employment may beco me exercisable in accordance with a sch edule determined by the Committee. Such Stock Op tion privileges shall expire unless exercised within such period of time after the da te of termination of employment as may be established by the Comm ittee, but in no event later than th e expiration date of the Stock O ption. 9 (f) Termination Due to Misconduct. If a Stock Option grantee's employment is terminat ed for gross misconduct, as determined by the Company, all rights under the St ock Option shall expire upon the date of such termination. (g) Limits on ISOs. Except as may otherwise be permitted by the Code, an Eligible Employee may not re ceive a grant of ISOs for stock that would have an aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of $100,000 (or such other amount as the Internal Reve nue Service may decid e from time to time), determined as of the time that the ISO is grante d, that would be exercisable fo r the first time by such person d uring any calendar year. If any grant is made in exce ss of the limits provided in the Code, su ch grant shall automatically become a Nonqu alified Option. In addition, ISOs may onl y be granted to Employees of th e Company and its subsidiaries. (h) Dividends. Anything in the Plan to the contrary not withstanding, no dividends or dividend eq uivalents may be pa id on Stock Options. 9. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS The Committee may, in its discre tion, grant a Stock Appreciation Right either singly or in comb ination with an underlying Stock Option granted hereunder. Such Stock Appreciation Right sh all be subject to the following terms and conditions and such ot her terms and condit ions as the Committee may prescribe: (a) Time and Period of Grant. If a Stock Appreciation Right is grante d as a Tandem SAR, it may be grante d at the time of the Stock Option grant or at any time thereafter but prior to the expiration of the Stock Option grant. At the time the Tandem SAR is granted th e Committee may limit the exercise period for such Stock Appreciation Right, before and afte r which period no Stock Appreciation Right shal l attach to the underlying Stock Option. In no event shal l the exercise period for a Tandem SAR exceed the exerci se period for such Stock O ption. If a Stock Appreciation Right is granted as a Stand Alone SAR the period for exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right shall be set by the Committee. The maximum term of a Stand Al one SAR shall not exceed ten years from the grant, provided furthe r, however, that, in the event of the death of the grantee prior to the expiration of such Stand Alone SAR, su ch Stand Alone SAR may, if the Committee s o determines, be exercisable for up to eleven years from the date of the grant and the Committee may provide in a grant agreement that the term of any Stock Option shall be extende d during any period that such Stock Option ma y not be exercised unde r any applicable l aw or during an applicable blackout period. (b) Value of Stock Appr eciation Right. The grantee of a Tandem SAR will be entitled to surrender the Stock Option which is then exercisable and receive in exchange theref ore an amount equal to the excess of the Fa ir Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the election to surrender is received by the Company in accordan ce with exercise procedures es tablished by the Company over the Stock Option price (the \" Spread \") multiplied by the number of shares covered by the St ock Option which is surrendere d. The grantee of a Stand Alone SAR will receive upon ex ercise of the Stock Appreciation Right an amount equal to the excess of the 10 Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the election to surrender such Sta nd Alone SAR is received by the Company in accordance with exercise procedures esta blished by the Company over the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of gr ant multiplied by the portion being exercised of the number of shares covered by the grant of the Stand Alone SAR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in its sole discretion the Committ ee at the time it grants a Stock Apprecia tion Right may provide that the Spread co vered by such Stock Appreciation Right ma y not exceed a specified amount. (c) Payment of Stock Ap preciation Right. Payment of a Stock Appreciation Ri ght shall be in the form of shares of Common Stock, cash or any combination of shares and cash. The fo rm of payment upon exercise of such a right shall be determined by the Committee eith er at the time of grant of the Stock Apprecia tion Right or at the time of exerci se of the Stock Appreciation Right. (d) Dividends. Anything in the Plan to the contrary not withstanding, no dividends or dividend equi valents may be paid on Stock Appreciation Rights. (e) Termination of Employment. Unless determined otherwise by the Committee, upon the terminati on of a Stock Appreciation Right grantee's employment (for any reason other than gross misconduct), Stock Appreciation Right privileges shall be limited to the shares that were immediately exercisable at the date of such termination. The Committee, however, in its discretion, ma y provide that any S tand Alone Stock Appreciation Right out standing but not yet exercisable upon the termina tion of a Stock Appreciation Right grantee's employment may become exercisable in accordance with a schedule determined by the Committee. Such privileges sh all expire unles s exercised within such period of time afte r the date of termination of employment as may be established by the Committee, but in no event later than the expiration date of the Stock Appreciation Right. (f) Termination Due to Misconduct. If a Stock Appreciation Right grante e's employment is terminated for gross misconduct, as determined by the Company, all rights under the St ock Appreciation Right shall expire upon the date of such termination. 10.

The Committee, in its discretion, may elect to make payment in shares of Common Stock, cash or a combination of shares and cash. An y cash payment of an award measured relative to Co mmon Stock shall be based on th e Fair Market Value of shar es of Common Stock on, or as soon as practicable prior to, the date of payment.

Except as otherwise pr ovided in the grant agreement evidencing th e Incentive, a grantee of a Performance Award must remain in the employ of the Co mpany, its subsidiary, affiliate or joint venture until the completion of the Award Pe riod in order to be entitled to paymen t under the Performance Award; provi ded that the Committee may, in its discretion, provide for a full or partial payment where such an exception is deemed equitable. (e) Dividends. The Committee may, in its discretion, at the time of the Perform ance Award grant, determine if any dividends declared on the Common Stock during the Award Period which woul d have been paid with respect to Perfo rmance Shares had they been owned by a grantee or dividend equivalents be either (i ) accumulated for the benefit of the grant ee and used to increase the number of Per formance Shares of the grantee, or paid as cash, at the end of the Award Period or (ii) not paid or ac cumulated. Notwithstanding anythin g to the contrary, such dividends or di vidend equivalents shall only be payable following the end of the Performance Period to the exten t that the Performance Shares have been earned. 11. RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS The Committee may grant Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units to an Eligible Employee, which shall be subject to the follo wing terms and conditions and such other terms and condi tions as the Committee may prescribe (\" Restricted Stock Grants \").

The Commi ttee may, in its discre tion, also provide for such complete or partial exceptions to the em ployment restriction as it deems equitable. (b) Restrictions on Transfer and Legend on Stock Certificates. During the Restricted Period, the gran tee may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock Grant, including but not limi ted to any shares of Common Stock. Any certifi cate for shares of Common Stock issued hereunder sh all contain a legend giving appropriate notic e of the restrictions in the grant. (c) Escrow Agreement. The Committee may require the grantee to enter into an escrow agreement providi ng that any certificates representing the Restricted Stock Grant will remain in the physical custody of an escr ow holder until all re strictions are remo ved or expire. (d) Lapse of Restrictions. All restrictions imposed under the Restri cted Stock Grant shall lapse upon the e xpiration of the Restricted Period if the conditions as to employment set forth a bove have been met. The grantee shall then be entitled to have the legend removed fr om any certificates for Restricted Stock. Restricted Stock Units may be paid in the form of shares of Common Stock, cash or any combin ation of shares and cash as determined by the Committee. The Committee may establish rules and procedures to permit a grantee to defer recognition of income upon the expira tion of the Restricted Period. (e) Dividends.

Notwithstanding the f oregoing, without consent of affected grantees, Incentives may be amended, revised or revoked when ne cessary to avoid pena lties under Section 409 A of the Code, to ensure compliance with the listing require ments any national secu rities exchange or association on which the Common Stock is th en listed, or as may be required or appropriate to comply with ch anges in applicable laws and regulations.

In accordance with any applicable administrative guideli nes it establishes, the Committee may allow an Eligible Employee to pay the amount of taxes required by law to be withheld from an Incentive by withhol ding from any payment of Common Stock due as a result of such Incentive, or by permitting the Eligib le Employee to deliver to the Company, sh ares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Committee, equal to the amount of su ch required or pe rmitted withholding taxes. 19.

To the extent that compliance with any Plan provision a pplicable solely to the Section 16 Officers is not required in order to bring a transa ction by such Section 16 Officer into complia nce with Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed null and void as to such transaction, to the extent perm itted by law and deemed advisabl e by the Committee and its delege es. To the extent any provision of the Plan or action by the Plan administrators involving such Section 16 Officers is deemed not to comp ly with an applicable condition of Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed null and void as to such Section 16 Officers, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Plan administrators. 15 20. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 409A OF THE CODE To the extent applicable, to the extent an Incentive is grante d to an Eligible Employee subjec t to the Code, it is intended tha t such Incentive be exempt from Section 409A of the Code or be structured in a manner that would not cause the Eligible Empl oyee to be subject to taxes an d interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan (a nd unless the award document specifically prov ides otherwise), if an Eligible Employee holding an Incent ive that constitutes \"deferred compensation\" under Section 409A of the Code is a \"specified employee\" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and the Eligible Employee is otherwise s ubject to Section 409A of the Code, no distributio n or payment of any amount that is due because of a \"separati on from service\" (as defined in Section 409A of the Code wit hout regard to alternative definitions thereunder) will be issued or paid before the date th at is six months following the date of such Eligible Employee's \"separation from servi ce\" or, if earlier, the date of the Eligible Employee's death, unless such distribution or payment can be made in a manner that complies with Section 409A o f the Code, and any amounts so deferred will be paid in a lump sum on the day after su ch six month period elapses, w ith the balance paid thereafter on the original schedule. 21. USE OF PROCEEDS Any proceeds received by the Company under th e Plan shall be added to the general funds of the Company and shall be used for su ch corporate purposes as the Board of Directors shall direct. 22. GOVERNING LAW The Plan, and all agreements hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by th e laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable grant agreement, the State and Federal cou rts located in the State of Delaware shall have exclus ive jurisdiction for any action brought under the Plan or pursuant to any Incentive. 23. REGISTRATION AND APPROVALS The obligation of the Company to sell or de liver shares of Common Stock with respect to Incentives granted under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regul ations, including all applicable federal and state securities la ws, and the obtaining of all su ch approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed necessary or a ppropriate by the Committee. Each Incentive is subject to the requirement that, if at a ny time the Committee determines, in its discretion, that the li sting, registration or qualific ation of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to t he Plan is required by any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental re gulatory body is necess ary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the grant of an Incentive or the issuance of shares of Co mmon Stock, no Incentives shall b e granted or payment made or shares of Common Stock issued, in whole or in part, unless listing, regist ration, qualification, consent or approval ha s been effected or obtained free of any conditions as acceptable to the Committee. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Pl an, the terms and conditions related to the Incentive, or any other agreement to the contrary, in the event that the disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Pl an is not covered by a then current registration statement under the Securities Act, a nd is not otherwise exempt from su ch registration, such shares o f Common Stock shall be restricted against transfer to the extent requi red by the Securities Act and Rule 144 or other 16 regulations thereunder. The Comm ittee may require any individual receiving shares of Common Stoc k pursuant to an Incentive gran ted under the Plan, as a condition precedent to receipt of such shares of Common Stock, to represent and wa rrant to the Company in writing that the shares of Common Stock acquired by such individual ar e acquired without a view to a ny distribution thereof and will not be sold or transferred o ther than pursuant to an effective registration thereof under said Act or pursuant to an exemption applicable under the S ecurities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The certificates evidencing any of such shares of Common Stock sha ll be appropriately amende d or have an appropriat e legend placed thereon to reflect their status as restricted securities as aforesaid. 24. OFFSET AND SUSPENSION OF EXERCISE Anything to the contrary in the Plan notwi thstanding, the Plan admini strators may (i) offset a ny Incentive by amounts reasonabl y believed to be owed to the Company by the grantee and (ii) disallow an Incentive to be exercised or otherwis e payable during a time when the Company i s investigating reasonably reliable alle gations of gross misc onduct by the grantee. 25. EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL The following provisions will apply to Incentives in the event of a Change in Control unless ot herwise provided in the grant ag reement evidencing the Incentive or any other written agreement be tween the Company or any affiliate and the Eligible Employee or unless otherwise exp ressly provided by the Committee at the time of grant of an Incentive. In the event of a Change in Control, then, notwithstanding a ny other provision of this Plan, the Committee will take one or more of the fo llowing actions with respect to each outstanding Incentive, contingent upon the closin g or completion of the Change in Control: (a) arrange for the surviving corporation or acquiring corporation (or the surviving or acquiring corporation's parent company) to assume or continue the Incentive or to s ubstitute a similar award for the In centive (including, but not limi ted to, an award to acquire t he same consideration per share paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Change in Control); (b) accelerate the vesting, in whole or in part, of the Incentive (and, if applicable, the time at which the Incentive may be ex ercised) to a date prior to the effective time of such Change in Control as the Co mmittee determines, with such Incentive terminating if not exerc ised (if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Change in C ontrol, and with such exercise reversed if the Change in Contro l does not become effective; (c) cancel or arrange for the canc ellation of the Incentive, to the extent not vested or not exer cised prior to the effective ti me of the Change in Control, in exchange for such cash consid eration, if any, as the Committee, in its reasonable determination, may consider appro priate as an approximation of the value of the canceled Incentive, taking into account the value of the Common Stock subject to the canceled Incentive, the possibility that the Incentiv e might not otherwise vest in full, and su ch other factors as the Committee deems r elevant; and 17 (d) cancel or arrange for the canc ellation of the Incentive, to the extent not vested or not exer cised prior to the effective ti me of the Change in Control, in exchange for a paymen t, in such form as may be dete rmined by the Committee equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the value in the Change in Control of the property the Eligible Employee would have received upon the exercise of the Incentive immediately prior to the effective time of the Change in Contro l, over (B) any exercise price payable by su ch holder in connection with such exercis e The Committee need not take the same action or actions with respect to all Incentives or portions thereof or with respect to al l Participants. The Committee may take different actions with respect to the vested and unvested portions of an Incentive. In the absence of any affirmativ e determination by the Committee at the time of a Change in Control, each outstanding Incentive will be assumed or an equivalent award will be substituted by such successor cor poration or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporatio n (the \" Successor Corporation \"), unless the Successor Corporation does not agree to assume the In centive or to substitute an e quivalent award, in which case the vesting of such Incentive will accelerate in its entiret y (along with, if applicable, the tim e at which the Incentive may be ex ercised) to a date prior to the effective time of such Change in Control as the Committe e determines, with such Incentiv e terminating if not exercised ( if applicable) at or prior to the effective time of the Change in Control, and with such exercise reversed if the Ch ange in Control does not become effective. An Incentive may be subject to additional acceleration of vesting and ex ercisability upon or after a Change in Control as may b e provided in the grant agreement evidencing the Incentive or as may be provided in any other written agreement be tween the Company or any affili ate and the Eligible Employee, but in the absence of such provision, no such acce leration will occur. 26. CLAWBACK, RECOUPMENT The Committee may specify in a grant agreement evidencing an Incen tive that the Eligible Employe e's right, payment and benefits with respect to an Incentive shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, clawback or re coupment upon the occurrence of certain specif ied events or as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consum er Protection Act or other a pplicable law, in addition to any otherwise applicable forfeiture provisions that apply to the Incentive. Without limi ting the generality of the foregoing, any In centive under the Plan shall be subject to the terms of any clawback policy maintained by the Company or as required by law, as it may be amended from time to time. 18 Exhibit 10.15 October 14, 2020 Kevin Ali 2000 Galloping Hill Road Kenilworth, NJ 07033 U.S.A.

Company Overview Organon is a science-based global pharmaceutical company that develops and delivers innovative health solutions through a portfolio of prescription therapies within women's health, biosimilars and established brands.No other large global pharmaceutical company has women's health as its primary therapeutic area of focus. Ourwomen's health portfolio has historically delivered strong revenues, underpinned by our contraceptives products,which include Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, our patented long-acting reversible contraceptive, with its salesgrowing at an 11% CAGR between 2010 and 2020. Our biosimilars portfolio has delivered more than$650 million in sales since 2017, and we expect growth will be fueled by planned launches in the United Statesand Europe. Finally, our established brands portfolio continues to generate strong operating profit across manymarkets, including the United States, China, Japan, Korea and countries in Europe, despite loss of marketexclusivity across a majority of brands. For many of our products, the impacts of loss of patent exclusivity eventsin the United States and Europe have passed, and, as a result, combined with enhanced management focus, anestablished supply chain and targeted resourcing, we believe that our portfolio will continue to deliver strong,reliable operating profit at low promotional and development expense requirements. See \"Business\u2014Products\"for more information on loss of patent exclusivity for our key products. Our mission is to be the world's leading women's health company and deliver a better and healthier every day for every woman. We plan to build on our strengths in reproductive health to assemble an array of healthsolutions to serve women from adolescence to menopause and beyond. We are focused on generating strong andgrowing cash flow by selectively investing in development and inorganic opportunities to drive innovation andfuture growth across our core areas. Our portfolio of diverse and branded products is supported bycommercialization and market access, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and clinical development expertiseglobally. Our global footprint lends scale to our business by enabling management to identify and focus onunique market opportunities across our broad portfolio. Our women's health, biosimilars and established brands portfolios, together with the expertise and experience of our employees, enable us to pursue an exciting innovation agenda, carving out a unique position inthe health care sector. Our product portfolio is unified by a central focus on patient needs addressed by our 7therapies, a commitment to driving organic and inorganic growth, a heritage of successful commercialization and clinical development, and a disciplined approach to cost and operational efficiency. We believe our women'shealth portfolio, in combination with our biosimilars and established brands portfolios, will enable us to delivervalue to patients and the health care system while creating value for our shareholders. We also believe ourgeographic scale, long heritage and sustained successes within women's health will enable us to become thecommercialization and distribution partner of choice for smaller women's health companies. Our globalcommercial capabilities and market access, established relationships with health care providers, patients andpayors and clinical expertise support our long-term strategy to launch therapies and recognize developmentopportunities within and beyond our existing portfolios. Our business strategy is focused on advancing our mission to be the world's leading women's health company, pursuing growth in biosimilars and maximizing opportunities from our established brands portfolio. Inparticular: We believe there is significant growth potential in women's health broadly. In addition to our ten marketed products, we intend to focus our growth efforts in two areas, on needs and conditions thatuniquely impact women, generally referred to as the core women's health market, and on needs andconditions that disproportionately impact women. We estimate that the combined global market forpharmaceuticals in the core women's health market, which includes therapeutic areas such ascontraception and fertility, endometriosis and uterine fibroids, was $33 billion in 2020. We project thatthe core women's health market will grow to $40 billion by 2026. In addition, we estimate that thesegment of therapeutic areas that disproportionately impact women, such as osteoporosis, lupus,urinary tract infections, migraines and celiac disease, will grow annually at an approximately 10%CAGR from 2020 to 2026, adding a further $21 billion to the core women's health market sizeestimates. Our existing biosimilars portfolio positions us for success in this attractive and fast growing area of health care. We estimate the total size of the global market for biosimilars was approximately$17.3 billion as of September 2020, reflecting 60 biosimilars approved in the European Union (\"EU\")and 29 approved in the United States. Industry publications estimate that 54 major biologics, with anaggregate market value of approximately $220 billion, will lose patent protection in the next decade,which has potential to expand the biosimilars global market to over $30 billion in the next decade or so.We do not have biosimilars corresponding to all biologics that will lose patent protection in the nextdecade. All five biosimilars in our portfolio have launched in certain countries globally, including twobiosimilars in the United States. We intend to expand our biosimilars portfolio throughcommercialization of additional products and expanded marketing of existing products. We believe oursize, capabilities and experience position us competitively in this area. Our established brands portfolio consists of 49 products covering cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatology and non-opioid pain management. A number of our established brands that face genericcompetition still contribute meaningful profitability. We intend to stimulate the performance of ourestablished brands products through renewed focus and attention on strategic marketing to create asignificant source of capital to fuel the company's growth aspirations. We believe our establishedbrands products will, over time, continue to deliver meaningful revenue and operating profit that can beredirected into organic and inorganic growth opportunities in key product areas and geographies. Ourestablished brands portfolio is supported by our large commercial and manufacturing capabilities,including a global network that enables us to distribute products to patients in more than 140 countriesand territories. 8Key Products Women's Health Biosimilars Established Brands In 2020, the Organon Products segment recorded revenue of $6.5 billion and generated $2.3 billion of net income. We expect to be well positioned for low to mid-single digit annual revenue growth off of a 2021 baseyear. We operate on a global scale and our global network enables us to distribute products to patients in morethan 140 countries and territories around the world, with approximately 80% of 2020 Organon Products segmentrevenue, or $5.1 billion, generated outside the United States. Upon the separation, we will have approximately9,950 employees worldwide, with approximately 4,030 employees focusing on sales, marketing and keycommercialization activities and approximately 730 employees focusing on clinical development, safety, andmedical affairs and product registration. Additionally, we expect to operate six manufacturing sites globally andhave approximately 3,020 manufacturing employees. Our operations are principally managed on a products basis and include two operating segments, the Organon Products segment and the Merck Retained Products segment. We consider the Organon Productssegment to be our only business going forward, and, as such, all discussion and financial information presentedin this section relates only to the Organon Products segment. Upon separation, Merck will retain operations of the Merck Retained Products segment, and we will no longer present financial information related to this segment in our financial statements. See \"Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Organon is a Delaware corporation incorporated on March 11, 2020. Our corporate offices are located at 30 Hudson Street, 33rd Floor, Jersey City, New Jersey 07302. 9Strengths We have a number of advantages that distinguish us from our competitors and support our strategy: Leading portfolio of health solutions for women .We intend to be the world's leading women's health company, with a long history of innovative, first-to-market contraceptive products. We have a broadoffering of contraception and fertility brands that we believe have long-term growth potential, and weare one of only two global contraception manufacturers operating in the highly fragmentedcontraception market. Our portfolio of ten products includes Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, globally oneof the highest revenue-generating long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARC, a class ofcontraceptives recognized as the most effective method of hormonal contraception available to patientswith a lower long-term average cost. Our management team has the development and commercialexpertise to drive innovation in therapeutics and drug-device combinations across the women's healthlandscape through opportunities related to our existing portfolio and by externally sourcing therapiesthrough in-licensing, acquisition and other business development transactions with innovators seekingto benefit from our global commercial presence in women's health. Growing position in biosimilars. We have a growing position in biosimilars. We have strong, global commercialization capabilities, with a portfolio spanning oncology and immunology treatments, twoareas primed for significant growth in biosimilars. We plan to continue evaluating opportunities inother potential therapeutic areas, including ophthalmology, diabetes and neuroscience. Our oncologybiosimilars have been launched in 20 countries and our immunology biosimilars have been launched infive countries. All five biosimilars in our portfolio have launched in certain countries globally,including two biosimilars in the United States. We expect that our biosimilars business will continue togenerate growth in the near term. Market Leading Established Brands. In established brands, we have a broad and robust portfolio of mature brands generally beyond market exclusivity, including leading brands in cardiovascular,respiratory, dermatology and non-opioid pain management. Our established brands portfolio generatesstrong operating profit, which we anticipate will continue to fund our future growth. We have provendevelopment, regulatory, manufacturing and commercial capabilities, which we believe will supportgrowth in targeted existing geographies, new geographies, and through new indications and lineextensions. Broad and fit-for-purpose capabilities .We have enterprise capabilities delivered by seasoned leaders in global commercialization and market access, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and clinicaldevelopment. In particular, our capabilities include: Global commercialization expertise : Our experienced team will execute targeted investment in, and successful commercialization of, organic growth opportunities across our global portfolio.These efforts will be supported by data-driven, science-based decision-making and execution atscale, enabled by data and analytics and by digital engagement of health care providers andpatients. Development capabilities: We have approximately 730 employees focused on clinical development, safety, medical affairs and product registration. Our employees have deep expertisein these areas that we believe will facilitate generation of robust clinical data capable of enablingrapid global product registration, as well as valuable insights to expand the commercial reach ofour portfolio. Digital and omni-channel marketing capabilities : We market our products using a digital and omni-channel approach, reaching a broad base of market participants, including health careproviders, patients and policy makers and payors in a cost-efficient manner. Our health care 10provider, patient and payor-focused relationship management is facilitated by an integrated digital ecosystem that coordinates health care provider and patient engagement across many channels,including face-to-face, email, social media, mobile and websites. Strategic alliances : We have an extensive track record of managing strategic alliances and creating value through global partnerships to guide investment and growth in inorganic pipelineopportunities. For example, our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. (\"SamsungBioepis\") allows us to work together with a biopharmaceutical company that complements ourcapabilities and strengths. Established manufacturing and supply chain : Beyond our commercial capabilities, we expect to have approximately 440 employees operating in supply chain management, which we believe,together with our manufacturing capabilities, will enable us to maintain a high-quality, reliableglobal supply chain. See \"Business\u2014Manufacturing Capabilities and Global Supply Chain.\" Geographic scale and platform . In 2020, we generated $5.1 billion in sales outside the United States, representing approximately 80% of our total Organon Products segment sales. Our footprint spans theglobe with a direct presence in 58 countries and the ability to deliver therapies to patients in more than140 countries and territories. We plan to initially focus on 14 key markets, which currently generateapproximately 75% of our global sales, and we expect our broader geographic reach and manufacturingcapabilities to drive long-term growth and expansion opportunities. Specifically, in women's healthand biosimilars, we believe our global footprint will enable us to expand the market for our currentproducts in order to meet the increasing demand for these products. We also believe our geographicscale, long heritage and sustained successes within women's health will enable us to become thecommercialization and distribution partner of choice for smaller women's health companies. Inestablished brands, where opportunities vary significantly depending on the exact dynamics andcharacteristics of each country, we believe our geographic scale enables us to capitalize on globalopportunities and increase brand share by responding to these dynamics. Strong financial profile with significant free cash flow generation and improving operating leverage . In 2020, the Organon Products segment generated approximately $2.3 billion in operating cash flowand spent $255 million on capital expenditures. The Organon Products segment also generatedAdjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion on $6.5 billion of sales, representing an EBITDA margin ofapproximately 47%. We expect that 2021 operating cash flow from the Organon Products Segment willbe comparable to, though slightly down from, 2020 before the impact of estimated interest expense.We anticipate we will continue to generate significant cash flow and expect our operating leverage toimprove in the future. Scientific heritage, expertise and culture of excellence inherited from Merck . Merck's rich, over-125-year scientific heritage is imbued in our strong scientific principles, innovative developmentstrategies and quality-focused culture. Building on our heritage of regulatory and scientific expertise,we expect to have the capabilities to continue to optimize pathways for clinical development andregulatory approvals. We also expect to have the data generation capabilities required to supportpatient access, formulary placement and reimbursement. Strong, leading and established brand in the area of women's health. The Organon brand has a long history in the area of women's health, both with patients and health care providers, and with employeeswho initially came to Merck through the acquisition of Organon. Our proud heritage in women's healthbegan with Organon's launch of one of the first-ever combined hormonal oral contraceptives, Lyndiol,in 1962. This was followed by an impressive series of innovative firsts, including: the launch of Marvelon in 1981, the first lower dose (30mcg) estrogen combined oral contraceptive with a selective progestin, the launch of Livial in 1987, the first non-estrogen gonadomimetic hormonal replacement treatment, 11 the launch of Follistim / Puregon (\"Follistim\"), the first recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone available in the United States for infertility, the launch of NuvaRing in 2001, the first once-a-month contraceptive ring, and the launch of Nexplanon / Implanon NXT in 2011, the first and only single-rod radiopaque contraceptive implant with preloaded applicator. Experienced management team and Board with track record of successful performance. Our executive management team has a strong track record of leadership, performance and execution in thepharmaceutical industry. Together, they bring a diverse set of leadership experience at respectedcompanies both within and beyond the biopharmaceutical industry. Our CEO and a majority of ourexecutive leadership team have been appointed from within Merck where they each establishedreputations as global leaders. Our management team is supported by a seasoned Board of Directorsproviding guidance and strategic vision based on a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. Theextensive company and industry experience of our management team as well as our Board of Directorswill serve as a source of strength and innovation to guide us into the future. Strategies Our strategy is to be the world's leading women's health company by leveraging our historical strength in this area and investing in therapies and innovations that support the medical needs of women, to pursue growth inbiosimilars and to maximize opportunities from our established brands, all while reinvesting our strong operatingcash flow to fund growth initiatives across our portfolio. We believe our portfolio will benefit from the increasedinvestment and attention we can provide as an independent company. Our focus will be to: Leverage our existing position in women's health to become the global leader in this space .No other large global pharmaceutical company has women's health as its primary therapeutic area of focus. Weintend to be the world's leading women's health company to address the needs and conditions thatuniquely and disproportionately impact women. We plan to achieve this by leveraging our scale, deepexperience, geographic reach, strong relationships with payors, health care providers, large clinics andimportant stakeholder groups such as societies, patients and scientific leaders to grow revenue for ourcontraception and fertility brands and expand into additional women's health therapeutic areas, andthrough strategic acquisitions and collaborations. In 2020, approximately one quarter of our revenuewas derived from women's health products and, over time, we expect to grow this share by: expanding the marketing and distribution of our key brands, including Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, Follistim and Elonva, investing in manufacturing to expand the supply capacity for Nexplanon / Implanon NXT and our fertility product portfolio, focusing our contraception commercial strategy on expanding global access to Nexplanon / Implanon NXT and increasing communication and education about LARC, which we believe willexpand the market opportunity for Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, focusing our fertility commercial strategy on increasing communication and education about antagonist protocols, which we believe will expand the market opportunity for both Follistim andElonva, applying our long history of women's health scientific development experience to invest in late lifecycle activities that will broaden the geographic footprint of our women's health portfolio andfurther enhance the value of the portfolio, and 12 tracking scientific innovation globally to source commercialized and development-stage inorganic opportunities across women's health broadly in order to develop products that target specificunmet medical need in conditions that impact women both uniquely and disproportionately. Maximize value from our biosimilars portfolio through increased focus and strategic investment .We believe that the biosimilars market offers potential for value creation for a company with our strengths.In the short term, we are focused on commercializing the five biosimilars sourced from ourcollaboration with Samsung Bioepis, including the recent EU launch of Aybintio in oncology. In thelonger term, we expect to focus on expanding our portfolio through ongoing identification andevaluation of new opportunities in therapeutic areas such as oncology, immunology, ophthalmology,diabetes and neuroscience, both through our Samsung Bioepis collaboration and through other potentialcollaborations. We believe that our focused approach enables us to further capitalize on the momentumin the biosimilars industry to drive growth through commercialization of additional biosimilars andexpansion of our existing products into additional countries. In addition, we believe the biosimilarsmarket will continue to favorably mature through continued policy efforts, both in the United Statesand globally, that recognize the important role biosimilars can play in alleviating cost pressures forhealth care systems. In addition, we believe our commercial experience, particularly in the areas oftendering and policy, obtained from our prior biosimilars launches (Renflexis in the United States andOntruzant in the United States and the EU) provides us a competitive advantage in the market. Drive near-term growth through investment in our existing portfolio. We believe that our broad portfolio affords us a range of options to drive future growth by developing products that target specificunmet medical need, including in-licenses, commercial collaborations, partnerships and acquisitionsconsistent with our focused strategy. For example, our established brands portfolio has a particularlystrong foothold in emerging markets where we have a broad base of products enabling us to buildtargeted additional product offerings and developments. We expect that greater managerial focus tocapture local market opportunities, along with targeted investments in expanding our geographicfootprint, digital promotion and commercial trade channels, will provide new revenue opportunities forselect brands in our established brands portfolio. We also believe there are meaningful opportunities tobe realized through further investment in, and lifecycle management of, our current products across ourportfolios. Drive long-term growth through investment in inorganic opportunities .To drive longer-term growth, we intend to expand our scientific capabilities in targeted therapeutic areas through investment ininorganic opportunities and acquisitions in order to further augment our existing product businesses.We believe these investments will help us build a development pipeline that will drive our futurerevenues. Enhance our digital and omni-channel marketing capabilities to drive growth . Our commercial strategy focuses on growing our product portfolio by increasing productivity across our sales force andleveraging digital channels, data and analytics to improve the return on investment in health careprovider and patient engagement. We plan to continually expand our digital and omni-channelcapabilities to optimize sales opportunities for our products and to further invest in digital engagementmodels that allow us to reach our customers and patients effectively. We also plan to further strengthenthe design and execution of personalized omni-channel campaigns, engaging health care providers andpatients through the most cost-effective channels and building upon existing strengths, such as oursophisticated capabilities to successfully target women and maximize our promotional response, whichwe achieved through nearly 10 years of executing and analyzing women's health consumer campaignsin the United States. Drive efficiency to improve operating leverage and cash flow . As an independent company, we intend to focus on delivering operating efficiencies. We have identified a number of key areas in which weplan to generate cost efficiencies by simplifying our operating model, standardizing and centralizing 13service activities and designing and enhancing our commercial model and supply chain functions. We also plan to leverage external providers where there is a cost and service advantage. In addition, we arein the process of implementing systems and process improvements to reduce general andadministrative costs, and simplify our infrastructure following the termination of our transition servicesagreement with Merck. We believe the combination of these efficiencies will allow us to drive growthin free cash flow. Deploy our free cash flow to invest in our existing product portfolio, fund inorganic opportunities and return capital to our shareholders. We are committed to the success of our existing product portfolio and plan to make commercial decisions that will allow us to maximize its value. In addition,we plan to invest in inorganic growth opportunities such as in-licenses, commercial collaborations andacquisitions of development-stage or in-market products. We also plan to acquire products that fitwithin our existing commercial infrastructure, which we believe will generate attractive risk-adjustedreturns on investment. There are inorganic growth opportunities, particularly in women's health andbiosimilars, that we plan to target. We believe that our global commercial and market accesscapabilities, regulatory affairs, specialized manufacturing and clinical development expertise, willenable us to evaluate and integrate external opportunities. In addition, we plan to pay a dividend to ourshareholders, pay down debt consistent with our financial policy and, to the extent that we generateexcess free cash flow, we will consider returning additional free cash flow to our shareholders via sharerepurchases. We expect our targeted dividend payout to be in the low 20s as a percentage of post-separation Adjusted Net Income. Capitalize on our status as a newly independent company to align our talented employee base with our performance expectations and drive a culture of high performance. Our strong heritage of excellence and scientific foundation enables us to approach complex problems with innovative science-based solutions. As a new, independent company, we have a rare opportunity to forge a distinct identityand align hiring, training, development and incentive activities around a clear set of performanceexpectations related to our core strategy. To establish this culture, we plan to draw upon key aspects ofour shared history with Merck while charting a new course. We expect to be a performance-focusedand entrepreneurial company with simplified organizational layers and governance, and a focus onalignment and leadership empowerment that enables our leaders to understand and address the evolvingand unmet medical need of patients and health care providers around the world. Summary of Risks Related to Organon's Business and the Separation An investment in Organon common stock is subject to a number of risks, including risks related to the separation and distribution. The following list of risk factors is not exhaustive. Please read the information in thesection entitled \"Risk Factors\" for a more thorough description of these and other risks. Risks Related to Organon's Business We have no history operating as an independent company, and we expect to incur increased administrative and other costs following the separation by virtue of our status as an independentpublic company. Our historical and pro forma financial information is not necessarilyrepresentative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded companyand may not be a reliable indicator of our future results . Our historical and pro forma financial information included in this information statement is derived from the consolidated financialstatements and accounting records of Merck. Accordingly, the historical and pro forma financialinformation included in this information statement does not necessarily reflect the financial condition,results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded companyduring the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future, primarily as a result of thefollowing factors: developing an independent ability to operate without access to Merck's existing 14operational and administrative infrastructure, loss of ability to utilize Merck's size and purchasing power in procuring various goods and services on favorable terms, potential need to obtain additionalfinancing, increased cost of capital for our business and issuance of any debt we expect to incur as partof the separation. Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financingand business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Merck. Key products generate a significant amount of our profits and cash flows, and any events that adversely affect the markets for our leading products could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition . Our ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of our key products, such as Nexplanon / Implanon NXT,Cozaar/Hyzaar, Zetia, Singulair and Atozet. As a result of our dependence on key products, any eventthat adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products could adverselyaffect our sales, results of operations and cash flows. These adverse events could include increasedcosts associated with manufacturing, product shortages, increased generic or over-the-counteravailability of our products or competitive products, the discovery of previously unknown side effects,results of post-approval trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effectivetreatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of these products for any reason. We alsoexpect that competition will continue to adversely affect the sales of these products. We face continued pricing pressure with respect to our products. In the United States, we experience and expect to continue experiencing significant pricing pressure from: managed caregroups, institutional and governmental purchasers, U.S. federal laws and regulations related toMedicare and Medicaid (including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and ModernizationAct of 2003), the Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\") and state activities aimed at regulating prices andincreasing price transparency. Outside the United States, numerous major markets have pervasivegovernment involvement in health care funding and, in that regard, extensive pricing andreimbursement mechanisms and processes for pharmaceutical products, which in turn means that weare subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to our products. We face intense competition from competitors' products. Our products face intense competition from competitors' products, including lower cost generic versions of our products that have lost marketexclusivity, which may be equally safe and as effective as our products but sold at a substantially lowerprice than our products. Alternatively, our competitors' products may be safer or more effective, moreconvenient to use, have better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels or be more effectivelymarketed and sold than our products. Our efforts to compete with other companies or our failure tomaintain our competitive position could adversely affect our business, cash flow, results of operations,financial condition and prospects. We expect to have limited in-house research and development capabilities and will rely on future acquisitions, partnerships and collaborations to expand our research and developmentcapabilities, which means we may not be able to develop new products or expand our existingproducts into new markets to replace the sales of products that lose patent protection, andtherefore we may not be able to maintain our current levels of profitability . Upon our separation from Merck, we will have limited in-house research and development staff and facilities, and we do notcurrently intend to hire or acquire such staff or facilities immediately after the separation and instead,we intend to rely on future acquisitions, partnerships and collaborations with third parties to expand ourexisting portfolio and research capabilities. In addition, we rely on our collaboration with SamsungBioepis for the successful development and manufacture of our biosimilars products and expect to doso for the foreseeable future. We also intend to grow our product portfolio of prescription therapies byacquiring products developed by third parties. If our expansion into new products, new indications orformulations of our existing products or expansion of existing products into new markets or newgeographies does not offset the sales lost through loss of patent exclusivity, then we may not be able to 15maintain our current levels of profitability, and this could adversely affect our business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We may experience difficulties identifying and effecting acquisition opportunities. We may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships to expandour product offerings and geographic presence as part of our business strategy. We may not completethese transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize theexpected benefits of any acquisition, license arrangement or strategic partnerships. In identifying,evaluating and selecting acquisition targets, we may encounter intense competition from othercompanies that have similar business objectives, extensive experience, and greater resources. Inaddition, certain provisions of the tax matters agreement may discourage, delay or prevent acquisitionproposals or otherwise limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in otherspecified transactions for a period of time. After the distribution, we expect to have significant indebtedness. We expect to have total indebtedness of approximately $9.5 billion, consisting of term loans and 144A senior notes with suchaggregate principal amount. Approximately $9.0 billion of such amount will be incurred to pay adistribution to Merck, with the remaining net proceeds intended to be used for general corporatepurposes. Such indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur could restrict our ability to paydividends and adversely affect our financing options and liquidity position. We may be unable to market our products if we do not obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals. Our activities, including the manufacturing and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal and state governmental authorities in the United States andby foreign regulatory authorities, including in the EU, China and Japan. Our failure to obtain approval,significant delays in the approval process or our failure to maintain approval in any jurisdiction willprevent us from marketing and selling the products in that jurisdiction. We would not be able to realizerevenues for our products in any jurisdiction where we do not have approval. Developments following regulatory approval may adversely affect sales of our products. Even after a product reaches the market, certain developments may decrease demand for our products,including results in post-approval Phase 4 trials or other studies, the re-review of products that arealready marketed, the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed,changing government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy, quality or labelingchanges and scrutiny of advertising and promotion. Further, we are at risk for product liability andconsumer protection claims and civil and criminal governmental actions related to our products,research and marketing activities. In addition, dissemination of promotional materials through evolvingdigital channels serves to increase visibility and scrutiny in the marketplace. The health care industry in the United States has been, and will continue to be, subject to increasing regulation and political action. We believe that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation and political and legal action at both the Federal and state levels.Recent health care reform legislation, such as the ACA, have resulted in requirements such as a pointof service discount and an annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee. In addition, there arecurrently several proposed draft rules or legislation that may have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Current Developments In March 2021, Merck and Alydia Health announced a definitive agreement pursuant to which, after the spin-off, Organon will acquire Alydia Health for up to $240 million in total consideration, subject to customarypurchase price adjustments. Total consideration includes a $215 million upfront payment plus a $25 millionsales-based contingent milestone payment. Alydia Health is a commercial-stage medical device company 16focused on preventing maternal morbidity and mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage or abnormal postpartum uterine bleeding. Of the $215 million upfront payment, $50 million was paid by Merck and theremaining $165 million will be paid by Organon upon the closing of the acquisition, which remains subject tocustomary closing conditions and completion of the spin-off of Organon from Merck. The $25 million contingentmilestone payment will be paid by Organon upon achievement of the milestone. The Separation and Distribution On February 5, 2020, Merck announced that it intended to spin-off its women's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses and create a standalone pharmaceutical company. Merck announced that itintended to effect the spin-off through a pro rata distribution of all of the common stock of a new entity, whichhas since been named Organon and holds the assets and liabilities associated with the women's health,biosimilars and established brands businesses. On May 7, 2021, the Merck Board of Directors approved the distribution of all of Organon's issued and outstanding shares of common stock to holders of shares of Merck common stock as of the close of business onMay 17, 2021, the record date. On June 2, 2021, the distribution date, each Merck shareholder will receive one-tenth of a share of Organon's common stock for each share of Merck common stock held at the close of business on the record date.Merck shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Organon common stock that they wouldhave received after application of this ratio. Shareholders will not be required to make any payment, or surrenderor exchange their shares of Merck common stock or take any other action to receive their shares of Organon'scommon stock in the distribution. The distribution of Organon's common stock as described in this informationstatement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. For a more detailed description of theseconditions, see the section entitled \"\u2014Conditions to the Distribution.\" Organon's Post-Distribution Relationship with Merck Organon will enter into a separation and distribution agreement with Merck, which is referred to in this information statement as the \"separation and distribution agreement.\" In connection with the separation, Organonwill enter into various other agreements to effect the separation and provide a framework for its relationship withMerck after the distribution, including one or more transition services agreements, manufacturing and supplyagreements, trademark license agreements, intellectual property license agreements, an employee mattersagreement, a tax matters agreement and certain other commercial agreements. These agreements will provide forthe allocation between Merck and Organon of Merck's assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (includinginvestments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at andafter Organon's separation from Merck. These agreements will also govern certain relationships between Merck andOrganon after the separation. For additional information regarding the separation and distribution agreement andother transaction agreements, see the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to the Separation andDistribution\" and \"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.\" Reasons for the Separation The Merck Board of Directors believes that separating the women's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses from the remainder of Merck is in the best interests of Merck and its shareholders for a numberof reasons, including that the spin-off will: give each of Organon and Merck its own dedicated management team, focused on its unique business opportunities and capital needs, thereby allowing each business to pursue more effectively its owndistinct operating priorities and strategies; 17 give each of Organon and Merck its own source of capital dedicated to its own investment priorities, and allow each of Organon and Merck to implement a capital structure appropriate for its respectivecash flow and growth profile; give each of Organon and Merck its own equity currency for use in connection with acquisitions; and enhance the ability of Organon and Merck to attract and retain qualified management and to better align incentive-based compensation with the performance of each of Organon and Merck's separate businesses. The Merck Board of Directors considered a number of potentially negative factors in evaluating the separation, including risks relating to the creation of a new public company and possible increased overall costs,as well as one-time separation costs, but concluded that the potential benefits of the separation outweighed thesefactors. For more information, see the sections entitled \"The Separation and Distribution\u2014Reasons for theSeparation\" and \"Risk Factors\" included elsewhere in this information statement. Conditions to the Distribution The distribution is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others: the receipt of opinions (the \"Tax Opinions\") from Baker & McKenzie LLP and Ernst & Young LLP (the \"Tax Advisors\") to the effect that the distribution and certain related transactions will qualify astax-free to Merck and its shareholders under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code; the making of a distribution of approximately $9.0 billion from Organon to Merck, and the determination by Merck in its sole discretion that following the separation Merck will have no furtherliability or obligation whatsoever with respect to any of the financing arrangements that Organon willbe entering into in connection with the separation; the receipt of an opinion from an independent appraisal firm to the Merck Board of Directors confirming the solvency of Merck giving effect to the distribution of Organon and confirming thesolvency of Organon giving effect to the cash dividend that is in form and substance acceptable toMerck in its sole discretion; the SEC declaring effective Organon's registration statement on Form 10 of which this information statement forms a part, and the making available of the information statement to all holders of shares ofMerck common stock as of the close of business on May 17, 2021, the record date; no order, injunction, or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the separation, distribution or any of the relatedtransactions shall be in effect; the shares of Organon common stock to be distributed shall have been accepted for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of distribution; and no other event or development existing or having occurred that, in the judgment of Merck's Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, makes it inadvisable to effect the separation, distribution and otherrelated transactions. Merck and Organon cannot assure you that any or all of these conditions will be met. In addition, Merck will have the sole and absolute discretion to determine (and change) the terms of, and whether to proceed with,the distribution and, to the extent it determines to so proceed, to determine the record date and the distributiondate and the distribution ratio. Merck does not intend to notify its shareholders of any modifications to the termsof the separation that, in the judgment of its Board of Directors, are not material.

Any of the following risks could materially and adverselyaffect Organon's results of operations or financial condition. The risk factors generally have been separated intothree groups: risks related to Organon's business, risks related to the separation and distribution, and risksrelated to Organon's common stock. Risks Related to Our Business We have no history operating as an independent company, and we expect to incur increased administrative and other costs following the separation by virtue of our status as an independent public company. Ourhistorical and pro forma financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we wouldhave achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. The historical information about Organon in this information statement refers to Organon's business as operated by and integrated with Merck. Our historical and pro forma financial information included in thisinformation statement is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Merck.Accordingly, the historical and pro forma financial information included in this information statement does notnecessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as aseparate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future,primarily as a result of the following factors: Prior to the distribution, our business was operated by Merck as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Merck or one of its affiliates performed variouscorporate functions for us, such as tax, treasury, finance, internal audit, risk management, legal,information technology, human resources, shareholder relations, compliance, insurance, employeebenefits and compensation. Following the distribution, Merck will continue to provide some of thesefunctions to us after we transition to an independent, publicly traded company, as described in \"CertainRelationships and Related Party Transactions.\" Our historical and pro forma financial results reflectallocations of corporate expenses from Merck for such functions. These allocations will not beindicative of the actual expenses we would have incurred had we operated as an independent, publiclytraded company in the periods presented. We will need to make significant investments to replicate oroutsource from other providers certain facilities, systems, infrastructure and personnel to which we willno longer have access once the terms of our arrangements with Merck expire. These initiatives todevelop our independent ability to operate without access to Merck's existing operational andadministrative infrastructure will be costly to implement, and we will incur additive costs inimplementing such initiatives currently provided to us by Merck. In addition, we may be unable toobtain replacement services on similar terms as those provided by Merck. We may not be able tooperate our business as efficiently or at comparable costs, and our results of operations may beadversely affected. Currently, our business is integrated with the other businesses of Merck. We are able to utilize Merck's size and purchasing power in procuring various goods and services and have shared economies ofscope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although we willenter into transition agreements with Merck, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits wehave enjoyed as a result of being integrated with Merck and may result in us paying higher chargesthan in the past for these services. As a separate, independent company, we may be unable to obtaingoods and services at the prices and terms obtained prior to the separation, which could adverselyaffect our results of operations. As a separate, independent company, we also may not be as successfulin negotiating favorable tax treatment with governmental entities. This could adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition. Our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, research and development and capital expenditures, have historically been satisfied as part 22of the corporate-wide cash management policies of Merck. Following the completion of the distribution, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings orprivate placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements. After the completion of the distribution, the cost of capital for our business is likely to be higher than Merck's cost of capital prior to the distribution. Our historical financial information does not reflect the issuance of any debt we expect to incur as part of the separation and distribution or our obligations to purchase from Merck certain operations andassets, and assume the corresponding liabilities, of our business after the distribution date. Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Merck. For additional information about the past financialperformance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical combined financial statements and theunaudited pro forma financial information of our business, see \"Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information,\"\"Selected Historical Financial Data,\" \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations\" and the historical financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in thisinformation statement. Key products generate a significant amount of our profits and cash flows, and any events that adversely affect the markets for our leading products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of our key products, such as Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, Cozaar/Hyzaar, Zetia, Singulair and Atozet. As a result ofour dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any ofthese products could adversely affect our sales, results of operations and cash flows. These adverse events couldinclude increased costs associated with manufacturing, product shortages, increased generic or over-the-counteravailability of our products or competitive products, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, results ofpost-approval trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments anddiscontinuation or removal from the market of these products for any reason. We also expect that competitionwill continue to adversely affect the sales of these products. We face continued pricing pressure with respect to our products. We face continued pricing pressure globally and, particularly, in mature markets from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could adversely affect our sales and profit margins. Weexpect pricing pressure to continue in the future. For example, in the United States, we experience significantpricing pressure from: managed care groups, institutional and governmental purchasers, U.S. federal laws andregulations related to Medicare and Medicaid (including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement andModernization Act of 2003 and the ACA) and state activities aimed at regulating prices and increasing pricetransparency. Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the United States, as wellas increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sectorbeneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, in the United States, larger customers havereceived higher rebates on drugs in certain highly competitive categories. We must also compete to be placed onformularies of managed care organizations. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage inthe managed care organization. Outside the United States, numerous major markets, including the EU, China andJapan have pervasive government involvement in health care funding and, in that regard, extensive pricing andreimbursement mechanisms and processes for pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, we aresubject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to our products. In China, pricingpressure from the Chinese government has increased, including through a series of health care reforms toaccelerate generic substitution. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reforms haveincreased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through the government's volume-based procurement (\"VBP\") and generic quality consistency evaluation (\"GQCE\") programs. In Japan, the 23pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricing for specific products if it determines that use of such productwill exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules. The next government-mandated pricingreduction will occur in April 2021 and is expected to impact many Organon products. We face intense competition from competitors' products. Our products face intense competition from competitors' products, including lower cost generic versions of our products that have lost market exclusivity. Competitors' products may be equally safe and as effective as ourproducts but sold at a substantially lower price than our products. Alternatively, our competitors' products maybe safer or more effective, more convenient to use, have better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels or bemore effectively marketed and sold than our products. Our efforts to compete with other companies or our failureto maintain our competitive position could adversely affect our business, cash flow, results of operations,financial condition and prospects. We expect to have limited in-house research and development capabilities and will rely on future acquisitions, partnerships and collaborations to expand our research and development capabilities, which means we maynot be able to develop new products or expand our existing products into new markets to replace the sales ofproducts that lose patent protection, and therefore we may not be able to maintain our current levels ofprofitability. Upon our separation from Merck, we will have limited in-house research and development staff and facilities, and do not currently intend to hire or acquire such staff or facilities immediately after the separation.Instead, we intend to rely on future acquisitions, partnerships and collaborations with third parties to expand ourexisting portfolio and research capabilities. We also intend to grow our business through new indications orformulations of our existing products or expansion of existing products into new markets or new geographies.However, we expect that our ability to do so will be limited by the scope of our limited intellectual propertylicenses for certain women's health products. For example, our license for Nexplanon / Implanon NXT permitsuse of the underlying technology solely as a contraceptive implant containing only the active pharmaceuticalingredient currently used in the product. We may not be able to offset any sales losses for products that lose or donot have exclusivity by growing sales in other markets. If we cannot produce sufficient revenues from expansioninto new products, new indications or formulations of our existing products or expansion of existing productsinto new markets or new geographies, then we may not be able to maintain our current levels of profitability, andthis could adversely affect our business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We may experience difficulties identifying and effecting acquisition opportunities. We may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, licensing arrangements and strategic partnerships to expand our product offerings and geographic presence as part of our business strategy. We maynot complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize theexpected benefits of any acquisition, license arrangement or strategic partnerships. Such opportunities may relateto products, technologies or operations with which we have limited or no historical experience. For example, inMarch 2021, Merck announced the signing of a definitive agreement for us to acquire Alydia Health, which is acommercial-stage medical device company. In identifying, evaluating and selecting acquisition targets, we mayencounter intense competition from other companies having a business objective similar to ours. Many of thesecompanies are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting these types of strategicacquisitions. Moreover, some of these competitors may possess greater financial, technical, human and otherresources than we do. In addition, certain provisions of the tax matters agreement, which are intended to preservethe intended tax treatment of the separation and certain related transactions, may discourage, delay or preventacquisition proposals or otherwise limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in othertransactions, including mergers or consolidations for a period of time following the spin-off. Even if we aresuccessful in making acquisitions, the products and technologies we acquire may not be successful or mayrequire significantly greater resources and investments than we originally anticipated. We could experience 24negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges. We could experience difficulties in integratinggeographically separated organizations, systems and facilities, and personnel with diverse backgrounds. If anacquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business,our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We may be unable to market our products if we do not obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals. Our activities, including the manufacturing and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal and state governmental authorities in the United States, including the Food andDrug Administration (\"FDA\"), and by foreign regulatory authorities, including in the EU, China and Japan. Inthe United States, the FDA administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness,manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. Regulation outside the United States alsois primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many cases, reduction in the cost of drugs. Inaddition, regulatory authorities such as the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\"), China's NationalMedical Products Administration (\"NMPA\") and Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare have increasedtheir focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. These regulatory authorities, including inChina and Japan, also have substantial discretion to require additional testing, to delay or withhold registrationand marketing approval and to otherwise preclude distribution and sale of a product. Our applications for regulatory approval may be rejected or otherwise delayed by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. For example, the FDA may issue complete response letters indicating that our applicationsare not ready for approval. We cannot market our products or new indications or formulations of our existingproducts unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each relevant jurisdiction. Onceobtained, we must maintain approval as long as we plan to market products in each jurisdiction where approval isrequired. Our failure to obtain approval, significant delays in the approval process or our failure to maintainapproval in any jurisdiction will prevent us from selling the products in that jurisdiction. We would not be able torealize revenues for our products in any jurisdiction where we do not have approval. Developments following regulatory approval may adversely affect sales of our products. Even after a product reaches the market, certain developments may decrease demand for our products, including the following: results in post-approval Phase 4 trials or other studies; the re-review of products that are already marketed; the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed; changing government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy, quality or labeling changes; and scrutiny of advertising and promotion. In the past several years, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of our competitors within the industry have raised concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling ofmarketed products. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs also have raisedconcerns among some health care providers and patients relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceuticalproducts in general that have negatively affected the sales of such products. In addition, increased scrutiny of theoutcomes of clinical trials has led to increased volatility in market reaction. Further, these matters often attractlitigation and, even where the basis for the litigation is groundless, may consume considerable resources. If previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of our products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require us to 25take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting our distribution or applying for labeling changes. Further, we are at risk for product liability and consumer protectionclaims and civil and criminal governmental actions related to our products, research and marketing activities. Inaddition, dissemination of promotional materials through evolving digital channels serves to increase visibilityand scrutiny in the marketplace. Certain of our products currently benefit from patent protection and market exclusivity. When the patent protection and market exclusivity periods for such products expire, we generally experience a significant andrapid loss of sales from those products. Expiry of patent protection and market exclusivity for products thatcontribute significantly to our sales will adversely affect our business. We depend upon patents to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for certain of our products for some period of time. Loss of patent protection typically leads to a significant and rapid loss of sales for that product aslower priced generic versions of that drug become available. In the case of current or future products thatcontribute significantly to our sales, a loss of market exclusivity could materially adversely affect our business,cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For example, the patent that provided UnitedStates market exclusivity for NuvaRing expired in April 2018 and generic competition began in December 2019.We experienced a rapid and substantial decline in NuvaRing sales in the United States in 2020 as a result of thisgeneric competition. In addition, we expect to have market exclusivity for Nexplanon / Implanon NXT in theUnited States until 2027 and the majority of countries where Nexplanon / Implanon NXT is commercializedoutside the United States until 2025. See \"Business\u2014Products\" for details, including the patent protection forcertain of our marketed products. We are dependent on our patent rights for the marketing of certain of our products, and invalidation or circumvention of our patent rights would adversely affect our business. Patent protections are important to the marketing of certain of our products, particularly certain of our women's health products in the United States and in most major foreign markets. Patents covering products thatwe have introduced normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the successful marketing andsale of certain of our products. Even if we succeed in obtaining patents covering our products, third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications. It is important for our businessto defend successfully the patent rights that provide market exclusivity for our products. We are often involved inpatent disputes relating to challenges to our patents or claims by third parties of infringement against us. Wedefend our patents both within and outside the United States, including by filing claims of infringement againstother parties. In particular, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products from time to time file abbreviatednew drug applications (\"ANDAs\") with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of our products prior to theexpiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by us. We normally respond by defending our patent, includingby filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. Patent litigation and other challenges to our patents are costly andunpredictable and may deprive us of market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases, third-partypatents may prevent us from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area, negatively affectingour business and results of operations. Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances, which could diminish or eliminate salesand profits from those regions and negatively affect our business and results of operations. Further, courtdecisions relating to other companies' patents, potential legislation in both the United States and certain foreignmarkets relating to patents, as well as regulatory initiatives may result in a more general weakening ofintellectual property protection. If one or more of our important products lose patent protection in profitable markets, sales of those products are likely to decline significantly as a result of generic versions of those products becoming available. Our results 26of operations may be adversely affected by the lost sales unless and until we have launched commercially successful products that replace the lost sales. In addition, if products with intangible assets that were measuredat fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negativelyaffect product cash flows, we may recognize material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value ofthose products. The health care industry in the United States has been, and will continue to be, subject to increasing regulation and political action. We believe that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation and political and legal action at both the Federal and state levels. In 2010, the United States enacted major health care reform legislation in the form of the ACA. Various insurance market reforms have advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014. TheACA increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managedcare utilization and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. The ACA also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 70% of the cost of the medicine, including biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., theso-called \"donut hole\"), which increased from 50% beginning in 2019 as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of2018. Also, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible health care reformfee. The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales tocertain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. As discussed in \"Business\u2014Competition and Health Care Environment,\" there is significant uncertainty about the future of the ACA and, in particular, health care laws generally in the United States. There are variouscourt cases and other regulatory actions ongoing that may result in the invalidation of all or portions of the ACA.If the individual mandate is held to be unconstitutional and not severable from the remainder of the ACA, weexpect this would result in invalidation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (\"BPCIA\"), whichprovides for an abbreviated pathway for obtaining FDA approval of biologic drugs that satisfy certain criteria andwhich is incorporated into the ACA. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") issued the Medicaid rebate Final Rule that implemented provisions of the ACA effective April 1, 2016. The rule provided comprehensive guidance on thecalculation of Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price, which are two metrics that determine the rebates drugmanufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaid programs. On December 31, 2020, CMS published a FinalRule on the Medicaid Program, which, among other things, introduced new definitions of \"line extension\" and\"new formulation.\" CMS defined \"line extension\" as a new formulation of the drug, not including an abuse-deterrent formulation of the drug, and adopted an expansive definition of \"new formulation\" to include \"anextended release formulation or other change in release mechanism, a change in dosage form, strength, route ofadministration, or ingredients.\" This expanded definition will result in a number of drugs being subject to ahigher Medicaid rebate. The new definitions of \"line extension\" and \"new formulation\" will take effect onJanuary 1, 2022. The Final Rule also revised regulations regarding authorized generic sales when manufacturerscalculate the average manufacturer price (AMP), manufacturer reporting requirements under the Medicaid DrugRebate Program (MDRP), and payments for prescription drugs under the Medicaid program. The implementationdate of these revised regulations is January 1, 2023. We will evaluate the financial effects of these elements oncethere is more certainty. In addition, as discussed in \"Business\u2014Competition and the Health Care Environment,\" a Final Rule was issued that allows importation of certain lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada. As a result of this FinalRule, effective November 30, 2020, states or certain other non-federal governmental entities will be able tosubmit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization of two-year programs (with theopportunity to extend for two more years). This rule is currently facing a legal challenge and is currently pending 27in federal district court, but if upheld, or if additional future legislative action is taken on drug importation, it would be expected to adversely affect our revenues. Various executive and legislative actions in the United States have been proposed, or may in the future be proposed, to mandate reduced drug prices. For example, in November 2020, CMS issued a Final Rule which wasintended to be effective January 1, 2021 to institute a new pricing system for certain prescription drugs andbiologic products covered by Medicare Part B in which Medicare would reimburse no more than the \"mostfavored nation price.\" The rule was immediately challenged in at least four federal courts and has beentemporarily enjoined from going into effect. The Department of Health and Human Services has indicated thatthe most favored nation, or MFN, model will not be implemented without further rulemaking. Additionally in November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\") issued a Final Rule that would, effective January 1, 2022, eliminate the Anti-Kickback Statute safeharbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\") on behalf of suchplans. While the Company cannot anticipate the effects of this change to the way it currently contracts, this newframework could significantly alter the way it does business with Part D Plan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf ofsuch plans. This rulemaking also established, effective January 1, 2021, a new safe harbor for point of salediscounts at the pharmacy counter and a new safe harbor for certain services arrangements betweenpharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs. In response to litigation brought by a trade association on behalf ofPBMs, the rule's effective date has been delayed until January 1, 2023. It remains to be seen whether, and towhat extent, these measures will take effect. These executive measures, if upheld, or future legislative action ondrug prices may adversely affect our revenues. We cannot predict the likelihood of additional future changes in the health care industry in general, or the pharmaceutical industry in particular, or what impact they may have on our business, cash flow, results ofoperations, financial condition and prospects. We are subject to a variety of United States and international laws and regulations. We are currently subject to a number of government laws and regulations and, in the future, could become subject to new government laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, or thenegative results of non-compliance, could adversely affect our business, cash flow, results of operations,financial condition and prospects. The costs of compliance and non-compliance may be particularly significantwith respect to health care reform initiatives in the United States or in other countries, including additionalmandatory discounts or fees; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 or other anti-bribery and corruption laws; new laws, regulations and judicial or other governmental decisions affecting pricing,drug reimbursement, and access or marketing within or across jurisdictions; new and increasing data privacyregulations and enforcement, particularly in the EU and the United States; legislative mandates or preferences forlocal manufacturing of pharmaceutical products; emerging and new global regulatory requirements for reportingpayments and other value transfers to health care professionals; environmental regulations; and importationrestrictions, embargoes, trade sanctions and legislative or other regulatory changes. We have significant global operations, which expose us to additional risks, and any adverse event could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The extent of our operations outside the United States is significant. Risks inherent in conducting a global business include: changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing restrictions in key markets; multiple regulatory requirements that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products in key markets; 28 trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, including the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the United States or other governments; foreign exchange fluctuations; diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and possible nationalization and expropriation. In addition, there may be changes to our business and strategic position if there is instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, health epidemics(including the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\")), riot, civil insurrection or socialunrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure. Cyber- attacks against our IT systems could result in exposure of confidential information, the modification ofcritical data or the disruption of our worldwide operations, including manufacturing and sales operations. We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications, complex information technology systems, computing infrastructure and cloud service providers (collectively, \"IT systems\") to conduct criticaloperations. Certain of these systems are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties, including Merck, toassist in conducting our business. Disruption, degradation or manipulation of these IT systems throughintentional or accidental means by our employees, third parties with authorized access or unauthorized thirdparties could adversely affect key business processes. Cyber-attacks against our IT systems or third-partyproviders' IT systems, such as cloud-based systems, could result in exposure of confidential information, themodification of critical data and/or the failure of critical operations. Misuse of any of these IT systems couldresult in the disclosure of sensitive personal information or the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property or otherconfidential business information. We continue to leverage new and innovative technologies across the enterpriseto improve the efficacy and efficiency of our business processes; the use of which can create new risks. In 2017, Merck experienced a network cyber-attack that led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations, and resulting losses. We could experience similaradverse effects from cyber-attacks. We have implemented a variety of measures to further enhance and modernize our systems to guard against similar attacks in the future, and also is pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to enhance our resiliency againstfuture cyber-attacks, including incidents similar to the 2017 Merck cyber-attack. The objective of these efforts isnot only to protect against future cyber-attacks, but also to improve the speed of our recovery from such attacksand enable continued business operations to the greatest extent possible during any recovery period. Merck has in the past, and we in the future may be, a target of events of this nature. We monitor our data, information technology and personnel usage of IT systems to reduce these risks and continue to do so on anongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our dataand IT systems or the efforts of third-party providers to protect their IT systems will be successful in preventingdisruptions to our operations, including our manufacturing and sales operations. Such disruptions could result inloss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from our or our third-party providers' databases orIT systems, or result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us and substantial remediation costs. We carry insurance against certain losses resulting from cyber-attacks, but such insurance may not cover a particular event that arises or the amount of such coverage may not be sufficient to fully compensate us for losseswe experience. 29We may experience difficulties and delays in manufacturing certain of our products. We may experience difficulties and delays inherent in manufacturing our products, such as: failure of us or our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines, which failures may lead tomanufacturing shutdowns, product shortages or manufacturing delays; delays related to the construction of newfacilities or the expansion of existing facilities; and other manufacturing or distribution problems, includingchanges in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity resulting from regulatoryrequirements, changes in types of products produced and physical limitations that could impact supply. Inaddition, we could experience difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products caused by natural disasters,such as hurricanes. Manufacturing difficulties can result in product shortages, leading to lost sales andreputational harm to us. The global COVID-19 pandemic is having an adverse impact on our business, operations and financial performance. We are unable to predict the full extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continueto adversely impact our business, operations, financial performance, results of operations, and financialcondition. Our business and financial results were negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. The continued duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult topredict. The degree to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our results in 2021 will depend on futuredevelopments, beyond our knowledge or control, including, but not limited to, the duration of the outbreak, itsseverity, the success of actions taken to contain or prevent the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and towhat extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. In 2020 and thus far in 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business and we continue to expect that it will impact our business in numerous ways, including but not limited to those outlined below. See\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014RecentDevelopments.\" In 2020, the negative impact of COVID-19 to Organon Products segment sales was estimated to be approximately $400 million. A significant amount of our revenue is comprised of physician-administeredproducts, which, despite underlying demand, have been affected by social distancing measures, fewer medicalvisits and delays in elective procedures. These impacts, as well as the prioritization of COVID-19 patients athealth care providers, have resulted in reduced administration of many products within established brands andwomen's health, in particular Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, throughout 2020. We expect that the COVID-19pandemic will negatively affect our sales in 2021. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact will also depend on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as governmental and third-partyactions taken to contain or prevent its spread, treat the virus and mitigate its public health and economic effects. We may be unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or we may experience other supply difficulties that could adversely affect our ability to deliver ourproducts and our results of operations and financial condition. We acquire our components, materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries, including sometimes from ourselves for self-supplied requirements. We endeavor toachieve, either alone or working closely with our suppliers, continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannotguarantee these efforts will always be successful. For instance, Follistim has been challenged by intermittentsupply disruptions over the past several years. Further, while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sourcesof components and materials, in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yetidentified. For many of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used, alternative 30sources or suppliers may exist, but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to anyrelated supply disruption, we cannot assure you that such measures will always be sufficient or effective. Ourability to achieve continuity of our supply may also be affected by public health crises and epidemics/pandemics.A reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for suchsupply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and distribute our products in a timely or cost-effectivemanner, and our ability to sell our products. We may not be able to realize benefits from our investments in emerging markets. We have been taking steps to increase our sales in emerging markets. However, there is no guarantee that our efforts to expand sales in these markets will succeed. Some countries within emerging markets may beespecially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend onhealth care. In order for us to successfully implement our emerging markets strategy, we must attract and retainqualified personnel. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents within less developedmarkets. In addition, many of these countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and, if such currenciesdevalue and we cannot offset the devaluations, our financial performance within such countries could beadversely affected. For example, our business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and China is now our second largest market, thereby increasing the importance of China to our overall pharmaceutical business. Continuedgrowth of our business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable regulatory environment,sustained access for our currently marketed products and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricingcontrols. Pricing pressure in China has increased as the Chinese government has been taking steps to reducecosts, including implementing healthcare reform that has led to the acceleration of generic substitution, whereavailable. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure inpart due to the acceleration of generic substitution through the government's VBP and GQCE programs. In 2019,the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for products that have genericsubstitutes with a GQCE approval. Mature products that have entered into the first three rounds of VBP had, onaverage, a price reduction of 50%. We expect VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significantimpact on mature products moving forward. In addition, we anticipate that the reported inquiries made by variousgovernmental authorities involving multinational pharmaceutical companies in China may continue. For all these reasons, sales within emerging markets carry significant risks. However, at the same time, macro-economic growth of selected emerging markets is expected to outpace Europe and even the U.S., leadingto significant increased headcount spending in the countries and access to innovative medicines for patients. Inaddition, we plan to pivot in China from a primary focus on the public tender market to growth opportunities inthe private retail segment. A failure to make such pivot effectively, or a failure to develop and maintain apresence in emerging markets could adversely affect our business, cash flow, results of operations, financialcondition and prospects. We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We operate in multiple jurisdictions and virtually all our sales outside the United States are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar. Additionally, we, as part of Merck, have historically entered into,and will in the future enter into, business development transactions, borrowings or other financial transactionsthat may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure. Since we cannot, with certainty, foresee and mitigate against such adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation could negatively affect our business, cash flow, results of operations, financialcondition and prospects. 31In order to mitigate against the adverse impact of these market fluctuations, we, as part of Merck, may from time to time enter into hedging agreements. While hedging agreements, such as currency options and forwardsand interest rate swaps, may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, suchattempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not always successful. We are subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in additional liabilities that may affect results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to evolving and complex tax laws in multiple jurisdictions. We must apply significant judgment to determine our tax liabilities, and our tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities.The ultimate resolution of tax matters may result in payments greater or less than the amounts we have accruedfor such tax liabilities. In addition, we may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations orchanges in interpretations of such laws and regulations. Pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns. Unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed pharmaceutical products such as our products, whether or not scientifically justified, which concerns may lead to product recalls, withdrawals ordeclining sales, as well as product liability, consumer fraud or other claims, including potential civil or criminalgovernmental actions. Such incidents could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows andfinancial condition. Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could materially adversely affect our business. We depend on third parties, including Merck and other suppliers, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for key aspects of our business includingdevelopment, manufacture and commercialization of our products and support for our IT systems. In addition, inconnection with the interim operating arrangements we intend to put in place following the separation, we mayenter into agreements with third-parties in certain jurisdictions, including China, to continue our businessoperations in compliance with local regulatory requirements. Failure of these third parties to meet theircontractual, regulatory and other obligations to us or the development of factors that materially disrupt therelationships between us and these third parties could adversely affect our business. The markets for our products, including the women's health market, may not develop successfully as expected. Our focus on women's health is a key component of our strategy. Our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy in this area is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including: uncertainty of the development of a market for such products; trends relating to, or the introduction or existence of, competing products, technologies or alternative treatments or therapies that may be more effective, safer or easier to use than our products,technologies, treatments or therapies; the perception of our products as compared to other products; recommendation and support for the use of our products or fertility treatments by influential customers, such as obstetricians, gynecologists, reproductive endocrinologists and treatment centers; changes in government policy or regulations could impair or repeal contraception coverage mandates under the ACA or state laws, which may affect payments to us or impose additional coveragelimitations or cost-sharing obligations on our patients; the availability and extent of data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of our products or treatments; 32 competition, including the presence of competing products sold by companies with longer operating histories, more recognizable names and more established distribution networks; and other technological developments. If we are unable to successfully commercialize and create a significant market for our women's health products, our business and prospects could be harmed. Biosimilars carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biosimilars. The regulation of the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of biosimilars are subject to regulation by the FDA,the EMA and other regulatory bodies. These laws and regulations differ from, and are not as well-established as,those governing pharmaceutical products or the approval of generic pharmaceutical products. In addition,manufacturing biosimilars, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovativetechnologies to handle living cells and micro-organisms. Any changes to the regulatory framework governingbiosimilars or in the ability of our partners to manufacture an adequate supply of biosimilars may adverselyaffect our ability to commercialize the biosimilars in our portfolio. We rely on our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis for the successful development and manufacture of our biosimilars products and expect to do so for the foreseeable future. Our current biosimilars portfolio consists entirely of products developed and manufactured by Samsung Bioepis for which we have worldwide commercialization rights, with certain geographic exceptions specified on aproduct-by-product basis. Our access rights to each product under our agreement with Samsung Bioepis last for 10years from each such product's launch date on a market-by-market basis. See \"Business\u2014Third-PartyAgreements\u2014Samsung Bioepis Development and Commercialization Agreement.\" Our ability to successfullycommercialize products in our biosimilars portfolio may depend upon maintaining a successful relationship withSamsung Bioepis. The success of our commercialization activities may also depend, in part, on the performance,operations and regulatory compliance of Samsung Bioepis and its suppliers, over which we do not have control. Wecannot assure you that our collaboration will be successful or that we will achieve the benefits of our collaboration. Product liability insurance for products may be limited, cost prohibitive or unavailable. We will be responsible for a number of ongoing product liability claims. We also may become subject to significant product liability claims in the future. Product liability insurance has become less available in recentyears while the cost of such insurance has increased significantly. As a result, we intend to self-insuresubstantially all of our risk. We have evaluated our risks and have determined that the cost of obtaining productliability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is available and, as such, we have noexternal insurance with respect to most product liabilities. We will continually assess the most efficient means toaddress our risk; however, there can be no guarantee that, if deemed necessary or desirable, outside insurancecoverage will be obtained or, if obtained, will be sufficient to fully cover product liabilities that may arise. Social media platforms present risks and challenges. The inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain social media channels could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications, including from the improper collection and/or disseminationof personally identifiable information. In addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us or ourproducts on any social networking platforms could damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill. Further, thedisclosure of non-public sensitive information by our workforce or others through external media channels couldlead to information loss. Although we have an internal Social Media Policy that guides employees on appropriatepersonal and professional use of social media about us, the processes in place may not completely secure andprotect information. Identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand also presents newchallenges. 33Risks Related to the Separation and Distribution As we build our information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own systems, we could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions. In connection with the separation, we have begun to install and implement information technology infrastructure to support our critical business functions, including accounting and reporting, manufacturingprocess control, quality and compliance systems, customer service, inventory control and distribution. We mayincur temporary interruptions in business operations if we cannot transition effectively from Merck's existingtransactional and operational systems, data centers and the transition services that support these functions as wereplace these systems. We may not be successful in implementing our new systems and transitioning our data,and we may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. Our failure to avoidoperational interruptions as we implement the new systems and replace Merck's information technology services,or our failure to implement the new systems and replace Merck's services successfully, could disrupt ourbusiness or adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to replicate or transitioncertain systems, our ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired. The separation may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel, which could materially harm our business. Operating as an independent public company will result in new and increased demands on our management team and other employees coming from Merck, which may give rise to increased employee turnover. Our successdepends in large part upon continuing leadership and performance of our management team and other keyemployees. If we lose the services of members of our management team or other key employees, we may not beable to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. Following the separation, we will need to continue to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in governmental regulation and commercialization. Ourability to attract, recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including the hiring practices ofour competitors, our compensation and benefits, work location and work environment and economic conditionsaffecting our industry generally. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or thatthe costs of doing so will not materially increase. If we cannot effectively hire and retain qualified employees, ourbusiness, results of operations and prospects could suffer. Merck may not satisfy its obligations under various transaction agreements that have been or will be executed as part of the separation or we may not have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transitionagreements expire. In connection with the separation, Organon and Merck will enter into a separation and distribution agreement and will enter into various other agreements, including one or more transition services agreements, manufacturingand supply agreements, trademark license agreements, intellectual property license agreements, an employeematters agreement, a tax matters agreement and certain other commercial or operating agreements. Theseagreements are discussed in greater detail in the section entitled \"Certain Relationships and Related PartyTransactions.\" Certain of these agreements will provide for the performance of services by each company for thebenefit of the other for a period of time after the distribution. We will rely on Merck to satisfy its performance andpayment obligations under these agreements. If Merck is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements,including its indemnification obligations, we could experience operational difficulties or losses. If we do not have our own systems and services in place, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services when these agreements terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and ourprofitability may decline. We are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systemsand services to replace many of the systems and services Merck currently provides to us. We may not be successfulin effectively or efficiently implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from Merck's systemsto ours. These systems and services may also be more expensive or less efficient than the systems and servicesMerck is expected to provide during the transition period. 34Potential indemnification liabilities to Merck pursuan t to the separation and distribution agreement could adversely affect us. The separation and distribution agreement with Merck covers, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation, certain conditions to the distribution, and provisions governing therelationship between Merck and us with respect to and resulting from the separation. For a description of theseparation and distribution agreement, see \"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u2014Agreementswith Merck\u2014The Separation and Distribution Agreement,\" which includes additional details regarding the scope ofour indemnification obligations. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides forindemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relatingto our business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the distribution pursuant to the separation anddistribution agreement, including any pending or future litigation. These liabilities, which could be material to us,include a general obligation to indemnify Merck for litigation relating to our products, including currently pendinglitigation relating to Fosamax, Nexplanon / Implanon NXT and Propecia / Proscar. However, we will not be liablefor the results of the antitrust litigation related to Zetia or the product liability litigation in Brazil related to Vioxx.For a description of the related legal proceedings, see Note 10 to our audited annual combined financial statements.These indemnification liabilities are intended to ensure that, as between Merck and us, we are responsible for allliabilities we assume in connection with the separation and that we pay for any liability incurred by Merck(including directors, officers, employees and agents) related to our failure to satisfy such obligations or otherwise inrespect of the operation of our business, or any breach by us of the separation and distribution agreement or anyancillary agreement. Our indemnity obligations to Merck under the circumstances set forth in the separation anddistribution agreement may be substantial. There could be significant income tax liability if the Spin-off or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Merck expects that, prior to completion of the Spin-off, it will receive the Tax Opinions from the Tax Advisors that are expected to conclude, among other things, that the distribution of all of the outstandingOrganon shares to Merck shareholders and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to Merck and itsshareholders under Sections 355 and 368 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, except to the extent of any cashreceived in lieu of fractional shares of Organon common stock. The Tax Opinions are not binding on the InternalRevenue Service (\"IRS\"). Accordingly, while Merck believes the risk is low, the IRS may reach conclusions withrespect to the Spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the Tax Opinions. The Tax Opinionswill rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Merck and Organon regarding thepast and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters, which, if incomplete,incorrect or not satisfied, could alter the conclusions of the party giving such Tax Opinion. If the proposed Spin-off is ultimately determined to be taxable, the Spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend to Merck's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and Merck's shareholders could incursignificant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, Merck would recognize a taxable gain to the extentthat the fair market value of Organon common stock exceeds Merck's tax basis in such stock on the date of theSpin-off. Each of Merck and Organon generally will be responsible for any tax-related losses imposed on Merckor Organon as a result of the failure of a transaction to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent that the failureto so qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to Merck's or Organon's respective stock,assets or business, or a breach of the relevant covenants made by Merck or Organon in the tax matters agreement.For a further description of the sharing of such liabilities between Merck and Organon, see \"CertainRelationships and Related Party Transactions\u2014Agreements with Merck\u2014Tax Matters Agreement.\" We will not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions after the separation. To preserve the tax-free treatment to Merck of the separation and the distribution, under the tax matters agreement that we will enter into with Merck, we will be restricted from taking any action that prevents thedistribution and related transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In particular, under 35the tax matters agreement, for the two-year period following the distribution, it is expected that we will be prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from, among other things: entering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of above a certain percentage of our stock or substantially all of our assets, whether by merger or otherwise; merging, consolidating, or liquidating; sales or transfers of our assets beyond certain thresholds; issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds; repurchasing our capital stock; amending our organizational documents in certain respects; ceasing to actively conduct certain businesses or causing our applicable affiliates to cease to actively conduct certain of their businesses; and taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders or that might increase the value of our business. Inaddition, under the tax matters agreement, we will be required to indemnify Merck against any tax liabilities as aresult of such actions, even if we did not participate in or otherwise facilitate such actions. In the event the spin-off failed to be tax-free as a result of such actions, our indemnity obligation for Merck's tax liability under thetax matters agreement would be substantial and could materially affect our cash flow. After the distribution, certain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous positions at Merck. Because of their current or former positions with Merck, certain of our initial post-distribution executive officers and directors are expected to own shares of Merck common stock and may continue to participate incertain Merck benefit programs. Following the distribution, even though our Board of Directors will consist of amajority of directors who are independent, and our expected executive officers who are currently employees ofMerck will cease to be employees of Merck, some Organon executive officers and directors will continue to havefinancial interests in Merck. Continuing ownership of Merck common stock and continued participation inMerck benefit programs could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if Organon and Merckpursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for us andMerck. We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, and the separation may adversely affect our business. The separation and distribution is expected to provide strategic and financial benefits to Organon, but such benefits may be delayed or not be realized at all or to the extent expected for a variety of reasons, including: the separation will require significant amounts of management's time and effort, which may divert management's attention from operating and growing our business; the separation will require us to implement interim operational arrangements in certain key markets, including China, to comply with existing regulatory and local manufacturing policies, which mayintroduce additional complexity to our business than if we were still part of Merck; following the separation, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of Merck; following the separation, our business will be less diversified than Merck's business prior to the separation; and 36 the other actions required to separate Merck's and our respective businesses could disrupt our operations. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we will receive in our agreements with Merck. The agreements we will enter into with Merck in connection with the separation, including one or more transition services agreements, manufacturing and supply agreements, trademark license agreements, intellectualproperty license agreements, an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement and certain othercommercial agreements, were prepared in the context of the separation while we were still a wholly ownedsubsidiary of Merck. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were prepared, wedid not have an independent board of directors or a management team that was independent of Merck. After the distribution, we will have indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to pay dividends and adversely affect our financing options and liquidity position. Prior to completion of the distribution, the Board of Directors of Organon will adopt a policy with respect to the payment of dividends on Organon common stock following the distribution. Organon currently expects that itwill pay regular cash dividends. However, we expect to have a total indebtedness of approximately $9.5 billion,consisting of term loans and 144A senior notes with such aggregate principal amount that we intend to enter intoprior to the distribution. Approximately $9.0 billion of such amount will be incurred to pay a distribution toMerck, with the remaining net proceeds intended to be used for general corporate purposes. We may also incuradditional indebtedness in the future, including to fund future acquisitions. Our current or future indebtednessmay in the future impose restrictions on us that could have material adverse consequences by: limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all; imposing restrictive covenants on our operations; requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to paying the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other corporate purposes; and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures. See \"Description of Material Indebtedness.\" Challenges in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect our ability to complete the separation and our future access to capital. Our ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or in the solvency of our customers orsuppliers or other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions. Volatility in the world financialmarkets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets. These conditions mayadversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain our credit ratings prior to and following the distribution. Risks Related to Our Common Stock We cannot be certain that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained after the distribution, and following the distribution, our stock price may fluctuate significantly. A public market for our common stock does not currently exist. We anticipate that on or prior to the record date for the distribution, trading of shares of our common stock will begin on a \"when-issued\" basis and will 37continue until the time of the distribution. We cannot predict the prices at which shares of our common stock may trade after the distribution, the liquidity of the market for our common stock after the distribution, the effectof the separation and distribution on the trading prices of our common stock or whether the combined marketvalue of the shares of our common stock and the shares of Merck common stock will be less than, equal to orgreater than the market value of Merck's common stock prior to the distribution. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate; and domestic and worldwide economic conditions. Shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits when the market price of a public company's common stock drops significantly, which lawsuits could result in substantial costs to us and could divert the timeand attention of our management and other resources. Shares of our common stock are or will be eligible for future sale, and substantial sales of such shares may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Any sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur, in connection with the distribution or otherwise, may cause the market price of our common stockto decline. We are unable to predict whether large amounts of our common stock will be sold in the open marketfollowing the distribution. Dispositions of significant amounts of our common stock or the perception in themarket that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of our common stock. We cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of any dividends on our common stock. Prior to completion of the distribution, our Board of Directors will adopt a dividend policy with respect to the payment of dividends on our common stock following the distribution. We currently expect that we will payregular cash dividends following the distribution. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any futuredividends to shareholders will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors' initialand future decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financialcondition, earnings, corporate strategy, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legalrequirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that the Board deems relevant. For more information, see\"Dividend Policy.\" Our ability to pay any dividends will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash fromoperations and access capital markets. We cannot guarantee that we will pay any dividends in the future orcontinue to pay any dividend if we commence paying dividends. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. We are a Delaware corporation and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices andinadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourageprospective acquirors to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. Specifically, because we have not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may favor. 38Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in anybusiness combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additionalshares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or their affiliates becomes the holder ofmore than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will include additional provisions that may have anti-takeover effects and may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that ourshareholders might consider in their best interests. For example, our amended and restated certificate ofincorporation and bylaws will: permit our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with such powers, rights and preferences as the Board of Directors shall determine; subject to a three-year sunset starting with our first annual meeting of shareholders, provide for a classified Board of Directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term, which could have theeffect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult; provide that, as long as our Board of Directors is classified, our directors can be removed for cause only; prohibit shareholder action by written consent; provide that special meetings of shareholders can be called only by the Board of Directors; provide that vacancies on the Board of Directors could be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; establish advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors. For additional details, see \"Description of Capital Stock\u2014Anti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions of DGCL and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\" for a further description ofcertain of these provisions. We believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directorswith more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune fromtakeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by someshareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the bestinterests of us and our shareholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove andreplace incumbent directors. In addition, these limitations may adversely affect the prevailing market price andmarket for our common stock if they are viewed as limiting the liquidity of our stock or discouraging takeoverattempts in the future. Certain of the agreements that we will enter into with Merck will require Merck's consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements. The consent and termination rights set forth in theseagreements might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable. See\"\u2014We may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions after the separation,\" \"Certain Relationshipsand Related Party Transactions\" and \"Description of Capital Stock\u2014Anti-Takeover Effects of VariousProvisions of DGCL and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\" for a moredetailed description of these agreements and provisions. In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. See \"Risks Related to the Separation and Distribution\u2014There could be significant income tax liabilityif the Spin-off or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes\" 39and \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.\" Under the tax matters agreement, we would be required to indemnify Merck for the resulting taxes, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent achange of control that shareholders may consider favorable. Our amended and restated bylaws will designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders,and the United States federal district courts as the exclusive forum for claims under the Securities Act, whichcould limit our shareholders' ability to obtain what such shareholders believe to be a favorable judicial forumfor disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that, unless we select or consent to the selection, in writing, of an alternative forum, all internal corporate claims, which include claims in the right of our company (i) thatare based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, employee or shareholder in suchcapacity or (ii) as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery, shall, to the fullest extentpermitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court doesnot have jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within the State of Delaware. Furthermore,unless we select or consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United Statesof America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arisingunder the Securities Act. Our exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability orduty created by the Exchange Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws andthe rules and regulations thereunder. These exclusive provisions may limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claimin a judicial forum that he, she or it believes to be favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or otheremployees, which may discourage such lawsuits. It is possible that a court could find these exclusive forumprovisions inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions orproceedings, and we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions,which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in adiversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors. 40Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements This information statement contains \"forward-looking statements.\" Forward-looking statements may be identified \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" meaning.

We expect our targeted dividend payout to be in the low 20s as a percentage of post-separation Adjusted Net Income. Thetiming, declaration, amount of, and payment of any dividends following the separation by Organon is within thediscretion of its Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including Organon's financial condition,earnings, corporate strategy, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certainof Organon's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability toaccess capital markets, and other factors deemed relevant by Organon's Board of Directors. Capitalization Set forth below is our capitalization at December 31, 2020, on a historical and a pro forma basis, which reflects the adjustments described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma financial information includedelsewhere in this information statement.

The spin-offwill be effected through a distribution of shares of Organon common stock to the Merck shareholders. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements of Organon give effect to the Separation and related adjustments in accordance with Article 11 of the Securities and Exchange Commission'sRegulation S-X. In May 2020, the SEC adopted Release No.33-10786 \"Amendments to Financial Disclosuresabout Acquired and Disposed Businesses,\" or the Final Rule. The Final Rule is effective on January 1, 2021 andthe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information herein is presented in accordance therewith. The unaudited condensed combined pro forma balance sheet gives effect to the Separation and related transactions described below as if they had occurred on December 31, 2020. The unaudited pro formaadjustments to the condensed combined statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 assume thatthe Separation and related transactions occurred as of January 1, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 has been derived from the audited historical combined statement of income of Organon for theyears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet asof December 31, 2020 has been derived from the audited historical combined balance sheet of Organon as ofDecember 31, 2020. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 has been adjusted to give effect to the impact of removing Merck Retained Products. See Note (a) to the unaudited proforma financial information below. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 have been prepared toreflect adjustments to Organon's historical combined financial information for the following transaction andautonomous entity adjustments: the removal of Merck Retained Products (see Note (a)) included in Organon's historical financial statements but retained by Merck; the issuance of $9.5 billion of debt at an interest rate of 3.8%; the adjustment for differences between Organon's historical combined balance sheet prepared on a carve-out basis and assets and liabilities expected to be contributed by Merck to Organon; the issuance of approximately 253,130,375 shares of Organon's common stock as part of the spin-off; the incremental costs Organon expects to incur as an autonomous entity; the one-time expenses associated with separation of Organon; and the impact of the separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement, transition services agreements, interim operating agreements, the employee matters agreement, manufacturing and supplyagreements and other commercial agreements between Organon and Merck and the provisionscontained therein.

Pro forma adjustments, including income tax, represent the impact of removing thehistorical results of Merck Retained Products from Organon's historical financial statements. (b) The pro forma condensed combined balance sheet reflects indebtedness of approximately $9.5 billion, consisting of term loans and senior notes, which are expected to be issued in connection with the Separation, andrelated debt issuance costs of $139 million. Organon plans to distribute approximately $9.0 billion of the proceedsreceived from the issuance of debt to Merck in connection with the Separation. Details of the term loans and seniornotes are as follows: ($ in millions) LIBOR plus 300 bps term loan due 2028 .......................... $3,000 LIBOR plus 300 bps euro-denominated term loan due 2028 .......... 8 9 2 4.125% secured notes due notes ....................................... 2,000 Total principal long-term debt issued ............................ $9,480 In addition, on or about the distribution date, an unsecured, unsubordinated 5-year revolving credit facility that provides for the availability of $1.0 billion of borrowings is expected to become available to Organon.No adjustment has been made to the unaudited pro forma financial information to reflect the potential drawdown on the revolving credit facility. The interest rate on the issued debt is expected to be approximately 3.8%. The pro forma condensed combined statement of income reflects estimated interest expense of $386 million related to the debt andamortization of deferred issuance costs. Interest expense was calculated assuming constant debt levelsthroughout the periods. A 1/8% change to the annual interest rate would change interest expense by$12 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. (c) Reflects the effect of manufacturing and supply agreements (MSAs) that Organon and Merck have entered into or will enter into prior to the Separation. The historical combined statement of income reflects certain Sales andCost of sales relating to the inventory transfers pursuant to newly entered or pre-existing intercompanyarrangements between Organon and Merck during the year ended December 31, 2020. The net adjustment to Salesof $75 million reflects sales price adjustments relating to such historical inventory transfers to reflect the pricingterms set forth in the MSAs, as well as incremental sales from inventory transfers from Organon to Merck expected in the first year after the Separation that also reflect the pricing terms set forth in the MSAs. The Cost of sales adjustment includes $76 million of costs expected to be incurred to manufacture the products relating to theincremental inventory transfers for Merck. The Cost of sales adjustment also includes an adjustment of $17 millionto reflect the approximate cost of products sold by Merck to Organon at the supply price set forth in the MSAs.Historically, inventory transfers from Merck to Organon were recorded at cost. (d) Reflects removal of $20 million from Accrued and other current liabilities related to certain litigation matters included in the historical combined balance sheet that will be retained by Merck. (e) Reflects the tax effects of the pro forma adjustments at the applicable statutory income tax rates.(f) The number of Organon shares used to compute basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 is based on the number of shares of Organon common stock assumed to be outstanding on December 31,2020, assuming the anticipated distribution ratio of one-tenth share of Organon common stock for each share of 48Merck common stock outstanding. The assumed number of outstanding shares of common stock is based on the number of Merck common shares of 2,531,303,747 outstanding as of March 31, 2021. (g) The number of shares used to compute diluted earnings per share is based on the number of basic shares of Organon common stock as described in Note (f) above, plus incremental shares assuming exercise of dilutiveoutstanding options and vesting of other outstanding stock awards expected to be issued by Organon as replacementawards to Merck employees transferring to Organon. (h) Reflects an adjustment to represent $500 million of cash at the balance sheet date, which is the approximate amount of cash Organon will have following the completion of the Separation. This reflects the $9.5 billion ofborrowings expected to be incurred in connection with the Separation, net of approximately $9.0 billion expected tobe distributed to Merck. (i) Reflects the addition of net benefit plan liabilities of $56 million and deferred benefit plan costs of $43 million that will be transferred to Organon by Merck prior to completion of the Separation and related transactions. The netbenefit plan liabilities are excluded from the historical combined balance sheet as Organon is not the plan sponsorfor the related benefit plans. The benefit plan expenses associated with these liabilities are included in Organon'shistorical combined statement of income. The deferred benefit plan costs relate to service crediting Merck willprovide to employees transferred to Organon in connection with the Separation for purposes of early retirementeligibility and subsidies under certain U.S.-defined benefit plan retained by Merck. The pro forma condensedcombined statement of income reflects $5 million of amortization related to the deferred benefit plan costs. (j) Represents the reclassification of Merck's net investment in Organon, including the additional net assets expected to be contributed by Merck and other pro forma adjustments, into Accumulated deficit and Commonstock, par value $0.01, to reflect the number of shares of Organon common stock expected to be outstanding atthe distribution date. The assumed number of outstanding shares of common stock is based on the number ofMerck common shares of 2,531,303,747 outstanding as of March 31, 2021 and an assumed pro-rata distributionratio of one-tenth share of Organon common stock for each share of Merck common stock. (k) For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, Organon's income tax liabilities attributable to its one-time transition tax assessed on previously undistributed earnings of itsinternational subsidiaries pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJA\") were removed. Theseincome tax liabilities were computed using a separate return methodology yielding approximately $161 millionthat was recorded within Income Taxes Payable and $1.3 billion that was recorded within Other NoncurrentLiabilities. Organon is responsible for unrecognized tax benefits, net of indirect deferred tax benefits, to the extent a reserve relates exclusively to separate tax returns filed by Organon. Accordingly, to remove unrecognized taxbenefits included in the historical combined balance sheet that were calculated on a separate return basis but willnot be settled or paid by Organon, the pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects a decrease toOther current assets in the amount of $1 million, a decrease to Other Assets in the amount of $18 million, adecrease to Income taxes payable in the amount of $18 million, and a decrease to Other Noncurrent Liabilities inthe amount of $193 million. (l) As a standalone public company, Organon expects to incur certain additional costs including costs resulting from: separation and establishment of Organon as a standalone company including incremental costs related to commercial, manufacturing, research and business support functions that were previously sharedwith Merck; costs to perform financial reporting and regulatory compliance, and costs associated with accounting, auditing, tax, legal, information technology, human resources, investor relations, risk management,treasury and other general and administrative related functions; 49 higher costs for the services to be provided by Merck to Organon under the transition services agreement with respect to information technology services, research and development, distribution,support for operations, legal, payroll, finance, tax and accounting, general administrative services andother support services; one-time expenses associated with the separation of Organon's information systems and facilities; compensation including new equity-based awards in connection with the Separation; insurance premiums; and depreciation and amortization related to information technology infrastructure investments. As a result, Organon expects to incur approximately $535 million of expenses (including one-time expenses of approximately $165 million expected to be incurred within 12 months following the completion of theSeparation), in addition to Merck's corporate and shared costs allocated in the historical combined financialstatements. Accordingly, the pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been adjusted to depictthe Company as an autonomous entity. The additional expenses have been estimated based on assumptions thatmanagement believes are reasonable. However, actual additional costs that will be incurred could be differentfrom the estimates and would depend on several factors, including the economic environment and strategicdecisions made in areas such as separation, manufacturing, selling and marketing, research and development,information technology and infrastructure. (m) The pro forma condensed combined balance sheet reflects $158 million in Accrued and other current liabilities with respect to additional employee related obligations of employees expected to be transferred fromMerck to Organon prior to separation. These liabilities were excluded from the historical combined balance sheetas the related employees were not fully dedicated to Organon. (n) The pro forma condensed combined balance sheet reflects $267 million in Other assets, $36 million in Accrued and other current liabilities and $231 million in Other Noncurrent liabilities, with respect to additionalright-of-use assets and related lease liability for Organon's real estate leases executed at December 31, 2020 thathad not yet commenced. (o) The pro forma condensed combined balance sheet reflects $110 million in Other assets with respect to a note receivable from a third party contract manufacturer expected to be contributed by Merck to Organon uponcompletion of negotiations currently ongoing with the third party. The pro forma condensed combined statementof income reflects $7 million of related interest income. 50Unaudited Pro Forma Non-GAAP Financial Measures Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP financial measures) are alternative views of our performance that we providebecause management believes this information enhances investors' understanding of our results as it permitsinvestors to understand how management assesses performance.

The selected unaudited pro forma financial information at and for the year ended December 31, 2020is unaudited and has been derived from our unaudited pro forma financial information included elsewhere in thisinformation statement. You should read this information in conjunction with the information under\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our auditedannual combined financial statements and the related notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in thisinformation statement. Organon & Co. was incorporated in Delaware on March 11, 2020 and will hold Merck'swomen's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses after the separation and distribution describedherein. The contribution of these businesses to Organon will begin to occur over a period of several months priorto the distribution, and Organon will have no operations prior to any such contribution. We have prepared ourhistorical combined financial statements as if Organon had conducted Merck's women's health, biosimilars andestablished brands businesses through all relevant periods.

Further 52discussion and a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP financial measures to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are provided in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included elsewhere in this informationstatement. The information on EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income should be considered in addition to, but not as asubstitute for or superior to, information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(\"GAAP\"). 53Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Company Overview Our operations are principally managed on a products basis and include two operating segments, the Organon Products segment and the Merck Retained Products segment. The Organon Products segment is engaged in developing and delivering innovative health solutions through our portfolio of prescription therapies within women's health, biosimilars, and established brands (the \"OrganonProducts\"). We sell these products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agenciesand managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers andother institutions. We expect to operate six manufacturing facilities in Belgium, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, theNetherlands and the UK. The Organon Products segment portfolio includes: Women's Health : We have innovative contraception and fertility brands that we believe have long-term growth potential, such as Nexplanon/Implanon NXT, globally one of the highest revenue generatingLARCs, a class of contraceptives which are recognized as the most effective type of hormonalcontraception available to patients with a lower long-term average cost. Biosimilars : Our current portfolio spans immunology and oncology treatments. We expect that our biosimilars business will continue to generate growth in the near term as we continue to expand ourexisting products into new markets. All five of the biosimilars in our portfolio have launched in certaincountries globally, including two biosimilars in the United States. Established Brands : We have a broad portfolio of established brands, which generally are beyond market exclusivity, including leading brands in cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatology andnon-opioid pain management. Our established brands portfolio generates strong operating profit whichwe anticipate will continue to fund our future growth. The Merck Retained Products segment reflects the results of certain Merck non-United States legal entities that will be contributed to Organon in connection with the spin-off (the \"Transferring Entities\" and each, a\"Transferring Entity\"). The Transferring Entities include operations related to other Merck products that will beretained by Merck (the \"Merck Retained Products\"). See \"Basis of Presentation of Our Financial Information.\" Separation from Merck On May 7, 2021, the board of directors of Merck approved the spin-off of its women's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent publicly traded company, Organon & Co., through adistribution of our publicly traded stock to Merck shareholders. Completion of the spin-off is subject to certain conditions which are described more fully under \"The Separation and Distribution\u2014Conditions to the Distribution,\" including receipt of the Tax Opinions from the TaxAdvisors to the effect that the distribution and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to Merck and itsshareholders under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code. Basis of Presentation of Our Financial Information Our audited historical combined financial statements have been prepared on a standalone basis and are derived from Merck's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The combined financialstatements reflect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as we were operated as part ofMerck prior to the spin-off, in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of theCompany have been reflected in our combined financial statements on a historical cost basis, as included in the 54consolidated financial statements of Merck, using the historical accounting policies applied by Merck. These combined financial statements do not purport to reflect what our results of operations, comprehensive income,financial position, equity or cash flows would have been had we operated as a standalone public company duringthe periods presented. Our combined financial statements were prepared following a legal entity approach, which resulted in the inclusion of the following: Certain assets and liabilities, results of operations and cash flows attributable to the sales of products in the Organon Products segment that will be contributed to us prior to the consummation of the spin-off,and The Transferring Entities, which have historically included the results from the sales of products included both in the Organon Products segment and the Merck Retained Products segment. EachTransferring Entity's historical operations, including its results of operations, assets and liabilities, andcash flows have been fully reflected in these combined financial statements; however, prior to theconsummation of the spin-off, the products in the Merck Retained Products segment will becontributed to newly formed Merck entities that will be retained by Merck. Upon full contribution ofthe Merck Retained Products by us to Merck and its affiliates, the historical results of operations ofsuch products in the Merck Retained Products segment will be reflected as discontinued operations inthe Organon financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2020, in contemplation of the spin-off: The Merck Retained Products business in certain Transferring Entities was distributed to Merck affiliates (the \"MRP Distribution\") and the Merck Retained Products segment's results of operations,assets and liabilities, and cash flows for such Transferring Entities are included in these combinedfinancial statements through the date of distribution to Merck affiliates. The Organon Products business in certain jurisdictions has been transferred by Merck affiliates to legal entities established to operate the Organon Products business and, as noted above, such entities will becontributed to Organon (the \"Organon Entities\"). Our businesses have historically functioned together with the other businesses controlled by Merck. Accordingly, we relied on Merck's corporate and other support functions for our business. Therefore, certaincorporate and shared costs have been allocated to us (see Note 2 to our audited annual combined financialstatements). Management believes these cost allocations are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to, or the benefit derived by, us during the periods presented, though the allocations may not be indicative of theactual costs that would have been incurred had we operated as a standalone public company. Actual costs thatmay have been incurred had we been a standalone company would depend on a number of factors, including thechosen organizational structure, whether functions were outsourced or performed by our employees, and strategicdecisions made in areas such as manufacturing, selling and marketing, research and development, informationtechnology and infrastructure. The combined balance sheet reflects all of the assets and liabilities that are either specifically identifiable or are directly attributable to us and our operations, as well as the assets and liabilities attributable to MerckRetained Products in the Transferring Entities. However, the balance sheet at December 31, 2020 excludes theassets and liabilities of the Merck Retained Products in certain Transferring Entities that were distributed to theParent in the fourth quarter of 2020 as part of the MRP Distribution. The assets and liabilities in the remainingTransferring Entities attributable to Merck Retained Products will be distributed to the Parent prior to thespin-off. Property, plant and equipment reflected in the combined balance sheet is primarily attributable to the sixmanufacturing facilities we expect to operate. No assets or liabilities are reflected in the combined balance sheetfor amounts related to derivatives and hedging activities. 55Merck maintains various employee benefit plans which our employees participate in, and a portion of the costs associated with these plans has been included in our combined financial statements. The combined balancesheet only includes assets and liabilities relating to plans for which the entity being transferred is the plansponsor; most of these plans are on the Transferring Entities and substantially all of the related assets andliabilities were transferred to Merck as part of the MRP Distribution in the fourth quarter of 2020 or will be priorto the spin-off. Income tax expense and deferred tax balances in the combined financial statements have been calculated on a separate tax return basis. Our operations are included in the tax returns of certain Organon Entities,Transferring Entities or the respective Merck entities of which our business is a part. In the future, as astandalone company, we will file tax returns on our own behalf, and our deferred taxes and effective income taxrate may differ from those in the historical periods. Merck utilizes a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its operations. Cash generated by us is routinely transferred into accounts managed by Merck's centralized treasury function and cashdisbursements for our operations are funded as needed by Merck. Cash and cash equivalents of the OrganonEntities and the Transferring Entities are reflected in our combined balance sheet. Balances held by the OrganonEntities and the Transferring Entities with Merck for cash transfers and loans are reflected as Due from related party, Due to related party orRelated Party Loans Payable . All other cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and related transfers between Merck and us are generally held centrally through accounts controlledand maintained by Merck and are not specifically identifiable to us. Accordingly, such balances have beenaccounted for through Net investment from Parent . Merck's third-party debt and related interest expense have not been attributed to us because we are not the legal obligor of the debt and the borrowings are not specificallyidentifiable to us. However, in connection with the spin-off, we expect to incur indebtedness as set forth under\"Description of Certain Indebtedness.\" Such indebtedness would cause us to record additional interest expense infuture periods. Relationship with Merck Following the spin-off, certain functions that Merck provided to us prior to the spin-off will either continue to be provided to us by Merck under a transition services agreement or will be performed using our ownresources or third-party service providers. Additionally, under manufacturing and supply agreements, we willmanufacture certain products for Merck or its applicable affiliate and Merck will manufacture certain productsfor us or our applicable affiliate. We expect to incur certain costs in establishing ourselves as a standalone publiccompany, as well as ongoing additional costs associated with operating as an independent, publicly tradedcompany. Concurrent with the spin-off, we will enter into certain agreements with Merck. See \"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u2014Agreements with Merck.\" Key Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations Generic Competition : The majority of our established brands products are beyond market exclusivity. However, these products continue to represent a significant value opportunity arising from long-termsustainable revenue streams and well-established supply chains that together generate significantoperating profit relative to low promotional and development expenses. Sustained Shift Towards Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives : Although daily contraceptive pills remain the largest market segment, the LARC market segment, which includes Nexplanon/ImplanonNXT, has experienced significant growth in the years leading up to 2019 due to a sustained shift fromdaily oral contraception to LARC. This was driven by payors, providers and patients looking foroptions beyond commonly used daily contraceptive pills. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected 56the LARC segment during 2020 due to clinic closures and the postponement of non-essential medical procedures during country lockdowns. However, LARC segment growth quickly rebounded duringmonths when clinic restrictions were removed and the sustained shift to LARC is expected to continuewith fundamental drivers unchanged. Increased Access to Fertility Solutions : We believe governments and payors are implementing favorable policies across major markets that, in turn, drive growth in the market for women's healththerapies. For example, in the United States, there has been an increase in fertility insurance mandatesand employer coverage, albeit subject to certain exemptions. Emergence of Biosimilars : Biologics continue to experience strong growth trends. However, given the high cost of many of these treatments, biosimilars, as a more affordable alternative, represent asignificant opportunity for patients, providers, and payors once a biologics product loses patentprotection. Moreover, a significant number of biologics are expected to lose exclusivity over the nextdecade, representing a large opportunity for more biosimilar approvals. Increased Competitive Pressures : The markets in which we conduct our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. Our competitorsinclude other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies withmore limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers. COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization (\"WHO\") declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Although COVID-19-relateddisruptions, including patients' inability to access health care providers, prioritization of COVID-19 patients, aswell as social distancing measures have negatively affected our results, we remain confident in the underlyingdemand for our products. In 2020, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to Organon Products segment sales was estimated to be approximately $400 million. A significant portion of our revenue is comprised of physician-administeredproducts, which, despite underlying demand, have been affected by social distancing measures, as well as fewermedical visits and elective procedures. These impacts, as well as the prioritization of COVID-19 patients athealth care providers, resulted in reduced administration of many products within established brands andwomen's health, in particular Nexplanon/Implanon NXT, throughout 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic also had anegative effect on sales within the Merck Retained Products segment as discussed below. We believe that global health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but our assumption is that ongoing residual negative impacts will persist, particularly during the firsthalf of 2021. We expect that the negative impact to Organon Products segment revenues in 2021 will be less thanthe negative impact in 2020, principally affecting products within established brands and women's health,primarily Nexplanon/Implanon NXT. The COVID-19 pandemic will also continue to negatively affect saleswithin the Merck Retained Products segment in 2021. Operating expenses in 2020 were positively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily driven by lower promotional and selling costs as discussed below. 57Operating Results ($ in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Sales ............................................. $8,096 $9,530 $9,777 Costs, Expenses and Other Cost of 4,693 Selling, general 2,013 Research and development ........................ 3 0 4 3 3 2 3 6 5 Restructuring costs .............................. 7 0 1 0 1 1 1 9 Other (income) expense, net ....................... 2 9 ( 1 ) 2,729 Taxes on Income ................................... 5 2 0 3 3 7 5 7 6 Net Income ........................................ $2,160 $3,218 $2,153 Sales Overview ($ in millions) 2020 % Change% Change Excluding Foreign Exchange 2019 % Change% Change Excluding Foreign Exchange 2018 United States .................... $1,402 (30)% (30)% Worldwide were $8.1 billion in 2020, a decline of 15% compared with 2019. Sales for the Organon Products segment were $6.5 billion in 2020, a decline of 16% compared with 2019, primarily due to recentgeneric competition for women's health product NuvaRing, and ongoing generic competition for products withinthe established brands business, particularly for respiratory products Singulair and Nasonex, and cardiovascularproducts Zetia and Vytorin. As described above, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected sales in 2020,contributing to declines in established brands, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular products, as well asdeclines in women's health products, particularly Nexplanon/Implanon NXT, Follistim AQ and Orgalutran. TheOrganon Products segment sales decline was partially offset by revenue resulting from an arrangement for thesale of generic etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring, higher sales of biosimilars resulting from the continueduptake of Renflexis in existing markets and the launch of Ontruzant into new markets, as well as higher sales ofcardiovascular product Atozet. We expect Organon Products segment revenues to decline in 2021 relative to2020, but the 2021 decline is expected to be more modest than the decline experienced in 2020, as a result ofgrowth in Nexplanon/Implanon and biosimilars and ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales forthe Merck Retained Products segment were $1.6 billion in 2020, a decline of 11% compared with 2019. Worldwide sales were $9.5 billion in 2019, a decline of 3% compared with 2018. Sales for the Organon Products segment were $7.8 billion in 2019, a decline of 6% compared with 2018, primarily due to ongoinggeneric competition in the established brands business, particularly for Zetia, Vytorin, Nasonex, antidepressantRemeron, and non-opioid pain product Arcoxia. resulting from the ongoing launchesof Renflexis, Ontruzant and Brenzys, as well as Nexplanon/Implanon NXT, and cardiovascularproducts Rosuzet and Atozet, partially offset the Organon Products segment revenue decline. Sales for the MerckRetained Products segment were $1.8 billion in 2019, an increase of 18% compared with 2018. 58Sales by Product Details Sales of our products were as follows: ($ in millions) 2020 2019 2018 U.S. Int'l Total U.S. Int'l Total U.S. Int'l Total Organon Products Segment Women's Health Nexplanon/Implanon ....................$ 4 8 8$ 1 9 2$ 6 8 0$ 5 6 8$ 2 1 9$ 7 8 7$ 4 9 5$ 2 0 8$ 7 0 3 NuvaRing ............................. 1 1 0 1 2 7 2 3 6 7 4 2 1 3 6 8 7 9 7 2 2 1 8 0 9 0 2 Follistim AQ ........................... 8 4 1 0 9 1 9 3 1 0 3 1 3 8 2 4 1 1 1 5 1 5 3 2 6 8 Orgalutran ............................. 1 1 6 9 8 1 2 5 8 6 1 1 2 4 8 9 3 1 4 1 Cerazette .............................. \u2014 6 7 6 7 \u2014 7 1 7 1 \u2014 9 0 9 0 Biosimilars Renflexis .............................. 1 2 2 1 3 1 3 5 9 4 3 9 7 2 6 1 2 7 Ontruzant ............................. 3 1 1 3 1 1 5 \u2014 8 3 8 3 \u2014 2 0 2 0 Brenzys ............................... \u2014 7 4 7 4 \u2014 7 2 7 2 \u2014 1 6 1 6 Established Brands Cardiovascular Zetia .............................

Organon Products Segment Women's Health ($ in millions) 2020 % Change% Change Excluding Foreign Exchange 2019 % Change% Change Excluding a single-rod subdermal contraceptive implant, declined 14% in 2020 primarily due to lower demand in the United States and in the EU resulting from the COVID-19pandemic. Global sales of Nexplanon/Implanon NXT grew 12% in 2019 primarily due to higher demand andpricing in the United States. Worldwide sales of NuvaRing, a vaginal contraceptive product, declined 73% in 2020 due to generic competition in the United States. The patent that provided market exclusivity for NuvaRing in the United Statesexpired in April 2018 and generic competition began in December 2019. Accordingly, we are experiencing arapid and substantial decline in NuvaRing sales in the United States and we expect the decline to continue. Inaddition to sales of branded NuvaRing, we have an agreement with a generic manufacturer that authorizes thesale of generic etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. Under the terms of the agreement, we are reimbursedon a cost-plus basis by the generic manufacturer for supplying finished goods and receive a share of the netprofits recorded by the generic manufacturer. In 2020, we recorded revenue of $148 million related to thisarrangement. We expect revenue under this arrangement to decline significantly in 2021. Global NuvaRing sales declined 3% in 2019 primarily due to lower demand in the EU due to ongoing generic competition, largely offsetby higher sales in the United States reflecting higher pricing that was partially offset by lower demand. Fertility Worldwide sales of Follistim AQ (marketed in most countries outside the United States as Puregon), a fertility treatment, declined 20% in 2020 largely due to lower demand globally resulting from the COVID-19pandemic. Worldwide sales of Follistim AQ declined 10% in 2019 primarily due to lower demand in the EU andin the United States, partially offset by higher demand in China. Worldwide sales of Orgalutran, a fertility treatment, declined 28% in 2020 primarily due to lower pricing in the United States, as well as lower demand in international markets attributable both to the COVID-19 pandemicand generic competition. Worldwide sales decreased 21% in 2019 primarily due to lower demand in the UnitedStates as a result of generic competition.

See \"Business\u2014Third-Party Agreements\u2014Samsung BioepisDevelopment and Commercialization Agreement\" and Note 4 to our annual combined financial statements. Ourcommercialization territories under the agreement vary by product as noted below. Renflexis (infliximab-abda) is a biosimilar to Remicade (infliximab) for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases. Sales growth in 2020 and 2019 was driven primarily by continued uptake in the UnitedStates since launch in 2017. Higher demand in Canada also contributed to the sales increase in 2020. We haveworldwide commercialization rights to Renflexis in countries outside the EU, Korea, China, Turkey and Russia. Ontruzant (trastuzumab-dttb) is a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for of HER2- cancer and HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junctionadenocarcinoma. Sales growth in 2020 was driven by the launch in Brazil. Sales growth in 2019 was driven bycontinued uptake in the EU since launch in early 2018. In December 2019, the WHO announced that Ontruzant isthe first biosimilar medicine approved for WHO pre-qualification. With this designation, Ontruzant is eligible forprocurement through international agencies, which could give many more women with HER2-positive breastcancer access to this essential medicine in low-income countries. We have worldwide commercialization rightsto Ontruzant in countries outside of Korea and China. Brenzys (etanercept) is a biosimilar to Enbrel (etanercept) for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases. Sales in 2020 were relatively flat compared to 2019. Sales growth in 2019 was driven by the launch inBrazil. We have worldwide commercialization rights to Brenzys in countries outside of the United States, theEU, Korea, China and Japan. Aybintio (bevacizumab) is a biosimilar to Avastin (bevacizumab) for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma,metastatic cervical cancer, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and metastatic breastcancer. Aybintio was approved in the EU in August 2020 and was launched in September 2020. We currentlyhave no plan for the timing of any launch of Aybintio in the United States nor do we know when such timingwould be determined. We have commercialization rights to Aybintio in the United States, Canada, Germany,Italy, France, the UK and Spain. Hadlima (adalimumab-bwwd) is a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab) for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases. We have worldwide commercialization rights to Hadlima in countries outside of the EU,Korea, China, Turkey and Russia. Samsung Bioepis reached a global settlement with AbbVie permitting us tolaunch Hadlima in the United States in June 2023 and outside of the United States starting in 2021. Hadlima iscurrently approved in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Israel. Hadlima was launched in Australia andCanada in February 2021. Established Brands Established brands represents a broad portfolio of well-known brands, which generally are beyond market exclusivity, including leading brands in cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatology and non-opioid painmanagement, for which generic competition varies by market.

The patent thatprovided market exclusivity for Ezetrol in Japan expired in September 2019 and generic competition began inJune 2020. The EU patents for Ezetrol and Inegy expired in April 2018 and April 2019, respectively.Accordingly, the Company is experiencing sales declines in these markets as a result of generic competition andexpects the declines to continue. The overall sales decline in 2020 also reflects lower pricing due to loss ofexclusivity in Australia. Partially offsetting the sales decline in 2020 were higher sales of Ezetrol in China,reflecting higher demand that was partly offset by lower pricing. Combined global sales of Zetia and Vytorindeclined 35% in 2019 primarily due to lower sales in the EU, as well as in Australia due to generic competition. Sales of Atozet (marketed outside of the United States), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, grew 16% in 2020 primarily due to higher demand in most markets, particularly in the EU, Japan and other countriesin the Asia Pacific region. Sales of Atozet grew 13% in 2019 primarily due to higher demand in the EU andKorea. Sales of Rosuzet (marketed outside of the United States), a medicine for lowering LDL cholesterol, grew 8% in 2020 primarily due to higher demand in Korea and Japan. We expect sales of Rosuzet to decline in 2021due to the expiration of a distribution agreement in Korea. Sales of Rosuzet more than doubled in 2019, primarilydue to the launch in Japan, as well as higher demand in Korea. Combined global sales of Cozaar, and its companion agent Hyzaar (a combination of Cozaar and hydrochlorothiazide that is marketed in Japan as Preminent), a medicine for the treatment of hypertension,declined 13% in 2020 primarily due to lower demand in China, Japan and the EU. Combined global sales ofCozaar and Hyzaar declined 3% in 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. Excludingthe unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales performance reflects higher demand in the Asia Pacific region,particularly in China, partially offset by lower demand and lower pricing in Japan. Worldwide sales of Zocor, a statin for modifying cholesterol, declined 31% in 2020 primarily due to lower demand in China, and decreased 7% in 2019 primarily due to lower sales in the EU and Japan. Respiratory ($ in millions) 2020 % Change% Change Excluding Foreign Exchange 2019 % Change% Change Excluding % 2 1 7 (4)% (4)% 227 Worldwide sales of Singulair, a once-a-day oral medicine for the chronic treatment of asthma and for the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, declined 34% in 2020 primarily due to lower demand in China and Japanattributable in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Global sales of Singulair declined 1% in 2019 primarilyreflecting the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, salesperformance in 2019 reflects higher demand in China and a favorable adjustment to customer discounts in theUnited States, largely offset by lower demand and lower pricing in Japan and the EU. Global sales of Dulera Inhalation Aerosol, a combination medicine for the treatment of asthma, increased 2% in 2020 due to higher demand in Canada. We expect sales of Dulera to decline in 2021 due to genericcompetition in the United States. Sales of Dulera declined 4% in 2019 due to lower demand in the United States. 62Global sales of Nasonex, an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms, declined 26% in 2020 primarily due to continued generic competition in Japan, as well as lower demand inseveral other international markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher demand inChina. Global sales decreased 22% in 2019 primarily due to ongoing generic competition in Japan and the UnitedStates.

Global sales of Proscar increased 10% in 2019 due to highervolumes in China reflecting a recovery from supply constraints in the prior year. Worldwide sales of Remeron , for the treatment of depression, declined 22% in 2020 and 38% in 2019 primarily due to lower demand in Japan. Remeron lost market exclusivity in Japan in December 2018.

As discussed above, prior to the consummation of the spin-off, the products in the Merck Retained Products segment will be contributed to newly formed Merck entities that will be retained by Merck. Upon fullcontribution of the Merck Retained Products segment by us to Merck and its affiliates, the historical results ofoperations of such products in the Merck Retained Products segment will be reflected as discontinued operationsin the Organon financial statements. As described in \"Basis of Presentation of Our Financial Information\" above,the MRP Distribution that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 contributed to lower sales of the MerckRetained Products in 2020 compared with 2019. 63Keytruda is an anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy approved for the treatment of many types of cancer. Sales of Keytruda in the Transferring Entities grew 7% in 2020 and 60% in 2019 primarily driven byhigher demand reflecting both uptake across approved indications and the launch of new indications in the UK,Brazil and Switzerland entities. However, the COVID-19 pandemic had a dampening effect on growing demandin 2020. Sales growth in 2020 was partially offset by lower sales resulting from the MRP Distribution. Januvia and Janumet are medicines that help lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. Combined sales of Januvia and Janumet in the Transferring Entities declined 31% in 2020 largely due to lowervolumes in the UK entity attributable in part to the MRP Distribution, as well as lower pricing in the Brazilentity. Combined sales of Januvia and Janumet in the Transferring Entities were relatively flat in 2019 comparedwith 2018. Gardasil/Gardasil 9 are vaccines to help prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in the Transferring Entities declined 27% in 2020due to lower demand in the UK entity attributable both to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the MRP Distribution.Sales of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in the Transferring Entities grew 11% in 2019 primarily due to higher volumes inthe UK entity. Zostavax is a vaccine to help prevent shingles (herpes zoster) in adults 50 years of age and older. Sales of Zostavax in the Transferring Entities declined 23% in 2020 and 15% in 2019 primarily due to lower governmenttenders in the UK. The sales decline in 2020 was also attributable to the MRP Distribution. Simponi is a once-monthly subcutaneous treatment for certain inflammatory diseases. Sales of Simponi in the Transferring Entities declined 30% in 2020 and 25% in 2019 primarily driven by lower demand in the UKentities due to the launch of biosimilars for a competing product. The sales decline in 2020 was also attributableto the MRP Distribution. Varivax is a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella). Sales of Varivax in the Transferring Entities declined 99% in 2020 driven by lower sales in the Brazil entity due to government tenders. Sales growth ofVarivax in the Transferring Entities in 2019 was driven by higher sales in the Brazil entity due to governmenttenders. Costs, Expenses and Other ($ in millions) 2020 % Change 2019 % Change 2018 Cost of sales ....................................... $3,347 (8)% 332 (9)% 365 Restructuring costs .................................. 7 0 (31)% 101 (15)% 119 Other (income) expense, net ........................... 2 9 * 1 ) * (142) $5,416 (9)% $5,975 (15)% $7,048 * Calculation not meaningful. Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets which totaled $85 million in 2020, $285 million in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018. The decline in amortization expenses in 2020 compared with 2019is primarily due to the intangible assets related to Nasonex, Clarinex and Atozet, which were fully amortized atthe end of 2019. The decline in amortization expenses in 2019 as compared with 2018 is primarily due to theintangible assets related to Zetia and Vytorin, which were almost fully amortized at the end of 2018. 64Gross margin was 58.7% in 2020, 62.0% in 2019 and 52.0% in 2018. The gross margin decline in 2020 compared with 2019 reflects pricing pressure and product mix, partially offset by lower amortization ofintangible assets as noted above. The gross margin increase in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily due tolower amortization of intangible assets noted above. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses declined 13% in 2020 primarily due to lower selling and promotional costs, reflecting lower travel and meeting expenses, due in part to the impact of the COVID-19pandemic, as well as lower costs due to the MRP Distribution. These declines were partially offset by costsincurred to establish Organon as a standalone entity. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined 5% in2019 primarily due to lower selling and promotional costs on products within established brands, partially offsetby higher spending to support the ongoing launches of biosimilars and higher spending on the Merck RetainedProducts, particularly Keytruda. Research and Development Research and development expenses declined 9% in 2020 primarily due to lower costs from post-marketing research activities, as well as lower costs due to the MRP Distribution, partially offset by higher spendingassociated with Organon development programs. Research and development expenses declined 9% in 2019,primarily reflecting lower costs from post-marketing research activities, as well as lower spending driven by theconclusion of certain clinical development programs. The decline was partially offset by higher spending forclinical trials and research collaborations associated with the Merck Retained Products. Restructuring Costs Certain of our operations have been affected by restructuring plans initiated by Merck. These restructuring plans include a global restructuring program approved in 2019 focused primarily on further optimizing Merck'smanufacturing and supply network and reducing its global real estate footprint. Our operations were also affectedby previous restructuring plans designed to streamline Merck's cost structure, which included the elimination ofpositions in sales, administrative and headquarters organizations, as well as the sale or closure of certainmanufacturing and research and development sites, and the consolidation of office facilities. Separation costsincurred were associated with actual headcount reductions made by Merck, as well as those headcount reductionsthat were probable and could be reasonably estimated. Also included in restructuring costs are costs associatedwith facilities to be sold or closed, asset abandonment, shut-down and other related costs (see Note 5 to ouraudited annual combined financial statements).

Organon Products segment profits grew 29% in 2019 primarily due to lower amortization of intangible assets. Declines in selling and promotional spending related to established brands, lower research anddevelopment spending resulting from the conclusion of certain clinical trials, and lower restructuring costs alsocontributed to the increase in Organon Products segment profits. Partially offsetting Organon Products segmentprofit growth in 2019 were lower sales, as well as unfavorability in other (income) expense, net, largely due to again on the settlement of certain patent litigation recorded in 2018. Merck Retained Products Segment Merck Retained Products segment losses declined 49% in 2020 primarily due to lower selling and promotional spending, partially offset by lower sales and unfavorability in other (income) expense, net. Merck Retained Products segment losses increased 3% in 2019 primarily reflecting higher selling and promotional spending and unfavorability in other (income) expense, net, partially offset by higher sales. Taxes on Income The effective income tax rates of 19.4% in 2020, 9.5% in 2019 and 21.1% in 2018 reflect the beneficial impact of foreign earnings and the unfavorable impact of the amortization of intangible assets. The effectiveincome tax rate in 2019 also reflects the favorable impact of a $258 million net tax benefit related to thesettlement of certain federal income tax matters. Net Income Net income was $2.2 billion in 2020, $3.2 billion in 2019 and $2.2 billion in 2018. 66EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income Earnings before interest, incomes taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP financial measures) are alternative views of our performance that we providebelow because management believes this information enhances investors' understanding of our results as itpermits investors to understand how management assesses performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA andAdjusted Net income are expected to be important internal measures for us. Our management intends to use thesemeasures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure our performance along with othermetrics. Also, we anticipate that our senior management's annual compensation will be derived in part usingthese non-GAAP measures. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important metrics for debtinvestors who utilize debt to EBITDA ratios. Since EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income arenot measures determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAPand, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of a similar measure of other companies. These metricsshould be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information prepared in accordancewith GAAP. As discussed above, our combined balance sheet and statement of income do not include anallocation of third-party debt or interest expense from Merck because we were not the legal obligor of the debtand because Merck's borrowings were not directly attributable to our business. However, in connection with thespin-off, we expect to incur debt and such indebtedness would cause us to record additional interest expense infuture periods. See \"Description of Certain Indebtedness.\" Organon Products Adjusted EBITDA and Organon Products Adjusted Net Income Organon Products Adjusted EBITDA and Organon Products Adjusted Net Income exclude Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Loss attributable to the Merck Retained Products. As noted above, prior to theconsummation of the spin-off, the Merck Retained Products will be contributed to newly formed Merck entitiesthat will be retained by Merck and the historical results of operations related to the Merck Retained Products willbe reflected as discontinued operations in the Organon financial statements.

Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are as follows: The amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with business acquisitions and licensing activities (see Note 8 to our audited annual combined financial statements). Costs related to restructuring actions, including employee separation costs and costs associated with facilities to be sold or closed, asset abandonment, shut-down and other related costs (see Note 5 to ouraudited annual combined financial statements). Other items are adjusted for after they are evaluated on an individual basis considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects. Typically, these consist of items that are unusual in nature,significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Excludedfrom Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income in 2020 are costs incurred to establish Organon as astandalone entity, primarily employee-related and information technology costs. Excluded fromAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income in 2018 is a gain on the settlement of certain patentlitigation (see Note 10 to our audited annual combined financial statements). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by definition exclude all income taxes. Adjusted Net Income excludes the estimated tax benefit on the reconciling items and a net tax benefit related to the settlement ofcertain federal income tax matters in 2019 (see Note 14 to our audited annual combined financialstatements). Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources Historic Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically participated in Merck's centralized treasury management, including its centralized cash pooling and overall financing arrangements. We have historically generated, and expect to continue to generate,positive cash flow from operations. Due to our participation in Merck's centralized treasury management, theonly cash and cash equivalents we have reported on our balance sheet are attributable to the Organon Entities andthe Transferring Entities. 68Working capital was $894 million in 2020, $2.6 billion in 2019 and $2.2 billion in 2018. The decrease in working capital in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to an increase in related party current liabilitiescoupled with a decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the establishment of new Organon Entitiesand subsequent activity between these entities and Merck affiliates. The decline in working capital in 2020 wasalso attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable due to lower sales and the MRP Distribution, a decline inprepaid taxes and lower inventory also related to the MRP Distribution. The increase in working capital in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in inventories and a related increase in the income tax consequences deferred for intra-entity inventory transfersreflected in other current assets, a decrease in related party current liabilities due to activity during the period andtiming of settlement, a decline in income taxes payable, and an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion in 2020, $2.8 billion in 2019 and $3.7 billion in 2018. Cash provided by operating activities is being unfavorably affected by sales declines. The lower cash provided byoperating activities in 2019 compared with 2018 is also attributable in part to higher tax payments related tosettlements with the Internal Revenue Service. Cash used in investing activities was $258 million in 2020, $102 million in 2019 and $69 million in 2018, mostly reflecting capital expenditures. Cash used in financing activities was $2.2 billion in 2020, $2.6 billion in 2019 and $4.2 billion in 2018, reflecting transactions with Merck (see Note 17 to our audited annual combined financial statements). Merck has accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions in certain countries to sell accounts receivable. Merck factored $227 million and $488 million of accounts receivable related to us in thefourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively, under these factoring arrangements, which reduced outstandingaccounts receivable. The cash received from the financial institutions is reported within operating activities in thecombined statement of cash flows. Post Spin-Off Liquidity and Capital Resources Subsequent to the spin-off, we will no longer participate in cash management and funding arrangements with Merck. Our ability to fund our operations and capital needs depends upon our ability to generate ongoingcash from operations and to access the capital markets. Our principal uses of cash in the future will be primarilyto fund our operations, working capital needs, capital expenditures, repayment of borrowings, payment ofdividends and strategic business development transactions . We expect to incur indebtedness in connection with the spin-off, of which a portion will be paid to Merck as a distribution. See \"Description of Certain Indebtedness.\" Following the debt incurrence, distribution to Merckand cash contributed from Merck in connection with the formation of various Organon entities, we expect tobegin operations as an independent company with cash and cash equivalents as set forth under \"Capitalization.\"We believe that our financing arrangements, future cash from operations and access to capital markets willprovide adequate resources to fund our future cash flow needs. Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 were as follows: Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Total 2021 2022\u20142023 2024\u20142025 Thereafter Purchase $308 $260 $216 Leases(2)......................................... 7 9 2 9 3 $1,033 $192 $343 $279 $219 (1) Includes inventory purchase commitments. (2) Amounts exclude reasonably certain lease renewals that have not yet been executed (see Note 9 to our audited annual combined financial statements). 69Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services. Payments of the transition tax related to the TCJA are not reflected in the table above as this liability will beretained by Merck pursuant to the tax matters agreement that Merck and Organon will enter into in connectionwith the separation. In addition, Organon is expected to be responsible for unrecognized tax benefits pursuant tothe tax matters agreement to the extent a reserve relates exclusively to separate tax returns filed by Organon.These reserves amounted to $50 million at December 31, 2020. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regardingthe timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits beyond one year, a reasonableestimate of the period of cash settlement for years beyond 2021 cannot be made and as such, are not reflected inthe table above. Contingent milestone payments related to collaborative arrangements are not reflected in thetable above because they are not considered contractual obligations until the successful achievement of therelated regulatory approval milestones. Financial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures Foreign Currency Risk Management We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign exchange riskwith respect to forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the euro, Japanese yen and Chineserenminbi. Merck manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on its affiliate's earnings, cash flowsand fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financialinstruments, including derivative instruments. Merck has established revenue hedging and balance sheet riskmanagement programs to protect against the volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fairvalue caused by volatility in exchange rates that we participate in. Accordingly, the combined statement ofincome includes the impact of Merck's derivative financial instruments that is deemed to be associated with ouroperations and has been allocated to us utilizing a proportional allocation method. The fair values of outstandingderivative instruments have not been allocated to our combined balance sheet. Following the spin-off, we intendto implement a foreign currency risk management program on our own behalf. We estimate a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Management Our combined balance sheet and statement of income do not include an allocation of third-party debt or interest expense from Merck because we are not the legal obligor of the debt and the borrowings were notdirectly attributable to our business. We expect to incur indebtedness in connection with the spin-off, at whichtime our exposure to interest rate risk is expected to increase. Critical Accounting Estimates The audited annual combined financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used indetermining the allocation of costs and expenses from Merck, and are used in determining such items asprovisions for sales discounts and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories,valuation of goodwill and intangibles, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities and otherreserves, pension and share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, and taxes on income. Becauseof the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition Recognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract, probable collection of sales proceeds and completion of substantially all performance obligations. We act as the principal in our customer arrangements 70and therefore record revenue on a gross basis. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation\u2014the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overallcustomer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed aseparately recognized performance obligation. Revenues from sales of products, including sales of Merck Retained Products to affiliates by the Organon Entities and the Transferring Entities, are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred tothe customer, which we have determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to thecustomer and we are entitled to payment. The nature of our business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method, although the mostlikely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts. In the United States, sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with alimited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts andreturns, which are established at the time of sale. In addition, revenues are recorded net of time value of moneydiscounts if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year. The provision for aggregate customer discounts in the United States covers chargebacks and rebates. Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler.The contracted customer generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up.The wholesaler, in turn, charges us back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and thecontract price paid to the wholesaler by the customer. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventorylevels. Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with privatesector and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the productby a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well asinventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. We usehistorical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels inthe distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate theexpected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis throughcomparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefitmanagers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. We continually monitor our provision for aggregate customer discounts. There were no material adjustments to estimates associated with the aggregate customer discount provision in 2020, 2019 or 2018. Summarized information about changes in the aggregate customer discount accrual related to sales in the United States is as follows: ($ in millions) 2020 2019 Balance January 1 .................................. $ 3 6 5 $ 4 0 4 Provision ......................................... 1,770 1,885 Payments ......................................... (1,792) (1,924) Balance December 31 ............................... $ 3 4 3 $ 3 6 5 Accruals for chargebacks are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts receivable and accruals for rebates as current liabilities. The accrued balances relative to these provisions included in Accounts receivable and Accrued and other current liabilities were $41 million and $302 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and were $52 million and $313 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. 71Outside of the United States, variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly competitive product classes, discounts required to gain or maintainreimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates. In certain European countries, legislatively mandated rebatesare calculated based on an estimate of the government's total unbudgeted spending and our specific paybackobligation. Rebates may also be required based on specific product sales thresholds. We apply an estimatedfactor against our actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate obligationsassociated with the sale. We maintain a returns policy that allows our customers in the United States to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12months after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experiencewith actual returns. Additionally, we consider factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel,product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of genericcompetition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. Outside of the UnitedStates, returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis. Our payment terms for customers in the United States are typically 36 days from receipt of invoice. Outside of the United States, payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets have longerpayment terms. Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities We are involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to our business, including product liability, intellectual property, and commercial litigation, as well as certain additional mattersincluding governmental and environmental matters (see Note 10 to our audited annual combined financialstatements). We record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additionalinformation becomes available. For product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuariallydetermined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claimsincurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable andreasonably estimable. Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legaldefense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by us; the development of our legal defense strategy andstructure in light of the scope of the litigation; the number of cases being brought against us; the costs andoutcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, andrelated costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal defense reserves asof December 31, 2020 and 2019 of approximately $35 million and $40 million, respectively, represents our bestestimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with our outstanding litigation;however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of the litigation couldaffect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by us. We will continue to monitor our legaldefense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves atany time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, we believe it would be appropriate to do so. We believe that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on us. Expenditures for remediation and environmentalliabilities were $1 million in 2020, and are estimated at $18 million in the aggregate for the years 2021 through2025. In management's opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonablyestimable have been accrued and totaled $24 million and $21 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, 72respectively. These liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily overthe next 15 years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or theultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that maybe incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed $20 million in the aggregate. Management also doesnot believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results ofoperations or liquidity for any year. Impairments of Long-Lived Assets We assess changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of our property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibleassets. We periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of our long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, anestimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to thecarrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss ismeasured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market pricesare not available, we estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill, attributable only to the Organon Products reporting unit, is evaluated for impairment on atleast an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors todetermine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value. Some of the factorsconsidered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry andmarket, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, and overall financialperformance. If we conclude it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitativefair value test is performed. If carrying value is greater than fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will berecorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill). As of the most recent goodwill impairmenttesting date, the reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by a substantial amount. Other acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When events or circumstanceswarrant a review, we will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flowsderived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. Impairments are recognized in operating results to theextent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the netpresent value of estimated future cash flows. The judgments made in evaluating impairment of long-lived intangibles can materially affect our results of operations. Taxes on Income Income tax expense and deferred tax balances in the audited annual combined financial statements have been calculated on a separate tax return basis. Our operations are included in the tax returns of certain OrganonEntities, Transferring Entities or the respective Merck entities of which our business is a part. We believe theassumptions supporting the allocation and presentation of income taxes on a separate return basis are reasonable.One of these assumptions is that we, on a standalone basis, will not benefit from certain tax incentives thathistorically benefited Merck. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax 73assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. We evaluate tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not ofbeing sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likelythan not of being sustained upon audit, we recognize the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50%likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not morelikely than not of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financialstatements. We recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of Taxes on income in the combined statement of income. We do not maintain an income taxes payable to or from account as it is deemed to be settled with the tax paying entities in the respective jurisdictions. These settlements are reflected as changes in Net investment from Parent on the combined balance sheet. However, our combined balance sheet reflects balances with taxing authorities for certain Organon Entities and Transferring Entities and the one-time transition tax resulting fromthe TCJA, as well as for unrecognized income tax benefits along with related interest and penalties. We andMerck will enter into a tax matters agreement prior to the separation. See \"Certain Relationships and RelatedParty Transactions\u2014Agreements with Merck\u2014Tax Matters Agreement.\" 74Business Overview Organon is a science-based global pharmaceutical company that develops and delivers innovative health solutions through a portfolio of prescription therapies within women's health, biosimilars and established brands.No other large global pharmaceutical company has women's health as its primary therapeutic area of focus. Ourwomen's health portfolio has historically delivered strong revenues, underpinned by our contraceptives products,which include Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, our patented long-acting reversible contraceptive, with its salesgrowing at an 11% CAGR between 2010 and 2020. Our biosimilars portfolio has delivered more than$650 million in sales since 2017, and we expect growth will be fueled by planned launches in the United Statesand Europe. Finally, our established brands portfolio continues to generate strong operating profit across manymarkets, including the United States, China, Japan, Korea and countries in Europe, despite loss of marketexclusivity across a majority of brands. For many of our products, the impacts of loss of patent exclusivity eventsin the United States and Europe have passed, and, as a result, combined with enhanced management focus, anestablished supply chain and targeted resourcing, we believe that our portfolio will continue to deliver strong,reliable operating profit at low promotional and development expense requirements. See \"\u2014Products\" for moreinformation on loss of patent exclusivity for our key products. Our mission is to be the world's leading women's health company and deliver a better and healthier every day for every woman. We plan to build on our strengths in reproductive health to assemble an array of healthsolutions to serve women from adolescence to menopause and beyond. We are focused on generating strong andgrowing cash flow by selectively investing in development and inorganic opportunities to drive innovation andfuture growth across our core areas. Our portfolio of diverse and branded products is supported bycommercialization and market access, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and clinical development expertiseglobally. Our global footprint lends scale to our business by enabling management to identify and focus onunique market opportunities across our broad portfolio. Our women's health, biosimilars and established brands portfolios, together with the expertise and experience of our employees, enable us to pursue an exciting innovation agenda, carving out a unique position inthe health care sector. Our product portfolio is unified by a central focus on patient needs addressed by ourtherapies, a commitment to driving organic and inorganic growth, a heritage of successful commercialization andclinical development, and a disciplined approach to cost and operational efficiency. We believe our women'shealth portfolio, in combination with our biosimilars and established brands portfolios, will enable us to delivervalue to patients and the health care system while creating value for our shareholders. We also believe ourgeographic scale, long heritage and sustained successes within women's health will enable us to become thecommercialization and distribution partner of choice for smaller women's health companies. Our globalcommercial capabilities and market access, established relationships with health care providers, patients andpayors and clinical expertise support our long-term strategy to launch therapies and recognize developmentopportunities within and beyond our existing portfolios. Our business strategy is focused on advancing our mission to be the world's leading women's health company, pursuing growth in biosimilars and maximizing opportunities from our established brands portfolio. In particular: We believe there is significant growth potential in women's health broadly. In addition to our ten marketed products, we intend to focus our growth efforts in two areas, on needs and conditions thatuniquely impact women, generally referred to as the core women's health market, and on needs andconditions that disproportionately impact women. We estimate that the combined global market forpharmaceuticals in the core women's health market, which includes therapeutic areas such ascontraception and fertility, endometriosis and uterine fibroids, was $33 billion in 2020. We project thatthe core women's health market will grow to $40 billion by 2026. In addition, we estimate that thesegment of therapeutic areas that disproportionately impact women, such as osteoporosis, lupus, urinarytract infections, migraines and celiac disease, will grow annually at an approximately 10% CAGR from 2020 to 2026, adding a further $21 billion to the core women's health market size estimates. 75 Our existing biosimilars portfolio positions us for success in this attractive and fast growing area of health care. We estimate the total size of the global market for biosimilars was approximately$17.3 billion as of September 2020, reflecting 60 biosimilars approved in the EU and 29 approved inthe United States. Industry publications estimate that 54 major biologics, with an aggregate marketvalue of approximately $220 billion, will lose patent protection in the next decade, which has potentialto expand the biosimilars global market to over $30 billion in the next decade or so. We do not havebiosimilars corresponding to all biologics that will lose patent protection in the next decade. All fivebiosimilars in our portfolio have launched in certain countries globally, including two biosimilars in theUnited States. We intend to expand our biosimilars portfolio through commercialization of additionalproducts and expanded marketing of existing products. We believe our size, capabilities and experienceposition us competitively in this area. Our established brands portfolio consists of 49 products covering cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatology and non-opioid pain management. A number of our established brands that face genericcompetition still contribute meaningful profitability. We intend to stimulate the performance of ourestablished brands products through renewed focus and attention on strategic marketing to create asignificant source of capital to fuel the company's growth aspirations. We believe our establishedbrands products will, over time, continue to deliver meaningful revenue and operating profit that can beredirected into organic and inorganic growth opportunities in key product areas and geographies. Ourestablished brands portfolio is supported by our large commercial and manufacturing capabilities,including a global network that enables us to distribute products to patients in more than 140 countriesand territories. Key Products Women's Health Biosimilars Established Brands In 2020, the Organon Products segment recorded revenue of $6.5 billion and generated $2.3 billion of net income. We expect to be well positioned for low to mid-single digit annual revenue growth off of a 2021base year. We operate on a global scale and our global network enables us to distribute products to patientsin more than 140 countries and territories around the world, with approximately 80% of 2020 Organon 76Products segment revenue, or $5.1 billion, generated out side the United States. Upon the separation, we will have approximately 9,950 employees worldwide, with approximately 4,030 employees focusing on sales,marketing and key commercialization activities and approximately 730 employees focusing on clinicaldevelopment, safety, and medical affairs and product registration. Additionally, we expect to operate sixmanufacturing sites globally and have approximately 3,020 manufacturing employees. Our operations are principally managed on a products basis and include two operating segments, the Organon Products segment and the Merck Retained Products segment. We consider the Organon Productssegment to be our only business going forward, and, as such, all discussion and financial information presentedin this section relates only to the Organon Products segment. Upon separation, Merck will retain operations of the Merck Retained Products segment and we will no longer present financial information related to this segment in our financial statements. See \"Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Organon is a Delaware corporation incorporated on March 11, 2020. Our corporate offices are located at 30 Hudson Street, 33rd Floor, Jersey City, New Jersey 07302. Strengths We have a number of advantages that distinguish us from our competitors and support our strategy: Leading portfolio of health solutions for women .We intend to be the world's leading women's health company, with a long history of innovative, first-to-market contraceptive products. We have a broadoffering of contraception and fertility brands that we believe have long-term growth potential, and weare one of only two global contraception manufacturers operating in the highly fragmentedcontraception market. Our portfolio of ten products includes Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, globally oneof the highest revenue generating long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARC, a class ofcontraceptives recognized as the most effective method of hormonal contraception available to patientswith a lower long-term average cost. Our management team has the development and commercialexpertise to drive innovation in therapeutics and drug-device combinations across the women's healthlandscape through opportunities related to our existing portfolio and by externally sourcing therapiesthrough in-licensing, acquisition and other business development transactions with innovators seekingto benefit from our global commercial presence in women's health. Growing position in biosimilars. We have a growing position in biosimilars. We have strong, global commercialization capabilities, with a portfolio spanning oncology and immunology treatments, twoareas primed for significant growth in biosimilars. We plan to continue evaluating opportunities inother potential therapeutic areas, including ophthalmology, diabetes and neuroscience. Our oncologybiosimilars have been launched in 20 countries and our immunology biosimilars have been launched infive countries. All five biosimilars in our portfolio have launched in certain countries globally,including two biosimilars in the United States. We expect that our biosimilars business will continue togenerate growth in the near term. Market Leading Established Brands. In established brands, we have a broad and robust portfolio of mature brands generally beyond market exclusivity, including leading brands in cardiovascular,respiratory, dermatology and non-opioid pain management. Our established brands portfolio generatesstrong operating profit, which we anticipate will continue to fund our future growth. We have provendevelopment, regulatory, manufacturing and commercial capabilities, which we believe will supportgrowth in targeted existing geographies, new geographies, and through new indications and lineextensions. 77Broad and fit-for-purpose capabilities .We have enterprise capabilities delivered by seasoned leaders in global commercialization and market access, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and clinicaldevelopment. In particular, our capabilities include: Global commercialization expertise : Our experienced team will execute targeted investment in, and successful commercialization of, organic growth opportunities across our global portfolio.These efforts will be supported by data-driven, science-based decision-making and execution atscale, enabled by data and analytics and by digital engagement of health care providers andpatients.

Digital and omni-channel marketing capabilities : We market our products using a digital and omni-channel approach, reaching a broad base of market participants, including health careproviders, patients and policy makers and payors in a cost-efficient manner. Our health careprovider, patient and payor-focused relationship management is facilitated by an integrated digitalecosystem that coordinates health care provider and patient engagement across many channels,including face-to-face, email, social media, mobile and websites. Strategic alliances : We have an extensive track record of managing strategic alliances and creating value through global partnerships to guide investment and growth in inorganic pipelineopportunities. For example, our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis allows us to work togetherwith a biopharmaceutical company that complements our capabilities and strengths. Established manufacturing and supply chain : Beyond our commercial capabilities, we expect to have approximately 440 employees operating in supply chain management, which we believe,together with our manufacturing capabilities, will enable us to maintain a high-quality, reliableglobal supply chain. See \"\u2014Manufacturing Capabilities and Global Supply Chain.\" Geographic scale and platform . In 2020, we generated $5.1 billion in sales outside the United States, representing approximately 80% of our total Organon Products segment sales. Our footprint spans theglobe with a direct presence in 58 countries and the ability to deliver therapies to patients in more than140 countries and territories. We plan to initially focus on 14 key markets, which currently generateapproximately 75% of our global sales, and we expect our broader geographic reach and manufacturingcapabilities to drive long-term growth and expansion opportunities. Specifically, in women's healthand biosimilars, we believe our global footprint will enable us to expand the market for our currentproducts in order to meet the increasing demand for these products. We also believe our geographicscale, long heritage and sustained successes within women's health will enable us to become thecommercialization and distribution partner of choice for smaller women's health companies. Inestablished brands, where opportunities vary significantly depending on the exact dynamics andcharacteristics of each country, we believe our geographic scale enables us to capitalize on globalopportunities and increase brand share by responding to these dynamics. Strong financial profile with significant free cash flow generation and improving operating leverage . In 2020, the Organon Products segment generated approximately $2.3 billion in operating cash flowand spent $255 million on capital expenditures. The Organon Products segment also generatedAdjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion on $6.5 billion of sales, representing an EBITDA margin ofapproximately 47%. We expect that 2021 operating cash flow from the Organon Products Segment willbe comparable to, though slightly down from, 2020 before the impact of estimated interest expense.We anticipate we will continue to generate significant cash flow and expect our operating leverage toimprove in the future. 78Scientific heritage, expertise and culture of excellence inherited from Merck . Merck's rich, over-125-year scientific heritage is imbued in our strong scientific principles, innovative developmentstrategies and quality-focused culture. Building on our heritage of regulatory and scientific expertise,we expect to have the capabilities to continue to optimize pathways for clinical development andregulatory approvals as well as data generation capabilities required to support patient access,formulary placement and reimbursement. Strong, leading and established brand in the area of women's health. The Organon brand has a long history in the area of women's health, both with patients and health care providers, and with employeeswho initially came to Merck through the acquisition of Organon. Our proud heritage in women's healthbegan with Organon's launch of one of the first-ever combined hormonal oral contraceptives, Lyndiol,in 1962. This was followed by an impressive series of innovative firsts, including: the launch of Marvelon in 1981, the first lower dose (30mcg) estrogen combined oral contraceptive with a selective progestin, the launch of Livial in 1987, the first non-estrogen gonadomimetic hormonal replacement treatment, the launch of Follistim, the first recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone available in the United States for infertility, the launch of NuvaRing in 2001, the first once-a-month contraceptive ring, and the launch of Nexplanon / Implanon NXT in 2011, the first and only single-rod radiopaque contraceptive implant with preloaded applicator. Experienced management team and Board with track record of successful performance. Our executive management team has a strong track record of leadership, performance and execution in thepharmaceutical industry. Together, they bring a diverse set of leadership experience at respectedcompanies both within and beyond the biopharmaceutical industry. Our CEO and a majority of ourexecutive leadership team have been appointed from within Merck where they each establishedreputations as global leaders. Our management team is supported by a seasoned Board of Directorsproviding guidance and strategic vision based on a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. Theextensive company and industry experience of our management team as well as our Board of Directorswill serve as a source of strength and innovation to guide us into the future. Strategies Our strategy is to be the world's leading women's health company by leveraging our historical strength in this area and investing in therapies and innovations that support the medical needs of women, to pursue growth inbiosimilars and to maximize opportunities from our established brands, all while reinvesting our strong operatingcash flow to fund growth initiatives across our portfolio. We believe our portfolio will benefit from the increasedinvestment and attention we can provide as an independent company. Our focus will be to: Leverage our existing position in women's health to become the global leader in this space .No other large global pharmaceutical company has women's health as its primary therapeutic area of focus. Weintend to be the world's leading women's health company to address the needs and conditions thatuniquely and disproportionately impact women. We plan to achieve this by leveraging our scale, deepexperience, geographic reach, strong relationships with payors, health care providers, large clinics andimportant stakeholder groups such as societies, patients and scientific leaders to grow revenue for ourcontraception and fertility brands and expand into additional women's health therapeutic areas, andthrough strategic acquisitions and collaborations. In 2020, approximately one quarter of our revenuewas derived from women's health products and, over time, we expect to grow this share by: expanding the marketing and distribution of our key brands, including Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, Follistim and Elonva, 79 investing in manufacturing to expand the supply capacity for Nexplanon / Implanon NXT and our fertility product portfolio, focusing our contraception commercial strategy on expanding global access to Nexplanon / Implanon NXT and increasing communication and education about LARC, which we believe willexpand the market opportunity for Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, focusing our fertility commercial strategy on increasing communication and education about antagonist protocols, which we believe will expand the market opportunity for both Follistim andElonva, applying our long history of women's health scientific development experience to invest in late lifecycle activities that will broaden the geographic footprint of our women's health portfolio andfurther enhance the value of the portfolio, and tracking scientific innovation globally to source commercialized and development-stage inorganic opportunities across women's health broadly in order to develop products that target specificunmet medical need in conditions that impact women both uniquely and disproportionately. Maximize value from our biosimilars portfolio through increased focus and strategic investment .We believe that the biosimilars market offers potential for value creation for a company with our strengths.In the short term, we are focused on commercializing the five biosimilars sourced from ourcollaboration with Samsung Bioepis, including the recent EU launch of Aybintio in oncology. In thelonger term, we expect to focus on expanding our portfolio through ongoing identification andevaluation of new opportunities in therapeutic areas such as oncology, immunology, ophthalmology,diabetes and neuroscience, both through our Samsung Bioepis collaboration and through other potentialcollaborations. We believe that our focused approach enables us to further capitalize on the momentumin the biosimilars industry to drive growth through commercialization of additional biosimilars andexpansion of our existing products into additional countries. In addition, we believe the biosimilarsmarket will continue to favorably mature through continued policy efforts, both in the United States,and globally, that recognize the important role biosimilars can play in alleviating cost pressures forhealth care systems. In addition, we believe our commercial experience, particularly in the areas oftendering and policy, obtained from our prior biosimilars launches (Renflexis in the United States andOntruzant in the United States and the European Union (\"EU\")), provides us a competitive advantagein the market. Drive near-term growth through investment in our existing portfolio. We believe that our broad portfolio affords us a range of options to drive future growth by developing products that target specificunmet medical need, including in-licenses, commercial collaborations, partnerships and acquisitionsconsistent with our focused strategy. For example, our established brands portfolio has a particularlystrong foothold in emerging markets where we have a broad base of products enabling us to buildtargeted additional product offerings and developments. We expect that greater managerial focus tocapture local market opportunities, along with targeted investments in expanding our geographicfootprint, digital promotion and commercial trade channels, will provide new revenue opportunities forselect brands in our established brands portfolio. We also believe there are meaningful opportunities tobe realized through further investment in, and lifecycle management of, our current products across ourportfolios. Drive long-term growth through investment in inorganic opportunities .To drive longer-term growth, we intend to expand our scientific capabilities in targeted therapeutic areas through investment ininorganic opportunities and acquisitions in order to further augment our existing product businesses.We believe these investments will help us build a development pipeline that will drive our futurerevenues. Enhance our digital and omni-channel marketing capabilities to drive growth . Our commercial strategy focuses on growing our product portfolio by increasing productivity across our sales force and 80leveraging digital channels, data and analytics to improve the return on investment in health care provider and patient engagement. We plan to continually expand our digital and omni-channelcapabilities to optimize sales opportunities for our products and to further invest in digital engagementmodels that allow us to reach our customers and patients effectively. We also plan to further strengthenthe design and execution of personalized omni-channel campaigns, engaging health care providers andpatients through the most cost-effective channels and building upon existing strengths, such as oursophisticated capabilities to successfully target women and maximize our promotional response, whichwe achieved through nearly 10 years of executing and analyzing women's health consumer campaignsin the United States. Drive efficiency to improve operating leverage and cash flow . As an independent company, we intend to focus on delivering operating efficiencies. We have identified a number of key areas in which weplan to generate cost efficiencies by simplifying our operating model, standardizing and centralizingservice activities and designing and enhancing our commercial model and supply chain functions. Wealso plan to leverage external providers where there is a cost and service advantage. In addition, we arein the process of implementing systems and process improvements to reduce general andadministrative costs, and simplify our infrastructure following the termination of our transition servicesagreement with Merck. We believe the combination of these efficiencies will allow us to drive growthin free cash flow. Deploy our free cash flow to invest in our existing product portfolio, fund inorganic opportunities and return capital to our shareholders . We are committed to the success of our existing product portfolio and plan to make commercial decisions that will allow us to maximize its value. In addition,we plan to invest in inorganic growth opportunities such as in-licenses, commercial collaborations andacquisitions of development-stage or in-market products. We also plan to acquire products that fitwithin our existing commercial infrastructure, which we believe will generate attractive risk-adjustedreturns on investment. There are inorganic growth opportunities, particularly in women's health andbiosimilars, that we plan to target. We believe that our global commercial and market accesscapabilities, regulatory affairs, specialized manufacturing and clinical development expertise, willenable us to evaluate and integrate external opportunities. In addition, we plan to pay a dividend to ourshareholders, pay down debt consistent with our financial policy and, to the extent that we generateexcess free cash flow, we will consider returning additional free cash flow to our shareholders via sharerepurchases. We expect our targeted dividend payout to be in the low 20s as a percentage of post-separation Adjusted Net Income. Capitalize on our status as a newly independent company to align our talented employee base with our performance expectations and drive a culture of high performance . Our strong heritage of excellence and scientific foundation enables us to approach complex problems with innovative science-based solutions. As a new, independent company, we have a rare opportunity to forge a distinct identityand align hiring, training, development and incentive activities around a clear set of performanceexpectations related to our core strategy. To establish this culture, we plan to draw upon key aspects ofour shared history with Merck while charting a new course. We expect to be a performance-focusedand entrepreneurial company with simplified organizational layers and governance, and a focus onalignment and leadership empowerment that enables our leaders to understand and address the evolvingand unmet medical need of patients and health care providers around the world. 81Products We are engaged in developing and delivering innovative health solutions through a diverse portfolio of products serving patient needs across multiple therapeutic areas and product categories, consisting of women'shealth, biosimilars and established brands. These portfolios are further described below, together with selectdetails for products within each group. Our sales for each of our product groups are as follows: ($ in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Women's Health ................................... $1,555 $2,264 $2,293 Biosimilars ........................................ $ 3 3 0 $ 2 5 3 $ 6 4 Established Brands ................................. $4,540 $5,159 $5,887 Approximately 90% of our 2020 sales came from products that no longer have patent exclusivity in the United States or EU. Within this group, Cozaar/Hyzaar, which lost patent protection in the United States and EUin 2010, saw a revenue decline of approximately 41% in that year; Nuvaring experienced a 73% decline in salesin 2020 following loss of patent protection in major markets in April 2018 and generic entry in the United Statesin 2019; Singulair, which lost patent protection in the United States in 2012 and in the EU in 2013, saw a revenuedecline of approximately 78% in 2013 as compared to 2011; and Zetia, which saw generic entry in the UnitedStates in December 2016, and lost patent protection in the United States in 2017 and in the EU in 2018, saw arevenue decline of approximately 77% in 2019 as compared to 2016. Women's Health Portfolio In 2020, our women's health portfolio accounted for $1.6 billion, or approximately 24%, of Organon Products segment sales, with approximately 45%, or $697 million, generated outside the United States. Ourwomen's health products are sold by prescription in two therapeutic areas, contraception, with key brands such asNexplanon / Implanon NXT and NuvaRing, and fertility, with key brands such as Follistim and Elonva. We are aglobal leader by revenue in the hormonal contraception market, offering a broad portfolio of products acrossthree core hormonal contraceptive market segments: daily pill, monthly ring and LARC. Our women's healthproducts are sold in over 90 markets worldwide, including the United States, China, Canada, Australia, Brazil,Mexico and many other countries in the EU, South America, Asia and Africa. Women's Health Market and Opportunity We intend to pursue opportunities in the broad women's health market as part of our future strategy. Our classification of women's health includes two areas: needs and conditions that uniquely impact women, generallyreferred to as the core women's health market; and needs and conditions that disproportionately impact women.We estimate that the combined global market for pharmaceuticals in the core women's health market, whichincludes therapeutic areas such as contraception and fertility, endometriosis and uterine fibroids, was $33 billionin 2020. We project that the core women's health market will grow to $40 billion by 2026. In addition, weestimate that the segment of therapeutic areas that disproportionately impact women, such as osteoporosis, lupus,urinary tract infections, migraines and celiac disease, will grow annually at an approximately 10% CAGR from2020 to 2026, adding a further $21 billion to the core women's health market size estimates. We believe governments and payors are implementing favorable policies across major markets that, in turn, drive growth in the market for women's health therapies. For example, in the United States, there has been anincrease in fertility insurance mandates and employer coverage, albeit subject to certain exemptions. In Canada,there is strong public and private reimbursement for contraception, accompanied by increased use of LARCs.Across Latin America, there is a significant untapped opportunity for LARCs, particularly given high rates ofunintended pregnancy. The women's health market has also been traditionally underserved in terms of science- 82based solutions that address unmet medical need. Despite the pipeline of new women's health products in development set to launch across the women's health market later in 2021 and beyond, the unmet need andlimited treatment options continue to exist across several therapeutic areas. For example, there is potential todevelop non-hormonal long-acting contraceptives, oral therapies for fertility to replace injections, non-narcotic,non-hormonal treatments for endometriosis, non-hormonal treatments for menopause symptoms, and new drug-device combinations such as combining prescription therapies with delivery devices that increase productefficacy and safety. We believe the potential for innovation in the areas outlined above, in addition to areas ofunmet need in conditions that disproportionately impact women, represents attractive opportunities to grow ourbusiness. In addition, according to Evaluate Pharma data for 2019, there are more than 140 pipeline assets in women's health in development across phase 1-3. We believe that this level of innovation will translate into an increasedflow of licensing and acquisition opportunities for us in the future. Our Women's Health Strategy Pharmaceutical companies that participate in the women's health market generally fall into two categories- small specialty players with a concentrated focus but small scale, and large diversified players with a limited,opportunistic attention to their women's health portfolio. There is currently no large player with women's healthbroadly as their primary therapeutic area of focus. As such, we distinguish ourselves by pairing our portfolio withlarge-scale size and global distribution capabilities. In order to grow our women's health business in the long-term, we intend to invest in both internal and external innovation. Internally, we intend to pursue clinicaldevelopment opportunities related to our existing portfolio of therapies that we believe will expand thegeographic reach, provide additional benefits for patients and increase the value of our offerings. For example,we are currently developing a next-generation version of Nexplanon / Implanon NXT that will extend the periodof contraception provided. Externally, we intend to source innovation and expand our share of the globalwomen's health market through strategic acquisitions, in-licenses and commercial collaborations that leverageour global footprint, strong relationships with health care providers, patients and payors and deep experiencewithin women's health. We intend to focus on commercial assets and development-stage assets that havedemonstrated clinical proof of concept where we can leverage our in-house capabilities and experience toaccelerate and better maximize these late-stage clinical development and commercialization opportunities. Weare initially planning to focus on opportunities that leverage our existing relationships with health care providersin obstetrics and gynecology (\"OBGYN\"), and fertility practices and plan to evaluate both therapeutics and drug-device combinations. Contraception In 2020, our contraception products accounted for $1.2 billion, or approximately 19%, of Organon Products segment sales, with approximately 40%, or $490 million, generated outside the United States. Contraception Market and Commercial Strategy We have an estimated global market share of approximately 12.6% in hormonal contraception and approximately 30% in the LARC market segment, each as measured by reported 2020 revenue. Although dailycontraceptive pills remain the largest market segment, the LARC market segment, which includes Nexplanon /Implanon NXT, has experienced significant growth in the years leading up to 2019 due to a sustained shift fromdaily oral contraception to LARC. This was driven by payors, providers and patients looking for options beyondcommonly used daily contraceptive pills. For example, in the United States, the share of LARC usage hasincreased from 5.6% in the period from 2006 to 2010, to 10.3% in the period from 2015 to 2017. In 2020,however, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced administration of many products within women's health,in particular for Nexplanon / Implanon NXT. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the LARC segmentduring 2020 due to clinic closures and the postponement of non-essential medical procedures during countrylockdowns. However, LARC segment growth quickly rebounded during months when clinic restrictions were 83removed and the sustained shift to LARC is expected to continue with fundamental drivers unchanged. We believe a continued shift toward LARC methods represents an opportunity both inside and outside the United States.Scientific research has indicated that the adoption of LARC can reduce rates of unintended pregnancy and webelieve that it can also enhance other family planning related outcomes. We expect the body of similar evidence toincrease over the next several years, and we plan to actively support ongoing work in this area. Based on revenueand market share, we are favorably positioned to capitalize on this opportunity in the contraception market. Global growth rates for hormonal contraception vary. Growth rates in emerging markets continue to outpace rates in developed markets as governments prioritize a range of methods to boost economic development, includingpublic funding for the expansion of family planning services to increase rates of female participation in theworkforce. We plan to work with payors and other health care stakeholders to improve insurance coverage of ourhighly effective contraceptive products such as Nexplanon / Implanon NXT. The traditional sales model for contraceptive products is to market primarily to obstetricians, gynecologists and other health care professionals that prescribe contraceptive products to patients. However, women with knowledgeof contraceptive options are the key decision makers regarding the selection of the contraceptive product that meetstheir individual lifestyle needs. We plan to advance market awareness of contraceptive options primarily throughadvancing education. We plan to work closely with women's health societies, governments, health careprofessionals and other key stakeholders to advance education regarding contraceptive options such that women andhealth care professionals are familiar with our products. To further increase growth opportunities across ourcontraception portfolio and leverage brand loyalty among patients and health care providers, we intend to increaseour investments in both face-to-face and digital methods of medical education. Contraception Products Our contraception portfolio currently consists of the following key products: Nexplanon / Implanon NXT We expect our core product focus in contraception to be Nexplanon, also known in some markets outside of the United States by the brand name Implanon NXT. In 2020, Nexplanon / Implanon NXT accounted for$680 million, or approximately 44%, of our total women's health portfolio sales, with approximately 28%, or$192 million, generated outside the United States. This represents an 11% CAGR growth in sales between 2010 and 2020. Nexplanon / Implanon NXT is a prescription medication for the prevention of pregnancy in women lasting up to three years and is reversible upon removal. Nexplanon / Implanon NXT is a small, thin and flexible arm implantthat is placed discreetly under the skin of the inner, upper arm by a health care provider. It is a progestin-only,radiopaque, removable implant, containing 68mg of etonogestrel pre-loaded into an applicator. Nexplanon /Implanon NXT prevents pregnancy in several ways, most importantly by suppressing ovulation, and is typicallyprescribed in women who are not looking to become pregnant in the near future and do not want the inconvenienceof taking a daily contraceptive. We expect to have market exclusivity for Nexplanon / Implanon NXT in the United States until 2027 and the majority of countries where Nexplanon / Implanon NXT is commercialized outside the United States until 2025.Our Nexplanon / Implanon NXT commercial strategy involves continued and expanded private and publicreimbursement for Nexplanon / Implanon NXT within countries where hormonal contraception is well accepted,including in the United States. We intend to focus our commercial efforts on education and training to assistproviders to understand Nexplanon / Implanon NXT, become confident with offering Nexplanon / Implanon NXTas one appropriate option for women seeking hormonal contraception, and become skilled with the insertion andremoval procedure of Nexplanon / Implanon NXT. We also intend to increase education of contraceptive options towomen. In addition, we plan to invest in increasing Nexplanon / Implanon NXT supply capacity to meet expectedfuture demand increases. NuvaRing In 2020, NuvaRing accounted for $236 million, or approximately 15%, of our total women's health portfolio sales, with approximately 53%, or $126 million, generated outside the United States. NuvaRing 84(etonogestrel / ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring) is a monthly vaginal contraceptive ring combination of progestin and estrogen used to prevent pregnancy in women. NuvaRing is prescribed for women that want a monthlycontraceptive option, and it prevents pregnancy by suppressing ovulation. Patent expiration for NuvaRing in the United States, and most countries outside of the United States, occurred in April 2018. Generic versions of NuvaRing were first approved in Europe in December 2018 and inthe United States in December 2019. Generic entrants have since entered the United States and select Europeanmarkets following such approvals. We saw a rapid and substantial decline in United States NuvaRing salesduring 2020 due to generic competition. Our focus will be on markets outside of the United States whereNuvaRing sales are expected to be relatively stable after initial declines immediately following entry of genericcompetition. Cerazette In 2020, Cerazette accounted for $67 million, or approximately 4%, of our total women's health portfolio sales. Cerazette (desogestrel) is a progestin-only, daily pill used to prevent pregnancy in women. Progestin-onlyproducts like Cerazette, are typically used by women wanting effective hormonal contraception for whomestrogen-containing contraceptives may not be medically appropriate. Cerazette prevents pregnancy bysuppressing ovulation. Cerazette is not approved or marketed in the United States but is broadly availableglobally outside the United States. Patent expiration for Cerazette occurred in most markets in 2011 and 2012. At the time of patent expiry, Cerazette was the leading progestin-only contraceptive pill globally based on revenue. Generic entrants haveentered most markets where Cerazette is commercialized. The progestin-only contraceptive pill market continuesto see modest growth globally, creating opportunities for Cerazette. Marvelon and Mercilon In 2020, Marvelon and Mercilon accounted for $95 million, or approximately 6%, of our total women's health portfolio sales. Marvelon and Mercilon (desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol pill) are both combinations ofprogestin and estrogen used as daily pills to prevent pregnancy. Marvelon contains a higher daily dose ofestrogen than Mercilon. Marvelon and Mercilon both prevent pregnancy by suppressing ovulation. We no longerhave market exclusivity for these products. Fertility We are one of only a few major global manufacturers offering a multi-drug fertility portfolio to fertility clinics and to specialty pharmacies and wholesalers who supply such clinics. In 2020, our fertility productsaccounted for $319 million, or approximately 20%, of our total women's health portfolio sales, withapproximately 65%, or $206 million, generated outside the United States. Fertility products fall broadly into two categories: products used in \"long agonist\" protocols and products used in \"antagonist\" protocols. The difference between the protocols principally relates to the type and amount ofproduct used to stimulate the ovaries and the length of use. The antagonist protocol is generally recognized as asafer procedure for patients and has demonstrated similar pregnancy rates for patients when compared to the longagonist protocol. The antagonist protocol is also considered more patient-friendly because it requires fewer daysof therapy and fewer injections. In contrast, the long agonist protocol is administered for several weeks alongwith daily follicle-stimulating hormone (\"FSH\") products. Our FSH product, Follistim, is used in both longagonist and antagonist protocols, while our Elonva product (a sustained FSH), substitutes for seven daily FSHinjections and is indicated for the antagonist protocol. Recognizing the patient benefits from antagonist protocols,we intend to focus our commercial strategy on communication of the advantages of this protocol. We believe thisstrategy will expand the market opportunity for both Follistim and Elonva because both products are well- 85positioned in patient-friendly antagonist protocols. In addition, we intend to build upon Merck's long heritage within the fertility market through focused investment in manufacturing and distribution for continued reliable,high-quality supply to health care providers and patients around the globe. Global Fertility Market and Strategy There are three major global fertility drug manufacturers, including our company, as well as several single- product players. We estimate the hormonal fertility market was approximately $3.7 billion in 2020. The marketexperienced 7.3% global growth from 2015 to 2020, with even faster growth in the United States and China.Large fertility markets such as the United States and China, with growing rates of in vitro fertilization (\"IVF\")cycles, are critical to future product performance. In addition, in the United States, there has been an increase infertility insurance mandates and employer coverage, albeit subject to certain exemptions. In these and otherlarger fertility markets, we intend to remain highly focused on expanding profitable access to fertility treatments. Specialist health care providers, many of whom own their own fertility clinics, are the most important decision makers regarding which treatment options are used for each patient in each IVF treatment. Health careproviders often tailor treatment protocols to individual patients to increase effectiveness. We intend to build onour long history and strong relationships with fertility clinics to improve services and patient access to ourcompetitive fertility portfolio. In addition, market characteristics have resulted in a concentration in the privatepractice market, where specialists are embracing new treatment protocols and in particular, the shortenedantagonist protocols. Our Fertility Products Our portfolio currently consists of three products used primarily for IVF treatment cycles: Follistim AQ / Puregon In 2020, Follistim accounted for $193 million, or approximately 12%, of our total women's health portfolio sales, with approximately 56%, or $109 million, generated outside the United States. Follistim (follitropin betainjection) is a recombinant FSH used to promote the development of multiple ovarian follicles in assistedreproduction technology procedures, such as IVF, embryo transfer, gamete intrafallopian transfer andintracytoplasmic sperm injection. Follistim belongs to the group of gonadotrophic hormones used by womentrying to get pregnant using IVF. Follistim has been challenged by intermittent supply disruptions over the past several years. We intend to make new investments in our fertility supply chain to bolster supply stabilization and expansion. We also expectto invest in a needle change for our injector pen and new instructions for use meant to enhance patientexperience. We no longer have market exclusivity for Follistim and a biosimilar version was launched in the EUin 2014. However, the market share of the biosimilar version remains below 4%. Elonva In 2020, Elonva accounted for $21 million in total sales. We expect that our Elonva revenue will grow, and we plan to continue to invest in expanding Elonva's market reach. Elonva (corifollitropin alfa) is an ovarianfollicle stimulant with the same mechanism of action as recombinant FSH, but characterized by a prolongedduration of FSH activity. Due to its ability to initiate and sustain growth of multiple ovarian follicles for an entireweek, a single subcutaneous injection of the recommended dose of Elonva may replace the first seven injectionsof any daily recombinant FSH preparation in an ovarian stimulation treatment cycle. Elonva belongs to the groupof gonadotrophic hormones used by women trying to get pregnant using IVF. Elonva's profile offers particularvalue because women do not need to self-inject daily during IVF cycles. Elonva has not been approved in theUnited States or in China, but it is approved and widely available in many other global markets where weoperate. We are currently reassessing our Elonva worldwide strategy with the opportunity to potentially launch inadditional markets. 86Orgalutran In 2020, Orgalutran accounted for $81 million, or approximately 5%, of our total women's health portfolio sales, with approximately 86%, or $69 million, generated outside the United States. injectable in fertilitytreatment in combination with FSH (Follistim) to prevent ovulation. By using Orgalutran, clinicians can continuestimulating follicle growth while preventing ovulation before egg collection. We do not have market exclusivityfor Orgalutran. Biosimilars Portfolio In 2020, our biosimilars portfolio accounted for $330 million, or approximately 5%, of Organon Products segment sales, with approximately 62%, or $206 million, generated outside the United States. Our biosimilarsportfolio and experience provide an opportunity to benefit from future growth anticipated in this area. We believe that through a combination of management focus and strategic investment, we expect that our biosimilars business will continue to generate growth in the near term. Our biosimilars portfolio consists oftherapies in oncology and immunology for which we have worldwide commercialization rights with certaingeographic exceptions specified on a product-by-product basis pursuant to an agreement between Merck andSamsung Bioepis entered into in February 2013. The biosimilars (with reference products in parenthesis)currently covered by products covered by the agreement havelaunched in certain countries globally, including two biosimilars in the United States. Our oncology biosimilarshave so far been launched in 20 countries, while our immunology biosimilars have been launched in fivecountries, including the United States, Canada, Australia and Ukraine. Once a biosimilar product is launched, ouraccess rights to that product under the agreement last for 10 years on a market-by-market basis from the date oflaunch. Based on this experience, we believe we are well-positioned to become a commercial partner of choicefor future collaborations with Samsung Bioepis or other potential partners to commercialize additionalbiosimilars products. Biosimilars Market and Opportunity Biosimilars are lower-cost alternatives to existing biologic medicines that treat some of life's most serious diseases. Biosimilar therapies have no clinically meaningful differences in the safety profile, potency and purityfrom their reference biologic medicines. As a result, biosimilars create new choices and competition in thebiologics marketplace and have the potential to lower costs for patients and the health care system, potentiallyexpanding the therapeutic options available to fight important diseases, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis,psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. As of December 31, 2020, the global biologics market represented an approximately $300 billion revenue opportunity, with an expected CAGR of approximately 10% until 2024. Given the high cost of many of thesebiologic treatments, biosimilars, as a more affordable alternative, represent a significant opportunity for patients,providers and payors once a biologics product loses patent protection. We estimate the total size of the global market for biosimilars was approximately $17.3 billion as of September 2020, reflecting 60 biosimilars approved in the EU and 29 in the United States. In 2019, the Europeanand United States markets accounted for 70% and 14%, respectively, of global biologics, but 34% and 56%,respectively, of global biosimilars. Industry publications estimate that 54 major biologics, with an aggregatemarket value of approximately $220 billion, will lose patent protection in the next decade, which has potential toexpand the global biosimilars market to over $30 billion, based on external estimates. We do not have biosimilarscorresponding to all biologics that will lose patent protection in the next decade. This long-term growth is drivenin part by an increasingly favorable regulatory framework that has increased the rate of approvals in the UnitedStates and the EU, as well as potentially increased demand in new and existing untapped markets, such as China,where only a few biosimilars have so far been approved. 87We believe the future outlook for biosimilars is promising, particularly in the United States where broad health care provider, patient and payor acceptance of biosimilars and policy trends continue in a favorabledirection, and where initial pricing pressure may not be as significant as in other geographies such as the EU. Webelieve we are well-positioned to capitalize on the United States market opportunity for biosimilars given ourlaunch experience across our commercial team. We expect that our biosimilars business will continue to generategrowth in the near term. Our Biosimilars Strategy In the short term, our biosimilars strategy is focused on commercializing the five biosimilars sourced from our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis. We believe the commercial experience obtained from our priorbiosimilars launches (Renflexis in the United States and Ontruzant in the United States and the EU) provides us acompetitive advantage in the market. All five biosimilars products in our portfolio have launched, two of whichare the oncology biosimilars, Ontruzant and Aybintio. We launched Ontruzant in the United States in April 2020and launched Aybintio in the EU in September 2020. We currently have no plan for the timing of any launch ofAybintio in the United States nor do we know when such timing would be determined. We expect to drive futurevalue through the commercialization of Hadlima, an adalimumab biosimilar, with launches in Australia and inCanada in 2021 and in the United States in 2023. In the long-term, given the favorable outlook for the biosimilarsindustry, we intend to expand our portfolio through the identification and evaluation of new assets that facebiosimilar competition in therapeutic areas such as oncology, immunology, ophthalmology, diabetes andneuroscience, among others, both through our Samsung Bioepis collaboration and through other potentialcollaborations. Our Biosimilars Products The portfolio currently consists of three immunology products, Brenzys, Renflexis and Hadlima, and two oncology products, Ontruzant and Aybintio. Aybintio was recently launched in the EU. For the year endedDecember 31, 2020, the biologics comparable to our biosimilars products generated sales (unless otherwisenoted) in the following amounts, according to public filings: Our Biosimilar Biologic ProductGlobal belaunched third-quarter 2021; and United States\u2014approvedas of July 2019 and expected to be launched June (1) Global sales of commercialized biologic products is presented solely for the purpose of characterizing theaddressable market. We expect global sales for each of our biosimilar products to be substantially less thanthe global sales for the corresponding biologic product. (2) Net revenue. 88Hadlima (SB5) Hadlima (adalimumab-bwwd) AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab) product, arthritis, psoriaticarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and plaquepsoriasis. Our current Hadlima filing does not include hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis indications. We haveworldwide commercialization rights to Hadlima in countries outside of the EU, Korea, China, Turkey and Russia.Samsung Bioepis reached a global settlement with AbbVie permitting us to launch Hadlima in the United Statesin June 2023 and outside of the United States starting in 2021. Hadlima is currently approved in the UnitedStates, Australia, Canada and Israel and was launched in Australia and Canada in February 2021. Brenzys (SB4) Brenzys (etanercept) treatment of arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis. Wehave commercialization rights to Brenzys in countries outside the EU, Korea, China, Japan and the United States,and it is currently approved and commercialized in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Israel. Renflexis (SB2) Renflexis (infliximab-abda) Remicade (infliximab) product, for treatment of Crohn's disease, disease, ulcerative colitis, pediatriculcerative colitis, ankylosing plaque psoriasis. We have worldwidecommercialization rights to Renflexis in countries outside the EU, Korea, China, Turkey and Russia, and it iscurrently approved and commercialized in the United States, Australia and Canada. Aybintio (SB8) Aybintio (bevacizumab) Avastin (bevacizumab) product. Aybintio is currently approved and commercialized in the EU for treatment of metastaticcarcinoma of the colon or rectum, metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic renal cellcarcinoma, metastatic cervical cancer, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer andmetastatic breast cancer. We currently have no plan for the timing of any launch of Aybintio in the United Statesnor do we know when such timing would be determined. We have commercialization rights to Aybintio in theUnited States, Canada, Germany, Italy, France, the UK and Spain. Ontruzant (SB3) Ontruzant (trastuzumab-dttb) Herceptin (trastuzumab) product. Ontruzant was approved by the FDA in January 2019 for the treatment of HER2overexpressing breast cancer and HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junctionadenocarcinoma consistent with Herceptin and by the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") in November 2017as the first trastuzumab biosimilar approved in the EU. Samsung Bioepis reached a global settlement with Rochein June 2019 allowing for us to launch Ontruzant worldwide. We have worldwide commercialization rights toOntruzant in countries outside of Korea and China. Ontruzant launched in Europe in early 2018 and in the UnitedStates in April 2020. Established Brands Portfolio Established brands represents a broad portfolio of mature brands, developed and launched by Merck or its predecessors, across multiple therapeutic areas and geographies and which are generally beyond market 89exclusivity. Our established brands portfolio contributed approximately 70%, or $4.5 billion of Organon Products segment sales in 2020. These figures reflect the reduced administration of many products within establishedbrands, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generic competition varies significantly across geographies.Products that have more recently lost market exclusivity, such as Zetia and Vytorin, account for the highestproportion of total established brands portfolio sales declines due to the entrance of new generic competition.Other products are experiencing only minimal sales declines and retaining organic growth opportunities. Webelieve our established brands portfolio is well-positioned in the market; we have a broad portfolio of brands,including leading brands in cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatology and non-opioid pain management, we havehigh-quality manufacturing functions and we maintain competitive pricing across multiple therapeutic areas andgeographies. Our established brands portfolio has a particularly strong foothold in emerging markets where wehave a broad base of products enabling us to build targeted additional product offerings and developments. Weexpect that greater managerial focus to capture local market opportunities, along with targeted investments inexpanding our geographic footprint, digital promotion and commercial trade channels, will provide new revenueopportunities for select brands. Established Brands Market and Strategy The majority of our established brands products are beyond market exclusivity. However, these products continue to represent a significant value opportunity arising from long-term sustainable revenue streams andwell-established supply chains that together generate significant operating profit relative to low promotional anddevelopment expenses. We believe that through strategic investment in established brands marketing and distribution, we can continue to deploy our large established brands product portfolio across our broad geographic footprint toidentify and manage organic growth opportunities. Our established brands portfolio has been managed through amix of efficient, digital-only promotion or local and regional promotional collaborations, which we believeenables product promotion while minimizing sales and marketing expenses. We plan to continually assess thesecollaborations to drive value for both parties. We believe there is opportunity to deliver growth from this portfolio. We continue to have market exclusivity for Arcoxia in many markets. Our cardiovascular brand Atozet also continues to enjoy marketexclusivity in multiple countries where we intend to grow our sales by increasing our share of the globalcholesterol-lowering market and expanding our geographic footprint with new country launches. In China, weplan to accelerate our strong progress by pivoting from a sole focus on the public tender market to growthopportunities in the private retail segment. Opportunities to stabilize or grow select products in select countries inthis portfolio tend to arise once the largest period of price and unit erosion has occurred immediately after loss ofmarket exclusivity and initial generic entrants. In the United States, there are fewer opportunities for ourestablished brands portfolio to grow after loss of patent exclusivity. However, outside of the United States,product-specific and individual market dynamics create opportunities for sales stabilization and even organicgrowth. Although the vast majority of our respiratory, dermatology and non-opioid pain management brandshave lost market exclusivity for several years, they continue to demonstrate strong resilience with health careproviders and patients. We intend to further invest in digital engagement models that allow us to reach ourcustomers and patients effectively. We intend to make select investments in our manufacturing sites, as well as drive supply chain improvements by our manufacturing partners, to build an efficient, robust and reliable supply chain. We alsointend to investigate opportunities to expand our established brands offerings and improve patient access throughtargeted new market launches and new indications listings. For example, we intend to launch Atozet and Rosuzetin new markets. We believe we have the commercial and market access, regulatory affairs, specializedmanufacturing and clinical development expertise that will enable expanded established brands offerings andimproved patient access to occur. 90Cardiovascular In 2020, our cardiovascular portfolio accounted for $1.9 billion, or approximately 29%, of Organon Products segment sales, nearly all of which was generated outside the United States, including approximately16%, or $305 million in China. Our cardiovascular portfolio consists of several cholesterol-modifying medicines,including: Zetia (ezetimibe), which is marketed as Ezetrol in most countries outside the United States; Vytorin(ezetimibe / simvastatin), which is marketed as Inegy outside the United States; Atozet (ezetimibe andatorvastatin), which is marketed in certain countries outside of the United States; Rosuzet (ezetimibe androsuvastatin), which is also marketed in certain countries outside of the United States; and Zocor (simvastatin),which is also available in certain countries outside of the United States, including China. Our portfolio alsoincludes Cozaar and Hyzaar (losartan and losartan / hydrochlorothiazide), which are cardiovascular drugs for thetreatment of hypertension. Respiratory In 2020, our respiratory portfolio accounted for $1.2 billion, or approximately 18%, of Organon Products segment sales, with approximately 74%, or $848 million, generated outside the United where Clarinex is classified by regulators as anover-the-counter medicine, the rights for Clarinex were sold to Bayer as part of Merck's divestment of itsover-the-counter medicine business in 2014. We currently own prescription rights for Clarinex in the UnitedStates and Aerius in markets around the world. Dermatology, Bone Health and Non-Opioid Pain Management In 2020, our dermatology, bone health and non-opioid pain management portfolios accounted for $833 million, or approximately 13%, of Organon Products segment sales, nearly all of which were generatedoutside the United States. Our dermatology portfolio consists of two core products, including Diprosone(betamethasone cream), a corticosteroid approved for treatment in relief of skin conditions and Elocon(mometasone cream), a topical prescription medicine approved for treatment in relief of inflammation, and othersymptoms caused by certain skin conditions. Our bone health portfolio includes Fosamax (alendronate sodium), abisphosphonate medicine used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and toincrease bone mass in men with osteoporosis. Our non-opioid pain management portfolio consists of three coreproducts, including Arcoxia (etoricoxib), a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor used for acute and chronictreatment of conditions such as acute pain, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, Diprospan (betamethasone), aglucocorticoids drug approved for treatment of conditions such bursitis, dermatological disorders andinflammatory conditions and Celestone (betamethasone injectable suspension), a sterile aqueous suspensionapproved for treatment of pain and inflammation, and conditions such as endocrine disorders and gastrointestinaldiseases. We have proven development capabilities that support the potential growth profile of our dermatology,bone health and non-opioid pain management portfolios. These brands have demonstrated strong resilience withhealth care providers and patients. We expect growth in these portfolios across multiple geographies. Other Established Brands This portfolio covers our other mature products, some of which remain significant to our product portfolio, including products such as Proscar (finasteride) and Propecia (finasteride). benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate, accounted for $176 million ofour sales in 2020. In addition, Propecia, used for the treatment of male pattern hair loss, accounted for$129 million of our sales in 2020. Nearly all of the sales of Proscar and Propecia were generated outside of theUnited States. 91New Product Capabilities Strategic Acquisition and Business Development and Collaboration ActivitiesFollowing our separation from Merck, we expect to actively engage in business development and collaboration activities to supplement our existing portfolio and internal development efforts, with a focus onexpanding our leadership position in women's health. Our expertise in women's health will enable us to trackinnovative science and identify promising products with the potential to address unmet medical need. Webelieve that our shared history with Merck, our global market access, commercial capabilities, andmanufacturing platforms, along with our management team's experience in development and implementationof clinical programs approved by global regulatory agencies, will make us a clear partner of choice tocompanies seeking to manage global development and commercialization. We plan to further advance ourwomen's health clinical development capabilities through future acquisitions, to drive us toward becoming theleading women's health biopharmaceutical company across needs and conditions that uniquely anddisproportionately impact women. Research and Development Our research and development initiatives aim to foster an innovative and nimble environment to generate robust clinical data supporting rapid global product registration, as well as value and access insights to expandthe commercial reach of our portfolio. Our development strategy seeks to achieve business continuity with our brands and unlock value from our existing products by utilizing our technical expertise to pursue new line extensions, new indications and in-linevalue enhancements. As part of our core strategy for growth and improved operating leverage position, we expectto identify scientific collaborations and acquisitions to develop late-stage assets and enhance our pipeline. Through our internal scientific expertise or close collaborations with partners, we expect to be enabled by a full range of capabilities necessary to achieve the rapid development of product development opportunities anddata generation for product registration globally. Our medical affairs and health economic scientists will utilize data generated by our clinical programs and observational studies, real-world data, and economic models of payor trends in order to demonstrate the value ofour products to payors and engage health care providers in scientific dialogue. We intend to use observationaland real-world data to drive strategy for future evidence generation, support access strategy development andinform external policy related to product reimbursement. We also intend to use the insights we gain throughhealth, economic and predictive modeling and data analytics to understand and communicate the full value of ourproducts, grow market access and enhance patient care in a dynamic health care environment, as well as informthe design of clinical programs and program investment choices. Sales, Marketing and Distribution Capabilities Sales and MarketingWe expect that upon the separation, we will have approximately 4,030 employees worldwide focused on commercialization activities, such as marketing, direct selling, digital and omni-channel and insight generation,covering data stewardship, data analytics and data science. We have experienced marketers and data scientistsacross geographies that we expect to implement localization and execution of our global brand and businessstrategies. We believe our commercialization capabilities will allow us to execute customer engagementstrategies optimized across preferred channels and aimed at health care providers, patients and payors. We expectthat our employees will be focused on building an integrated digital ecosystem that will coordinate engagementacross all channels. The engagements will include direct face-to-face engagement, virtual engagement, email,social media and our websites. In addition, we believe we have the knowledge, capabilities and resources toachieve optimal local market access for our portfolio in a changing external environment. 92In women's health, we have established relationships with payors, health care providers, large clinics, and important stakeholder groups such as societies, patients and scientific leaders within both contraception andfertility. We have experience and capabilities with two distinctive fit-for-purpose commercialization models thatreflect the specific requirements of obstetricians and gynecologists and reproductive endocrinologist specialistsin the respective target categories of contraception and fertility. We expect that we will have broad reach whereprescribing is done by health care providers. In biosimilars, we have established capabilities in reimbursement and tendering to maximize global access and medical affairs for payors and health care providers to understand the clinical profile of our biosimilars. Wealso have experience with commercializing biosimilars within the United States, the fastest growing biosimilarsmarket with the largest market size potential, and in developing value propositions for payors and health careproviders in the EU. In established brands, we have digital omni-channel marketing experience and portfolio-selling capabilities to enable the promotion of multiple and diverse portfolios across multiple diverse geographies. We also haveexpertise derived from established relationships with our commercial trade partners, including distributors,wholesalers, purchasing groups and pharmacies, that are important in achieving continued product availabilityand sustained access to our brands in the market. Such expertise and relationships also support our effectiveinventory management, data insights, product support and relevant pricing and chargeback administrationfunctions. We have a trade channel strategy that provides a robust capability framework for our activities, including in the selection of channel partners, commercial terms and supportive health care services that promote theefficient, safe and cost-effective delivery of our products. We have significant insight into the use of newertechnologies such as blockchain, and the use of valuable patient services such as patient adherence programs thatcan further drive value in collaboration with our trade partners. We have no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Distribution Our global network enables us to distribute products directly and indirectly to patients in more than 140 countries and territories, including through our regional distribution centers. We sell our pharmaceutical productsprimarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies, pharmacies and managedhealth care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and otherinstitutions. We also sell our pharmaceutical products through third-party distributors and agents for smallermarkets. Our professional representatives communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of our pharmaceuticalproducts to health care professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals and managed careorganizations. Manufacturing Capabilities and Global Supply Chain We have an established heritage in quality manufacturing, including development and improvement of manufacturing processes. Our principal manufacturing capabilities include formulation, fill-and-finishing ofproducts, packaging of products, and distribution and supply to patients in more than 140 countries andterritories. Internal Manufacturing Capabilities Following our separation from Merck, we expect to own and operate six manufacturing sites, as shown in the table below, where we will manufacture a range of pharmaceutical products, including hormonal products,sterile formulations, and certain of our medical device combination products. 93Site Predominant area of Focus # Markets Served Workforce(1) Campinas, Brazil ............... Women's health, cardiovascular and respiratory~12 (in Latin America)~200 Cramlington, United Kingdom .... Cardiovascular and ................ and dermatology~16 Pacific)~200 Xochimilco, Mexico ............ Cardiovascular and respiratory ~30 (in Latin America and others)(2)~170 (1) Workforce estimated based on 2021 year-end forecast, represents manufacturing employees and does not include other global support functions or temporary, contingent workers. (2) Including Australia, Canada and the Philippines. A majority of our internal manufacturing sites have long-standing, deep technical capabilities across the broad base of manufacturing platforms that are required to support our product portfolio. Our specializedmanufacturing capabilities include oral solid dosage manufacturing, liquids, ointments and creamsmanufacturing, aseptic processing of hormonal products, extrusion technology, inhaler and implant medicaldevice combination products, and packaging to facilitate speed to market as well as more direct control of qualityand compliance. We also expect to continue to manufacture a range of Merck products at each of our sixmanufacturing sites. The terms of our arrangement for the manufacture of Merck products will be governed by anagreement with Merck entered into at the time of our separation. See \"Certain Relationships and Related PartyTransactions.\" Contracted Manufacturing We also intend to contract with Merck or other third-parties for the manufacture of certain of our products. We expect that our manufacturing team will supervise external manufacturing activities conducted bythird-parties related to our products. Global Supply Chain We manage our global supply chain through planning centers with oversight for the United States, Europe, Canada, the Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and in the Caribbean. We purchase certain raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, components, devices and other supplies necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Weutilize third-party contract manufacturers for packaging, formulation and fill-and-finish for our products. We alsoutilize a combination of logistics service providers as part of our global supply chain, primarily for storage andfor shipping and delivering raw materials, intermediate goods and finished goods between internal sites and fromproduction sites to customers. In order to satisfy the manufacturing and regulatory requirements for the products in our portfolio, we rely on a single source for a number of materials and components critical to our products, including, for example,100% of our active pharmaceutical ingredients and portions of our drug product. The majority of our single-sourced materials and components are from established pharmaceutical suppliers with whom we have significantexperience. In addition, we rely heavily on one supplier for formulation and packaging as our gateway to sales inboth China and Japan. 94To mitigate supply risk, we aim to have a conservative inventory posture and to keep an internal function focused on maintaining an external manufacturing network with operational, quality, technology andprocurement capabilities. This function is responsible for identifying, developing and assessing the performanceof our suppliers such that they meet quality expectations and satisfy their contractual obligations to us. Inaddition, this function provides rapid response support for potential supply issues. We also have an establishedrisk management framework, which is intended to assess risk elements across our supply chain to mitigate risks. Our manufacturing network and supply chains are designed to provide us with a flexible and scalable global platform for continued expansion, including in emerging markets. We believe our extensive manufacturing andsupply chain expertise and capabilities position us well to provide critical therapies for distribution in all regionsof the world and to meet growing demand over the long-term. Our global commercial and manufacturing teams collaborate on various operational efficiency initiatives, including yield improvements, procurement savings, site synergies, manufacturing support rationalization andsupply chain distribution optimization, each intended to improve our leverage position. Quality Management Our facilities and supporting functions, along with our external contractors, suppliers, and partners, make up an integrated, interdependent global network that is dedicated to consistently delivering compliant, reliableproduct supply to health care providers and patients. We have one quality management system deployed globallythat enables the development, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, handling, and distribution of the company'sproducts such that they conform to applicable regulatory requirements in every country we serve. Our qualitymanagement system is designed to promote and facilitate regulatory and operational excellence, anticipate risks,and prepare the network to effectively respond and adapt to emerging trends. Human Capital Upon the separation, we will have approximately 9,950 employees worldwide with approximately 4,030 employees focusing on sales, marketing and key commercialization activities. Approximately 730 employeeswill focus on clinical development, safety, and medical affairs and product registration. Our human resourcesorganization is led by an experienced team that monitors our employee base and sets annual targets for managingour human capital, including employee retention, engagement and training targets. Our experienced TalentCommittee (as defined herein) develops diversity and inclusion initiatives and regularly reviews our strategiesand programs for leadership development. We have established benefit and incentive compensation plans,including comprehensive medical and life insurance coverage, 401K matching programs and other incentivecompensation programs that we believe align employee incentives directly with our future performance. Properties We expect to own and operate six manufacturing facilities as described above under \"\u2014Manufacturing Capabilities and Global Supply Chain\u2014Internal Manufacturing Capabilities.\" Intellectual Property Patents, Trademarks and LicensesPatent protection is important to the marketing of certain of our products in the United States and in most major foreign markets. Patents may cover products per se , pharmaceutical formulations, processes for, or intermediates useful in, the manufacture of products, or the uses of products. Protection for individual productsextends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protectionafforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope ofcoverage. 95In particular, we consider the patents that cover the rod technology in Nexplanon / Implanon NXT to be material to our business. Such device patents will expire in 2027 in the United States and in 2025 in othercountries around the world. There are currently no contested proceedings or third-party claims that involve thesepatents. We have been granted licenses to use such patents from Merck. Such licenses permit use of theunderlying technology solely as a contraceptive implant containing only the active pharmaceutical ingredientcurrently used in the product. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act includes a Pediatric Exclusivity Provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the United States for indications of new or currentlymarketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant. Current United States patentlaw provides additional patent terms for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review by theFDA. The EU also provides an additional six months of pediatric market exclusivity attached to a product'sSupplementary Protection Certificate. Japan provides the additional term for pediatric studies attached to marketexclusivity unrelated to patent term. While the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product, commercial benefits may continue to be derived from: (i) later-granted patents onprocesses and intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient ofsuch product; (ii) patents relating to the use of such product; (iii) patents relating to novel compositions andformulations; and (iv) in the United States and certain other countries, market exclusivity that may be availableunder relevant law. The effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon manyother factors, such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, thecomplexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and therequirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and regulationsin other countries. Additions to market exclusivity are sought in the United States and other countries through all relevant laws, including laws increasing patent life. Some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset byan increase in the number of incentives for and use of generic products. Additionally, improvements inintellectual property laws are sought in the United States and other countries through reform of patent and otherrelevant laws and implementation of international treaties. For further information with respect to our patents, see the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and Note 10 \"Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities\" to the Financial Statements included in this information statement. Worldwide, all of our important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used ; in other countries,as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely. Royalty income in 2020 on patent and know-how licenses and other rights amounted to $6 million. We also incurred royalty expenses amounting to $40 million in 2020 under patent and know-how licenses we hold. Privacy and Data Protection We are subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on our ability to transfer, access and use personal data across our business. Thelegislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There has beenincreased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with thepotential to affect directly our business, including both the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"),which went into effect in May 2018 and imposes penalties of up to 4% of global revenue, and the CaliforniaConsumer Privacy Act, which became effective January 1, 2020. 96The GDPR and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States govern the collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU. The GDPR increased responsibility and liability inrelation to personal data that we process. It also imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on theability to process (which includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data, including health data fromclinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to the consent of theindividuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processingtheir personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national dataprotection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. Further, the GDPR prohibits thetransfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that are not considered by the European Commission toprovide an adequate level of data protection, including to the United States, except if the data controller meetsvery specific requirements. Following the Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union onJuly 16, 2020, there is considerable uncertainty as to the permissibility of international data transfers under theGDPR. In light of the implications of this decision we may face difficulties regarding the transfer of personaldata from the European Union to third countries. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties as well as civilliability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from thedifferent EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national dataprotection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to thecomplexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at both EU level and at the national levelin individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices is often updated orotherwise revised. There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Failing to complywith these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, harm toour reputation, and adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplaybetween different regulatory frameworks further adds to the complexity that we face with regard to dataprotection regulation. Additional laws and regulations enacted in the United States (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act), Europe, Asia and Latin America have increased enforcement and litigation activity in the United States and otherdeveloped markets, as well as increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. We haveadopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving risks and facilitate the transfer ofpersonal information across international borders, which has been certified as compliant with and approved bythe Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Cross-Border Privacy Rules System. Competition and the Health Care Environment CompetitionThe markets in which we conduct our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. Our competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceuticalcompanies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers. Ouroperations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as our products mature, as well astechnological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitivecombination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors' branded productsand new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patentrights are increasingly being challenged by competitors and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverseresult in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existingproducts and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect 97to intangible assets associated with certain products. Competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown. To remain competitive, the additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control, flexibility to meet buyer specifications, an efficient distribution system and a strong technicalinformation service. We plan to acquire and market products through external alliances, such as licensingarrangements and collaborations and have designed our sales and marketing efforts to address changing industryconditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in pricereductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. For example, the number ofcompounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed salesgrowth or reduced sales for our products in that therapeutic category. Health Care Environment Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. United States In the United States, federal and state governments for many years have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs for which they pay. For example, federal and state laws require us to pay specified rebates for medicinesreimbursed by Medicaid and to provide discounts for medicines purchased by certain state and federal entitiessuch as the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service entities and hospitals serving adisproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients. Health Care Programs The United States enacted major health care reform legislation in 2010, the ACA. Various insurance market reforms have since advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014. With respect tothe effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry, the law increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1%to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid-managed care utilization and increased the types of entities eligiblefor the federal 340B drug discount program. The law also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 70% ofthe cost of the medicine, including biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the MedicarePart D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called \"donut hole\"), which increased from 50% beginning in 2019 as a result ofthe Balanced Budget Act of 2018. We recorded approximately $24 million, $30 million and $20 million as areduction to revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the donut hole provision. Also,pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee. The totalannual industry fee was $2.8 billion in both 2019 and 2020. The fee is assessed on each company in proportion toits share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs, such as Medicare andMedicaid. We recorded approximately $4 million, $6 million and $6 million of costs within Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the annual health care reform fee. In February 2016, the CMS issued the Medicaid Rebate Final Rule that implemented provisions of the ACA effective April 1,2016. The rule provides comprehensive guidance on the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price and BestPrice; two metrics utilized to determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaidprograms. In 2019, CMS took further action on two aspects of the rule that were deferred for laterimplementation. First, CMS declined to define what constitutes a product \"line extension\" (beyond the statutorydefinition) instead advising manufacturers to rely on the statutory definition of the term and permittingmanufacturers, where appropriate, to use \"reasonable assumptions\" in their determination of whether their drugqualifies as a line extension drug, so long as such reasonable assumptions are consistent with the purpose ofSection 1927 of the Social Security Act, federal regulations, and the terms of the Medicaid Drug Rebateagreement, and so long as they maintain adequate documentation explaining such assumptions. Second, CMSconfirmed a second delay in the participation of the United States Territories in the Medicaid Drug RebateProgram until April 1, 2022. 98On December 31, 2020, CMS published a Final Rule on the Medicaid Program, which, among other things, introduced new definitions of \"line extension\" and \"new formulation.\" CMS defined \"line extension\" as a newformulation of the drug, not including an abuse-deterrent formulation of the drug. CMS adopted an expansivedefinition of \"new formulation\" to include \"an extended release formulation or other change in releasemechanism, a change in dosage form, strength, route of administration, or ingredients.\" This expanded definitionwill result in a number of drugs being subject to a higher Medicaid rebate. The new definitions of \"lineextension\" and \"new formulation\" will take effect on January 1, 2022. The Final Rule also revised definitions ofseveral other terms for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP), including oral solid dosageform, single source drug, multiple source drug, innovator multiple source drug, and CMS-authorizedsupplemental rebate agreement. The Final Rule also revised regulations regarding authorized generic sales whenmanufacturers calculate the average manufacturer price (AMP), manufacturer reporting requirements under theMDRP, and payments for prescription drugs under the Medicaid program. The implementation date of theserevised regulations is January 1, 2023. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act There is significant uncertainty about the future of the ACA in particular and health care laws in general in the United States. In December 2018, a Texas federal district court struck down the ACA on the grounds that theindividual health insurance mandate is unconstitutional. The United States Supreme Court heard arguments inthis case on November 10, 2020 and a decision is expected by the Spring of 2021. If the individual mandate isheld to be unconstitutional and not severable from the remainder of the ACA, we expect this would result ininvalidation of the BPCIA, which provides for an abbreviated pathway for obtaining FDA approval of biologicdrugs that satisfy certain criteria and which is incorporated into the ACA. We are participating in the healthcare debate and monitoring how any proposed changes could affect our business. We are unable to predict the likelihood of changes to the ACA. Depending on the nature of any changesto the ACA, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations,financial condition and prospects. Other Legislative Changes In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes include automatic aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscalyear as part of the federal budget sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, which went into effect inApril 2013. Section 4408 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act temporarily suspendedMedicare sequestration during the period of May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, while extending theMedicare sequestration sunset date through 2030. The moratorium on Medicare sequestration was subsequentlyextended by three months, until March 31, 2021, under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. A number of states have passed pharmaceutical price and cost transparency laws. These laws typically require manufacturers to report certain product price information or other financial data to the state. Some lawsalso require manufacturers to provide advance notification of price increases. We expect that states will continuetheir focus on pharmaceutical price transparency and that this focus will continue to exert pressure on productpricing. Drug Pricing We also face increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect our sales and profit margins, including, in the United States(i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges and institutional and governmentalpurchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the MedicarePrescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the ACA. As discussed above, in 99November 2020, the OIG issued a Final Rule that would, effective January 1, 2022, eliminate the Anti- Kickback Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to PBMs on behalf of such plans.The Final Rule's effective date has been delayed until January 1, 2023 in response to litigation brought by atrade association on behalf of PBMs. While the Company cannot anticipate the effects of this change to theway it currently contracts, this new framework could significantly alter the way it does business with Part DPlan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans. This rulemaking also established, effective January 1, 2021,a new safe harbor for point of sale discounts at the pharmacy counter and a new safe harbor for certainservices arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs. This rule is currently subject to legalchallenge. On November 20, 2020, CMS also issued the MFN Rule, which was intended to be effectiveJanuary 1, 2021, to institute a new pricing system for certain prescription drugs and biologic products coveredby Medicare Part B in which Medicare would reimburse no more than the \"most favored nation price,\"meaning the lowest price after adjusting for volume and differences in gross domestic product, for the top fiftyPart B reimbursed products, sold in 22 member countries of the OECD, rather than use the current AverageSales Price (\"ASP\")-based payment framework for certain physician-administered drugs. Implementation ofthe MFN Rule could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash flow, results ofoperations, financial condition and prospects. The MFN Rule was immediately challenged in federal courtsand is prevented from going into effect pending final judgments in the lawsuit. The Department of Health andHuman Services has indicated that the MFN model will not be implemented without further rulemaking. TheFDA also recently issued rulemaking allowing the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs fromCanada through FDA-authorized, time-limited programs sponsored by states or Indian tribes, and, in certainfuture circumstances, pharmacists and wholesalers. The FDA also recently released final guidance for industrydetailing procedures for drug manufacturers to import FDA-approved prescription drug, biological, andcombination products that were manufactured abroad and authorized and intended for sale in a foreigncountry. A trade organization brought suit, which remains pending in federal district court, challenging thecommercial importation rule. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow,results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Changes to the health care system enacted as part ofhealth care reform in the United States, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate onbehalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. As anexample, health care reform has contributed to an increase in the number of patients in the Medicaid programunder which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates. The pharmaceutical industry also could be considered a potential source of savings via other legislative and administrative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. These types of revenue-generating orcost-saving proposals include additional direct price controls. The U.S. House of Representatives approvedlegislation that would require pharmaceutical companies to directly negotiate the price of 50 drugs with thefederal government. Although the U.S. Senate did not approve the bill, similar measures may be reintroduced inthe future. It remains very uncertain as to what drug-pricing related proposals, if any, may be included under thecurrent Congress as part of future federal legislative proposals that would directly or indirectly affect us. Duringhis presidential campaign, President Biden expressed support for allowing the federal government to negotiatedrug prices for both public and private purchasers. In addition, additional proposals that allow international reference pricing or, under certain conditions, the importation of medicines from other countries may be considered. For example, in December 2019, the FDAissued guidance describing procedures for drug manufacturers to facilitate the importation of FDA-approveddrugs and biologics manufactured abroad and originally intended for sale in a foreign country into the UnitedStates. Also, in September 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued a FinalRule that allows importation of certain lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada. Under the Final Rule,effective November 30, 2020, states or certain other non-federal governmental entities will be able to submitimportation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization of two-year programs (with theopportunity to extend for two more years). This rule is currently facing a legal challenge and is currently pendingin federal district court, but if upheld, or if additional future legislative action is taken on drug importation, itwould be expected to adversely affect our revenues. 100In the United States private sector, consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products. Health plans and PBMs have been consolidating intofewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as wellas governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formularyinclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for our products or obtaining suchplacement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay differentials,private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments required frombeneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurancecompanies also are increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring priorauthorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one ormore generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also usedin treatment areas in which the payor has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeuticallycomparable. As the United States payor market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in genericform, pharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors. European Union Efforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in the EU. We face competitive pricing pressure resulting from generic and biosimilar drugs. In addition, a majority of countries in the EU attempt to contain drugcosts by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices ofdrugs. Reference pricing may either compare a product's prices in other markets (external reference pricing), orcompare a product's price with those of other products in a national class (internal reference pricing). Theauthorities then use the price data to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including ours. Guidelines forexamining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations. SomeEU Member States have established free-pricing systems, but regulate the pricing for drugs through profit controlplans. Others seek to negotiate or set prices based on the cost-effectiveness of a product or an assessment of whetherit offers a therapeutic benefit over other products in the relevant class. The downward pressure on health care costsin general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are beingerected to the entry of new products. In some EU Member States, cross-border imports from low-priced marketsalso exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within an EU Member State. Additionally, EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement plans varywidely from Member State to Member State. Some EU Member States provide that drug products may be marketedonly after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some EU Member States may require the completion ofadditional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to already available therapiesor so-called health technology assessments (\"HTA\"), in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. TheHTA of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursementprocedures in most EU Member States. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of thesecountries, involves the assessment of the cost-effectiveness, public health impact, therapeutic impact and/or theeconomic and social impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national health care system of theindividual country is conducted. Ultimately, HTA measures the added value of a new health technology comparedto existing ones. The outcome of HTAs regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the pricingand reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual EUMember States. A negative HTA of one of our products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or may forceus to reduce our reimbursement price or offer discounts or rebates. A negative HTA by a leading and recognizedHTA body could also undermine our ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a jurisdiction.For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms may rely to some extent on theHTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework, to inform pricing and reimbursement decisions. HTA procedures require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on availablereimbursement. 101To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, we may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other therapies that are considered thelocal standard of care. There can be no assurance that any EU Member State will allow favorable pricing,reimbursement and market access conditions for any of our products, or that it will be feasible to conductadditional cost-effectiveness studies, if required. Brexit In 2016, the United Kingdom (\"UK\") held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" As a result of that referendum and subsequent negotiations, the UK left the EUon January 31, 2020. A transitional period applied from January 31, 2020 until December 31, 2020, and duringthis period the EU and UK operated as if the UK was an EU Member State, and the UK continued to participatein the EU Customs Union allowing for the freedom of movement for people and goods. It was announced on December 24, 2020, that the EU and the UK agreed to a Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). The TCA sets out the new arrangements for trade of goods, including medicines andvaccines, which allows goods to can continue to flow between the EU and the UK. On December 29, 2020, theCouncil of the EU adopted the decision to sign the TCA and for the TCA to be provisionally applied fromJanuary 1, 2021. The UK and EU signed the TCA on December 30, 2020. In order for the TCA to be ratified andformally come into effect the Council of the EU must unanimously approve the TCA the European Parliamentmust consent to it, which we believe will occur. As a result of the TCA, we believe that our operations will not bematerially adversely affected by Brexit. Japan In Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricings for specific products if it determinesthat use of such products will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules. The nextgovernment-mandated pricing reduction will occur in April 2021 and is expected to impact many Organonproducts. China Our business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to our overall pharmaceutical business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of our business in China is dependentupon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products, sustained accessfor our current in-line products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. In recentyears, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented a number of structural reforms to accelerate theshift to innovative products and reduce costs. Since 2017, there have been multiple new policies introduced bythe government to improve access to new innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings, and acceleratethe review and approval process. This has led to a significant increase in the number of new products beingapproved each year. Additionally, in 2017, the Chinese government updated the National Reimbursement DrugList for the first time in eight years. While the mechanism for drugs being added to the list evolves, inclusionmay require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands. In 2020, drugswere added to the NRDL through double-digit price reductions. While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volume based procurement (\"VBP\"). In 2019, thegovernment implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products which have genericsubstitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation approval. Mature products that have entered into thefirst three rounds of VBP have had, on average, a price reduction of 50%. We expect VBP to be a semi-annualprocess that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward. 102Other Markets Our focus on other markets, in addition to China, has continued. Governments in many other markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impactingintellectual property, including in exception, cases, threats of compulsory licenses, that aim to put pressure on theprice of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in constrained market access to innovative medicine. We anticipatethat pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to varying degrees in suchmarkets. Beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in certain countries outside the United States can affect our efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, changes intrade sanctions and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changingavailability of funding for health care, credit worthiness of healthcare partners, such as hospitals, due toCOVID-19, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for us. Further, we mayengage third-party agents to assist in operating in such markets, which may affect our ability to realize continuedgrowth and may also increase our risk exposure. In addressing cost containment pressures, we engage in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continue to work to demonstrate that our medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for healthcare. We advocate with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health carefinancing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as asource of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, we encourage thosegovernments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens' access toappropriate health care, including medicines. Operating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. Although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on ourbusiness, we continually take measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and our businesspractices to better meet customer needs and believe that we are well-positioned to respond to the evolving healthcare environment and market forces. Regulation of Our Products The pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world, focused on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well asconditions for sale or reimbursement. Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals.In some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary todevelop new products and bring them to market in the United States. At the same time, the FDA has committedto expediting the development and review of products bearing the \"breakthrough therapy\" designation, which hasaccelerated the regulatory review process for medicines with this designation. The FDA has also undertakenefforts to bring generic and biosimilar competition to market more efficiently and in a more timely manner. The EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, approval for marketing, labeling, advertising, manufacturing, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, pharmacovigilance andsafety monitoring of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU,which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU Member States. In particular,EU regulators may approve products subject to a number of post-authorization conditions. Examples of typicalpost-authorization commitments include additional pharmacovigilance, the conduct of clinical trials, theestablishment of patient registries, physician or patient education and controlled distribution and prescribingarrangements. Non-compliance with post-authorization conditions, pharmacovigilance and other obligations can 103lead to regulatory action, including the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations, or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including the imposition of financial penalties. Our policies andprocedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, we believe that they willnot have any material effect on our business. We believe that we will continue to be able to conduct our operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment. The Regulatory Approval Process in the United States Industry practice and government regulations in the United States and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds suitable for pharmaceutical use throughpre-clinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. Before a new drug may be marketed in the United States,recorded data on pre-clinical and clinical experience are included in the New Drug Application (\"NDA\") for adrug, or the Biologics License Application (\"BLA\") for a biologic submitted to the FDA for the requiredapproval. Once scientists identify internal technology development opportunities or external technology licensing opportunities to enable improvement of existing products or development of new products, pre-clinical testingwith that compound is commenced. Pre-clinical testing includes laboratory testing and safety studies to gatherdata on chemistry, pharmacology, immunogenicity and toxicology and must be conducted in compliance withGood Laboratory Practice regulations. Pending acceptable pre-clinical data, we will submit an InvestigationalNew Drug (\"IND\") application to the FDA through a combination of internal and external resources, whichincludes the results of pre-clinical testing, information about the drug composition and manufacturing, and ourplan for clinical testing on humans. After submission of the IND, we must wait 30 days before initiating clinicaltesting so that the FDA has the opportunity to review the IND for safety and to determine that clinical testing willnot expose human subjects to unreasonable risk. We will then initiate clinical testing under the supervision ofqualified investigators in accordance with established regulatory requirements, including Good Clinical Practiceregulations. The clinical testing begins with Phase 1 studies, which are designed to assess safety, tolerability,pharmacokinetics and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans. If favorable,additional, larger Phase 2 studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affectedpopulation and define appropriate dosing for the compound, as well as identify any adverse effects that couldlimit the compound's usefulness. In some situations, the clinical program incorporates adaptive designmethodology to use accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of the ongoing clinical study as itcontinues, without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. One type of adaptive clinical trial is anadaptive Phase 2a / 2b trial design, a two-stage trial design consisting of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept stage and aPhase 2b dose-optimization finding stage. If data from the Phase 2 trials are satisfactory, we commence large-scale Phase 3 trials to confirm the compound's efficacy and safety. Another type of adaptive clinical trial is anadaptive Phase 2 / 3 trial design, a study that includes an interim analysis and an adaptation that changes the trialfrom having features common in a Phase 2 study (such as multiple dose groups) to a design similar to a Phase 3trial. An adaptive Phase 2 / 3 trial design reduces timelines by eliminating activities which would be required tostart a separate study. Upon completion of Phase 3 trials, if satisfactory, we submit regulatory filings with theappropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing. Therecan be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatoryapprovals necessary for it to be marketed. After a product receives marketing authorization, the FDA may requireus to perform post-marketing studies, or Phase 4 studies, which may involve additional clinical trials, nonclinicaltesting and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products or to provide additional informationregarding treatment or a drug's risks, benefits, or best use. In the United States, upon completion of clinical testing, a complete NDA or BLA is submitted, received and accepted for review by the FDA. Within 60 days after receipt, the FDA determines if the application issufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA also assesses, at that time, whether the application 104will be granted a priority review or standard review. Pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA review period target for NDAs or original BLAs is either six months, for priority review, or 10 months, for astandard review, from the time the application is deemed sufficiently complete. Once the review timelines aredetermined, the FDA will generally act upon the application within those timelines, unless a major amendmenthas been submitted (either at our own initiative or the FDA's request) to the pending application. If this occurs,the FDA may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information, but by no more than threemonths. The FDA can act on an application either by issuing an approval letter or by issuing a CompleteResponse Letter (\"CRL\") stating that the application will not be approved in its present form and describing alldeficiencies that the FDA has identified. Should we wish to pursue an application after receiving a CRL, we areable to resubmit the application with information that addresses the questions or issues identified by the FDA inorder to support approval. Resubmissions are subject to review period targets, which vary depending on theunderlying submission type and the content of the resubmission. The FDA has four program designations\u2014Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval and Priority Review\u2014to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needin the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The Fast Track designation provides pharmaceuticalmanufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA reviewers during the product's developmentand the ability for the manufacturer to do a rolling submission of the NDA/BLA. A rolling submission allowscompleted portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. TheBreakthrough Therapy designation provides manufacturers with all of the features of the Fast Track designationas well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and acommitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced staff in the review. The AcceleratedApproval designation allows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediateendpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product's clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer toconduct required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, theFDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform Phase 4 or post-marketingstudies to verify and describe the predicted clinical benefit, and the drug may be subject to acceleratedwithdrawal procedures. The Priority Review designation means that the FDA's goal is to take action on theNDA/BLA within six months, compared to 10 months under standard review. In addition, the BPCIA provides for an abbreviated pathway for obtaining FDA approval of biologic drugs that satisfy certain criteria. If a manufacturer can show that its proposed biosimilar product is highly similar toand has no clinically meaningful differences from the FDA-approved reference product, it can rely in part on theFDA's previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for obtaining approval. Thiscan potentially lead to a faster and less costly approval process for these products because it generally means thatthe biosimilar manufacturer does not need to conduct as many clinical trials. After the NDA or BLA has been approved, a drug can be marketed in the United States and remains subject to post-marketing drug safety monitoring by the FDA. Any significant changes to an approved drug, such aschanges in formulation, labeling, dosage strength, or certain manufacturing changes require prior approval by theFDA through a supplemental application. Additionally, further development of an approved drug for a new use,dosage strength, or a new or different form must be conducted under a new IND. Our activities are subject to theFDA's requirements governing, among other things, drug establishment registration and listing, labeling andadvertising, and current Good Manufacturing Practices (\"cGMP\") regulations, which set forth minimumrequirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing a drugproduct. Post-approval reports of product quality defects and adverse events are maintained and submitted to theFDA in accordance with its regulations. The FDA conducts routine inspections of drug manufacturing facilitiesto monitor compliance with these requirements. Non-compliance with cGMP or other regulatory requirementscan lead to regulatory action, including issuance of Warning Letters to the Company or issuance of safety alerts,press releases, or other communications containing warnings about the products; suspension or withdrawal of themarketing authorizations; suspension of any ongoing clinical trials; or other enforcement or regulatory actions,including seeking injunction or imposing civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines. 105The FDA regulates the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory approvals, that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims, andthat our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading in any respect. As a manufacturer and distributor of drug products, our activities are regulated under various federal and state statutes, including the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (the \"DQSA\") and Controlled Substances Act (the\"CSA\"). Title II of the DQSA, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, calls for the establishment of a nationwide electronic system that tracks certain prescription drugs at each point in the supply chain in order toprevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated, or mislabeled drugs into the market. Implementation began in2015 and is scheduled to be completed by 2023. The FDA has issued regulations and guidance implementing theDQSA, which require manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers to comply with various regulatory requirementsrelated to product identification, product tracing, product verification, detection and response, notification, andwholesaler licensing. Under the CSA, manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances must maintain registration with the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") and comply with various regulatory requirements, including with respect tomaintaining records and inventory, reporting to the DEA, and meeting certain security and operational safeguards. The Regulatory Approval Process Outside the United States Before our pharmaceutical products can be marketed outside of the United States, they may be subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States. The requirements governing the conduct of clinicaltrials, including requirements to conduct additional clinical trials, product licensing, safety reporting, post-authorization requirements, marketing and promotion, interactions with health care professionals, pricing andreimbursement may vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a countryuntil an appropriate approval application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. Thecurrent approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from thatrequired for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricingreview period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority,satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product, which would make launch of such products commerciallyunfeasible in such countries. The European Union Drug and Biologic Development ProcessSimilar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Tria ls Directive 2001/20/EC (\"Clinical Trials Directive\"), has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control andauthorization of clinical trials in the EU, EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of theClinical Trials Directive in a manner that is not always uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing theconduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States. The EU has, therefore, adopted Regulation (EU) No536/2014 (\"Clinical Trials Regulation\"). The Clinical Trials Regulation, which will replace the Clinical TrialsDirective, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for pharmaceutical products inthe EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutualrecognition procedure for marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products, and increased obligations onsponsors to publish clinical trial results. The coming into effect of the Clinical Trials Regulation has been postponedseveral times due to technical difficulties with the underlying IT systems that are still ongoing. Currently, it is notexpected to come into force before December 2021. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted by two separate entities: the National Competent 106Authority (\"NCA\"), and one or more Ethics Committees. The NCA of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial will be conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial, and the independent Ethics Committeemust grant a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the clinical trial in the relevant EU Member Statebefore the commencement of the trial. Any substantial changes to trial protocol or other information submittedwith the clinical trial applications must be submitted to or approved by the relevant NCA and Ethics Committees.Under the current regime, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occurduring the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and to the Ethics Committees of the EU Member Statewhere they occur. However, under the new Clinical Trials Regulation, which will come into force once the underlying IT systems are working, the approval of clinical trials in the EU will be simplified and streamlined. For example, thesponsor will submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the clinical trials information system.As part of the application process, the sponsor will propose a reporting Member State, which will coordinate thevalidation and evaluation of the application. The reporting Member State shall consult and coordinate with theother concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EUPortal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, aconcerned Member State can in limited circumstances declare an \"opt-out\" from an approval. In such a case, theclinical trial cannot be conducted in that Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamlineand simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatorysubmission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database. National laws, regulations, and the applicable Good Clinical Practice and Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council forHarmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines on Good ClinicalPractice (\"GCP\"). During the development of a pharmaceutical product, the EMA and national regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usuallydone in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use(\"CHMP\") on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party. A fee is incurred with each scientificadvice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example,quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, andpharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any futureMarketing Authorization Application (\"MAA\") of the product concerned. In the EU, pediatric data or an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan (\"PIP\"), or deferral or waiver, must be approved by the EMA, prior to submission of a MAA to the EMA or to the competent authorities of the EUMember States; an application has to include the results of studies as described in an approved PIP, unless thepharmaceutical product is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. In most EU Member States, companies arealso required to have an approved PIP before enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial. Marketing Authorization Procedures In the EU and in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein (together the European Economic Area or \"EEA\"), pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (\"MA\").Marketing Authorizations can be obtained through the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure,the decentralized procedure, or a national procedure (for pharmaceutical products sold in a single EU MemberState only). The primary method we use to obtain a Marketing Authorization of pharmaceutical products in theEU is through the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the European Commission (\"EC\"), that is valid for all 27 EU Member States and, after respective national implementing decisions, in the three additional 107EEA Member States (Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein). The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, including pharmaceutical products derived from biotechnological processes, orphanpharmaceutical products, advanced therapy pharmaceutical products and products with a new active substanceindicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases.It is optional for pharmaceutical products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA beforeMay 20, 2004, that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations, or for which the grant of anMA through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health at the EU level. Under thecentralized procedure, the timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application by the EMA's CHMP is, in principle,210 days from receipt of a valid application for MA. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, when additionalwritten or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so theoverall process typically takes a year or more. Applications may be eligible for accelerated assessment if the CHMPdecides the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation. On request, the CHMP canreduce the time frame to 150 days if the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment.The CHMP will provide a positive opinion regarding the application only if it meets certain quality, safety andefficacy requirements. However, the EC has final authority for granting the MA within 67 days after receipt of theCHMP opinion. In light of the UK's decision to leave the EU, the UK Medicines and Healthcare ProductsRegulatory Agency had proposed that, subject to being approved by the UK Parliament, a centralized MA willautomatically convert into a UK MA. However, that proposal has been withdrawn and further changes may beforthcoming in the scope of the centralized approval procedure as the terms of the future relationship are negotiatedbetween the United Kingdom and the European Union. The decentralized marketing authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for an MA to the competent authorities in several EU Member States simultaneously for a pharmaceutical product that hasnot yet been authorized in any EU Member State. This procedure is available for pharmaceutical products notfalling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The competent authority of a single EU MemberState, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. Thecompetent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required togrant MA for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where the competentauthority of an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health relatedto authorization of the product. In these circumstances the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agenciesfor review. Where a pharmaceutical product has already been authorized for marketing in an EEA Member State, this national authorization can be recognized in another Member State through the mutual recognition procedure. Thenational marketing authorization procedure, which is increasingly rare, permits a company to submit an applicationto the competent authority of a single EU Member State and, if successful, to obtain a MA that is valid only in thisEU Member State. If a pharmaceutical product falls under the optional scope of the centralized procedure, theapplicant has the choice of using either the centralized or the national (decentralized / mutual recognition)procedure. Similar to accelerated approval regulations in the United States, conditional MAs can be granted in the EU by the European Commission in exceptional circumstances. A conditional MA can be granted for pharmaceuticalproducts where, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceuticalproduct have not been supplied, a number of criteria are fulfilled; (i) the benefit / risk balance of the product ispositive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data, (iii) unmetmedical need will be fulfilled by the grant of the marketing authorization and (iv) the benefit to public health of theimmediate availability on the market of the pharmaceutical product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in thefact that additional data are still required. A conditional MA must be renewed annually. All new MAAs must include a Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\"), describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with theproduct. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. RMPs and 108Periodic Safety Update Reports (\"PSURs\") are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. Marketing Authorizations have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for anunlimited period unless the EC or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating topharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Applications for renewal must be made tothe EMA at least nine (9) months before the five-year period expires. Data and Market Exclusivity As in the United States, it may be possible to obtain a period of market and / or data exclusivity in the EU that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor's generic, hybrid orbiosimilar product (even if the pharmaceutical product has already received an MA) and prohibiting anotherapplicant from relying on the MA holder's pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data in support of anotherMA for the purposes of submitting an application, obtaining MA or placing the product on the market. Newchemical entities (\"NCE\") approved in the EU qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years ofmarketing exclusivity. An additional noncumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible ifduring the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), the MAholder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significantclinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product's first MA in the EU. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the MA holder's data.However, a generic product cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first MA in the EUof the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11 years after the first MA in the EU of the innovatorproduct) if the MA holder obtains MA for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight-yeardata exclusivity period. Additionally, another noncumulative one-year period of data exclusivity can be added tothe eight years of data exclusivity where an application is made for a new indication for a well-establishedsubstance, provided that significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the newindication. Another year of data exclusivity may be added to the eight years, where a change of classification of apharmaceutical product has been authorized on the basis of significant pre-trial tests or clinical trials (whenexamining an application by another applicant for or holder of market authorization for a change of classificationof the same substance the competent authority will not refer to the results of those tests or trials for one year afterthe initial chance was authorized). However, even if a compound is considered to be a NCE and the MA applicant is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of thepharmaceutical product if such company can complete a full MAA with their own complete database ofpharmaceutical tests, preclinical studies and clinical trials (without relying on the other initial applicant's data)and obtain MA of its product. Post-Approval Regulation Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and / or the competent regulatoryauthorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing licensesand marketing authorizations. It includes control of compliance with EU good manufacturing practices rules,manufacturing authorizations, pharmacovigilance rules and requirements governing advertising, promotion, sale,and distribution, recordkeeping, importing and exporting of pharmaceutical products. Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU laws and the related national laws of individual EU Member States governing the conduct of 109clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, statutory health insurance, bribery andanti-corruption or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminalpenalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grantmarketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variationof the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinicaltrials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties. The holder of an EU MA for a pharmaceutical product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conductingpharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of pharmaceutical products. Thesepharmacovigilance rules can impose on holders of MAs the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection ofdata regarding the risks and benefits of marketed pharmaceutical products and to engage in ongoing assessmentsof those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies or post-authorization safety studies to obtain further information on a medicine's safety, or to measure the effectivenessof risk-management measures, which may be time consuming and expensive and could impact our profitability.MA holders must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified personfor pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expeditedreporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of PSURs in relation to pharmaceutical productsfor which they hold MAs. The EMA reviews PSURs for pharmaceutical products authorized through thecentralized procedure. If the EMA has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has varied, it can adoptan opinion advising that the existing MA for the product be suspended, withdrawn or varied. The agency canadvise that the MA holder be obliged to conduct post-authorization Phase IV safety studies. The EMA opinion issubmitted to the European Commission for its consideration. If the Commission agrees with the opinion, it canadopt a decision varying the existing MA. Failure by the marketing authorization holder to fulfill the obligationsfor which the European Commission's decision provides can undermine the on-going validity of the MA. More generally, noncompliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the MA for the product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products in the EU is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires amanufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirementsset out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good ManufacturingPractice (\"GMP\"). We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to other good manufacturing practices,which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and qualitystandards as defined by the EMA, the European Commission, the competent authorities of EU Member Statesand other regulatory authorities. Companies may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, if theyfail to comply with these practices. These include suspension of manufacturing authorization in case ofnon-compliance with the EU or EU Member States' requirements governing the manufacturing ofpharmaceutical products. Compliance with EU GMP standards is required when manufacturing pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EUwith the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. Similarly, the distribution ofpharmaceutical products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulationsand guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by thecompetent authorities of the EU Member States. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person whois responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with GMP, beforereleasing the product for commercial distribution in the EU or for use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilitiesare subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with GMP. 110Sales and Marketing Regulations The advertising and promotion of our products is also subject to EU laws concerning promotion of pharmaceutical products, interactions with health care providers, misleading and comparative advertising andunfair commercial practices. In addition, other national legislation of individual EU Member States may apply tothe advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and may differ from one country to another. Theselaws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to pharmaceutical products comply with theproduct's Summary of Product Characteristics (\"SmPC\") as approved by the competent regulatory authorities.The SmPC is the document that provides information to health care providers concerning the safe and effectiveuse of the pharmaceutical product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization grantedfor the pharmaceutical product. Promotion of a pharmaceutical product that does not comply with the SmPC isconsidered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products is prohibited inthe European Union. The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibitthe direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only pharmaceutical products. Violations of the rulesgoverning the promotion of pharmaceutical products in the European Union could be penalized by administrativemeasures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of ourproducts to the general public and may also impose limitations on its promotional activities with health careprofessionals. Anti-Corruption Legislation In the EU, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and health care providers are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and health care providers' codes of professionalconduct both at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages tohealth care providers to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply,order or use of pharmaceutical products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits oradvantages to health care providers is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States.Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Payments made to health care providers in certain EU Member States also must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with health care providers must often be the subject of prior notification and approval bythe physician's employer, his / her regulatory professional organization, and / or the competent authorities of theindividual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, orprofessional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual EU Member States. Failure to comply with theserequirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment. Other Markets Outside of the United States, the EU, the EEA and other European Jurisdictions, we submit marketing applications to national regulatory authorities. Examples of such are the NMPA in China, the Ministry of Health,Labour and Welfare in Japan, Health Canada, Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Vigil\u00e2ncia Sanit\u00e1ria in Brazil, Korea Foodand Drug Administration in South Korea and Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia. Each country has aseparate and independent review process and timeline. In many markets, approval times can be longer as theregulatory authority requires approval in a major market, such as the United States or the EU and issuance of aCertificate of Pharmaceutical Product from that market before initiating their local review process. Environmental Matters We believe that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on our business. Expenditures for remediation andenvironmental liabilities were $1 million in 2020 and are estimated to be $18 million in the aggregate for theyears 2021 through 2025. In management's opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probableand reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $24 million and $21 million at December 31, 2020 and 1112019, respectively. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, we do not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurredin excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed $20 million in the aggregate. We also do not believe that theseexpenditures should have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidityfor any year. We believe that climate change could present risks to our business. Some of the potential effects of climate change to our business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risksto our facilities, water limitations and disruptions to our supply chain. These potential risks are integrated intoour business planning, including investment in reducing energy, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. We donot believe these risks are material to our business at this time. Third-Party Agreements Samsung Bioepis Development and Commercialization AgreementWe are party to a development and commercialization agreement with Samsung Bioepis. The agreement was entered into by Merck and Samsung Bioepis as of February 18, 2013 (as subsequently amended byAmendments No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, the \"Samsung Bioepis Agreement\"). All of therights and obligations of Merck under the Samsung Bioepis Agreement were transferred to us in connection withthe separation. The Samsung Bioepis Agreement grants us an exclusive license to commercialize the followingpre-specified biosimilars products (with reference products in description of each product and the geographicareas in which we have an exclusive license for regulatory and commercialization activities. Under the Samsung Bioepis Agreement, Samsung Bioepis is responsible for pre-clinical and clinical development, process development and manufacturing, clinical trials and registration of product candidates. Ouraccess rights to each product under the Samsung Bioepis Agreement last for 10 years from each such product'slaunch date on a market-by-market basis. Unless the parties agree to extend the term, the agreement expires uponthe expiration of the last such 10 year period. We may terminate the agreement with respect to a particular regionor product if a product fails to meet certain milestones in such region. We may terminate the agreement upon 60days' written notice to Samsung Bioepis for a particular presentation of a product in a region if SamsungBioepis's revenue share for such product presentation in such region exceeds a certain contractual threshold. Wemay also terminate the agreement upon 60 days' written notice in the event of a third party infringement claimthat Samsung Bioepis decides to litigate despite our opposition to such litigation. The agreement may be terminated by either party on 30 days' written notice for a particular product or region if the parties fail to agree upon a strategy regarding third party patents within six months following writtennotice by either party of the existence of such patents. The agreement may also be terminated by either partyupon written notice if the other party commits a material breach of its obligations by specified actions within itsreasonable control and has not cured such breach within ninety calendar days after notice requesting cure of thebreach. The Samsung Bioepis Agreement provides that gross profits are shared equally in all markets with the exception of Brazil where gross profits are shared 65% to Samsung Bioepis and 35% to us. The Samsung BioepisAgreement also provides for payment of certain milestone license fees associated with pre-specified clinical andregulatory milestones to Samsung Bioepis, payment of the supply price for each product to Samsung Bioepis,and an upfront payment to Samsung Bioepis that was completed by Merck at the commencement of theagreement. As of December 31, 2020, there were $25 million in potential future regulatory milestone paymentsremaining under the agreement. For further information related to the Samsung Bioepis collaboration, see Note 4to our audited annual combined financial statements. 112Employees We expect that upon the separation, we will have approximately 9,950 employees worldwide. Approximately 1,530 employees are employed in the United States, including Puerto Rico. Approximately 35%of our worldwide employees are represented by various collective bargaining groups. Legal Proceedings We are from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims and litigation may include, among other things, allegations of violation of United States and foreigncompetition law, labor laws, consumer protection laws and environmental laws and related regulations, as well asclaims or litigation relating to product liability, intellectual property, securities law, breach of contract and tort.We operate in multiple jurisdictions and, as a result, claims in one jurisdiction may lead to claims or regulatorypenalties in other jurisdictions. We intend to defend vigorously against any pending or future claims andlitigation. For a description of certain legal proceedings, see Note 10 to our audited annual combined financialstatements. While our liability in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated with any certainty, and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant effect on thecompany's results of operations and cash flow for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is notexpected to have a material adverse effect on our combined financial position. Although we believe we havevalid defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur, and we may in thefuture incur material judgments against us or enter into settlements of claims resulting in material financialpayments or otherwise having a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Subject to certain specified matters, we and Merck generally will assume liability for all pending, threatened and unasserted legal matters related to our respective businesses or assumed or retained liabilities and willindemnify the other party for any liability to the extent arising out of or resulting from such assumed or retainedlegal matters. 113Management Executive Officers and Directors Following the Distribution The following table sets forth information as of April 1, 2021, regarding individuals who are expected to serve as our executive officers and/or directors following the distribution.

Mr. Walsh is also eligible for an annual long-term incentive award with aninitial target annual opportunity of $3,000,000. In August 2020, Mr. Walsh received a grant valued atapproximately $2,600,000 in the form of Merck time-based RSUs that vest in equal annual installments overthree years from the grant date (the \"2020 Annual Grant\"). The 2020 Annual Grant will convert into an Organonequity award as described in the section titled \" Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u2014 Agreements with Merck\u2014Equity Compensation Awards .\" In addition, Mr. Walsh received a $200,000 cash sign- on bonus, which is subject to repayment upon Mr. Walsh's voluntary resignation or termination of employmentby Merck or Organon for Cause (as defined in the offer letter) prior to March 24, 2022 (the \"RepaymentProvision\"). The offer letter provides that if Mr. Walsh's employment is (i) terminated by Merck other than for Cause (as defined in the offer letter) prior to the legal separation of Organon from Merck or (ii) the legal separation ofOrganon from Merck is not consummated prior to January 1, 2022 and Mr. Walsh terminates his employment onor prior to January 31, 2022, Mr. Walsh will be entitled to (1) severance benefits equal to the sum of his currentannual base salary and his target annual incentive bonus for the current performance year, (2) the RepaymentProvision will be waived and (3) to the extent such termination of employment occurs prior to the one yearanniversary of the 2020 Annual Grant, an additional amount equal to the sum of the value of the 2020 AnnualGrant multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months Mr. Walsh was employed sincethe grant date and a denominator of which is 36. Other Executive Officer Arrangements The compensation arrangements for our other anticipated executive officers generally provide for the following primary elements of compensation: (i) annual base salary, (ii) an annual cash incentive opportunity,(iii) eligibility for annual long-term incentive awards, and (iv) severance entitlements. Each offer letter providesfor general participation in retirement and benefits plans commensurate with those provided to other executivesof the Organon business. Executive Severance Programs In connection with the Separation, Organon intends to adopt an Executive Severance Program (the \"Severance Plan\"). The Severance Plan would provide payments and benefits to certain eligible members of Organon's 125management team, including each of the executive officers in the event of a termination of employment without cause (as defined in the Severance Plan). Payments and benefits under the Severance Plan would be conditionedupon execution of a release of claims, which may contain restrictive covenants, and would include (i) a lump sumcash payment in an amount equal to 1.0 times (or 2.0 times in the case of the Chief Executive Officer) the sum ofthe executive officer's annual base salary and target annual cash incentive opportunity; (ii) if such terminationoccurs between June 30 and December 31 of a year, a pro-rata annual cash incentive payment based on theexecutive officer's target incentive opportunity for the year of termination, and (iii) subsidized medical anddental coverage for up to 24 months. The Severance Plan would not provide for any payments or benefits upon atermination for cause or any resignation of an eligible employee's employment. Furthermore, severancepayments and benefits will be subject to forfeiture in the event and employee breaches any obligations of his orher terms and conditions of employment or makes any false or misleading statements about Organon or any of itsaffiliates or their products, officers or employees to competitors, customers, potential customers or to currentemployees or former employees. In addition to the Severance Plan, Organon also intends to adopt an Executive Change in Control Severance Program (the \"CIC Severance Plan\"). The CIC Severance Plan will provide \"double trigger\" severance paymentsand benefits to eligible employees, including the executive officers, in the event of a termination of employmentwithout cause or a resignation for good reason (each as defined in the CIC Severance Plan) during the six-monthperiod prior to or the two-year period following a change in control (as defined in CIC Severance Plan).Payments and benefits under the CIC Severance Plan would be conditioned upon execution of a release of claimsand would include (i) a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to 2.0 times the sum of the executiveofficer's annual base salary and target annual cash incentive opportunity; (ii) a pro-rata annual cash incentivepayment based on the executive officer's target incentive opportunity for the year of termination, and (iii) a lumpsum cash payment intended to offset the costs of continued medical and dental coverage for up to 24 months. The Severance Plan and the CIC Severance Plan will also provide minimum guaranteed cash benefits should a participant be entitled to greater cash separation pay benefits under Merck's existing severance plans. Other Employee Benefits In connection with the Separation, Organon will adopt core employee benefits plans, generally consisting of retirement, separation pay, paid time off, medical (excluding retiree medical), dental, vision, life, short-term andlong-term disability plans or coverage, as of or prior to the distribution date and Organon employees generallywill be eligible to participate in such benefit plans as of the distribution date. In general, Organon core benefitplans will contain terms substantially comparable in the aggregate to those of the corresponding Merck plans,although Organon is not currently expected to implement any U.S.-defined benefit pension, deferredcompensation, or retiree welfare benefit plans. 2021 Incentive Stock Plan Prior to the Separation, we expect our Board of Directors to adopt, and Merck, as our sole shareholder to approve, the Organon & Co. 2021 Incentive Stock Plan (the \"Equity Plan\") for the benefit of certain of ourcurrent and future employees. The following summary describes the material terms of the Equity Plan. The formof the Equity Plan is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement on Form 10 of which this informationstatement forms a part, and the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to such text. Purpose. The purpose of the Equity Plan will be to encourage employees of Organon, its subsidiaries, its affiliates and its joint ventures to acquire common stock in Organon, and to allow such individuals to have agreater personal financial interest in Organon through the ownership of, or the right to acquire, our commonstock and to earn cash incentives based on the achievement of performance goals, which in turn will stimulatesuch individuals' efforts on the company's behalf and maintain and strengthen their desire to remain with thecompany. The Equity Plan is also expected to assist in the recruitment and retention of service providers. Shares Available for Awards. It is expected that the maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the Equity Plan will not exceed 35,000,000. In addition, it is expected that the 126Equity Plan will contain a limit on the number of shares of common stock available for grant in the form of incentive stock options of 35,000,000. Under the Equity Plan, it is expected that Organon will have the flexibility to grant different types of equity compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance awards,share awards, phantom stock awards (including restricted stock units), and cash-based awards. The grant, vesting,exercise and settlement of awards granted under the Equity Plan may be subject to the satisfaction of time- orperformance-based conditions, as determined at or after the date of grant of an award under the Equity Plan. In the event of any change in corporate structure that affects our outstanding common stock (e.g., a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split or reverse stock split, stock dividend, extraordinarycash dividend, combination or exchange of shares, repurchase of shares, merger, consolidation, rights offering,spin off, split off, split up, change in corporate structure, or other similar event), our Talent Committee will makeequitable adjustments including adjustments to the share limits described above, the number and type of sharessubject to outstanding awards, and the purchase or exercise price of outstanding awards. Shares that are subject to awards that are settled in cash, terminate, expire, or are canceled or forfeited, or are tendered or withheld to satisfy the payment of any exercise price or tax withholding obligations would beavailable again for grant under the Equity Plan and would not be counted for purposes of the limits above. Eligibility. Employees of Organon or its subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures would be eligible to receive awards under the Equity Plan. Administration. Our Talent Committee or any designated subcommittee thereof would have the authority to administer the Equity Plan, including the authority to select the persons who receive awards, determine thenumber of shares subject to the awards and establish the terms and conditions of the awards, consistent with theterms of the Equity Plan. Our Talent Committee may specify the circumstances under which the exercisability orvesting of awards may be accelerated or whether awards or amounts payable under awards may be deferred. OurTalent Committee may waive or amend the terms of an award, consistent with the terms of the Equity Plan, butunless approved by our stockholders, may not adjust or reduce the exercise price of any outstanding stockappreciation rights or stock options in the event of a decline in our stock price, either by reducing the exerciseprice of outstanding awards or through cancellation of outstanding awards in connection with regranting ofawards at a lower price to the same individual, nor may stock appreciation rights or stock options be cancelled inexchange for a cash payment to account for a decline in stock price. Our Talent Committee will have theauthority to construe and interpret the Equity Plan and establish rules for the administration of the Equity Planand any agreement or instrument relating to the Equity Plan. Our Talent Committee may delegate its powers andduties under the Equity Plan to one or more officers of the Company or one of its subsidiaries, except that onlyour Talent Committee would have authority to grant and administer awards to executive officers. Duration; Amendment; Termination. Unless earlier discontinued by action of our Board of Directors, the Equity Plan will terminate on the tenth anniversary of the date of its approval by our Board, and no furtherawards may be granted under the Equity Plan after the end of the term; however, awards previously grantedthereunder may extend beyond such date. Our Board of Directors may discontinue the Equity Plan at any timeand may from time to time amend or revise the terms of the Equity Plan as permitted by applicable statutes,except that it may not, without the consent of the participants affected, revoke or alter outstanding awards in amanner that is materially unfavorable to the award holders, nor may the board of directors amend the Equity Planwithout stockholder approval where the absence of such approval would cause the Equity Plan to fail to complywith applicable law or listing standards to which we are subject. Transfer Restrictions. The rights of a participant to any award granted under the Equity Plan will be exercisable during the participant's lifetime only by the participant and generally will not be transferable otherthan by will or the laws of descent and distribution. The Talent Committee may, however, permit othertransferability, subject to any conditions and limitations that it imposes. 127Clawback; Recoupment. Awards under the Equity Plan will be subject to the terms of any clawback policy maintained by Organon or as required by law and any reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, clawback or recoupmentprovisions specified by the Talent Committee in an applicable grant agreement. Tax Consequences of Awards. The following is a brief summary of the principal United States federal income tax consequences of awards and transactions under the Equity Plan for the employees selected toparticipate in the Equity Plan (the \"Participants\") and Organon. This summary is not intended to be exhaustiveand, among other things, does not describe local, state or foreign tax consequences. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. A Participant will not recognize any income at the time a stock option or stock appreciation right is granted, nor will Organon be entitled to a deduction at that time. When anon-qualified stock option is exercised, the Participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to theexcess of the fair market value of the shares received as of the date of exercise over the exercise price of theoption. When a stock appreciation right is exercised, the Participant will recognize ordinary income in an amountequal to the cash received or, if the stock appreciation right is settled in shares, the shares received as of the dateof exercise. Organon generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction in the same time period andamount as the Participant recognizes income. When an incentive stock option is exercised, the Participant willnot recognize any income and Organon will not be entitled to any tax deduction; provided, however, that theamount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares received as of the date of exercise over theexercise price will be subject to taxation under the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code. When anincentive stock option is sold, the Participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess ofthe sales price over the price of the option on the date of grant and Organon will entitled to a corresponding taxdeduction. Restricted Stock and RSUs. A Participant will not recognize any income at the time of grant of a restricted stock unit or share of restricted stock (whether subject to time-based vesting or performance-based vesting), andOrganon will not be entitled to a deduction at that time. The Participant will recognize ordinary income in anamount equal to the fair market value of the shares received or, if the restricted stock unit is paid in cash, theamount payable, upon settlement of a restricted stock unit. In the year in which shares of restricted stock are nolonger subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (i.e., in the year that the shares vest), the Participant willrecognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date ofvesting over the amount, if any, the Participant paid for the shares. Under certain circumstances and if permittedby an individual award, a Participant may elect (within 30 days after being granted restricted stock) under CodeSection 83(b) to recognize ordinary income in the year of receipt instead of the year of vesting of such restrictedstock. If such an election is made, the amount of income recognized by the Participant will be equal to the excessof the fair market value of the shares on the date of receipt over the amount, if any, the Participant paid for theshares. Organon generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction in the same time period and amountas the Participant recognizes income. Other Types of Awards. If other awards are granted under the Equity Plan, the tax consequences may differ from those described above for stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and RSUs. As a generalmatter, Organon typically would be entitled to a tax deduction in respect of any such compensatory awards in thesame time period and amount as the Participant recognizes income in respect of such awards, provided, however,that any compensation in excess of $1,000,000 earned by Organon's listed officers who are subject to Section162(m) of the Code will not be deductible. Withholding of Taxes. Organon has the right to deduct from any payment under the Plan, regardless of the form of such payment, the amount of all applicable income, excise and employment taxes required or permittedby law to be withheld with respect to such payment or may require Participants to pay to the company such taxprior to and as a condition of the making of such payment. 128Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions Agreements with Merck The Separation and Distribution AgreementThe separation and distribution agreement will set forth the agreements between Merck and Organon regarding the principal transactions required to effect the separation of the Organon business from Merck andcontain other agreements governing Organon's relationship with Merck.

Specifically, during such period, Organon and its subsidiarieswill be prohibited, except in specific circumstances, from, among other things, (1) ceasing to actively conductcertain businesses or causing our applicable affiliates to cease to actively conduct certain of their businesses;(2) entering into certain transactions or series of transactions pursuant to which all or a portion of the shares ofOrganon common stock would be acquired or all or a portion of certain assets of Organon and its subsidiaries wouldbe acquired; (3) liquidating, partially liquidating, merging or consolidating with any other person; (4) issuing equitysecurities beyond certain thresholds; (5) repurchasing Organon stock other than in certain open-market transactions;(6) making certain amendments to Organon's certificate of incorporation and other organizational documents; and(7) taking or failing to take any other action that would cause the distribution or certain related transactions to fail toqualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code or for otherapplicable non-U.S. income tax purposes. The tax matters agreement will provide special rules that allocate tax-related losses in the event that the separation, distribution or other related transactions that are intended to qualify as tax-free fail to so qualify.Under the tax matters agreement, each of Merck and Organon generally will be responsible for any tax-relatedlosses imposed on Merck or Organon as a result of the failure of a transaction to qualify for tax-free treatment, tothe extent that the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to Merck's orOrganon's respective stock, assets or business, or a breach of the relevant covenants made by Merck or Organonin the tax matters agreement. If such tax-related losses are not specifically allocable to Merck or Organon, eachparty will be responsible for a specified portion of such tax-related loss. Employee Matters Agreement Merck will also enter into an employee matters agreement with Organon. The employee matters agreement will allocate assets, liabilities and responsibilities relating to employee compensation and benefit plans andprograms and other related matters in connection with the separation both in and outside of the United States. The employee matters agreement will provide that, unless otherwise specified, Organon will be responsible for liabilities associated with employees who transfer to Organon, former employees whose last employment waswith a manufacturing plant or entity located outside of the United States that wholly transfers to Organon, andindividual independent contractors associated with Organon. Merck will be responsible for liabilities associatedwith employees retained by Merck, all other former employees, and all individual independent contractorsassociated with the Merck group or business. 134Organon will adopt core employee benefits plans, generally consisting of retirement, separation pay, paid time off, medical (excluding retiree medical), dental, vision, life, short-term and long-term disability plans orcoverage, as of or prior to the distribution date and Organon employees generally will be eligible to participate insuch benefit plans as of the distribution date. In general, Organon core benefit plans will contain termssubstantially comparable in the aggregate to those of the corresponding Merck plans; provided that Organon willnot be required to implement any U.S.-defined benefit pension, deferred compensation, or retiree welfare benefitplans. Merck will retain liability for U.S.-defined benefit pension, supplemental executive retirement, deferred compensation and retiree medical benefits for employees continuing with Merck, employees transferring toOrganon and for former employees. The liability to employees transferred to Organon generally will be as toaccrued benefits, but Merck will also provide service crediting to Organon employees transferred in connectionwith the Separation under these retained U.S.-defined benefit pension, supplemental executive retirement, andretiree medical plans for purposes of early retirement eligibility and subsidies, as well as for certain servicecrediting bridges for transferred Organon employees who would have otherwise met the eligibility requirementsfor such service crediting bridges on or prior to December 31, 2022. Although Merck will be responsible forproviding these benefits, Organon will assume that portion of the aggregate incremental cost of providing earlyretirement subsidies, service crediting bridges, and retiree healthcare benefits under these programs that isattributable to future service, with such aggregate incremental cost as determined based on reasonable estimatesin the discretion of the actuaries designated by Merck to calculate such amounts. In general, Organon will provide, through December 31, 2022, each employee transferring to Organon in connection with the Separation with at least (i) the same rate of base salary, (ii) the same cash incentive and long-term incentive compensation opportunities, (iii) other core employee benefits that are substantially comparable inthe aggregate to those provided prior to the earlier of the distribution date or the date as of which the comparableOrganon core employee benefit plan is established or adopted, and (iv) the same separation pay and comparablepost-termination medical, dental & life benefits continuation (excluding retiree medical and life insurance). Equity Compensation Awards The employee matters agreement will provide for the adjustment or conversion of all outstanding Merck equity awards as follows: Options and RSU Awards. As of the distribution date, all Merck stock options and time-based restricted stock unit (RSU) awards (whether then-vested or unvested) will be converted into (1) adjusted Merckawards for Merck employees, employees transferring to Organon at any time following the distributiondate (each, a \"Post-Distribution Organon Employee\") and any former employees or (2) Organonawards for Organon employees (other than Post-Distribution Organon Employees). Such adjustedawards will preserve the same intrinsic value and general terms and conditions (including vesting) aswere in place immediately prior to the adjustments. Performance Share Units For any Merck performance share unit (PSU) awards held by Merck employees, Post-Distribution Organon Employees and any former employees, the performance goals will be equitably adjustedto reflect the spin-off and the number of units subject to such awards will be determined on thesame basis described above with respect to RSU awards. Such Merck PSU awards will otherwisesettle in the ordinary course. For any 2019 PSU awards with a 2019-2021 performance period held by Organon Employees (other than Post-Distribution Organon Employees), performance will be assessed based on atruncated performance period that ends on December 31, 2020 and attained performance throughsuch date will be applied to 100% of the award. As of the distribution date, such earned award will 135then be converted into a time-based Organon RSU award (on the same basis described above with respect to converted Organon RSU Awards) that otherwise vests in accordance with thepreviously applicable time-based vesting schedule. For any 2020 and 2021 PSU awards with a 2020-2022 or 2021-2023 performance period held by Organon employees (other than Post-Distribution Organon Employees), performance will bedeemed to have been met at the target level. As of the distribution date, such award will then beconverted into a time-based Organon RSU award (on the same basis described above with respectto converted Organon RSU Awards) that otherwise vests in accordance with the previouslyapplicable time-based vesting schedule. Adjusted Merck Phantom Shares & Deferred Stock Units. Each Merck phantom share outstanding under the Merck Deferred Compensation Plan and each Merck deferred stock unit granted under theMerck Directors Plan as of immediately prior to the distribution date will be converted at the time ofthe distribution on the distribution date into an adjusted Merck phantom share or deferred stock unit, asapplicable, with the number of units represented by such award adjusted to preserve the aggregatevalue of the original Merck phantom shares as measured immediately before and immediately after thedistribution. Annual Bonus Organon will assume all obligations for post-distribution incentive compensation payments to transferring Organon employees, including for all 2021 annual bonuses. Other Related Person Transactions In January 2020, Merck entered into a consulting agreement with Carrie Cox, who will serve as Chairman of our Board of Directors upon the completion of the distribution. Under the consulting agreement, Ms. Cox isentitled to a monthly fee of $9,500 in exchange for her performance of certain consulting services to Merckrelating to her anticipated Chairmanship at Organon and reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Inaddition, as a former employee of Merck, Ms. Cox received a non-qualified deferred compensation plandistributions from Merck (that is not conditioned on future services) of $1,560,423 in 2019. No distributionswere made in 2020 or are expected to be made in 2021. In addition, Ms. Cox currently holds retirement benefitsin Merck's tax qualified 401(k) and pension plans, which are expected to be distributed commencing when shereaches age 65. Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions Effective upon the completion of this distribution, our Board of Directors will adopt a written policy regarding the review, approval, ratification or disapproval by the Audit Committee of transactions between us orany of our subsidiaries and any related person (to be defined in the policy to include our executive officers,directors or director nominees, any shareholder beneficially owning in excess of 5% of our stock or securitiesexchangeable for our stock and any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons) in which theamount involved since the beginning of our last completed fiscal year will or may be expected to exceed$120,000 and in which one or more of such related persons has a direct or indirect material interest. In approvingor rejecting any such transaction, we expect that the Audit Committee will consider the relevant facts andcircumstances available and deemed relevant to the committee. Any member of the Audit Committee who is arelated person with respect to a transaction under review will not be permitted to participate in the deliberationsor vote on approval, ratification or disapproval of the transaction. 136Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management Before the distribution, all of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be owned beneficially and of record by Merck. The following table sets forth information with respect to the expected beneficial ownership of ourcommon stock upon the distribution by each expected director and named executive officer and all of Organon'sexpected directors and named executive officers as a group. Organon based the share amounts on each person'sbeneficial ownership of Merck's common stock and stock options or other equity awards as of April 28, 2021 unlessMerck indicates some other basis for the share amounts, and assume a distribution ratio of a one-tenth share ofOrganon's common stock for every share of Merck's common stock.

Merck announced that itintended to effect the separation through a pro rata distribution of all of the common stock of a new entity, whichhas since been named Organon and was formed to hold the assets and liabilities associated of the women'shealth, biosimilars and established brands businesses. On May 7, 2021, the Merck Board of Directors approved the distribution of all of Organon's issued and outstanding shares of common stock to holders of shares of Merck common stock as of the close of business onMay 17, 2021, the record date. On June 2, 2021, the distribution date, each Merck shareholder will receive one-tenth of a share of Organon's common stock for each share of Merck common stock held at the close of business on the record date.Merck shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Organon common stock which theywould have received after application of this ratio. Shareholders will not be required to make any payment, orsurrender or exchange their shares of Merck common stock or take any other action to receive their shares ofOrganon's common stock in the distribution. The distribution of Organon's common stock as described in thisinformation statement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. For a more detaileddescription of these conditions, see the section entitled \"\u2014Conditions to the Distribution.\" Reasons for the Separation The Merck Board of Directors believes that separating the women's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses from the remainder of Merck is in the best interests of Merck and its shareholders for a numberof reasons, including that it will: give each of Organon and Merck its own dedicated management team, focused on its unique business opportunities and capital needs, thereby allowing each business to pursue more effectively its owndistinct operating priorities and strategies; give each of Organon and Merck its own source of capital dedicated to its own investment priorities, and allow each of Organon and Merck to implement a capital structure appropriate for its respectivecash flow and growth profile; give each of Organon and Merck its own equity currency for use in connection with acquisitions; and enhance the ability of Organon and Merck to attract and retain qualified management and to better align incentive-based compensation with the performance of each of Organon and Merck's separatebusinesses. The Merck Board of Directors considered a number of potentially negative factors in evaluating the separation, including risks relating to the creation of a new public company and possible increased overall costs,as well as one-time separation costs, but concluded that the potential benefits of the separation outweighed thesefactors. For more information, see the sections entitled \"The Separation and Distribution\u2014Reasons for theSeparation\" and \"Risk Factors\" included elsewhere in this information statement. When and How You Will Receive the Distribution With the assistance of Equiniti Trust Company, Merck expects to distribute Organon common stock on June 2, 2021, the distribution date, to all holders of outstanding shares of Merck common stock as of the close ofbusiness on May 17, 2021, the record date. Equiniti Trust Company, which currently serves as the transfer agentand registrar for Merck's common stock, will serve as the settlement and distribution agent in connection withthe distribution and the transfer agent and registrar for Organon common stock. 139For shareholders who own shares of Merck common stock as of the close of business on the record date, the shares of Organon's common stock that such shareholder is entitled to receive in the distribution will be issuedelectronically, as of the distribution date, to such shareholder in direct registration form or to such shareholder'sbank or brokerage firm on the shareholder's behalf. For shareholders who are registered holders, Equiniti Trust Company will then mail such shareholders a direct registration account statement that reflects such shares of Organon common stock. Direct registration formrefers to a method of recording share ownership when no physical share certificates are issued to shareholders, asis the case in this distribution. Commencing on or shortly after the distribution date, for shareholders holdingphysical share certificates that represent their shares of Merck common stock and are the registered holder of theshares represented by those certificates, the distribution agent will mail to such shareholders an account statementthat indicates the number of shares of Organon's common stock that have been registered in book-entry form intheir names. Shareholders who elect to sell shares of Merck common stock in the \"regular-way\" market on orprior to the time of the distribution will be selling their right to receive shares of Organon common stock in thedistribution. Most Merck shareholders hold their common stock through a bank or brokerage firm. In such cases, the bank or brokerage firm would be said to hold the shares in \"street name\" and ownership would be recorded onthe bank or brokerage firm's books. For shareholders holding their shares of Merck common stock through abank or brokerage firm, such bank or brokerage firm will credit such shareholder's account for the Organoncommon stock that such shareholder is entitled to receive in the distribution. If you have any questionsconcerning the mechanics of having shares held in \"street name,\" please contact your bank or brokerage firm. Transferability of Organon Shares Received in the Distribution Shares of Organon common stock distributed to shareholders in connection with the distribution will be transferable without registration under the Securities Act, except for shares received by persons who may bedeemed to be Organon affiliates. Persons who may be deemed to be Organon affiliates after the distributiongenerally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control withOrganon, which may include certain Organon executive officers, directors or principal shareholders. Securitiesheld by Organon affiliates will be subject to resale restrictions under the Securities Act. Organon affiliates will bepermitted to sell shares of Organon common stock only pursuant to an effective registration statement or anexemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, such as the exemption afforded by Rule 144under the Securities Act. The Number of Shares of Organon Common Stock You Will Receive For each share of Merck common stock that you own at the close of business on May 17, 2021, the record date, you will receive one-tenth of a share of Organon common stock on the distribution date. Merck will not distribute any fractional shares of Organon common stock to its shareholders. Instead, for holders of registered shares, Equiniti Trust Company will aggregate fractional shares into whole shares, sell thewhole shares in the open market at prevailing market prices and distribute the aggregate cash proceeds (net ofdiscounts and commissions) of the sales pro rata (based on the fractional share such holder would otherwise beentitled to receive) to each holder who otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fractional share in thedistribution. The transfer agent, in its sole discretion, without any influence by Merck or Organon, will determinewhen, how, through which broker-dealer and at what price to sell the whole shares. Any broker-dealer used bythe transfer agent will not be an affiliate of either Merck or Organon. Neither Organon nor Merck will be able toguarantee any minimum sale price in connection with the sale of these shares. Recipients of cash in lieu offractional shares will not be entitled to any interest on the amounts of payment made in lieu of fractional shares. The aggregate net cash proceeds of these sales will be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See \"Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\" for an explanation of the material U.S. federal income tax 140consequences of the distribution. For a holder of physical certificates for shares of Merck common stock who is also the registered holder, such holder will receive a check from the distribution agent in an amount equal to yourpro rata share of the aggregate net cash proceeds of the sales. Organon estimates that it will take approximatelytwo weeks from the distribution date for the distribution agent to complete the distributions of the aggregate netcash proceeds. For a holder of shares of Merck common stock through a bank or brokerage firm, such holder'sbank or brokerage firm will receive, on behalf of such holder, such holder's pro rata share of the aggregate netcash proceeds of the sales and will electronically credit such holder's account for such holder's share of suchproceeds. Results of the Distribution After the distribution, Organon will be an independent, publicly traded company. The actual number of shares to be distributed will be determined at the close of business on May 17, 2021, the record date for thedistribution, and will reflect any exercise of Merck options between the date the Merck Board of Directorsdeclares the distribution and the record date for the distribution. The distribution will not affect the number ofoutstanding shares of Merck common stock or any rights of Merck's shareholders. Merck will not distribute anyfractional shares of Organon common stock. Organon will enter into the separation and distribution agreement with Merck and will enter into other agreements with Merck before the distribution to effect the separation and provide a framework for Organon'srelationship with Merck after the distribution. These agreements will provide for the allocation between Merckand Organon of Merck's assets, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property, employee benefitsand tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to Organon's separation from Merck and willgovern the relationship between Merck and Organon after the distribution. For a more detailed description ofthese agreements, see \"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.\" Market for Organon Common Stock There is currently no public trading market for Organon's common stock. Organon intends to apply to list its common stock on the NYSE under the symbol \"OGN.\" Organon has not and will not set the initial price of itscommon stock. The initial price will be established by the public markets. Organon cannot predict the price at which its common stock will trade after the distribution. In fact, the combined trading prices, after the distribution, of the shares of Organon common stock that each Merckshareholder will receive in the distribution and the shares of Merck common stock held at the record date maynot equal the \"regular-way\" trading price of a Merck share immediately prior to the distribution. The price atwhich Organon common stock trades may fluctuate significantly, particularly until an orderly public marketdevelops. Trading prices for Organon common stock will be determined in the public markets and may beinfluenced by many factors. See \"Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Organon's Common Stock.\" Trading Between the Record Date and Distribution Date Beginning on or shortly before the record date and continuing until the time of the distribution, Merck expects that there will be two markets in shares of Merck common stock: a \"regular-way\" market and an\"ex-dividend\" market. Shares of Merck common stock that trade on the \"regular-way\" market will trade with anentitlement to Organon common stock distributed pursuant to the distribution. Shares of Merck common stockthat trade on the \"ex-dividend\" market will trade without an entitlement to Organon common stock distributedpursuant to the distribution. Therefore, if a shareholder sells shares of Merck common stock in the \"regular-way\"market on or prior to the time of the distribution, such shareholder will be selling the right to receive Organoncommon stock in the distribution. If a shareholder own shares of Merck common stock at the close of business onthe record date and sells those shares on the \"ex-dividend\" market on or prior to the time of the distribution, suchshareholder will receive the shares of Organon common stock that such shareholder is entitled to receivepursuant to such shareholder's ownership as of the record date of the shares of Merck common stock. 141Furthermore, beginning on or shortly before the record date and continuing until the time of the distribution, Organon expects that there will be a \"when-issued\" market in its common stock. \"When-issued\" trading refers toa sale or purchase made conditionally because the security has been authorized but not yet issued. The \"when-issued\" trading market will be a market for Organon common stock that will be distributed to holders of Merckcommon stock on the distribution date. Shareholders who owned Merck common stock at the close of businesson the record date are entitled to Organon common stock distributed pursuant to the distribution. Such ashareholder may trade this entitlement to shares of Organon common stock, without the shares of Merckcommon stock such shareholder owns, on the \"when-issued\" market. Upon completion of the distribution,\"when-issued\" trading with respect to Organon common stock will end, and \"regular-way\" trading will begin. Conditions to the Distribution The distribution is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others: the receipt of opinions from Merck's Tax Advisors to the effect that the distribution and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to Merck and its shareholders under Sections 355 and 368 of theCode; the making of a distribution of approximately $9.0 billion from Organon to Merck, and the determination by Merck in its sole discretion that following the separation Merck will have no furtherliability or obligation whatsoever with respect to any of the financing arrangements that Organon willbe entering into in connection with the separation; the receipt of an opinion from an independent appraisal firm to the Merck Board of Directors confirming the solvency of Merck giving effect to the distribution of Organon and confirming thesolvency of Organon giving effect to the cash dividend that is in form and substance acceptable toMerck in its sole discretion; the SEC declaring effective Organon's registration statement on Form 10 of which this information statement forms a part, and the making available of the information statement to all holders of shares ofMerck common stock as of the close of business on May 17, 2021, the record date; no order, injunction, or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the separation, distribution or any of the relatedtransactions shall be in effect; the shares of Organon common stock to be distributed shall have been accepted for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of distribution; and no other event or development existing or having occurred that, in the judgment of Merck's Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, makes it inadvisable to effect the separation, distribution and otherrelated transactions. Merck and Organon cannot assure you that any or all of these conditions will be met. In addition, Merck will have the sole and absolute discretion to determine (and change) the terms of, and whether to proceed with,the distribution and, to the extent it determines to so proceed, to determine the record date and the distributiondate and the distribution ratio. Merck does not intend to notify its shareholders of any modifications to the termsof the separation that, in the judgment of its Board of Directors, are not material. For example, the Merck Boardof Directors might consider material such matters as significant changes to the distribution ratio, the assets to becontributed or the liabilities to be assumed in the separation. To the extent that the Merck Board of Directorsdetermines that any modifications by Merck materially change the material terms of the distribution, Merck willnotify Merck shareholders in a manner reasonably calculated to inform them about the modification as may berequired by law, by, for example, publishing a press release, filing a current report on Form 8-K, or circulating asupplement to this information statement. 142Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to Merck and to the holders of Merck common stock in connection with the spin-off (including the separation and distribution). Thissummary is based on the Code, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrativeinterpretations thereof, in each case as in effect and available as of the date of this information statement and allof which are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the taxconsequences described below. This summary is limited to holders of Merck common stock that are U.S. Holders, as defined immediately below. A \"U.S. Holder\" is a beneficial owner of Merck common stock that is, for U.S. federal income taxpurposes: an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States; a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantialdecisions or (ii) it has a valid election in place under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as aUnited States person. This summary also does not discuss all tax considerations that may be relevant to shareholders in light of their particular circumstances, nor does it address the consequences to shareholders subject to special treatmentunder the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: dealers or traders in securities or currencies; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; tax-exempt entities; banks, financial institutions or insurance companies; persons who acquired Merck common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation; shareholders who own, or are deemed to own, at least 10% or more, by voting power or value, of Merck equity; holders owning Merck common stock as part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging, conversion or other risk reduction transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; holders who are subject to the alternative minimum tax; or a person that owns Merck common stock through partnerships or other pass-through entities. This summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to Merck's shareholders who do not hold Merck common stock as a capital asset. Moreover, this summary does not address any state, local ornon-U.S. tax consequences or any estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences. If a partnership (or any other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Merck common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in that partnership generally will depend on the status of thepartner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as toits tax consequences. 143YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE SPIN-OFF. THISSUMMARY IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSTRUED TO BE, LEGAL ORTAX ADVICE TO ANY PARTICULAR INVESTOR. In connection with the spin-off, Merck expects to receive the Tax Opinions from its Tax Advisors to the effect that the distribution of 100% of the outstanding Organon shares to Merck shareholders and certain relatedtransactions will qualify as tax-free to Merck and its shareholders under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code. TheTax Opinions will be based on, among other things, current tax law, and assumptions and representations madeby Organon and Merck, which if incorrect in any material respect, could jeopardize the conclusions reached inthe Tax Opinions. The Tax Opinions received by Merck will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. The TaxOpinions will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Merck and Organonregarding the past and future conduct of Merck's and Organon's businesses and other matters. If any of thesefacts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Merck may not be ableto rely on the Tax Opinions. Accordingly, notwithstanding the receipt of the Tax Opinions, we cannot assure youthat the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to one or more of theconclusions set forth therein. In that event, the consequences described immediately below would not apply andholders of Merck common stock who receive shares of Organon common stock in the spin-off could be subject tosignificant U.S. federal income tax liability. Assuming the spin-off satisfies the requirements necessary for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code, the following will describe the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the spin-off toMerck, Organon and Merck's shareholders: no income, gain or loss will be recognized by, or be includible in the income of, a holder of Merck common stock, solely as a result of the receipt of Organon common stock, except with respect to anycash received in lieu of a fractional share; subject to the discussion below regarding Section 355(e), no gain or loss will be recognized by Merck as a result of the spin-off except for taxable income or gain possibly arising as a result of certainintercompany transactions; the aggregate tax basis of the Merck common stock, and Organon common stock received in the spin-off, in the hands of Merck's shareholders immediately after the spin-off, will be the same as theaggregate tax basis of the Merck common stock held by the holder immediately before the spin-off,allocated between the common stock of Merck and Organon common stock, including any fractionalshare interest for which cash is received, in proportion to such shares' relative fair market values on thedate of the spin-off; the holding period of shares of the Organon common stock received by Merck's shareholders in the spin-off will include the holding period of their Merck common stock, provided that such Merckcommon stock is held as a capital asset on the date of the spin-off; and a Merck shareholder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Organon common stock in the spin-off will be treated as having sold such fractional share for the amount of cash received andgenerally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount ofsuch cash received and such shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the fractional share. That gain or losswill be long-term capital gain or loss if the shareholder's holding period for its Merck common stockexceeds one year. Merck's shareholders that have acquired different blocks of Merck common stock at different times or at different prices should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of their aggregate adjusted basis among,and their holding period of, Organon common stock distributed with respect to such blocks of Merck commonstock. 144U.S. Treasury Regulations require certain shareholders that receive stock in a spin-off to attach to their respective U.S. federal income tax returns, for the year in which the spin-off occurs, a detailed statement settingforth certain information relating to the spin-off. Within a reasonable period of time after the distribution, Merckexpects to make available to its shareholders information pertaining to compliance with this requirement. If the spin-off were not to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each Merck shareholder that receives shares of Organon common stock in the spin-off would be treated as receiving a distribution in anamount equal to the fair market value of such shares, which generally would be treated in the following manner: first as a taxable dividend to the extent of such shareholder's pro rata share of Merck's current and accumulated earnings and profits; then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder's tax basis in its Merck common stock; and thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value. Additionally, each shareholder's basis in the Organon common stock would be equal to the fair market value of such stock on the date of the distribution and its holding period in the Organon common stock wouldbegin on the date of the distribution. Furthermore, Merck would recognize a taxable gain on the Organoncommon stock to the extent the fair market value of Organon common stock exceeds Merck's tax basis therein.Even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may be taxable toMerck (but not Merck's shareholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of theshares of Organon common stock or Merck common stock are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series ofrelated transactions that includes the spin-off. For this purpose, any acquisitions or issuances of Merck commonstock within two years before the spin-off, and any acquisitions or issuances of Organon common stock or Merckcommon stock within two years after the spin-off, generally are presumed to be part of such a plan, althoughOrganon or Merck may be able to rebut that presumption. Even if Section 355(e) of the Code were to apply tocause the spin-off to be taxable to Merck, the receipt of the shares of Organon common stock in the spin-offwould remain tax-free to the Merck shareholders. Tax Matters Agreement In connection with the distribution, Merck and Organon will enter into a tax matters agreement pursuant to which Organon will agree to be responsible for certain liabilities and obligations following the distribution. Ingeneral, under the terms of the tax matters agreement, in the event the distribution were to fail to qualify for U.S.federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code (including as a result of Section 355(e) ofthe Code) and if such failure were the result of actions taken by Organon after the distribution, Organon would beresponsible for all taxes imposed on Merck to the extent such taxes result from such actions. Further, if suchfailure were the result of any acquisition of Organon shares or assets or any of Organon's representations orundertakings being incorrect or breached, Organon would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Merck as aresult. For a more detailed discussion, see \"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u2014Tax MattersAgreement.\" Our indemnification obligations to Merck and its subsidiaries, officers and directors are not limitedin amount or subject to any cap. If we are required to indemnify Merck and its subsidiaries and their respectiveofficers and directors under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement, we may be subject tosubstantial liabilities. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding U.S. Treasury regulations require certain shareholders who receive stock in a distribution to attach to the shareholder's U.S. federal income tax return for the year in which the distribution occurs a detailed statementsetting forth certain information relating to the tax-free nature of the distribution. In addition, payments of cash toa Merck shareholder in lieu of fractional shares of Organon common stock in the distribution may be subject to 145information reporting, unless the shareholder provides proof of an applicable exemption. Such payments that are subject to information reporting may also be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%), unlessthe shareholder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with the requirementsof the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding does not constitute an additional tax, but merely anadvance payment, which may be refunded or credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability,provided the required information is timely supplied to the IRS. The preceding summary of the anticipated U.S. federal income tax consequences of the spin-off is for general informational purposes only. Merck's shareholders should consult their own tax advisors as to thespecific tax consequences of the spin-off to them, including the application and effect of state, local ornon-U.S. tax laws and of changes in applicable tax laws. 146Description of Certain Indebtedness The following summary sets forth information based on Organon's current expectations about the financing arrangements anticipated to be entered into prior to the separation. However, Organon has not yet entered intoany definitive agreements with respect to such financing arrangements, and, accordingly, the terms of suchfinancing arrangements have not yet been determined, remain under discussion and are subject to change,including as a result of market conditions. Senior Notes Issuances In April 2021, Organon Finance 1 LLC, a subsidiary of Merck, issued \u20ac1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior secured notes due 2028, $2.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% seniorsecured notes due 2028 and $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2031(collectively, the notes), in connection with the spin-off of Organon. The notes were issued to \"qualifiedinstitutional buyers\" in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The proceeds of thenotes offering will be held in escrow until satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the spin-off and certainother escrow release conditions. As part of the spin-off, Organon and a wholly-owned Dutch subsidiary of Organon will assume the notes as co-issuers. Organon's debt balance as of the distribution date will be determined based on internal capitalplanning and take into account factors and assumptions including the anticipated business plan, optimal debtlevels, operating activities, general economic contingencies, credit rating and desired financing capacity. Nothingin this summary or otherwise herein shall constitute or be deemed to constitute an offer to sell or the solicitationof an offer to buy the notes. Senior Credit Facilities In connection with the spin-off, we expect to enter into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (the \"Senior Credit Agreement\"), providing for: a Term Loan B Facility (\"Term Loan B Facility\"), consisting of (i) a U.S. dollar denominated senior secured \"tranche B\" term loan in the amount of $3,000 million, and (ii) a Euro denominated seniorsecured \"tranche B\" term loan in the Euro equivalent amount of \u20ac750 million, in each case with a seven-year term that matures in 2028; and a Revolving Credit Facility (\"Revolving Credit Facility\" and, together with the Term Loan B Facility, the \"Senior Credit Facilities\"), in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,000 million, with a five-year term that matures in 2026. The following is a summary description of certain terms of the Senior Credit Facilities. The terms of the Senior Credit Agreement and related documentation for the Senior Credit Facilities are subject to ongoingnegotiation, and accordingly their definitive terms may vary from those described below. We expect the Revolving Credit Facility to be undrawn on the spin date, and do not expect to have outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility on the spin date. We expect borrowings made under the Senior Credit Agreement to initially bear interest, in the case of revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility (i) in U.S. Dollars, at 2.00% in excess of an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate or 1.00% in excess of an alternate base rate, at our option and(ii) in Euros, at 2.00% in excess of an adjusted Euro Interbank Offer Rate; and term loans under the Term Loan B Facility (i) denominated in U.S. Dollars, at 3.00% in excess of Adjusted LIBOR or 2.00% in excess of ABR, at our option and (ii) denominated in Euros, at 3.00% inexcess of Adjusted EURIBOR. 147We expect the interest rate on the revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility to be subject to a step-down based on meeting a leverage ratio target. A commitment fee applies to the unused portion of therevolving facility that is expected to initially be 0.50%, and to be subject to a step-down to 0.375% based onmeeting a leverage ratio target. The Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to a financial covenant whereby the total leverage ratio, which measures the ratio of (i) consolidated total debt to (ii) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciationand amortization, and subject to other adjustments, must meet certain defined limits which are tested on aquarterly basis (commencing with the quarterly period ending on September 30, 2021) in accordance with theterms of the Senior Credit Facilities. In addition, the Senior Credit Agreement will contain covenants that willlimit, among other things, our ability to prepay, redeem or repurchase our subordinated and junior lien debt, incuradditional debt, make acquisitions, merge with other entities, pay dividends or distributions, redeem orrepurchase equity interests, and create or become subject to liens. 148Description of Capital Stock Organon's certificate of incorporation and bylaws will be amended and restated prior to the distribution. The following is a summary of the material terms of Organon's capital stock that will be contained in theamended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The summaries and descriptions below do notpurport to be complete statements of the relevant provisions of the certificate of incorporation or of the bylaws tobe in effect at the time of the distribution. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to thesedocuments, which you must read (along with the applicable provisions of Delaware law) for completeinformation on Organon's capital stock as of the time of the distribution. The certificate of incorporation andbylaws to be in effect at the time of the distribution will be included as exhibits to Organon's registrationstatement on Form 10, of which this information statement forms a part. General Organon's authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. Organon's Board of Directors mayestablish the rights and preferences of the preferred stock from time to time. Immediately following thedistribution, and based on the number of Merck shares outstanding on March 31, 2021 and the distribution ratio,Organon expects that approximately 253,130,375 shares of its common stock will be issued and outstanding(based on the number of shares of Merck outstanding on March 31, 2021) and that no shares of preferred stockwill be issued and outstanding. Common Stock Each holder of Organon common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted upon by the holders of Organon common stock, and there will be no cumulative voting rights. Subject to anypreferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock, holders of Organon common stock will be entitled toreceive ratably the cash dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by its Board of Directors out offunds legally available for that purpose. If there is a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Organon, holders ofits common stock would be entitled to ratable distribution of its assets remaining after the payment in full ofliabilities and any preferential rights of any then-outstanding preferred stock. Holders of Organon common stock will have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. After thedistribution, all outstanding shares of Organon common stock will be fully paid and non-assessable. The rights,preferences and privileges of the holders of Organon common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affectedby, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that Organon may designate and issue in thefuture. Preferred Stock Under the terms of Organon's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, its Board of Directors will be authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, and byits amended and restated certificate of incorporation, to issue preferred stock in one or more series withoutfurther action by the holders of its common stock. Organon's Board of Directors will have the discretion, subjectto limitations prescribed by the DGCL and by Organon's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, todetermine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversionrights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock. Certain provisions ofthe tax matters agreement, which are intended to preserve the intended tax treatment of the separation and certainrelated transactions, may prevent certain issuances of our stock for a period of time following the closing of thetransactions. 149Anti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions of DGCL and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws Certain provisions in our proposed amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our proposed amended and restated bylaws summarized below may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay,deter or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider to be in its best interests,including attempts that might result in a premium being paid over the market price for the shares held byshareholders. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in thecomposition of our Board of Directors and in the policies formulated by our Board of Directors and to discouragecertain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control. Classified Board. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, until the annual shareholder meeting in 2025, our Board of Directors will be divided into three classes, witheach class consisting, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors. Thedirectors designated as Class I directors will have terms expiring at the first annual meeting ofshareholders following the distribution, which we expect to hold in 2022, and will be up for re-electionat that meeting for a three-year term to expire at the 2025 annual meeting of shareholders; the directorsdesignated as Class II directors will have terms expiring at the following year's annual meeting ofshareholders, which we expect to hold in 2023, and will be up for re-election at that meeting for atwo-year term to expire at the 2025 annual meeting of shareholders; and the directors designated asClass III directors will have terms expiring at the following year's annual meeting of shareholderswhich we expect to hold in 2024, and will be up for re-election at that meeting for a one-year term toexpire at the 2025 annual meeting of shareholders. Commencing with the 2025 annual meeting ofshareholders, directors will be elected annually and for a term of office to expire at the next annualmeeting of shareholders, and our Board of Directors will thereafter no longer be divided into classes.Before our Board of Directors is declassified, it would take at least three years after the completion ofthe distribution for any individual or group to gain control of our Board of Directors. Accordingly,while the Board of Directors is divided into classes, these provisions could discourage a third partyfrom initiating a proxy contest, making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to control us. Removal and Vacancies . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that (i) prior to our Board of Directors being declassified as discussed above, our shareholders may removedirectors only for cause and (ii) after our Board of Directors has been fully declassified, ourshareholders may remove directors with or without cause. Removal will require the affirmative vote ofholders of at least a majority of the voting power of our stock outstanding and entitled to vote on suchremoval. Vacancies occurring on the Board of Directors, whether due to death, resignation, removal,retirement, disqualification or for any other reason, and newly created directorships resulting from anincrease in the authorized number of directors, shall be filled solely by a majority of the remainingmembers of the Board of Directors or by a sole remaining director. Blank Check Preferred Stock . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize our Board to designate and issue, without any further vote or action by the shareholders, up to 25,000,000shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and, with respect to each such series,to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers(if any) of the shares of the series, and the preferences and relative, participating, optional and otherrights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of the shares of such series. The abilityto issue such preferred stock could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay orprevent a change in control. No Shareholder Action by Written Consent . Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will expressly exclude the right of our shareholders to act by written consent. Shareholder action must takeplace at an annual meeting or at a special meeting of our shareholders. 150No Shareholder Ability to Call Special Meetings of Shareholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will provide that only the Board of Directors will be able to call a specialmeeting of shareholders. Requirements for Advance Notification of Shareholder Nominations and Proposals . Our amended and restated bylaws will require shareholders seeking to nominate persons for election as directors at anannual or special meeting of shareholders, or to bring other business before an annual or special meeting(other than a proposal submitted under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act), to provide timely notice inwriting. A shareholder's notice to our Corporate Secretary must be in proper written form and must setforth certain information, as required under our amended and restated bylaws, related to the shareholdergiving the notice, the beneficial owner (if any) on whose behalf the nomination is made as well as theircontrol persons and information about the proposal or nominee for election to the Board of Directors. Exclusive Forum . Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that, unless we select or consent to the selection, in writing, of another forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if theCourt of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within theState of Delaware) shall be the exclusive forum for any \"internal corporate claims,\" which includeclaims in the right of our company (i) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or formerdirector, officer, employee or shareholder in such capacity; or (ii) as to which the DGCL confersjurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. Furthermore, unless we select or consent to the selection of analternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusiveforum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.Our exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created bythe Exchange Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rulesand regulations thereunder. It is possible that a court could find our exclusive forum provision to beinapplicable or unenforceable. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increasedconsistency in the application of law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision mayhave the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. Business Combinations with Interested Shareholder . We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any businesscombination with any interested shareholder for a period of three years following the date that suchshareholder became an interested shareholder. Limitation on Liability of Directors and Indemnification of Directors and Officers Our amended and restated bylaws will generally provide indemnification and advancement of expenses for our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Prior to the completion of the distribution,we also intend to enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers thatmay, in some cases, be broader than the specific indemnification and advancement of expenses provisionscontained under Delaware law. In addition, as permitted by Delaware law, our amended and restated certificateof incorporation will include a provision that eliminates the personal liability of our directors for monetarydamages resulting from breaches of certain fiduciary duties as a director. The effect of this provision is to restrictour rights and the rights of our shareholders in derivative suits to recover monetary damages against a director forbreach of fiduciary duties as a director, except that under Delaware law, we may not eliminate the personalliability of a director for: any breach of his duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders; acts or omissions not in good faith, or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the DGCL; or 151 any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit; or improper distributions to shareholders. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock will be Equiniti Trust Company. Listing We have applied to list our common stock on the NYSE, under the ticker symbol \"OGN.\" 152Where You Can Find More Information Organon has filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the SEC with respect to the shares of Organon common stock being distributed as contemplated by this information statement.

F - 7 Notes to the Combined Financial Statements .................................................. F - 8Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Merck & Co., Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of Organon & Co. (a business of Merck & Co., Inc.) (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related combined statements of income, ofcomprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"combined financial statements\"). In our opinion,the combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company asof December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years inthe period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the UnitedStates of America. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 3 to the combined financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in 2018. Basis for Opinion These combined financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's combined financial statements based on our audits. We are a publicaccounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) andare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities lawsand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these combined financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standardsrequire that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financialstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the combined financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such proceduresincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the combined financialstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made bymanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the combined financial statements. We believe thatour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the combined financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that(i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the combined financial statements and (ii) involved ourespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does notalter in any way our opinion on the combined financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, bycommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on theaccounts or disclosures to which it relates. F-2Customer Discount Accruals in the U.S. - Medicaid and Managed Care Rebates As described in Note 3 to the combined financial statements, the Company records certain variable consideration including discounts, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method. Amountsaccrued for aggregate customer discounts as of December 31, 2020 in the U.S. are $302 million and are evaluatedon a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenanceorganizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amountsaccrued. Certain of these discounts take the form of rebates, which are amounts owed based upon definitivecontractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector (Managed Care) and public sector (Medicaid)benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. Theprovision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel todetermine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. Management uses historical customer segmentutilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel,government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to customer discount accruals in the U.S.\u2014Medicaid and Managed Care rebates is a critical audit matter are the significant judgmentby management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing the provisions, as theprovisions include assumptions related to changes to price and historical customer segment utilization mix,pertaining to forecasted customer claims that may not be fully paid until a subsequent period. This in turn led to ahigh degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in applying the procedures related to those assumptionsand in evaluating the evidence obtained from these procedures. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the combined financial statements. These procedures included, among others,(i) developing an independent estimate of the rebate accruals by utilizing third party data on historical customersegment utilization mix in the U.S., changes to price, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historicaltrend of actual rebate claims paid, (ii) comparing the independent estimate to the rebate accruals recorded bymanagement, and (iii) testing actual rebate claims paid, including evaluating those claims for consistency withthe contractual terms of the Company's rebate agreements. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New JerseyMarch 17, 2021 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.

F-7Notes to Combined Financial Statements Organon & Co. ($ in millions) 1. Background and Nature of Operations On February 5, 2020, Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck or Parent) announced its intent to spin-off its women's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent publicly traded company,Organon & Co. (Organon or the Company), through a distribution of Organon's publicly traded stock to Merckshareholders. These combined financial statements reflect the combined historical results of operations, financialposition and cash flows of the Company. Completion of the spin-off is subject to certain conditions, including receipt of an opinion from tax counsel or other third-party adviser that the distribution and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to Merckand its shareholders under sections 355 and 368 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's operations are principally managed on a products basis and include two operating segments, the Organon Products segment and the Merck Retained Products segment. The Organon Products segment is engaged in developing and delivering innovative health solutions through its portfolio of prescription therapies within women's health, biosimilars, and established brands (OrganonProducts). The Company sells these products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, governmentagencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefitmanagers and other institutions. The Company expects to operate six manufacturing facilities in Belgium, Brazil,Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK). The Organon Products segment portfolio includes: Women's Health : the Company has innovative contraception and fertility brands, such as Nexplanon/ Implanon , a long-acting reversible contraceptive, a class of contraceptives which are recognized as the most effective type of hormonal contraception available to patients with a lower long-term averagecost. Biosimilars: the Company's current portfolio spans immunology and oncology treatments. All five of the biosimilars in Organon's portfolio have launched in certain countries globally, including twobiosimilars in the United States. Established Brands : the Company has a portfolio of established brands, which generally are beyond market exclusivity, including leading brands in cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatology andnon-opioid pain management. The Merck Retained Products segment reflects the results of certain Merck non-U.S. legal entities that will be contributed to Organon in connection with the spin-off (Transferring Entities and each, a Transferring Entity).The Transferring Entities include operations related to other Merck products that will be retained by Merck(Merck Retained Products) (see Note 2). 2. Basis of Presentation The Company's historical combined financial statements have been prepared on a standalone basis and are derived from Merck's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The combined financialstatements reflect the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows as it was operated aspart of Merck prior to the spin-off, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).The assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the Company have been reflected in our combined financialstatements on a historical cost basis, as included in the consolidated financial statements of Merck, using the F-8historical accounting policies applied by Merck. These combined financial statements do not purport to reflect what the Company's results of operations, comprehensive income, financial position, equity or cash flows wouldhave been had the Company operated as a standalone public company during the periods presented. These combined financial statements were prepared following a legal entity approach, which resulted in the inclusion of the following: Certain assets and liabilities, results of operations and cash flows attributable to the sales of products in the Organon Products segment that will be contributed to Organon prior to the consummation of thespin-off, and The Transferring Entities, which have historically included the results from the sales of products included both in the Organon Products segment and the Merck Retained Products segment. EachTransferring Entity's historical operations, including its results of operations, assets and liabilities, andcash flows have been fully reflected in these combined financial statements; however, prior to theconsummation of the spin-off, the products in the Merck Retained Products segment will becontributed to newly formed Merck entities that will be retained by Merck. Upon full contribution ofthe Merck Retained Products by the Company to Merck and its affiliates, the historical results ofoperations of such products in the Merck Retained Products segment will be reflected as discontinuedoperations in the Organon financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2020, in contemplation of the spin-off: The Merck Retained Products business in certain Transferring Entities was distributed to Merck affiliates (MRP Distribution) and the Merck Retained Products segment's results of operations, assetsand liabilities, and cash flows for such Transferring Entities are included in these combined financialstatements through the date of distribution to Merck affiliates. The Organon Products business in certain jurisdictions has been transferred by Merck affiliates to legal entities established to operate the Organon Products business and, as noted above, such entities will becontributed to Organon (Organon Entities). The Company's businesses have historically functioned together with the other businesses controlled by Merck. Accordingly, the Company relied on Merck's corporate and other support functions for its business.Therefore, certain corporate and shared costs have been allocated to the Company including: (i) expenses related to Merck support functions that are provided on a centralized basis within Merck, including expenses for facilities, executive oversight, treasury, finance, legal, human resources, shared services,compliance, procurement, information technology and other corporate functions. These expenses have beenallocated to the Company based on a specific identification basis or, when specific identification is notpracticable, a proportional cost allocation method primarily based on revenue or directly identifiable actual costs,depending on the nature of the services. (ii) certain manufacturing and supply costs incurred by Merck's manufacturing division, including facility management, distribution, logistics, planning and global quality. These costs include material, manufacturingcosts and variances, distribution expenses, supply chain management, contract manufacturing and qualitycharges, among others. These costs have been allocated based on a specific identification basis, or when specificidentification is not practicable, a proportional cost allocation method based on directly identifiablemanufacturing costs, depending on the nature of the costs. (iii) certain costs incurred by Merck's human health division in relation to selling and marketing activities, and related administrative support functions, that are not routinely allocated to therapeutic areas. Human healthdivision costs have been allocated either based on product specific identification, or when specific identificationis not practicable, a proportional cost allocation method based on associated selling and marketing costs,depending on the nature of the costs. F-9(iv) costs incurred by Merck's research laboratories for activities related to drug discovery and development, as well as medical and regulatory affairs. Such costs have been allocated based on a specificidentification basis, or when specific identification is not practicable, a proportional cost allocation method basedon directly identifiable employee activities. (v) restructuring costs (see Note 5) and share-based compensation expenses (see Note 11).(vi) certain compensation expenses maintained on a centralized basis such as certain employee benefit expenses. Management believes these cost allocations are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to, or the benefit derived by, the Company during the periods presented, though the allocations may not beindicative of the actual costs that would have been incurred had the Company operated as a standalone publiccompany. Actual costs that may have been incurred if the Company had been a standalone company woulddepend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, whether functions were outsourcedor performed by Company's employees, and strategic decisions made in areas such as manufacturing, selling andmarketing, research and development, information technology and infrastructure. Following the spin-off, certain functions that Merck provided to the Company prior to the spin-off will either continue to be provided to the Company by Merck under a transition services agreement or will beperformed using the Company's own resources or third-party service providers. Additionally, undermanufacturing and supply agreements, the Company will manufacture certain products for Merck or itsapplicable affiliate and Merck will manufacture certain products for the Company or its applicable affiliate. TheCompany expects to incur certain costs in its establishment as a standalone public company, as well as ongoingadditional costs associated with operating as an independent, publicly traded company. The combined balance sheet reflects all of the assets and liabilities that are either specifically identifiable or are directly attributable to the Company and its operations, as well as assets and liabilities attributable to theMerck Retained Products in the Transferring Entities. However, the balance sheet at December 31, 2020excludes the assets and liabilities of the Merck Retained Products in certain Transferring Entities that weredistributed to the Parent in the fourth quarter of 2020 as part of the MRP Distribution. The assets and liabilities inthe remaining Transferring Entities attributable to Merck Retained Products will be distributed to the Parent priorto the spin-off. Property, plant and equipment reflected in the combined balance sheet is primarily attributable tothe six manufacturing facilities the Company expects to operate. No assets or liabilities are reflected in thecombined balance sheet for amounts related to derivatives and hedging activities. Merck maintains various employee benefit plans which the Company's employees participate in, and a portion of the costs associated with these plans has been included in the Company's combined financialstatements. The combined balance sheet only includes assets and liabilities relating to plans for which the entitybeing transferred is the plan sponsor; most of these plans are on the Transferring Entities and substantially all ofthe related assets and liabilities were transferred to Merck as part of the MRP Distribution in the fourth quarter of2020 or will be prior to the spin-off. Income tax expense and deferred tax balances in the combined financial statements have been calculated on a separate tax return basis. The Company's operations are included in the tax returns of certain Organon Entities,Transferring Entities or the respective Merck entities of which the Company's business is a part. In the future, asa standalone entity, the Company will file tax returns on its own behalf, and its deferred taxes and effectiveincome tax rate may differ from those in the historical periods. Merck utilizes a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its operations. Cash generated by the Company is routinely transferred into accounts managed by Merck's centralized treasuryfunction and cash disbursements for the Company's operations are funded as needed by Merck. Cash and cash F-10equivalents of the Organon Entities and the Transferring Entities are reflected in the Company's combined balance sheet. Balances held by the Organon Entities and the Transferring Entities with Merck for cash transfersand loans are reflected as Due from related party ,Due to related party ,o rRelated Party Loans Payable . All other cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and related transfers between Merck and the Company aregenerally held centrally through accounts controlled and maintained by Merck and are not specificallyidentifiable to the Company. Accordingly, such balances have been accounted for through Net investment from Parent . Merck's third-party debt and related interest expense have not been attributed to the Company because the Company is not the legal obligor of the debt and the borrowings are not specifically identifiable to theCompany. However, in connection with the spin-off, the Company expects to incur indebtedness and suchindebtedness would cause the Company to record additional interest expense in future periods. As the separate legal entities that make up the Company's business were not historically held by a single legal entity, Net investment from Parent is shown in lieu of shareholders' equity in these combined financial statements. Net investment from Parent represents Merck's interest in the recorded assets of the Company and the cumulative investment by Merck in the Company through the periods presented, inclusive of operatingresults. All intercompany transactions and accounts within Organon have been eliminated. For the Organon Entities and the Transferring Entities, transactions with Merck affiliates attributable to the Merck Retained Products areincluded in the combined statement of income and related balances are reflected as Due to related party, Due from related party orRelated Party Loans Payable . Other balances between the Company and Merck are considered to be effectively settled in the combined financial statements at the time the transactions are recorded.The total net effect of these intercompany transactions considered to be settled is reflected in the combinedstatement of cash flows within financing activities and in the combined statement of equity as Net transfers to Parent . See Note 17 for additional details. 3. Summary of Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition \u2014 Recognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract, probable collection of sales proceeds and completion of substantially all performance obligations. The Company acts as the principal in itscustomer arrangements and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. The majority of the Company's contractshave a single performance obligation \u2014 the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in thecontext of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shippingis not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation. Revenues from sales of products, including sales of Merck Retained Products to affiliates by the Organon Entities and the Transferring Entities, are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred tothe customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to thecustomer and the Company is entitled to payment. The nature of the Company's business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method,although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts. In the United States, sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with alimited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts andreturns, which are established at the time of sale. In addition, revenues are recorded net of time value of moneydiscounts if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year. The U.S. provision for aggregate customer discounts covering chargebacks and rebates was $1.8 billion in 2020, $1.9 billion in 2019 and $2.0 billion in 2018. Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted F-11customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The contracted customer generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up. The wholesaler, in turn, charges the Company backfor the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesalerby the customer. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company'swholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. Rebates areamounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and publicsector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacyto a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventorylevels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. The Companyuses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventorylevels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimatethe expected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basisthrough comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacybenefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. The accrued balancesrelative to the provisions for chargebacks and rebates included in Accounts receivable andAccrued and other current liabilities were $41 million and $302 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and were $52 million and $313 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Outside of the United States, variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly competitive product classes, discounts required to gain or maintainreimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates. In certain European countries, legislatively mandated rebatesare calculated based on an estimate of the government's total unbudgeted spending and the Company's specificpayback obligation. Rebates may also be required based on specific product sales thresholds. The Companyapplies an estimated factor against its actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount orrebate obligations associated with the sale. The Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months afterproduct expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actualreturns. Additionally, the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel,product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of genericcompetition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. Outside of the UnitedStates, returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis. The Company's payment terms for U.S. customers are typically 36 days from receipt of invoice. Outside of the United States, payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets have longer paymentterms. See Note 16 for disaggregated revenue disclosures.Cash Equivalents \u2014 Cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Inventories \u2014 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of a substantial majority of U.S. inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for both financial reportingand tax purposes. The cost of all other inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Value Added Tax \u2014 The Company's purchases, sales and intercompany transfers of goods are subject to value added tax (VAT) and VAT receivables are recognized for amounts that represent credits against futureVAT obligations. VAT receivables included in Other current assets were $348 million and $187 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. VAT payables included in Accrued and other current liabilities were $38 million and $46 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. F-12Depreciation \u2014 Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets, principally using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives primarily range from 25 to 45 years for Buildings , and from 3 to 15 years for Machinery, equipment and office furnishings . Depreciation expense was $72 million in 2020, $69 million in 2019 and $68 million in 2018. Advertising and Promotion Costs \u2014 Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred. The Company recorded advertising and promotion expenses of $217 million, $298 million and $322 million in 2020,2019 and 2018, respectively. Goodwill \u2014 Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Substantially all of the goodwill attributed to Organon in the Company's financialstatements resulted from Merck's merger with Schering-Plough Corporation (Schering-Plough) in 2009.Goodwill was attributed to Organon based on the fair value of the Organon business as of the acquisition daterelative to the total fair value of Schering-Plough. Goodwill, attributable only to the Organon Products reportingunit, is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, byfirst assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is less thancarrying value. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that fair value is less than carrying value, aquantitative fair value test is performed. If carrying value is greater than fair value, a goodwill impairment chargewill be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill). As of the most recent goodwillimpairment testing date, the reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by a substantial amount. Acquired Intangibles \u2014 Acquired intangibles include products and product rights and licenses, which are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized on a straight-line basis over theirestimated useful lives. Substantially all of the products and product rights intangible assets attributed to Organonin the Company's financial statements resulted from Merck's merger with Schering-Plough. The intangible assetsattributable to the Company's operations have been reflected in the combined financial statements based onMerck's historical cost. Licenses include milestone payments made to collaborative partners upon or subsequentto regulatory approval. The estimated useful lives of acquired intangibles range from 5 to 15 years (see Note 8).The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values ofits acquired intangibles may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of theundiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying valueto determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured basedon the difference between the carrying value of the intangible asset and its fair value, which is determined basedon the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Research and Development \u2014 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs also include upfront and milestone payments related to licensing or collaborativearrangements involving clinical development programs that have not yet received regulatory approval. Foreign Currency Translation \u2014 The net assets of international operations where the local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. TheU.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded inthe foreign currency translation account, which is included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reflected as a separate component of equity. For those operations that operate in highly inflationary economiesand for those operations where the U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional currency, non-monetaryforeign currency assets and liabilities are translated using historical rates, while monetary assets and liabilitiesare translated at current rates, with the U.S. dollar effects of rate changes included in Other (income) expense, net. Merck calculates foreign currency translation on its consolidated assets and liabilities, which include assets and liabilities of the Company. These combined financial statements include Merck's foreign currencytranslation for the Organon entities and the Transferring Entities. Other than for the Organon Entities and the F-13Transferring Entities, since the Company has not historically recorded foreign currency translation on its own assets and liabilities, foreign currency translation recorded in these combined financial statements, is based oncurrency movements specific to the Company's combined financial statements during the periods presented. Share-Based Compensation \u2014 Certain of the Company's employees have historically participated in Merck's share-based compensation plans. Share-based compensation expense has been allocated to the Companybased on a proportionate cost allocation method. The Company expenses all share-based payments to employeesover the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair value of the awards. Pension Benefits \u2014 The defined benefit plans in which the Company participates relate primarily to plans sponsored by Merck and for which other businesses of Merck also participate (Shared Plans). The Companyaccounts for the Shared Plans as multiemployer plans and therefore the related assets and liabilities are notreflected in the combined balance sheet. The combined statement of income reflects a proportional allocation ofnet periodic benefit cost for the Shared Plans associated with the Company. For certain defined benefit plansattributable to the Organon Entities and the Transferring Entities, the overfunded or underfunded status of theplan is recognized as an asset or liability on the combined balance sheet. Restructuring Costs \u2014 Costs associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized in the period in which they are incurred. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render serviceuntil termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. Thecombined financial statements include restructuring costs directly identifiable to the Organon Entities and theTransferring Entities and a proportional allocation of Merck's restructuring costs associated with the Company.The Company has recorded liabilities for costs associated with restructuring activities related to the OrganonEntities and the Transferring Entities. When accruing these costs, the Company recognizes the amount within arange of costs that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimatethan any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum amount with the range. Contingencies and Legal Defense Costs \u2014 The Company records accruals for contingencies and legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency when it is probable that a liabilityhas been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Taxes on Income \u2014 Income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been calculated on a separate tax return basis. The Company's operations are included in the tax returns of certain Organon Entities, TransferringEntities or the respective Merck entities of which the Company's business is a part. In the future, as a standaloneentity, the Company will file tax returns on its own behalf and its deferred taxes and effective tax rate may differfrom those in the historical periods. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporarydifferences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. The Companyestablishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income isnot likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are morelikely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that isgreater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positionsthat are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion ofthe benefit in the financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertaintax positions as a component of Taxes on income in the combined statement of income. The Company accounts for the tax effects of the tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of certain foreign subsidiaries in theincome tax provision in the period the tax arises. The Company does not maintain an income taxes payable to orfrom account as it is deemed to be settled with the tax paying entities in the respective jurisdictions. Thesesettlements are reflected as changes in Net investment from Parent on the combined balance sheet. However, the Company's combined balance sheet reflects balances with taxing authorities for certain Organon Entities and F-14Transferring Entities and the one-time transition tax resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), as well as for unrecognized income tax benefits along with related interest and penalties. The Company and Merckwill enter into a tax matters agreement prior to the separation. Use of Estimates \u2014 The combined financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Estimatesare used in determining the allocation of costs and expenses from Merck, and are used in determining such itemsas provisions for sales discounts and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories,valuation of goodwill and intangibles, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities and otherreserves, pension and share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, and taxes on income. Becauseof the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Net Investment from Parent \u2014 Net investment from Parent in the combined balance sheet represents Merck's historical investment in the Company, the accumulated net earnings after taxes and the net effect of thetransactions with and allocations from Merck. See Notes 2 and 17 for additional information. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards \u2014 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended accounting guidance on revenue recognition that applies to all contracts with customers.The objective of the new guidance is to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entitiesand to provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosurerequirements. The new standard permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting periodpresented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of adopting the guidancebeing recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). The new standard waseffective as of January 1, 2018 and was adopted using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of thenew standard had a de minimis impact on the Company's combined financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra- entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income taxconsequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset (with the exception of inventory) when the intra-entitytransfer occurs, replacing the prohibition against doing so. The current exception to defer the recognition of anytax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remainsunaffected. The new standard was effective as of January 1, 2018 and was adopted using a modified retrospectiveapproach. The Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption increasing Net investment from Parent by $329 million with a corresponding decrease to Deferred Income Taxes. In February 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to address a narrow-scope financial reporting issue that arose as a consequence of the TCJA. The new standard allows a company to make a one-timeelection to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJA from accumulated other comprehensiveincome to retained earnings. The new standard also requires companies to disclose their accounting policy forreleasing stranded income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company has electednot to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJA. The Company's policy for releasingdisproportionate income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss is to utilize the item-by-item approach. In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that provides for the elimination of Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, impairment charges are recognized to the extent the carrying amountof a reporting unit exceeds its fair value with certain limitations. The Company adopted the new standard in2018. The adoption of the new guidance had an immaterial effect on its combined financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the accounting and reporting of leases and subsequently issued several updates to the new guidance (new leasing guidance). The new leasing guidancerequires that lessees recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for each of its leases (other than leases that F-15meet the definition of a short-term lease). Leases are classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases result in straight-line expense in the income statement (similar to previous operating leases), while finance leasesresult in more expense being recognized in the earlier years of the lease term (similar to previous capital leases).The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach and electedthe transition method that allows for application of the standard at the adoption date rather than at the beginningof the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company also elected availablepractical expedients. Upon adoption, the Company recognized $67 million of additional assets and relatedliabilities on its combined balance sheet. The adoption of the new leasing guidance did not impact theCompany's combined statements of income or of cash flows. In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance modifying the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The new guidance removes disclosures that nolonger are considered cost beneficial, clarifies the specific requirements of certain disclosures, and addsdisclosure requirements identified as relevant. The Company elected to early adopt the new guidance in 2019 andhas incorporated the new guidance into its employee benefit plan disclosures (see Note 12). Also, in August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance on fair value measurements that adds, removes, and modifies certain disclosure requirements. The Company elected to early adopt the new guidance in 2019. Therewere no changes to the Company's existing fair value disclosures upon adoption. In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance introduces an expected loss model for estimating credit losses, replacing the incurred lossmodel. The new guidance also changes the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities, requiring theuse of an allowance to record estimated credit losses (and subsequent recoveries). The Company adopted the newguidance effective January 1, 2020. There was no impact to the Company's combined financial statements uponadoption. In November 2018, the FASB issued new guidance for collaborative arrangements intended to reduce diversity in practice by clarifying whether certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participantsshould be accounted for under revenue recognition guidance. The Company adopted the new guidance effectiveJanuary 1, 2020. There was no impact to the Company's combined financial statements upon adoption. In December 2019, the FASB issued amended guidance on the accounting and reporting of income taxes. The guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing exceptions related to certainintraperiod tax allocations and deferred tax liabilities; clarifying guidance primarily related to evaluating thestep-up tax basis for goodwill in a business combination; and reflecting enacted changes in tax laws or rates inthe annual effective tax rate. The Company adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2021. There was noimpact to the Company's combined financial statements upon adoption. 4. Samsung Collaboration In 2013, Merck entered into an agreement with Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. (Samsung Bioepis) to develop and commercialize multiple pre-specified biosimilar candidates, which have since launched and are part of theCompany's product portfolio. Under the agreement, Samsung Bioepis is responsible for preclinical and clinicaldevelopment, process development and manufacturing, clinical trials and registration of product candidates, andthe Company has an exclusive license for worldwide commercialization with certain geographic exceptionsspecified on a product-by-product basis. The Company's access rights to each product under the agreement lastfor 10 years from each product's launch date on a market-by-market basis. Gross profits are shared equally in allmarkets with the exception of Brazil where gross profits are shared 65% to Samsung Bioepis and 35% to theCompany. Since the Company is the principal on sales transactions with third parties, the Company recognizessales, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses on a gross basis. Generally, profit sharingadjustments are recorded either to Cost of sales (after commercialization) or Selling, general and administrative expenses (prior to commercialization). F-16In addition to an upfront payment upon execution of the arrangement, Samsung Bioepis is eligible for additional payments associated with pre-specified clinical and regulatory milestones. Milestone payments madeto Samsung Bioepis were $25 million in 2020 and $50 million in 2019. At December 31, 2020, potential futureregulatory milestone payments of $25 million remain under the agreement. Summarized information related to this collaboration is as follows: Years Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Sales ................................................. $330 $252 $ 64 Cost of sales ........................................... 208 152 40 Selling, general and administrative ......................... 87 91 47 December 31 2020 2019 Receivables from Samsung included in Other current assets ............ $5 2 $8 6 Payables to Samsung included in Trade Accounts Payable .............. 13 \u2014 5. Restructuring Certain of the Company's operations have been affected by restructuring plans initiated by Merck. These restructuring plans include a global restructuring program approved in 2019 focused primarily on furtheroptimizing Merck's manufacturing and supply network and reducing its global real estate footprint. TheCompany's operations were also affected by previous restructuring plans designed to streamline Merck's coststructure, which included the elimination of positions in sales, administrative and headquarters organizations, aswell as the sale or closure of certain manufacturing and research and development sites and the consolidation ofoffice facilities. The following table summarizes the charges directly attributed to the Organon Entities and the Transferring Entities as well as charges allocated to the Company related to these restructuring program activities by type ofcost: Separation CostsAccelerated Depreciation Other Total Year Ended December 31, 2020 Cost of sales ..................................... $\u2014 $\u2014 $ 3 $ 3 Restructuring costs ............................... 33 \u2014 37 70 $3 3 $ \u2014 $4 0 $7 3 Year Ended December 31, 2019 Cost of sales ..................................... $ \u2014 $ 7 $ \u2014 $ 7 Restructuring costs ................................ 8 7 \u2014 1 4 1 0 1 $ 87 $ 7 $ 14 $108 Year Ended December 31, 2018 Cost of sales ..................................... $ \u2014 $ 5 $ 2 $ 7 Restructuring costs ................................ 8 6 \u2014 3 3 1 1 9 $ 86 $ 5 $ 35 $126 Restructuring costs allocated to the Company were $58 million, $73 million and $96 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Separation costs are associated with actual headcount reductions made by Merck, as wellas those headcount reductions which were probable and could be reasonably estimated. Other activity representscosts associated with facilities to be sold or closed including allocated accelerated depreciation expense forfacilities retained by Merck, asset abandonment, shut-down and other related costs. F-17The Company has recorded liabilities for costs associated with restructuring activities related to the Organon Entities and the Transferring Entities included primarily in Accrued and other current liabilities , which were $18 million and $10 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 6. Financial Instruments Merck manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on its affiliates' earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financialinstruments, including derivative instruments. Merck has established revenue hedging and balance sheet riskmanagement programs to protect against the volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fairvalue caused by volatility in exchange rates that the Company participates in. Accordingly, the combinedstatement of income includes the impact of Merck's derivative financial instruments that is deemed to beassociated with the Company's operations and has been allocated to the Company utilizing a proportionalallocation method. In 2020, the recognized amount allocated to Sales wasde minimis. In 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized allocated net (gains) losses of $(73) million and $44 million, respectively, in Sales .I n 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized allocated net losses (gains) of $52 million, $3 million and$(107) million, respectively, in Other (income) expense, net . Additionally, direct and allocated foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were net losses of $18 million, $61 million and $167 million, respectively. Concentrations of Credit Risk On an ongoing basis, the Company's operations form part of Merck's monitoring of concentrations of credit risk associated with corporate and government issuers of securities and financial institutions with which Merckconducts business. Credit exposure limits are established to limit a concentration with any single issuer orinstitution. The majority of the Company's accounts receivable arise from product sales in the United States, Europe and China and are primarily due from drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies, managedhealth care providers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Company's customers with the largest accountsreceivable balances are AAH Pharmaceuticals LTD (headquartered in the UK), McKesson Corporation,AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc., which represented, in aggregate, approximately 30%of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2020. Bad debts have been minimal. The Company does notnormally require collateral or other security to support credit sales. Merck has accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions in certain countries to sell accounts receivable. Merck factored $227 million and $488 million of accounts receivable related to theCompany in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively, under these factoring arrangements, whichreduced outstanding accounts receivable. The cash received from the financial institutions is reported withinoperating activities in the combined statement of cash flows. F-187. Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of: 2020 2019 Finished goods ...................................... $ 409 $ 463 Raw materials and work in process ...................... 630 632 Supplies ........................................... 60 73 Total (approximates current cost) ....................... 1,099 1,168 Decrease to LIFO as: Inventories ..................................... $ 971 $1,071 Other assets .................................... 127 93 Inventories valued under the LIFO method comprised $48 million and $62 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amounts recognized as Other assets are comprised almost entirely of raw materials and work in process inventories not expected to be sold within one year. 8. Other Intangibles Other intangibles at December 31 consisted of: 2020 2019 Gross Carrying AmountAccumulated Amortization NetGross Carrying AmountAccumulated Amortization Net $24,159 $23,715 $444 125 $ 24,360 $ 23,857 $ 503 $ 24,335 $ 23,766 $ 569 Acquired intangibles include products and products rights, and licenses, which are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.At December 31, 2020, the Company's most significant acquired intangible asset balance included in productsand product rights above related to Nexplanon/Implanon , which had a net balance of $354 million. At December 31, 2020, the most significant amounts within licenses relate to capitalized milestone paymentsassociated with the Samsung Bioepis collaboration (see Note 4), which had a net balance of $113 million in theaggregate. Aggregate amortization expense recorded within Cost of sales was $85 million in 2020, $285 million in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018. The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five years is 9. Leases The Company has operating leases primarily for real estate. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. When evaluating contracts for embedded leases, the Company exercises judgment todetermine if there is an explicit or implicit identified asset in the contract and if the Company controls the use ofthat asset. Embedded leases, primarily associated with contract manufacturing organizations, are immaterial. Thelease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company willexercise that option. Real estate leases for facilities have an average remaining lease term of 6.8 years, which for F-19one lease includes an option to extend for 5 years. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to record short-term leases (leases with an initial term of 12 months or less) on the balance sheet; however, theCompany currently has no short-term leases. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the leaseterm. Since most of the Company's leases do not have a readily determinable implicit discount rate, theCompany uses Merck's incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments. On aquarterly basis, an updated incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the average remaining lease termof each asset class and Merck's pretax cost of debt for that same term. The updated rates for each asset class areapplied prospectively to new leases. The Company does not separate lease components (e.g. payments for rent,real estate taxes and insurance costs) from non-lease components (e.g. common-area maintenance costs) in theevent that the agreement contains both. The Company includes both the lease and non-lease components forpurposes of calculating the right-of-use asset and related lease liability (if the non-lease components are fixed).Direct and allocated operating lease cost was $49 million in 2020 and $57 million in 2019. Direct and allocatedrental expense under operating leases for periods prior to the adoption of the new leasing guidance was$58 million in 2018. Certain of the Company's lease agreements contain variable lease payments that are adjusted periodically for inflation or for actual operating expense true-ups compared with estimated amounts; however, these amountsare immaterial. Sublease income is immaterial and there are no sale-leaseback transactions. The Company's leaseagreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Supplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows: December 31 2020 2019 Assets Other Assets ....................................... $9 1 $8 2 Liabilities Accrued and other current liabilities ..................... 20 14 Other Noncurrent Liabilities ........................... 71 68 $9 1 $8 2 Weighted-average remaining lease term (years) ................ 6.8 8.3 Weighted-average discount rate ............................ 2.7% 3.3% Maturities ................................................ $22 1 0 2025 ................................................ 9 Thereafter ............................................ 2 3 Total lease payments ................................... 9 9 Less: Imputed interest ................................... 8 $9 1 At December 31, 2020, the Company had entered into real estate operating leases that had not yet commenced. The obligations associated with these leases total $280 million, of which $115 million relates to alease for Organon's corporate headquarters that will commence in March 2021 and has a lease term of 11 years. F-2010. Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property, and commercial litigation, as well as certain additionalmatters including governmental and environmental matters. In the opinion of the Company, it is unlikely that theresolution of these matters will be material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cashflows. Given the nature of the litigation discussed below and the complexities involved in these matters, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss for such matters until theCompany knows, among other factors, (i) what claims, if any, will survive dispositive motion practice, (ii) theextent of the claims, including the size of any potential class, particularly when damages are not specified or areindeterminate, (iii) how the discovery process will affect the litigation, (iv) the settlement posture of the otherparties to the litigation and (v) any other factors that may have a material effect on the litigation. The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change oradditional information becomes available. For product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual isactuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates ofclaims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable andreasonably estimable. Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency areaccrued when probable and reasonably estimable. The Company's decision to obtain insurance coverage is dependent on market conditions, including cost and availability, existing at the time such decisions are made. The Company has evaluated its risks and hasdetermined that the cost of obtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage thatis available and, as such, has no insurance for most product liabilities. Product Liability Litigation Fosamax Merck is a defendant in product liability lawsuits in the United States involving Fosamax (Fosamax Litigation). As of December 31, 2020, approximately 3,520 cases are pending against Merck in either federal orstate court. Plaintiffs in the vast majority of these cases generally allege that they sustained femur fractures and/or other bone injuries (Femur Fractures) in association with the use of Fosamax. All federal cases involving allegations of Femur Fractures have been or will be transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the District of New Jersey (Femur Fracture MDL). In the only bellwether case tried to date in theFemur Fracture MDL, Glynn v. Merck , the jury returned a verdict in Merck's favor. In addition, in June 2013, the Femur Fracture MDL court granted Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of law in the Glynn case and held that the plaintiff's failure to warn claim was preempted by federal law. In August 2013, the Femur Fracture MDL court entered an order requiring plaintiffs in the Femur Fracture MDL to show cause why those cases asserting claims for a femur fracture injury that took place prior toSeptember 14, 2010, should not be dismissed based on the court's preemption decision in the Glynn case. Pursuant to the show cause order, in March 2014, the Femur Fracture MDL court dismissed with prejudiceapproximately 650 cases on preemption grounds. Plaintiffs in approximately 515 of those cases appealed thatdecision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Third Circuit). In March 2017, the Third Circuitissued a decision reversing the Femur Fracture MDL court's preemption ruling and remanding the appealed casesback to the Femur Fracture MDL court. In May 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the Third Circuit hadincorrectly concluded that the issue of preemption should be resolved by a jury, and accordingly vacated thejudgment of the Third Circuit and remanded the proceedings back to the Third Circuit to address the issue in a F-21manner consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion. In November 2019, the Third Circuit remanded the cases back to the District Court in order to allow that court to determine in the first instance whether the plaintiffs' statelaw claims are preempted by federal law under the standards described by the Supreme Court in its opinion.Briefing on the issue is closed, and the parties await the decision of the District Court. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 970 cases were actively pending in the Femur Fracture MDL. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 2,270 cases alleging Femur Fractures have been filed in New Jersey state court and are pending in a N.J. coordinated proceeding. The parties selected an initial group of casesto be reviewed through fact discovery, and Merck has continued to select additional cases to be reviewed. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 275 cases alleging Femur Fractures have been filed and are pending in California state court. All of the Femur Fracture cases filed in California state court have beencoordinated before a single judge in Orange County, California. Additionally, there are four Femur Fracture cases pending in other state courts.Discovery is presently stayed in the Femur Fracture MDL and in the state court in California. Nexplanon/Implanon Merck is a defendant in lawsuits brought by individuals relating to the use of Implanon and Nexplanon. In the United States, as of December 31, 2020, there were two filed product liability actions involving Implanon,both of which are pending in the Northern District of Ohio. In addition, there are 55 unfiled cases alleging similarinjuries, which have been tolled under a written tolling agreement. There is one filed action related to Nexplanonin the United States seeking compensation for alleged injuries or medical bills involving complicated removals ofNexplanon. As of December 31, 2020, Merck had 21 cases pending outside the United States pertaining toinsertion and removal related events, of which 15 relate to Implanon and six relate to Nexplanon. Propecia/Proscar Merck is a defendant in product liability lawsuits in the United States involving Propecia and/or Proscar. The lawsuits were filed in various federal courts and in state court in New Jersey. The federal lawsuits were thenconsolidated for pretrial purposes in a federal multidistrict litigation in the Eastern District of New York (theMDL), and Judge Brian Cogan now presides over these matters. The matters pending in state court in New Jerseywere consolidated in Middlesex County (N.J. Coordinated Proceedings). Merck is also defending a Propeciamatter in state court in Los Angeles, California. In 2018, Merck and the Plaintiffs' Executive Committee in the MDL and the Plaintiffs' Liaison Counsel in the N.J. Coordinated Proceedings entered into an agreement to resolve the above mentioned Propecia/Proscarlawsuits for an aggregate amount of $4.3 million. The settlement was subject to certain contingencies, including95% plaintiff participation and a per plaintiff clawback if the participation rate was less than 100%. Thecontingencies were satisfied and the settlement agreement has been finalized. At December 31, 2020, fewer than10 cases remain pending in the United States. The Company is also defending 16 product liability cases outsidethe United States. Vioxx Merck Sharp & Dohme Farmaceutica Ltda. is a named defendant in product liability cases in Brazil alleging personal injury or economic loss as a result of the purchase or use of Vioxx, including two individual actions andseven putative class action proceedings. Organon will not be liable for the results of the Vioxx litigation. F-22Governmental Proceedings Merck's subsidiaries in China have received and may continue to receive inquiries regarding their operations from various Chinese governmental agencies. Some of these inquiries may be related to mattersinvolving other multinational pharmaceutical companies, as well as Chinese entities doing business with suchcompanies. Merck's policy is to cooperate with these authorities and to provide responses as appropriate. From time to time, Merck's subsidiaries receive inquiries and is the subject of preliminary investigation activities from competition and other governmental authorities in markets outside the United States. Theseauthorities may include regulators, administrative authorities, and law enforcement and other similar officials,and these preliminary investigation activities may include site visits, formal or informal requests or demands fordocuments or materials, inquiries or interviews and similar matters. Certain of these preliminary inquiries oractivities may lead to the commencement of formal proceedings. Should those proceedings be determinedadversely to the Company, monetary fines and/or remedial undertakings may be required. Commercial and Other Litigation Zetia Antitrust Litigation Merck, MSD, Schering Corporation and MSP Singapore Company LLC (collectively, the Merck Defendants) are defendants in putative class action and opt-out lawsuits filed in 2018 on behalf of direct andindirect purchasers of Zetia alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws, as well as other state statutory and common law causes of action. The cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a federalmultidistrict litigation before Judge Rebecca Beach Smith in the Eastern District of Virginia. In December 2018,the court denied the Merck Defendants' motions to dismiss or stay the direct purchaser putative class actionspending bilateral arbitration. In August 2019, the district court adopted in full the report and recommendation ofthe magistrate judge with respect to the Merck Defendants' motions to dismiss on non-arbitration issues, therebygranting in part and denying in part Merck Defendants' motions to dismiss. In addition, in June 2019, therepresentatives of the putative direct purchaser class filed an amended complaint and, in August 2019, retaileropt-out plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In December 2019, the district court granted the MerckDefendants' motion to dismiss to the extent the motion sought dismissal of claims for overcharges paid byentities that purchased generic ezetimibe from Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Par Pharmaceutical) and dismissed anyclaims for such overcharges. In November 2019, the direct purchaser plaintiffs and the indirect purchaserplaintiffs filed motions for class certification. On August 21, 2020, the district court granted in part the directpurchasers' motion for class certification and certified a class of 35 direct purchasers, and on November 2, 2020,the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted the Merck Defendants' motion for permission to appealthe district court's order. Also, on August 14, 2020, the magistrate judge recommended that the court grant themotion for class certification filed by the putative indirect purchaser class. The Merck Defendants objected tothis report and recommendation and are awaiting a decision from the district court. On August 10, 2020, the Merck Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and other motions, and plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment, and other motions. Those motions are now fully briefed,and the court will likely hold a hearing on the competing motions. Trial in this matter has been adjourned. On September 4, 2020, United Healthcare Services, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota against Merck and others (the UHC Action). The UHC Action makes similarallegations as those made in the Zetia class action. On September 23, 2020, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the case to the Eastern District of Virginia to proceed with the multidistrictZetia litigation already in progress. On December 11, 2020, Humana Inc. filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Francisco, against Merck and others, alleging defendants violated state antitrust laws in multiple states.Also, on December 11, 2020, Centene Corporation and others filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of F-23California, County of San Francisco, against the same defendants as Humana. Both lawsuits allege similar anticompetitive acts to those alleged in the Zetia class action. Organon will not be liable for the results of the Zetia Antitrust litigation. Patent Litigation From time to time, generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products file abbreviated New Drug Applications (NDAs) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking to market generic forms of theCompany's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned by the Company. To protect its patentrights, the Company may file patent infringement lawsuits against such generic companies. Similar lawsuitsdefending the Company's patent rights may exist in other countries. The Company intends to vigorously defendits patents, which it believes are valid, against infringement by companies attempting to market products prior tothe expiration of such patents. As with any litigation, there can be no assurance of the outcomes, which, ifadverse, could result in significantly shortened periods of exclusivity for these products, potential payment ofdamages and legal fees, and, with respect to products acquired through acquisitions, potentially significantintangible asset impairment charges. Nasonex \u2014Nasonex lost market exclusivity in the United States in 2016. Prior to that, in April 2015, Merck filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (Apotex) in respect of Apotex'smarketed product that Merck believed was infringing. In January 2018, Merck and Apotex settled this matterwith Apotex agreeing to pay $115 million plus certain other consideration. Nexplanon \u2014 In June 2017, Microspherix LLC (Microspherix) sued the Company in the U.S District Court for the District of New Jersey asserting that the manufacturing, use, sale and importation of Nexplanon infringed several of Microspherix's patents that claim radio-opaque, implantable drug delivery devices. Microspherix isclaiming damages from September 2014 until those patents expire in May 2021. The Company brought Inter Partes Review (IPR) proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and successfully stayed the district court action. The USPTO invalidated some, but not all, of the claims asserted against theCompany. The Company appealed the decisions finding claims valid, and the Court of Appeals for the FederalCircuit affirmed the USPTO's decisions. The matter is no longer stayed in the district court, and the Company iscurrently litigating the invalidity and non-infringement of the remaining asserted claims. Other Litigation There are various other pending legal proceedings involving the Company, principally product liability and intellectual property lawsuits. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such proceedings, in the opinionof the Company, either the likelihood of loss is remote or any reasonably possible loss associated with theresolution of such proceedings is not expected to be material to the Company's financial condition, results ofoperations or cash flows either individually or in the aggregate. Legal Defense Reserves Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legaldefense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company'slegal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being broughtagainst the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regardinganticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. Theamount of legal defense reserves as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 of approximately $35 million and$40 million, respectively, represents the Company's best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be F-24incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurredby the Company. The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of theassociated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factorsset forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so. Environmental Matters In management's opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $24 million and $21 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019,respectively. These liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and willbe paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily overthe next 15 years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or theultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that maybe incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed approximately $20 million in the aggregate.Management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on theCompany's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity for any year. 11. Share-Based Compensation Plans Merck has share-based compensation plans under which it grants restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) to certain management level employees. In addition, employees andnon-employee directors of Merck may be granted options to purchase shares of Merck's common stock at the fairmarket value at the time of grant. For the periods presented, since the Company operated together with other Merck businesses, the Company has determined that it is not practicable to specifically identify share-based compensation expense for Merckawards related to the Company's employees. Accordingly, such expense, as well as expense related to Merck'scorporate and shared functional employees, has been allocated to the Company on a proportional cost allocationmethod, primarily based on revenue or directly identifiable costs, depending on the employee's function. Theamounts presented are not necessarily indicative of future awards and do not necessarily reflect the costs that theCompany would have incurred as an independent company for the periods presented. Total allocated share-based compensation expense and the associated income tax benefits recognized by the Company in the combined statement of income are as follows: Years Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Share-based compensation expense ............................ $54 $52 $56 Income tax benefits ........................................ 11 11 12 12. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans The Organon Entities and the Transferring Entities are the plan sponsors for certain defined benefit pension plans and these combined financial statements reflect the periodic benefit costs and funded status of such plans.The Company uses December 31 as the year-end measurement date for these plans. Further, Merck has defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees in the United States and in certain of its international subsidiaries. Merck also provides medical benefits, principally to its eligible U.S.retirees and their dependents through its other postretirement benefit plans. Liabilities associated with these plansare not reflected in the Company's combined balance sheet. The combined statement of income includes expenseallocations for these benefits which were determined using a proportional allocation method. Total benefit planexpense allocated to the Company amounted to $55 million, $29 million and $42 million for the years ended2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. F-25The following tables provide disclosures for pension plans of the Organon Entities and the Transferring Entities: Net Periodic Benefit Cost The net periodic benefit (credit) cost for pension plans consisted of the following components: Years Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Service cost ........................................... $3 6 $2 8 $3 0 Interest cost ........................................... 35 51 51 Expected return on plan assets ............................

(55) (59) F-26During the fourth quarter of 2020, (i) certain Transferring Entities transferred net pension assets of $61 million, reflecting plan assets of $2.7 billion and benefit obligations of $2.6 billion from the Merck RetainedProducts business to Merck affiliates related to plan participants that will remain with the Parent, and (ii)$3 million of benefit obligations were contributed by Merck affiliates to the Organon Entities related toparticipants of Merck sponsored plans that were transferred to the Company in 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $429 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. The decline in 2020 resulted primarily from the transfers noted above. Information related to the funded status of selected pension plans at December 31 is as follows: 2020 2019 Pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets Projected benefit obligation ......................... $491 $1,178 Fair value of plan assets ............................ 435 1,118 Pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets Accumulated benefit obligation ...................... $5 4 $4 5 Fair value of plan assets ............................ 38 34 Plan Assets Entities are required to use a fair value hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs used tomeasure fair value with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Level 1 \u2014 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 \u2014 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data forsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; Level 3 \u2014 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The Level 3 assets are those whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similartechniques with significant unobservable inputs, as well as instruments for which the determination of fairvalue requires significant judgment or estimation. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of theinstrument. F-27The fair values of the Company's pension plan assets at December 31 by asset category are as follows: Fair Value Measurements Using Fair Value Measurements Using Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents .............. $\u2014 $\u2014 $\u2014 $\u2014 $4 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 4 Investment funds Developed markets equities ......... \u2014 198 \u2014 198 \u2014 1,332 \u2014 1,332 Government and agency obligations . . \u2014 198 \u2014 198 \u2014 1,018 \u2014 1,018 Emerging markets equities .......... \u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014 \u20149 6 \u20149 6 Fixed income securities Government and agency obligations . . \u20145 \u2014 5 \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014 Other investments Insurance contracts ................ \u20143 4 \u2014 3 4 \u2014 32 382 414 Other ........................... \u20141 \u2014 1 \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014 Plan assets at fair $\u2014 $436 $\u2014 $436 $ 4 targeted investment portfolio for the Company's pension plans that are sponsored outside the United States varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. The table below provides a summary of the changes in fair value of all financial assets measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the Company's pension plan assets: 2020 2019 Insurance ContractsInsurance Contracts Balance January 1 ................................ $ 382 $357 Actual return on plan assets still held at December 31 .... \u2014 42 Purchases and sales, net ............................ \u2014 (17) Transfer of plan assets to Merck affiliates ..............

Expected Benefit Payments Expected benefit payments are payments are based on the sameassumptions used to measure the benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service. Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Net loss amounts reflect differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Net loss amounts in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into netperiodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees.

(3) (2) (3) $1 5 $7 $ 1 2 Actuarial Assumptions The Company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. The weighted average assumptions used in determining pension plan information are as follows: December 31 2020 2019 2018 Net periodic benefit cost Discount rate ............................................ 1.75% 2.51% 2.36% Expected rate of return on 5.40% Salary growth rate ........................................ 2.68% 3.03% 3.13% The discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to paythe benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. The expected rate of return represents theaverage rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligationare to be paid and is determined on a plan basis. The expected rate of return for each plan is developedconsidering long-term historical returns data, current market conditions, and actual returns on the plan assets.Using this reference information, the long-term return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected return for each plan's target portfolio is developed according to the allocation among thoseinvestment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management asappropriate. Savings Plan Merck also maintains defined contribution savings plans in the United States, which the Company participates in. The Company matches a percentage of employees' contributions. The amount allocated for totalemployer contributions in 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $18 million, $18 million, and $21 million, respectively,which is recognized as an expense in the combined statement of income. 13. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net, consisted of: Years Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Interest income ......................................... $(16) $(19) $ (21) Interest expense ......................................... 6 66 Exchange losses ......................................... 70 64 60 Net periodic defined benefit plan credit other than service cost ....

Taxes on Income For purposes of these combined financial statements, income taxes have been calculated as if the Company filed income tax returns on a standalone basis. The Company believes the assumptions supporting its allocationand presentation of income taxes on a separate return basis are reasonable. One of these assumptions is that theCompany on a standalone basis will not benefit from certain tax incentives that historically benefited Merck.However, the taxes recognized in the combined financial statements and resulting effective tax rates may not bereflective of the taxes that the Company expects to recognize in the future as a standalone entity. A reconciliation between the effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Amount Tax Rate Amount Tax Rate Amount Tax Rate U.S. statutory rate applied to income before taxes ..... $563 21.0% $ 747 21.0% $ 573 21.0% Differential arising from: Foreign earnings ...........................

The Company's remaining transition tax liability under the TCJA that was enacted in 2017, which has been reduced by payments, was $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of theseamounts, $161 million is included in Income Taxes Payable at both December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the remainder of $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities . As a result of the TCJA, the Company has made a determination it is no longer indefinitely reinvested with respect to its previously taxed undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries andprovided for a deferred tax liability for withholding taxes due upon future remittances, net of certain foreignincome tax credits. The Company has continued to accrue for income taxes that will be due upon futureremittances of undistributed foreign earnings in the amount of $79 million and $32 million as of December 31,2020 and 2019, respectively, for withholding taxes due and taxable currency gains and losses, net of certainforeign income tax credits. The tax effects of foreign earnings in the tax rate reconciliation above primarily reflect the effects of operations in jurisdictions with different tax rates than the United States thereby yielding a favorable impact onthe effective tax rate compared with the U.S. statutory rate of 21%. Towards the end of 2020, a new reduced taxrate arrangement was agreed to in Switzerland for a newly active legal entity.

(81) (86) Total deferred taxes ................................. $126 $ 89 $122 $ 64 Net deferred income taxes ............................ $3 7 $5 8 Recognized as: Deferred Taxes .......................... $139 The Company has recognized $67 million and $78 million of deferred taxes on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in Brazil as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Valuation allowances of$81 million and $86 million have been established on these foreign NOL carryforwards and other deferred taxassets in Brazil as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Company has no NOLcarryforwards relating to U.S. jurisdictions. Income taxes paid in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $391 million, $920 million and $678 million, respectively.As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company deferred the income tax consequences resulting from intra-entity transfers of inventory totaling $421 million and $657 million, respectively. These amounts arereflected in Other current assets. F-31A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Balance January 1 ...................................... $213 $ 619 $659 Additions related to current year tax positions ................ 15 12 29 Additions related to prior year tax positions .................. 23 43 Reductions for tax positions of prior years(1)................. (3) (274) (6) Settlements(1).......................................... (19) (140) (49) Lapse of statute of limitations ............................. (10) (8) (17) Balance December 31 ................................... $219 $ 213 $619 (1) Amounts in 2019 reflect the settlement with the IRS discussed below. If the Company were to recognize the unrecognized tax benefits of $219 million at December 31, 2020, the income tax provision would reflect a favorable net impact of $211 million. The Company is part of Merck's consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as separate and combined Merck income tax returns in numerous state and international jurisdictions. Merck is underexamination by numerous tax authorities in various jurisdictions globally. The Company believes that it isreasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 could decreaseby up to $52 million in the next 12 months as a result of various audit closures, settlements or the expiration ofthe statute of limitations. The ultimate finalization of Merck's examinations with relevant taxing authorities caninclude formal administrative and legal proceedings, which could have a significant impact on the timing of thereversal of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes that its reserves for uncertain tax positions areadequate to cover existing risks or exposures. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions amounted to an expense (benefit) of $12 million in 2020, $(48) million in 2019 and $21 million in 2018. These amounts reflect the beneficial impactsof various tax settlements, including those discussed below. Liabilities for accrued interest and penalties were$68 million and $61 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2019, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its examinations of Merck's 2012-2014 U.S. federal income tax returns. As a result, the Company reflected a payment of $142 million in the combined financialstatements. The Company's reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the years under examination exceeded theadjustments relating to this examination period and therefore the Company recorded a net tax benefit of$258 million in 2019. This net benefit reflects reductions in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for taxpositions relating to the years that were under examination, partially offset by additional reserves for taxpositions not previously reserved for. The IRS is currently conducting examinations of Merck's tax returns for the years 2015 and 2016. In addition, various state and foreign tax examinations are in progress and for these jurisdictions, Merck's incometax returns are open for examination for the period 2003 through 2020. F-3215.

Segment Reporting The Company's operations are principally managed on a products basis and include two operating segments, the Organon Products segment and the Merck Retained Products segment. The Organon Products segment isengaged in developing and delivering innovative health solutions through its portfolio of prescription therapieswithin women's health, biosimilars and established brands. The Merck Retained Products segment reflects theresults of the Transferring Entities with respect to other Merck products that will be retained by the Parent. Forcertain Transferring Entities that distributed the Merck Retained Products business to the Parent in the fourthquarter of 2020, the Merck Retained Products segment reflects results up to the date of distribution.

Related Party Disclosures The Company has not historically operated as a standalone business and the combined financial statements are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Merck. The followingdisclosure summarizes activity between the Company and Merck, including the affiliates of Merck that are notpart of the planned spin-off. Cost Allocations from Merck Merck provides significant corporate, manufacturing, selling, marketing, administrative, research services and resources to the Company. Some of these services will continue to be provided by Merck to the Company ona temporary basis after the separation is completed under a transition services agreement. The combined financialstatements reflect an allocation of these costs. See Note 2 for a discussion of these costs and the methodologyused to allocate them. These allocations are reflected in the combined statement of income as follows: Years Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Cost of sales ....................................... $ 466 $ 528 $ 453 Selling, general and administrative ..................... 765 837 879 Research and development ............................ 153 200 251 $1,384 $1,565 $1,583 Management believes these cost allocations are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to, or the benefit derived by, the Company during the periods presented. The allocations may not,however, be indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had the Company operated as a F-36standalone public company. Actual costs that may have been incurred if the Company had been a standalone public company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, whetherfunctions were outsourced or performed by Company's employees, and strategic decisions made in areas such asmanufacturing, selling and marketing, research and development, information technology and infrastructure.

We note your disclosure on page 24 that in March 2021 Merck announced the signing of a definitive agreement for you to acquir e Alydia Health, which is a commercial-stage medical de vice company Please revise you r discussion of subsequent events to disclose this transaction. Please also tell us whether this transaction has an impact on your pro forma financial informat ion. In this regard , we note that a Merck news re lease dated March 30, 2021 indi cates that a portion of the acquisition consideration will be paid prior to completion of the spin-off. Response 1 We advise the Staff that the Amended Regi stration Statement has been revised on page s 16-17 and page F-38 to provide additional disclosure in response to the Staff's comm ent. We also advise th e Staff that the unaudited pro forma conde nsed combined financial statements of the Company included in the Amended Re gistration Statement gi ve effect to the Separati on and related adjustments in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The Company considered whether the proposed acquisition of Alydia H ealth is directly attributable to the Separation, such that an adjustment to the pro forma financial informati on might be required. The Company de termined that the proposed acquisi tion is not directly attributabl e to the Separation because the Separation does not depend on th e proposed acquisition and, a lthough the acquisition is expe cted to be consummated after the Separation, such consummation depends on customary closi ng conditions unrelated to the Separation. Th e Company also determined that the pro posed acquisition is not a significant acquisition to Organon under Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and, accordingly, no pro forma financial informat ion for the proposed acquisition is require d under Article 11.
