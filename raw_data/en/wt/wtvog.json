Why Choose Lakeland Paints VOCs and Chemical Free Paint VOCs are chemicals, seriously bad for your health & need to be avoided wherever possible - and Chemical free paint is the ideal option. A Chemical Free Home needs Chemical Free Paint VOCs - Volatile Organic Chemicals are in many household products - including paints - and cause Danish Painters Syndrome, Sick Building Syndrome, asthma, allergies & cancer.

And I have done this demonstration half a dozen times or more - for Lancashire + Cumbria Trading Standards, the ASA, HSE and others. So why not ask the others to do the same ? You never know - they just might ! Lakeland -V- The Rest = read the marketing carefully and you'll see that other brands are surprisingly unremarkable (No USP) - don't believe us?

[CLICK HERE TO SEE WHO USES LAKELAND PAINTS](/our-clients) \" Ordered yesterday here at 09:30 today DM Why Choose Lakeland Paints Why buy Ecos Organic Paint - as opposed to any other environmentally friendly paint ? Because other paint is just LOW VOC - maybe 1-2% VOC - with harmful, smelly VOCs, solvents & chemicals - just with different branding & usually made by just two or three big EU producers with NO USP - Yes - NO Unique Selling Point. But Lakeland Paint is at least 7000x Purer than this - and often 12,000x purer ! Ecos is Super Breathable and uses 3x as much pigment as most others - 24% -v- 8% - meaning that often you can finish that job with just One Coat of our Eco Friendly non toxic paint. All are totally VOC-Free, Solvent Free and Non-yellowing - Forever ! Other paint brands = Read their claims carefully and you'll see that other brands are surprisingly unremarkable - (with No USP) and this is why the new ones arrive in a flurry of press-releases, fizzle out and die - because they have [nothing new to offer](/brand-marketing). Don't believe us? [Read it Here >](/brand-marketing) Lakeland Paints are unique, with 0.0% VOC and are now in our 32nd year, selling to 72 countries - but like other top brands, Quality never comes cheap - it can't. And this is often how you can spot a brand in trouble - when you see it on supermarket shelves - because it costs ~50% just to be there - so guess how they make up that 50% loss?

Sustainable Architecture - Green Architecture - Sustainable Architecture - Green Building - Eco Architects in the 21st century When designing a new build, any Eco architect will naturally plan from the outset to use the most environmentally friendly, sustainable and non-polluting materials available. Air quality is key. And this is where Green Architecture - Sustainable Architecture - Green Building - needs emphasis. That these same Eco Architects often don't know the sources of indoor pollution - and that the vast majority of it is due to the paint, even the \"LOW VOC\" environmentally friendly paint, varnish & glues used in any new build.

ALL Lakeland Paints are Super Breathable paint anyway - we don't specifically engineer them to be that way, they just ARE breathable paints. All Breathable Paint is rated by its Sd value (Steam Diffusion value) or MVT and a breathable paint is one that lets moisture to get through it quickly - so a lower Sd means a more breathable paint. Standard paints meanwhile are often higher than Sd3.0 = not great ! Breathable Paint with an Sd of 0.1 or less is a good breathable paint suitable for all purposes.
