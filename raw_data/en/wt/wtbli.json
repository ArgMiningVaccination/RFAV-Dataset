Notice. huge traffic generated by the posting of [Stefan Grimm's last email](http://www.dcscience.net/2014/12/01/publish-and-perish-at-imperial-college-london-the-death-of-stefan-grimm) brought down the server for an hour or two on December 3rd. Since it went up at 18.30 on 2nd December, it has been getting a hit every second or so. This has been cured by introduction of a caching system, but this had the side effect of breaking links to most of the pictures and documents on this blog. I now have to correct the links manually on 386 posts and 17 pages. This will take a while to complete. Truly gobsmacked to find this blog got first prize at the [Good Thinking Society UK science blog event](http://goodthinkingsociety.org/winners-of-2012-uk-science-blog-prize/). It was shared with PhD student, Suzi Gage [@soozaphone](http://www.scilogs.com/sifting_the_evidence/). We must have been the youngest and the oldest entrants.

A post in 2006, now removed, criticised the organisation CancerActive, for selling D-mannose and Chloralla with the suggestion that they might help people with cancer. In May 2012, I added to that post a quotation from one of several authors who claimed that there was an a priori case for investigating the relationship between the business and the charitable activities of CancerActive. Mr Woollams then threated to sue me for defamation. As a consequence, the original post has been removed and I am required to publish the following apology. It's better than destitution. 7 November 2013. My agreement with Chris Woollams' lawyers was that the apology should be shown for 6 months. It has now been up for almost 11 months. I am, therefore, removing it. It was, of course, bullied out of me by the threat of destitution. Now, thanks in part to people like him, we have a new Defamation Act. This sort of thing should be much less common in the future.

This WordPress blog continues, in a new format, the original [DC's IMPROBABLE SCIENCE Page](http://www.dcscience.net/improbable.html). Older entries from there are being transferred here as time allows. This blog now incorporates 'DC's goodscience', which was centred on university politics, in particular, how science should be organised to get the best results, and the invidious rise of management bollocks and corporatisation. It was started as a vehicle for an extended version of an article that I wrote for the Times Higher Education Supplement, [HOW TO GET GOOD SCIENCE](http://dcscience.net/?p=182). This extended version has now been printed in full in the Physiology News, 69, 12 - 14, 2007 [ [download the pdf version](http://dcscience.net/colquhoun-goodscience-jp-version-2007.pdf)].
