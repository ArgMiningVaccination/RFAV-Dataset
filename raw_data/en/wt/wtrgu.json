The development process involved the identification of proposed competencies by an inter-provincial committee of experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practiti oners and educators, working with a consultant. The com mittee utilized source documents from various countries describing TCM education and practice, as well as the expertise of i ts members. This was followed by surveys of practitioners in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec and Newfoundland & Labrador, to determine the extent to which the propo sed competencies were deemed by practitioners to be impo rtant, frequently-used and appropriate as entry-level requir ements. The Occupational Competencies are subject to the approval of the regulatory authority in each jurisdiction. Th ey are intended to identify the job tasks in which entry-level TCM practitioners and acupuncturists should be proficient, in order to provide safe, effective and ethical practice. The Alliance is currently developing sub-competencies and performance indicators for the Occupational Competencies, which will enable the creation of a pan-Canadian reg istration examination, as well a framework of learning outcomes to be expected of education programs preparatory to entry-t o-practice. The members of the Alliance gratefully acknowledge the Government of Canada, under the Foreign Credential Recognition Program, for funding this project in partn ership with BC's Ministry of Advanced Education and La bour Market Development. OCCUPATIONAL COMPETENCIES AND ENTRY-LEVEL PROFICIEN CY Entry-Level Occupational Competencies for the Pract ice of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Canada Copyright \u00a9 2009 Canadian Alliance of Regulatory Bo dies for TCM Practitioners and Acupuncturists 3 An Occupational Competency is defined as A job task that can be carried out to a specified level of proficiency The following statement defines Entry-Level Proficien cy When presented with routine situations, the entry-level practitioner applies each relevant competency in a manner consistent with generally accepted standards in the professi on, without supervision or direction, and within a reasonable timeframe. The practitioner selects and ap plies competencies in an informed manner. The practitioner anticipates what outcomes to expect in a gi ven situation, and responds appropriately. The entry-level practitioner recognizes unusual, difficul t to resolve and complex situations which may be beyond hi s / her capacity. The practitioner takes appropriate and e thical steps to address these situations, which may include seeking consultation or supervision, reviewing research lite rature, or referring the client. Development beyond entry-level proficiency is to be en couraged. This involves Advanced Skills, Expert Skills and Leadership: The practitioner working at an advanced level has extensi ve experience and exhibits a more in-depth understanding of clinical situations. Decision-making and treatment flow more efficiently because the practitio ner readily perceives which aspects of a presenting situation a re the important ones, and how they should be addressed. The practitioner working at an advanced level deals effectively with most unusual, difficult to resolve and complex situations. Beyond the advanced level, practitioners may be recognize d as experts or leaders in their fields, who contribute to the advancement of the profession.
