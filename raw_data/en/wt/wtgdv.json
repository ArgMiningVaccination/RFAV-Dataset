Naturopathic medicine is a practice of healthcare focused on treating the whole person using holistic modalities. When I say, \"treat the whole person\",\" I'm referring to looking at the individual beyond their dis-ease. The principles of naturopathic medicine include: First do no harm Fundamental of course. Healing power of nature Naturopathic doctors recognize that a lot of the time, if we create an environment conducive for the body to heal, it will. The body is not medication deficient and while pharmacotherapy is a vital practice of medicine, there are many times where natural therapies are less invasive and more appropriate options. Some of these therapies may include hydrotherapy, botanical medicine, energy work and nutrition. Identify and treat the cause The point is not to simply suppress symptoms, though symptom management is important, but to investigate the root cause so optimum health can be achieved. Doctor as teacher A therapeutic relationship between doctor and patient can't be achieved unless the patient and doctor work as a team both with the understanding of what's going on so the health decisions being made come from a place of empowerment. Treat the whole person The mind and body can't be separated. Oftentimes anxiety has nothing to do with neurotransmitters, and everything to do with underlying physiology. Prevention It's easier to prevent health issues whenever possible and there's no better time than now. What's the difference between naturopathic and allopathic medicine? Both MDs and NDs must complete four years of medical school with credited hours in anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, etc. The primary difference is the focus of the education. MDs have a stronger focus on pharmacology and NDs favor natural approaches like nutrition (\"Let food be thy medicine\" - Hippocrates). While MDs and NDs may practice differently, their modalities work together harmoniously. For example, if someone needed surgery, a medical surgeon would be the physician of choice, and an ND could be an appropriate choice to support post-surgical healing. What about integrative medicine? Integrative medicine is a term used to describe physicians who combine the best of natural medicine and allopathic medicine. "}
