Anthroposophic medicine integrates conventional medicine with an anthropo - sophic 1 perception of the human being. It starts with a conventional diagnosis, but includes in its assessment of the patient the imbalances of the body and the mental and spiritual dimensions. It takes a holistic approach to health and offers specific therapies enhanced according to anthroposophic principles. It uses both conventional and anthroposophic medicinal products. Both the treatment appro - ach and the use and selection of medicinal products and other therapies are highly individualised, with the intention of bringing about a 'process of develop - ment' within the patient, reinforcing the patient's natural self-healing ability. Anthroposophic medicine was developed in 1920 by Rudolf Steiner and the medical doctor, Ita Wegman, and is now widely accepted in European society. It is used in both primary and clinical care in over twenty EU Member States, and offers a high degree of patient satisfaction. Research shows that the anthroposophic medical approach is safe and effective and leads to only sparing use of antibiotics; medical insurance policies show mi - nimal medication costs. Anthroposophic medicine, as an integrated complemen - tary medical system, is proven to be both safe and effective and offers consider - able added value to the health systems in the EU. 1 Anthroposophy is defined in the Webster Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language as 'A philosophy based on the teaching of Rudolf Steiner (1861 -1925) which maintains that, by virtue of a prescribed method of self- discipline, cognitional experience of the spiritual world can be achieved' .

They are produced according to a homeopathic manufacturing method described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in absence thereof, in an official pharma - copoeia. They can also be produced according to a specific anthroposo - phic manufacturing method. They are manufactured according to the standards of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and their quality is controlled by the criteria and parameters of official pharmacopoeias. Although anthroposophic medicinal products are regulated directly within the national health systems in Germany and Switzerland, the EU regulatory framework for medicinal products includes only those products produced according to a homeopathic manufacturing method. This raises a number of difficulties as regards their registration as medi - cinal products in countries across Europe. Anthroposophic medicine will only be able to thrive if the EU regulatory framework for medicinal products for human use recognises anthroposophic medicinal products as their own category of medicinal products; stipulates adequate procedures for the authorisation or registration of the different categories of medicinal products; adequately recognises the specific manufacturing methods of these products; accepts their long-established safety record; takes into account that these are low-profit products with limited economic resources. \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 5 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine As an \" integrative medicine\", anthroposophic medicine combines in an multi-disciplinary approach conventional interventions with a number of specific therapeutic treatments and anthroposophic medication.

The principal aspects of an anthroposophic medical approach to promoting health and pre - venting and curing illness are: it is an integrative medicine that builds on the well-established facts and methods of diagnosis and treatment of conventional medicine but extends it with a holistic approach; it is based on a holistic concept of health and so-called salutogenesis 3; this leads to effective strategies for disease prevention through educati- on and lifestyle programmes and the development of self-management in the prevention of and coping with disease; it regards a pathological condition as the culmination of a longer pro-cess; the analysis of the process that leads to a pathological condition is of major importance in assessing the specific situation of the individual patient in his or her biography 4 and for the subsequent diagnosis and therapeutic process; it both assesses the situation of the patient's illness and takes account of the patient's relationship with his or her social and natural environ-ment; it includes a mental and spiritual 5 dimension in its assessment of the imbalances of the individual patient; treatment for this therapeutic approach is seen as a process rather than a switch from a condition of illness to a condition of health; the treatment approach is highly individualised, with a comprehensive and individual analysis; this corresponds to individualised use and ap-plication of both anthroposophic and conventional medicinal products and other therapies; all therapeutic treatments are aimed at stimulating the ability of the patient to self-heal, the so-called salutogenetic principle; emphasis is on an optimal multi-disciplinary approach, adjusting the application of anthroposophic medicinal products and different anthro- 2 Anthroposophy is defined in the Webster Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language as 'A philosophy based on the teaching of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) which maintains that, by virtue of a prescribed method of self- discipline, cognitional experience of the spiritual world can be achieved' .

See Glossary 4 In anthroposophic medicine the term 'biography' refers to the development of the individual in a lifetime from childhood to maturity and thereafter to physical decay until death. See Glossary 5 The anthroposophic understanding of the spiritual dimension is that each human being is a unique immortal individual. This individual undergoes a lifelong process of development in illness and in health.

Anthroposophic medicine is practised by physicians with a dual training; they have to be fully qualified as a physician first and then to successfully complete a further three years of training as an anthroposophic doctor. It is practised in multi-disciplinary therapeutic settings or clinics and anthroposophic physicians are active in general practice as well as in all specialist fields of medicine. Anthroposophic medicine is a medical system offering sustainable and cost-effective solutions for public health. 6, 7 The diagnostic process In anthroposophic medicine, the diagnostic process integrates specific anthroposophic diagnostic skills and disciplines into a conventional me - dical diagnosis, for a holistic treatment of the individual patient. It pays particular attention to salutogenetic aspects, the mental and spiritual dimension of the patient, and his or her interaction with the physiologi - cal aspects of the body (see Chapter 4). 6 See National Health Service figures of general practitioner practice in Stroud, UK 7 Kooreman P., Baars E.W.

As an integrative medicine, anthroposophic medicine combines appropriate conventional and anthroposophic medical interventions. The anthroposophic medical approach includes the following characteristics: individualised anthroposophic medication with anthroposophic me-dicinal products designed and produced in accordance with pharma - copoeia standards; notably, 25% of total anthroposophic medicine prescriptions are injections; these are of particular importance in acute and severe medical situations such as in hospitals; anthroposophic treatments for external use include compresses, hydrotherapy, medical washes, medicinal baths (whole body and foot bath), rhythmical massage therapy (with oil or ointment) and inhalations performed with specific anthroposophic medicine techniques; nursing, physiotherapy and rhythmical massage therapy , dietetics, eurythmy therapy (see Chapter 2 and Annex 1), therapeutic arts (music, drawing and painting, sculpture, speech) (see Chapter 2 and Annex 1), psychotherapy and further anthroposophic therapeutic and life-style approaches; 8 conventional medical intervention in diagnosis and, where appropri - ate, treatment of acute and chronic diseases, for example in the dia-gnosis and treatment of severe conditions, intensive care, surgery, endoscopies, vascular catheterisation etc. the input and advice of specialised anthroposophic therapists in multi-disciplinary health care settings, in order to select the most appropriate treatment; the treatment approach is agreed in close discussion with the patient (informed consent). 8 It is possible for all health professions to be enhanced by further anthroposophic training.Anthroposophic clinic and public hospital - 'Filderklinik', Filderstadt, Germany1.2.1 \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 1 1 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine Disease prevention and lifestyle A holistic anthroposophic medicine approach is based on a particular concept of health and disease. Health is seen as the process of integra - tion of physiological, mental and spiritual activities, which can be highly influenced by education, lifestyle and self-management. Anthroposophic medicine focuses on how to keep people healthy rather than on why they fall ill. Physicians and therapists empower their patients to take responsibility for their personal health and well-being. Anthroposophic medicine promotes the individual developmental processes of the human being. Developing self-management - physio - logical, mental, cognitive and spiritual - is seen as a key to becoming strong and healthy. Nutrition In addition to the general promotion of good nutrition, anthroposophic medicine lifestyle programmes encourage organically-produced (biody - namic) 9 foods. Smoking and drugs Anthroposophic medicine discourages the use of tobacco or too much alcohol and disapproves of the use of drugs. There are some very effec - tive anthroposophic medicine drug addiction rehabilitation program - mes. 10 Physical exercise As well as the general promotion of physical exercise, anthroposophic medicine has developed a special eurythmic movement therapy , which creates a link between the body's external movements and the inner mental and healing forces of the human organism. Education The educational approach of anthroposophic nurseries and Waldorf schools supports the development of the 'inner clock' of natural rhyth - ms of the human body. Children are encouraged to develop their own creativity before they are subjected to the influence of multimedia. 9 See http://www.demeter.net 10 Sieben Anthroposophic Medicine 12 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved Technical support, TV and computer games are integrated carefully and in an age-appropriate way. Antibiotics and medication Anthroposophic medicine strives, wherever possible, to support the pa - tient's own self-healing abilities, using medication only when necessary and appropriate. For example, the use of antibiotics has always been restricted, especially in childhood, even before professional standard guidelines recommended such limitations. Recent evidence underpins the knowledge that therapies which suppress fever in children deregula - te the immune system. 11 In anthroposophic medicine, such interventions are used only if the self-healing processes are too weak. Where possible, fever is not suppressed but supported with anthroposophic medicines and compresses. Research shows that the anthroposophic approach to medicine leads to only sparing use of antibiotics. 12, 13 Prevention of mental disorders Self-management contributes to self-healing. This is reflected in the lifelong capacity of a human being to learn and in the way in which an individual seeks to make sense of his or her own biography . 11 Kluger M.J., Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1998 Sep 29; 856:224 -33, Role of fever in disease, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb08329.x/abstract; Richard Beasley, the Lancet Vol 372 September 20, 2008, Association between paracetamol use in infancy and childhood, and risk of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in children aged 6 -7 years; Prof. Dr. A.

Anthroposophic medicine offers strategies and guidelines for handling mental difficulties and accessing inner spiritual forces to pre-vent these. This is important in the prevention of depression, aggression and anxiety. Research Anthroposophic medicine has always been a science-based medical system. Both basic descriptive and clinical research are pillars of eviden - ce for anthroposophic medical treatment. As is true for all medicine, the methodological approach has evolved over time, from anecdotal case reports and simply-designed retrospective documentation and cohort studies to the most sophisticated prospective-controlled study designs including randomised controlled trials. Today anthroposophic medicine uses the full spectrum of study designs. Anthroposophic medicine is a coherent and continuously developing scientific medical system, and so modern study designs are used not only to collect and prove empirical data, but also to verify new the - rapeutic concepts in clinical practice. The concept of cognition-based medicine (CBM) 14, a scientific approach for evaluating the effectiveness of therapeutic procedures in single case settings, has been developed within anthroposophic medicine. There are currently several research institutes and many co-operative projects between research institutes 15 and universities in several EU Member States which work on basic rese - arch in methodology, and on experimental and observational studies in the field of anthroposophic medicine. 16 It is also taught at universities in Austria, Germany, Holland, Italy, Latvia, Spain and Switzerland.17 A large number of research studies establish and analyse the use and effectiveness of anthroposophic medicinal products and anthropo - sophic therapies. An overview of recent research results in anthropo - sophic medicine can be found in the reviews of Kienle et al 200618 and Kienle et al 201119 (see Annexes 5 14 Kiene H., von Sch\u00f6n-Angerer T.: Single-Case Causalitiy Assessment as a Basis for Clinical Judgment.

The adverse effects are documented by their producers as required by the European Medicines Agency. All anthroposophic me-dicinal products are produced according to Good Manufacture Practice (GMP). An innovative electronic pharmacovigilance system has been established by a network of general practitioners in anthroposophic medicine as a model of best practice in recent years ( see Annex 5). Added value and cost-effectiveness A detailed cost analysis of the anthroposophic medicine approach to treatment should compare the cost of conventional and anthroposophic medicine therapies, in-patient hospital and rehabilitation treatment, and the economic impact of number of days taken off work. A number of studies show a cost-reduction in relation to the duration of the tre - atment and cost savings, partly due to lower drug costs, fewer specialist referrals, and fewer hospital days and admissions. 20, 21 This is particu- larly relevant with respect to the treatment of chronic disease. Medical insurance policies show minimal medication costs. 22 20 AMOS: The study established that total costs in the first year did not differ significantly from costs in the pre-study year, when the patients were new to anthroposophic medicine therapy; in the second year, the costs were reduced by 13%. Other, less detailed evaluations also indicate similar or lower costs in anthroposophic therapy settings compared to conventional settings. 21 Kienle G., Albonico H.U., Baars E.W., Hamre H.J. et al, Anthroposophic Medicine: An Integrative Medical System Originating in Europe, Global Advances in Health and Medicine, Vol 2 No 5 November 2013 22 (See footnote 7): Kooreman P., Baars E.W.

Its multi-disciplinary approach combines conventional intervention, some homeopathic and phytotherapeutic medicinal products, anthro-posophic medication and a number of specific therapeutic treatments. These approaches can be applied in all health care settings and situa - tions, including emergency and acute intensive care, as well as in the treatment of chronic disease. The therapeutic medical approaches of anthroposophic medicine include medication, the biographical approach, nursing, physiotherapy, rhythmical massage therapy , eurythmy therapy , therapeutic arts and psychotherapy.2 2.1The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 16 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved Medication Anthroposophic physicians use and apply anthroposophic medicinal pro - ducts, homeopathic, phytotherapeutic and, where necessary, conventio- nal medicinal products. Anthroposophic medicinal products are applied internally, externally and by injection. They are conceived, developed, and produced in accordance with the anthroposophic understanding of man, nature, substances and pharmaceutical processing. The range of anthroposophic medicinal products is partially deter - mined by the physical characteristics of substances, and takes account of conventional medicinal, phytotherapeutic and homeopathic criteria. Most particularly, anthroposophic medicinal products are characterised by their manufacturing processes which involve specific anthroposophic and/or typical homeopathic pharmaceutical procedures. They are manu-factured according to pharmacopoeia standards (see Chapter 3). The biographical approach There are three elements to the therapeutic importance given to the biography of a patient in anthroposophic medicine. Firstly, the development of a human being changes at different times of his or her life, with different tendencies for disharmony and 2.1.1 Anthroposophic medicinal products are applied, internally, externally and by injection 2.1.2 \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 17 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine disease in each period, for example diseases such as chickenpox in childhood, gastric ulcers in maturity or strokes in elderly people. Se - condly, the mental and spiritual development of a human being also follows certain biographical periods in childhood, adulthood and old age. Thirdly, the ways in which patients overcome their illness also differ according to the period of their life: children tend to experience short disease development with high fevers, while elderly people experience longer lasting or chronic diseases. These differences require differentia - tions in treatment. In addition, each human being has a distinct individual biography , according to his or her own life experience. Anthroposophic medici - ne offers a subtle framework for the correlation between the physical experience and experience at a mental and spiritual level, in order to understand disharmony and disease. Each physician or therapist takes this into account when choosing the best treatment. Biography treatment by physicians, psychotherapists or other trained anthroposophic life coaches helps patients to develop an over - view of how their life has developed, where they stand in relation to their illness or disease and how they want to live and cope with their specific situation. Nursing as a part of therapy Nursing plays a central role in anthroposophic medicine. Attention and attachment towards the patient are not simply 'add-ons'; rather, they are applied in a methodical way and become an essential part of the treatment process. Patients are always attended to, treated and guided with the objective of helping them to regain an individual and autono - mous existence. Anthroposophic nursing works with an augmented understanding of care. This means not only washing, warming or moving the patient, but creating a mental and emotional 'shelter' around him or her. Anthropo-sophic nursing seeks to respect the human existence of the patient in every situation of his or her illness or disease and to provide a genuine accompaniment during this period and in the recovery process. It is especially renowned for its support in moments of transition and during the experience of life events such as birth, severe disease and death. Anthroposophic nursing is provided in all anthroposophic clinics and hospitals as well as in homes for elderly people, home care services, social care, curative education settings and primary care.2.1.3The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 18 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved Anthroposophic physiotherapy and rhythmical massage therapy In addition to conventional movement exercises, anthroposophic phy - siotherapists offer a special kind of massage called rhythmical massage therapy (see Annex 1). Rhythmical massage therapy seeks to influence all fluids of the hu- man body and aids the body's self-healing abilities. It gives the patient better control of his or her body, rectifying imbalances derived from stress and/or illness, and supporting and restoring the body's own harm-ony and process to healing. Various forms of hydrotherapy have also been developed, which com- plement this form of therapeutic massage. Two recent research studies report on the positive experience of external applications and rhythmi- cal massage therapy . 23 Eurythmy therapy The term 'eurythmy' is derived from Greek ('eu' meaning beautiful or harmonious) and means 'harmonious, beautiful rhythm' . Eurythmy movements create a link between the body's external movement and the inner mental and healing forces of the human organism. Anthropo - sophic medicine has successfully applied eurythmy therapy as a special form of movement since 1920. Consciously-exercised movements are used to support the healing forces. Different exercises address circulation and breathing, metabo - 23 massage therapy in chronic disease: a four- year prospective cohort study. Altern J. Complement Med 2007; 13 (6):635 - 42.

The aim is to regulate the expressions of the body, which have been disrupted as a result of imbalances. Eurythmy therapy employs speech, gestures and music, translating them into a unique form of movement. Each consonant and vowel is connected to a particular movement. These exercises are specifically de - signed to stimulate, strengthen and regulate every function and process of the human body. Eurythmy therapy can be used as an additional therapy in a range of indications, for example acute, chronic or degenerative diseases of the nervous, cardiac or circulatory systems, for troubles of the metabolic or musculoskeletal system, for developmental problems or disabilities in children as well as in the field of psychosomatic and psychiatric me - dicine. This movement therapy may also be applied for prevention and after-care, and is used as a complementary therapy in the treatment of cancer. Eurythmy therapy is exercised in hospitals, clinics and care centres, therapeutic centres, primary care, schools and nurseries. There are in - creasing research data on the benefits of eurythmy therapy ( see Anne- xes 1 and 5). Eurythmy therapyThe System of Anthroposophic Medicine 20 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved Anthroposophic art therapy Therapeutic art, such as drawing, music, painting, sculpture, singing and speech, may also form part of anthroposophic health care treatment. It can help harmonise imbalance between the physiological, mental and spiritual dimensions of a human being. Anthroposophic art therapy hel - ps patients to mobilise their inner resources and stimulate their active contribution to their own process of recovery. With the use of colours, tones, rhythms, forms, breath or sound, the patient learns to deal with his or her imbalances and to bring about changes that are beneficial to the healing process. Patients of therapeutic art feel less overwhelmed by their illness, especially in cases of chronic disease. Anthroposophic art therapy may be applied in many different condi - tions, including acute and chronic diseases, degenerative, inflammatory or sclerotic diseases, psychosomatic and mental or developmental pro - blems. There is an increasing evidence base for the benefit of anthropo - sophic art therapy (see Annexes 1 and 5). Anthroposophic psychotherapy Over the last century, there has been a steady increase in mental disea- ses and the demand for psychological and psychiatric care is growing, especially for personality disorders and disorders of identity formation. Anthroposophic psychotherapy is able to offer a particular set of thera - peutic instruments for these needs. Anthroposophic psychotherapy pays special attention to periods of mental and spiritual development. Conventional psychotherapeutic me-thods are enhanced by a set of instruments including the biographical development approach. The delivery of anthroposophic psychotherapy relies on interdiscip - linary cooperation between the medical, therapeutic and psychothera - peutic team. It aims to enable the individual to regain his or her auto - nomy and empower his or her self-determination.2.1.7Anthroposophic art therapy2.1.6 \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 21 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine ANTHROPOSOPHIC PHARMACY General aspects Anthroposophic medicinal products have been on the market in Europe since 1920 and worldwide since 1960. There are about 1700 different products on the market in the European Union, with new ones regularly being developed. They are prescribed by anthroposophic doctors and by a wide range of complementary and alternative medicine and conventional doctors. In some EU Member States, a range of products is also available for self-medication. According to national regulations, for example in Germany, registered health practitioners (Heilpraktiker) are legally per-mitted to prescribe certain anthroposophic medicinal products. The stimulation of self-healing (salutogenesis) in a human being via anthroposophic medicinal products is a guiding principle of anthroposo - phic medicine in overcoming illness and disease. Anthroposophic medicinal products are conceived, developed and produced in accordance with the anthroposophic knowledge of man, nature, substance and pharmaceutical processing. The starting mate-rials come from minerals, plants and animal substances. The process by which they are developed, and produced reflects the relationship between human beings and the realms of minerals, plants and animals. To understand this interrelationship and its implications for health and well-being, imbalance or illness, a thorough understanding and knowledge of anatomy, biology, biochemistry, physiology and pathology, as well as botany, mineralogy and pharmaceutical processes is essential. The application of the medicinal products within anthroposophic medi - cine is the result of that knowledge. Therefore a fruitful work between doctors and pharmacists is mandatory when conceiving new medicinal products. Characteristics of anthroposophic medicinal products According to anthroposophic principles, active substances may be star - ting materials which are used as such, or starting materials which have been transformed into active substances by a process of anthroposophic pharmacy , including compositions. An anthroposophic medicinal product can contain one or more acti - ve substances. It can be employed in any dosage form, including exter - nal (topical), internal and parenteral dosage forms. 3 3.1 3.2The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 22 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved Starting materials for anthroposophic medicinal products are distinc - tively shaped by different formative processes, for example the inner structures of a mineral or the morphology and substance of plants, which are a result of different processes in time and space. It is a basic principle of anthroposophic pharmacy to make approp - riate use of these formative processes, which are part of the biography of the substance. It is from this perspective that appropriate starting materials and substances for anthroposophic medicinal products are selected; this provides anthroposophic pharmacy with its distinctive and subtle pharmaceutical processes. Production and quality control Anthroposophic medicinal products are produced in accordance with the modern standards of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Their quality is controlled by the criteria and parameters of official pharma - copoeia (e.g. Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex (APC)) (see Annex 2). Detailed pharmaceutical information for quality control and regula - tory needs is provided in the different Pharmacopoeias and the APC 24, as well as in individual company monographs. Professional competence in anthroposophic pharmacy is provided by the associations of anthroposophic pharmacists which are also respon - sible for training and research and development (see Annex 2). 24 http://www.iaap.org.uk/downloads/codex.pdf3.3 Viscum album - Mistletoe Potentisation Dilutions \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 23 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine A HUMAN BEING ACCORDING TO ANTHROPOSOPHIC MEDICINE The holistic perception of a human being In anthroposophic medicine, as in conventional medicine, the physiolo - gical and biochemical aspects of the human body provide the basis for diagnosis and therapy. In anthroposophic medicine, a holistic percep-tion of a human being encompasses, in addition to the physical body, the mental and spiritual dimensions, the capacity for self-healing and recovery - best epitomised by the term 'life-force' - and the ability for continuous development. Individuals are further characterised by their own biography and their distinctive nature as a social being. This leads to a set of analytical determinants which are used to incorporate this holistic perception of the human being into both diagnosis and treatment. These determinants perceive human beings according to their individual development and their relationship with the social and natural environment. They pay particular attention to the fact that human beings carry within them elements of all parts of the realms of minerals, plants and animals in nature. This approach makes possible a sophisticated and differentiated treatment of imbalance, disorder or illness, according to which the appropriate anthroposophic medicines and therapies are applied.4 4.1Human Physical Body Dimension Visible and measurable Life Processes Dimension Living organismBiological identity RecoveryPhysiological functions Mental Dimension Awareness, perception PassionFeeling MovementMental organisation Spiritual Dimension BiographySelf-awarenessCreativitySelf-determinationIndividualityNature Minerals Plants Animals Humanity (unique world)The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 24 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved The relationship between human beings and the world of nature is reflected in the fact that human beings share the inorganic elements of their body with the realm of minerals, their existence as a living organism with the realm of plants, and their awareness, mobility and the capacity to feel sympathy and antipathy with the realm of animals. \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 25 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine The systems governing the human body Four different dimensions Taking into account the anthroposophic understanding of human beings and their special relationship with their social and natural environment, anthroposophic medicine observes and works in four different dimensi - ons to stimulate and influence treatment and healing: Physical body dimension Anthroposophic medicine is governed by physical and chemical prin - ciples and the laws of nature for any aspect of the physical body that relates to its form or structure For example, a broken arm has to be splinted to allow it to mend. Life processes dimension In addition, anthroposophic medicine considers the forces responsible for generating life and enabling human beings to develop and recover from illness. These 'life-processes' are considered essential to revive or activate self-healing in the human body in order to overcome patholo - gical symptoms or illness. For example, rest, sleep and rhythm play an important role in any recovery of accident or disease. Treatment with anthroposophic medi-cinal products and anthroposophic medicine therapies stimulates these healing forces. Mental dimension The mental and emotional dimensions of a human being also have an influence on health. This is reflected in the ability to feel joy or distress, sympathy or antipathy, the ability to recognise something consciously, or to wish or detest. Modern medicine, like anthroposophic medicine, acknowledges the importance of the mental disposition of a human being and its direct influence on recovery from illness and the ability to achieve health and well-being. Anthroposophic medicine takes account of these dispositions and abilities in diagnosis and treatment. For example, stress, pain or sorrow lead to increased amounts of cor - tisol, the stress hormone; this suppresses immune system activity, leading to delayed recovery and a reduction in the ability of the body to react to the invasion of viruses, bacteria and injury.4.2 4.2.1The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 26 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved Individual or spiritual dimension A fourth component, specific to human beings, and a strong element affecting their existence, is self-awareness. Only human beings can acknowledge the Self as an individual. The ability to distinguish bet - ween oneself and others, the faculty to communicate by speech and the capability to take decisions out of free will rather than simply to follow the principles and laws of nature are all part of the unique position of human beings in relation to the world of nature. This self-awareness points towards a further spiritual dimension in human beings and is also instrumental for treatment and healing, because this level contributes to the restructuring of the functions of the human body and of its organ systems. For example, this can be observed in the working of the immune system. A strong self-management and sense of coherence will bring about a more positive outcome of treatment. 25 Threefold systematics of the organ systems As a second analytical tool, anthroposophic medicine differentiates between the functional and rhythmic aspects in the form and structure (morphology) of a human body and the physiological or biochemical systems. It assesses, for example, the catabolic 26, the metabolic27 and the rhythmic systems. Here, anthroposophic medicine distinguishes between organs or organ systems, which are related to the nerve-sense system (catabo-lic function) and organs or organ systems which are connected to the regeneration system (metabolic function). A third distinctive system, the rhythmic functions in the body, or cardiovascular/respiratory system, is oriented to balance the divergent activities and functions (polarities) of the nerve-sense (catabolic) and regeneration (metabolic) systems and to facilitate a harmonic functioning of the three systems in the human body. With this concept, illness is not only regarded as a malfunction of one single organ but is perceived as an imbalance between and within different organ systems, including the question as to whether the rhyth- mic system is fulfilling its task to balance and harmonise properly. 25 Larsson, Kallenberg, 1996, Sense of coherence, socio-economic conditions and health, European Journal of Public Health 6: 175-180 26 Catabolic: Destruction of body cells and substances Glossary). 27 Metabolic: Regeneration system (see Glossary).4.2.2 \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 27 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine The functioning of these three systems or levels can be depicted like this: These three systems are also reflected in the manufacture of anthropo - sophic medicinal products and in the application of these products in medical treatment.

These are called potencies (See Glossary).Mineral Quartz is one of the substances used in anthroposophic medicinal products \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 29 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine ANTHROPOSOPHIC MEDICINE IN PRACTICE History The foundations of anthroposophic medicine were established by Austri - an philosopher and scientist Rudolf Steiner (1861 -1925) together with the Dutch physician Ita Wegman (1876 -1943). The first anthroposophic hospital was founded in Arlesheim, Switzerland in 1921. A new anthroposophic pharmaceutical approach was developed by Rudolf Steiner and Austrian chemist Oskar Schmiedel (1887 -1959), in collaboration with a number of other physicians. Their aim was to complement the results of pharmaceutical and medical research with the findings of anthroposophic research in humans and in nature. In response to requests from doctors for the right remedies for medication and treatment of their patients, a first pharmaceutical laboratory for professional manufacturing of anthroposophic medicinal products was attached to the anthroposophic clinic in Arlesheim in Switzerland. Availability Anthroposophic medicine has been practised since 1920 and is today available in 20 European and over 60 other countries around the world. Anthroposophic medicine is practised at many places in multi-dis- ciplinary settings in therapeutic centres or clinics, where physicians and anthroposophically-trained health professionals work together. There are also independent practitioners. Anthroposophic physicians are active in general practice and in all specialist fields including internal medi - cine, intensive care and surgery, rheumatology. Anthroposophic medicine is also integrated in primary care set - tings, in intensive care and first aid medicine, in hospitals (including university teaching hospitals), in anthroposophic medical departments in conventional hospitals and in psychiatric hospitals. Anthroposophic hospitals and hospital departments exist in Italy, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. The availability of anthroposo - phic medical practice in Europe varies according to the different legal requirements in the various EU Member States for the practice of anth - roposophic medicine. 29 29 http://www.ivaa.info5 5.1 5.2The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 30 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved As concerns the availability of anthroposophic medicinal products, a study30 by ECHAMP, the European Coalition on Homeopathic and An- throposophic Medicinal Products, found that the availability of homeo - pathic and anthroposophic medicinal products in various EU Member States is threatened by the lack of registration, or by an incomplete or outstanding re-registration process. In particular, the availability of an- throposophic medicinal products not covered by the rules for homeopa - thic medicinal products is limited by a lack of legal provisions for those products in the EU. The presence of anthroposophic medicinal products on the market and their national authorisation or registration in some Member States are related to national policy already in place before the publication of the specific homeopathic Directive in 1992. Training and quality control High professional standards amongst anthroposophic medical professi - onals are achieved by in-depth training and a set of practice guidelines for anthroposophic physicians. Any anthroposophic doctor has first qualified as a doctor with a national medical licence, whether as a general practitioner or as a specialist in any branch of medicine. An additional two to three ye - ars' specialised training in anthroposophic medicine is then necessary, to achieve an internationally agreed certificate as an anthroposophic physician, within an institution authorised by the national anthropo-sophic medical associations. Postgraduate training courses are also available for all specialists 31. The responsibility for training physicians rests with these national anthroposophic medical associations and the international community of anthroposophic physicians. Anthroposophic physicians follow a high standard of medical services, outlined in the 'Guidelines for Good Professional Practice in Anthroposophic Medicine. 32 In addition, anthroposophic physicians adhere to the 'Model Guidelines for the Practice of Complementary Therapies by Medical Doctors in the European Union, 33 a joint convention of the European complementary and alternative medicine doctors' associations.34 The availability of anthroposophic medical training varies according to the different legal requirements in the EU Member States.

Rese- arch shows that patient satisfaction is generally high and therapeutic expectations are fulfilled. 37 In a recently completed Dutch survey, 2099 patients reported very high satisfaction with anthroposophic primary care practices. 38 In 2007 two anthroposophic clinics were ranked second and third best clinics in Germany.39 The Havelh\u00f6he Community Hospital in Berlin, Ger- many has been recognised as a hospital with a designated oncology focus in the state hospital plan since 2011. Patients of anthroposophic health care are as diverse as patients who use other forms of medicine. Anthroposophic medicine is used by anyo-ne who wishes to seek self-management and active participation in the therapy and the healing process. Some patients seek to use the whole range of anthroposophic medical services available, whilst others use only specific services or medicinal products which they find helpful to their specific circumstances. Nevertheless studies show that patients treated with anthroposophic medicine are more severely affected or have been ill for a longer period before starting therapy. 40 37 Kienle G.S., Albonico H.U., Medicine: An Integrative Medical System Originating in Europe, Global Advances in Health and Medicine, Vol 2 No 5 November 2013 38 See footnote 36 39 http://www.damid.de 40 See footnote 36Anthroposophic medicine is provided in both primary and clinical care.6 \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 33 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANTHROPOSOPHIC MEDICINE EU regulatory framework The various traditions of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in Europe and around the world have led to a complex legal situ - ation for anthroposophic medicine in the last fifty years. Although it is practised in nearly all EU Member States, anthropo - sophic medicine is legally recognised as a medicine to various degrees only in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Romania, Swit-zerland and UK. Swedish law rules out the practice of CAM treatments by a physician; only one clinic, Vidar Clinic, 41 has a special legal permit to apply anthroposophic medicine. In general, anthroposophic medicine health services are reimbursed by public health insurance in only a few insurance systems. Anthroposophic medicine doctors are reimbursed in France, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Private health insurance for anthroposophic medicine is only possible in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands and for certain services, in Switzerland. As regards the EU, the legal situation of anthroposophic medicine is complicated by the divided competences in public health between the EU Member States and the EU institutions. On the one hand, the EU Member States are still responsible for their national health sys - tems - and therefore the regulation of anthroposophic medicine. On the other, the national competent authorities have to follow EU regulations setting standards for the authorisation, production and marketing of medicines for human use in the respective national markets. The EU regulations still do not acknowledge anthroposophic medicine as they need to. This has far reaching consequences for the availability of anth - roposophic medicinal products and, in consequence, for anthroposophic medicine in the EU. The EU Community code relating to medicinal products for hu - man use (especially Directive 2001/83/EC and Directive 2004/24/EC) differentiates between a general authorisation procedure for medici - nal products and special simplified registrations for homeopathic and traditional herbal medicinal products. The specific approaches used in the manufacture of anthroposophic medicinal products are not recogni - sed in this code, meaning that only anthroposophic medicinal products which fall under the specific categories for homeopathy or traditional herbal medicinal products qualify for simplified registration. The majo - 41 http://www.vidarkliniken.se7 7.1The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 34 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved rity of prescribed anthroposophic medicinal products must be authorised according to the authorisation procedure for all medicinal products, defined in the EU framework regulations. The national competent au-thorities are obliged to apply these regulations, all the more so since the ruling of the European Court of Justice in 2007.35 These regulations do not take account of the special features and manufacturing methods and the individual-centred practice of anthroposophic medicinal products and are, therefore, not appropriate. It will only be possible to do justice to anthroposophic medicine if the EU regulatory framework relating to medicinal products for human use recognises anthroposophic medicinal products as a special category; stipulates adequate procedures for their authorisation or registration; adequately recognises their specific manufacturing methods; accepts their long-established safety record; takes into account that these are low-profit products with limited economic resources. A suitable regulatory framework - the work of ESCAMP Such a framework is needed to guarantee the future availability of these medicinal products for patients and doctors. Suitable regulatory frameworks for anthroposophic medicinal products exist in only one EU Member State (Germany), although also in Switzerland. The European Commission has acknowledged the existence of therapy systems whose medicinal products have no adequate regulation, and in 2008 it proposed that the suitability of a separate legal framework for medicinal products of certain traditions such as anthroposophic medicine should be asses-sed. 42 In this context, ESCAMP (European Scientific Cooperative on Anth- roposophic Medicinal Products)43 was founded in 2010 to facilitate the development of an adequate regulatory framework for anthroposophic medicinal products in the EU. The work of ESCAMP includes three tasks: i. Development of methods and standards for the scientific assessment of efficacy/effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of anthroposophic medicinal products; 42 Case C-84/06 Antroposana and others The Netherlands [2007] ECR I-07609 43 ESCAMP is an incorporated charitable association with headquarters in Freiburg (DE). ESCAMP members are independent experts in pharmacy, clinical use and scientific research on AMPs. 7.2 \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 35 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine ii. (Based on i), elaboration of appropriate categories and criteria for a future regulatory framework for anthroposophic medicinal products in the EU; iii. Implementation of these methods and regulatory criteria in reference documents and product monographs. The ESCAMP strategy for scientific assessment of anthroposophic me-dicinal products follows a whole system approach, with three evaluation stages: i. Description of anthroposophic medicine and anthroposophic medicinal products; ii. Evaluation of therapy with anthroposophic medicinal products as a whole system; iii. Evaluation of single anthroposophic medicinal products and groups of anthroposophic medicinal products. As at publication, ESCAMP is elaborating a detailed, justified proposal for a regulatory framework for anthroposophic medicinal products. The proposal has been developed according to two main principles: The whole spectrum of anthroposophic medicinal products should be covered; Amendments and additions to the EU Community code relating to medicinal products for human use should be kept as limited as pos-sible. National regulatory examples Switzerland Anthroposophic medicine is recognised in the Swiss health system by the fact that the official Swiss Medical Association publishes the quali - fication certificate of an anthroposophic medicine physician. As a result of the Swiss referendum in May 2009 to include complementary and alternative medicine in the Swiss constitution, anthroposophic medicine is recognised in the Swiss legal health system as a specific medicine and accepted as a provider of the public basic health services. 44 The Swiss legal system for the marketing of medicinal products provides a simplified registration procedure for CAM medicinal products because of their low risk factor. This simplified registration process is based on up-to-date scientific and technical standards as well as on consideration of the nature of the particular therapy. Anthroposophic 44 www.parlamenmt.ch/d/wahlen-abstimmungen/volksabstimmungen 20097.3 7.3.1The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 36 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved medicinal products are registered according to this simplified procedure and representatives of the Umbrella group of all professional organi - sations in complementary medicine, including Swiss Anthroposophic Medical Association, are members of the advisory committees of the Swiss regulatory authority (EAK). Germany The legal regulation of the German health system (Deutsches Sozialge - setzbuch) recognises anthroposophic medicine, along with a 'special therapy method' (Besondere Therapie- richtung). This means that the treatment and medicinal products of the special therapy methods are available within the health service and eligible for reimbursement by the health insurance institutions. This also applies to anthroposophic medicinal products which do not require a prescription. Furthermore, the German law for medicinal products stipulates a distinct regulation for the medicinal products of these special therapy methods and, in extension of the EU legal framework, includes anth - roposophic medicine and phytotherapy in this regulation. It provides a legal definition of anthroposophic medicinal products. 45 This pluralistic approach in the German health system enables anth- roposophic medicine to be present in in-patient and out-patient health care in Germany. 2000 medical doctors are active in anthroposophic medicine in Germany and the application of anthroposophic medicine is well-established in general health care. The health insurance system in Germany is open to special and individual insurance schemes for anth - roposophic medicine and allows the insurance institutions to include integrated health care schemes enabling health insurance funds to reimburse anthroposophic medicine treatment. 45 See 9.2 and \u00a7 4 of the German law on medicinal products, Gesetz \u00fcber den Verkehr mit Arzneimitteln7.3.2 \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 37The System of Anthroposophic Medicine ANNEX 1: SPECIAL THERAPIES IN ANTHROPOSOPHIC MEDICINE All medical professions can be enhanced by further training in the anthroposophic view of the human being and his or her development as a personality. Furthermore, anthroposophic medicine has also enlarged medicine with a set of special therapies developed with this perception of a human being. The following presents further information and some references on the most common of these therapies: anthroposophic art therapy, eurythmy therapy and anthroposophic physiotherapy and rhythmical massage therapy . Anthroposophic art therapy Therapeutic drawing and painting With the aim of achieving inner balance, therapeutic drawing and pain - ting serve to promote an intensive process of self-examination on the part of the patient. At the same time, the patient's inner engagement with forms and colours provides a chance to influence the body's vital functions. Drawing and painting can release creative forces in each hu - man being, releasing them from the limitations of past experiences, and acting as catalysts for things yet to be realised, which then enter the consciousness and take effect through the very activity of art. Cognitive functions, feelings and psychosomatic conditions are specially influen - ced by drawing. Music therapy Music, be it through voice, melody, harmony, sound or rhythm, appeals to the emotions rather than the intellect. Neither prior knowledge nor musical talent is required to participate in music therapy. The range of instruments is wide and they are easy to play. Together with the the-rapist, the patient improvises or simply listens to melodies, sounds and rhythms. The choice of instrument depends on the patient's individual situation, the degree of severity and the stage of the illness. The aim of music therapy is to open oneself to stillness or sound. Every rhythmic process helps stimulate, strengthen, and maintain this vigour. Music therapy is a vital component in both paediatrics and in the treatment of adults with internal physical and mental disorders. It can 8 8.1 8.1.1 8.1.2The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 38 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved be especially helpful in treating respiratory, heart and circulation disea- ses. In intensive care, music therapy can have a direct physical influ - ence. Patients' respiration becomes deeper and more regular with less artificial mechanical dependency. Blood pressure normalises and stress relaxes. Sculpture Sculpture is used to provide patients with a physical experience by get - ting to grips directly with the material in question. Pulse and breathing change, and heat is generated. Materials used include stone, soapstone, wood, clay, beeswax, plasticine and sand. These help the patient to un - derstand the illness better, to accept and overcome it, and to approach life with renewed courage. Clay modelling for example can be very hel - pful in anorexia. The artistic engagement with different materials works positively on both the physical and mental feelings of the patients. Therapeutic speech Speech is one of the most important forms of human communication. It is more than just a vehicle for information; it is an expression of the en - tire personality. Every person's voice, speech patterns, and enunciation are unique. Palate, tongue, lips, and teeth create sounds that form the flow of air into words. All this happens as we inhale and exhale - in fact speech is articulated exhalation. Breathing therefore plays a particularly important role in speech. Rhythm and metre of a text have an impact on breathing. A poem written in hexameter, for instance, reinforces the harmony between pul-se and breathing in an ideal, natural ratio of 1:4 (18 breaths to 72 beats of a normal pulse), and therefore has a measurable stabilising and rege - nerative effect on cardiac and circulatory rhythms. Research has estab - lished that in therapeutic recitation of hexameter, inequality in rhythm of respiration was harmonised and became much more synchronal with heart rhythm. This implies that therapeutic hexameter recitation has a positive influence on blood pressure regulation.

The 'beauty' is the harmony of internal and external, of the spiritual experience and its expression in physical movement. Eurythmy was developed as a dance for the theatre, being subsequently extended for educational and therapeutic purposes. Eurythmy therapy employs speech, gestures and music, translating them into a unique form of movement. Particular movements are assi-gned to each consonant and vowel. Geometric shapes are attributed to the vowels: for example, in the case of A, the arms are spread wide and stretched upwards, forwards, backwards, or diagonally downwards; for O the arms form a large circle with fingertips just touching; for E hands are outstretched and the wrists crossed. Consonants are generally ex - pressed through movement: D for example is represented by a forwards gesture, R by arms rolling circles vertically downwards, and G by arms stretching, pushing outwards. On the basis of medical diagnosis provided by the medical doctor and the individual's diagnosis, the eurythmy therapist selects a few of these sounds and gestures and practices them together with the patient in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. The aim is to regulate the body's powers of expression, which have been disrupted as a result of illness. The eurythmic movements create a link between the body's external movements and the inner vital workings of the organism. The - rapeutic eurythmic exercises may involve the whole body, or combina-tions such as arms and hands, legs and feet, fingers and toes; steps and leaps may also be added. In the process, the sequence of movements are adapted to the patient's condition: eurythmy therapy can also be carried out sitting or lying down, even with severely ill patients or those recei - ving treatment in intensive care. The exercises are specifically designed to stimulate, strengthen and regulate every bodily function and process. Depending on the exercise programme selected, circulation and breathing, metabolism, general mobility and balance may be addressed. As all the organs and their systems are stimulated by active movement, the eurythmic movement patterns influence the functions of specific organs, as well as the indivi - dual's emotional and mental capacity to express and experience.8.2The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 40 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved Research studies in eurythmy therapy Seifert et al: Effects of complementary eurythmy therapy on he - art rate variability, P.: Therapeutic - movement therapy for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): a pilot study. Complement Ther Nurs Midwifery 2004 10(1):46-53 Anthroposophic physiotherapy and rhythmical massage therapy In addition to conventional movement exercises, anthroposophic phy-siotherapists offer rhythmical massage therapy . Rhythm is central to healthy life processes. Each cell and organ has its own physiological rhythms; the whole organism needs the sleeping/ waking rhythm. Disturbances of these rhythmical functions can indicate potential or actual illness. The therapist can strengthen or calm either one of the two major functional activities of the body; those associated with the nervous system, or those active in the metabolism. One of the most important techniques is to alternate the strengthening and loosening in a rhyth-mical way like the breathing rhythm or heartbeat. This stimulates the life processes within the tissues. This rhythmical massage therapy was developed from classical Swedish massage to a special massage technique by Ita Wegman, M. D., medical doctor schooled in physiotherapy and Swedish Massage and Gymnastics. It employs many of the basic massage terms and strokes such as effleurage, petrissage or kneading and friction, with the general exception of percussion and tapotement (pummelling, tapping, slapping). The above terms have been greatly broadened and at the same time finely tuned to a very exact and creative technique. For example the effleurage encompasses not only soft tissue strea-ming strokes but also varied and defined movements of forms of the figure eight, known as lemniscates, performed using one or two hands. The frictions can be understood as being formed by the dynamic mo-vements of a vortex. This engenders a deep tissue suction quality. All of these employ and involve qualities of intermittent binding and loosening. Rhythmical massage therapy works oppositional to the forces of gravity with 'forces of levity' . This strengthens and supports 8.3 \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 41 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine life processes in the body. Although reminiscent of lymph drainage, the benefits of rhythmical massage therapy are not confined to the lymphatic flow but are rather aimed at influencing all fluids of the human organism. In addition, the massage oils developed for anthroposophic medicine do not just aid lubrication, but also act as carriers of healing substances. Various forms of hydrotherapy have also been developed, which complement this form of therapeutic massage. Rhythmical massage therapy aids the body's self-healing abilities. It gives the individual better control of his or her body, rectifying imbalan-ces derived from stress and/or illness, thus supporting and restoring the body's own harmony and process to healing. It is known for its harmo - nising and integrating effects as well as for improving circulation and lymph drainage, elimination of toxins and inducing a pleasant state of relaxation and a renewed sense of well-being. It can be a vital component in the treatment and management of most chronic illness disorders and in cases of asthma, angina, sleep disturbances, disturbances of the arterial and venous blood supply, headaches of various types, spinal problems and other muscular skele - tal problems, auto immune conditions, i.e. rheumatic conditions etc. Massage can also play a role in the care of the cancer patient and can be used in the treatment of certain psychiatric conditions, for example depression and addiction. The therapist needs to engage in a thorough understanding of the human being from both a conventional, natural scientific perspective and an anthroposophic spiritual scientific perspective apparent in health and illness. The way in which the massage is approached and delivered is as im - portant as the techniques themselves. The practitioner needs to learn to be guided by knowledge and principles of sensitivity, awareness, warmth and professionalism.

The General Monograph on Anthroposophic Prepara- tions in the Swiss Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Helv.) defines anthroposophic preparations starting materials methods of preparation dosage form as follows:(This is an unofficial translation of the monograph \"Anthroposophische Zubereitungen\", Anthroposophic Preparations, in the Swiss Pharmaco - poeia, published in Supplement 10.2.) Anthroposophic Preparations DefinitionAnthroposophic preparations are developed, composed and produced according to the principles of anthroposophic cognition of humans, animals, substances and nature and are appropriate to be used in accor - dance with these principles. An anthroposophic preparation may contain one or more active substances as well as vehicles and other excipients. According to anthroposophic principles, active substances may be starting materials which are used as such or starting materials which have been transformed into active substances by a process of anthropo- sophic pharmacy . 46 http://www.iaap.org.uk9 9.1 \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 43 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine Vehicles are excipients which are used to produce active substances (e.g. in the process of potentisation, substances such as water, alcohol, whey, lactose, rice starch or glycerine are used). Further excipients are used in the preparation of dosage forms. Starting MaterialsStarting materials for the production of anthroposophic preparations are substances of natural or synthetic origin, in particular: Minerals, rocks, metals, natural waters (e.g. sea water); Starting materials of botanical origin are usually from certified biodynamic or organic cultivation or from sustainable wild plant harvesting: dried or fresh plants or parts of plants, including algae, fungi and lichens; plant secretions, juices, extracts (fractions), oleo - resins, essential oils or distillation products. Plants may be pre-trea - ted by special procedures; Starting materials of zoological origin: whole animals, parts of animals (e.g. organ preparations), glandular secretions from ani - mals, extracts (e.g. Iecoris oleum), calcareous deposits (e.g. Con - chae); organ preparations are starting materials taken from healthy warm-blooded animals raised according to adequate and suitable, usually biodynamic standards: fresh or dried organs or parts of organs (including bones, glands), organ extracts, tissue or parts of tissue, preparations from fresh blood; Starting materials which can be characterised chemically (e.g. Cuprum metallicum, Aesculinum). Starting materials used for the production of anthroposophic prepara - tions must comply with the following requirements, where applicable: the general requirements for starting materials of the Pharmacopo - eia (Ph.Eur. and Ph.Helv.), the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (GHP/ HAB), the French Pharmacopoeia (Ph.F.); the general requirements for homoeopathic preparations of the Pharmacopoeia, in particular the requirements of the general mono - graph Homoeopathic preparations of Ph.Eur; specific requirements of particular monographs of the Pharmaco - poeia, the GHP/HAB, the Ph.F. or an appropriate quality monograph of the manufacturer, when there is no particular monograph in a pharmacopoeia. This quality monograph must comply with the requirements listed in Appendix 1 part II C 2 of the Ordinance for complementary and phytochemical Medicines (Komplement\u00e4r und Phytoarzneimittelverordnung, KPAV), SR 812.212.24. For starting materials of zoological origin, adequate measures must be The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 44 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved taken to minimise the risk of the presence of agents of infection, inclu - ding viruses, in the anthroposophic preparation (see Ph.Eur. Viral safety (5.1.7)). For this purpose it must be demonstrated that: the method of production includes a step or steps that have been shown to remove or inactivate agents of infection; where applicable, starting materials of zoological origin comply with the monograph of the Ph.Eur, Products with risk of transmitting agents of animal spongiform animalium); where applicable, the animals and tissues used to obtain raw ma - terials comply with the food law requirements of the competent authorities for animals for human consumption. In addition, for cells, tissue and organs, it must be demonstrated that the used production methods devitalise the material (devitalisation in the sense according to article 2, paragraph 2, letter a of the law relating to transplantation, SR 810.21). Starting materials of botanical origin must comply with the mono - graph of the Ph.Eur. Herbal drugs for homoeopathic preparations (Plan-tae medicinales ad praeparationes homoeopathicas). Methods of PreparationFor anthroposophic preparations, homeopathic and anthroposophic methods of preparation can be used as described in: the homeopathic preparation methods described in GHP/HAB or the Ph.F. the anthroposophic manufacturing methods described in the Ph. Helv, GPH or in the B. Hom. Ph. Specific anthroposophic production processes which have been recognised by the authorities: 47 Chapter 17.7 Manufacturing methods for anthroposophic preparations of the Ph. Helv. gives an overview of the manufacturing methods used in anthroposophic pharmacy and describes the preparation methods in detail. It was published in the Supplementum 11.1 of the Ph. Helv. in 2013 and contains all specific anthroposophic manufacturing methods 47 See the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex (APC) of the International Association of IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 45 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine like fertilization of plants with metals, metal mirrors, special heat tre - atments like digestions methods, rhythmic methods as well as different composition manufacturing methods. Dosage formsAn anthroposophic preparation may be used in all dosage forms descri - bed in the Pharmacopoeia or the GHP/HAB, which correspond to the perception of anthroposophic medicinal products. All dosage forms of anthroposophic preparations must comply with the monograph of the relevant dosage form of the European Pharmaco - poeia, unless otherwise justified. Existing legal definitions of anthroposophic medicinal products To date only German and Swiss medical law gives a definition of an anth- roposophic medicinal product.48 Germany: Law on the circulation of medicinal products (Gesetz \u00fcber den Verkehr mit Arzneimitteln) Art. 4, (33) An anthroposophic medicinal product is a medicinal product that has been developed according to the anthroposophic knowledge of man and nature and that is produced according to a homoeopathic manufacturing procedure described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in absence thereof in a pharmacopoeia offici-ally used in the Member States or according to a special anthroposophic manufacturing procedure and that is meant to be used according to the anthroposophic principles concerning man and nature. Switzerland: Law of the Swiss Institute of Medicinal Products con- cerning the simplified authorisation of complementary and 2f: Anthroposophic medicinal product: Medicinal product, whose active substances are manufactured by a homoeopathic manufacturing procedure, or according to an anthroposophic manufacturing procedure described in the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia or in the British Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia or according to a special anthroposophic manufacturing procedure and that is composed and developed according to the anthroposophic knowledge of man, animal, substance and nature and meant to be used according to these principles. 48 See also: http://www.escamp.org/anthroposophic-medicinal-products.html9.2The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 46 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved ANNEX 3: ANTHROPOSOPHIC MEDICINE PATIENTS' ORGANISATIONS The roots of the anthroposophic patients' movement stem for the most part from groups of practitioners or support groups for local practitio - ners. This is particularly true in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands, where over the years, the support groups came together to establish national umbrella associations. In other countries, associ - ations were established directly at national level. Over time, the focus of these organisations has changed from support groups for doctors to associations representing the demands and wishes of their members at national level. Anthroposophic patients' associations differ from most other types of patients' organisations in one important aspect: while patients' orga - nisations are usually focused on one specific illness or group of illnesses, the anthroposophic patients' movement is concerned with the preserva - tion and promotion of good health in general and the promotion of the right to select the therapy of one's own choice. The European Federation of Patients' Associations for Anthroposo- phic Medicine (EFPAM) was founded in 2000 as an umbrella organisati-on for all existing national associations. It has members in 15 countries and one outside Europe. The combined membership of these national organisations is around 50 000. More than one million people support anthroposophic medicine and use its services and products occasionally or on a regular basis as shown in the recent ELIANT survey. 49 Most members of the individual anthroposophic patients' organisations advocate the right to self-determination in medicine, i.e. to be able to use the type of medicine they trust most, whether in a specific situation or more generally; take their own health and health maintenance very seriously; choose, where possible, gentler interventions such as anthroposo - phic medicine over more invasive forms of medical intervention. 49 http://www.eliant.eu10 \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 47 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine ANNEX 4: EUROPEAN ANTHROPOSOPHIC MEDICINE UMBRELLA ORGANISATIONS DoctorsInternationale Vereinigung Antroposophischer \u00c4rztegesellschaften International Association des Associations M\u00e9dicales Anthroposo - phiques http://www.ivaa.info Pharmacists International Association of Anthroposophic Pharmacistshttp://www.iaap.org.uk Patients European Federation of Patients\u00b4 Associations for Anthroposophic Medicine http://www.efpam.eu Anthroposophic medicine and professional organisations Medical Section of the School of Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum http://www.medsektion-goetheanum.ch Anthroposophic producers are member of ECHAMP, the European Coalition on Homeopathic and Anthroposophic Medicinal Products http://www.echamp.eu European Scientific Cooperative on Anthroposophic Medicinal Pro- ducts (ESCAMP) http://www.escamp.org11The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 48 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved ANNEX 5: THE SCIENTIFIC STATUS OF ANTHROPOSOPHIC MEDICINE The scientific research field of anthroposophic medicine stands in seve-ral scientific traditions. First of all, anthroposophic medicine is founded in the tradition of the natural sciences and conventional medicine. They form the general basis and starting point for (research in) anthroposophic medicine. Anthroposophic medicine is fully compatible with the scientific facts derived from this tradition, and for a large extent with the concepts developed in this tradition (concepts and positions that categorically exclude all spiritual explanations are of course not compatible with anth-roposophic medicine concepts). It is also part of other traditions such as holistic thinking in science, preventive and curative health promotion, and diagnostic and therapeutic orientation at the individual patient. 50 The concept of anthroposophic medicine, based on the integration of knowledge from conventional science and medicine with knowledge from spiritual science (anthroposophy) has been described in several anthropo-sophic medicine textbooks. 51 It is conceptually in accordance with newer relevant theories concerning complex biological systems, such as epige-netics, emergentism and systems biology. Its methodological approach is conceptually also in line with recently developed systems biology-orien-ted and pattern recognition methodologies and the renewed interest in the role of expert knowledge in clinical reasoning and science. 52 The most recent comprehensive systematic review of clinical studies of anthroposophic medicine treatment included a total of 256 studies published until the end of 2010. 53 Of these 256 studies, 74 were prospec- tively comparative studies (including 38 randomized clinical trials; RCTs), 90 prospective and 52 retrospective studies without comparison groups, and 49 retrospective comparative studies with a comparative group. In 38 of these 256 studies, anthroposophic medicine was assessed as a whole therapeutic system (including anthroposophic medicine medication and non-medication therapies). For the rest there were 10 studies of non-me-dication treatment, 133 studies of mistletoe therapy for cancer and 84 studies of other anthroposophic medicinal products. The results of the studies are predominantly positive and there are barely any risks and side effects; if present, they are mild to moderate.

Anthroposophic medi-cine diagnostic and therapeutic methods for use in healthcare practice have also been developed and some of these methods are currently being validated. New research methodologies or innovations of existing me-thodologies have been developed. In the last decade several research infrastructures have been built to perform scientific research projects on a structural basis. 54 References Baars E.W., Kienle G.S., Kiene H., Heusser P., Hamre H.J.

Anthroposophic pharmacy The discipline related to conceiving, developing and producing medicinal products according to the anthroposophic understanding of man, nature, substance and pharmaceutical processing. See http://www.iaap.org.uk/pharmacy/index.html . Anthroposophy 'Anthropos' and 'sophia' mean 'man' and 'wisdom' ancient Greek. The etymological meaning of the term 'anthroposophy' is 'wisdom of man' . Anthroposophy is defined in the Webster Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language as 'A philosophy based on the tea-ching of Rudolf Steiner (1861 -1925) which maintains that, by virtue of a prescribed method of self-discipline, cognitional experience of the spiritu-al world can be achieved' . Biography The development of the individual in a lifetime from childhood to matu-rity and thereafter to physical 'decay' until death; during a lifetime, each period of development has a specific physiological, mental and spiritual constellation leading to a differentiated understanding e.g. of the me-aning of and thus therapy for a disease in one age or another. During a lifetime, an individual gradually takes hold of his or her inner self at the expense of physical vitality. This process may need professional counsel-ling. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) CAM offers a range of complementary and/or alternative approaches for maintaining health and for preventing and treating illness. CAM disci-plines have an individualised and holistic approach to healthcare, and work to induce and support the self-healing process of the individual. 14The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 54 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved They include modification of lifestyle, dietary change, bodily treatments, health psychology approaches and the use of naturally sourced, low-risk medicinal products. They can often be used as a first option for people suffering from a wide range of health problems or as a complement to conventional treatment. Anthroposophic medicine is seen as one of the CAM modalities. Catabolic system (see nerve-sense system) Cognition-based medicine (CBM)A newly-developed methodological system of scientific medicine; its primary element is the criteria-based assessment of therapeutic causality at the level of the individual patient. Principles and criteria of single-case causality assessment have been analysed and explained CBM enables a methodological professionalisation of clinical judgment, as well as the explanation of physician experience and expertise. CBM study designs ex-pand the current range of clinical research, extending from criteria-based causality assessment in single cases to new forms of cohort evaluations.

In anthroposophic pharmacy , raw materials are considered to be the result of the formative forces of the mineral, plant, and animal worlds. These forces are similar to the formative forces acting on the human organism, whether healthy or diseased. The study of formative forces is a specific discipline within anthroposophic pharmacy . \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved | 55 The System of Anthroposophic Medicine Holistic approach An approach to human beings that integrates all dimensions - physiologi-cal, mental, spiritual and social. Homeopathy A medical system that originated in Germany; the fundamental idea of homeopathy is the Similarity Principle, that substances capable of causing disorder in healthy subjects are used as medicines to treat similar patterns of disorder experienced by ill people. Homeopathic medicines are aimed to direct and stimulate the body's self-regulatory mechanisms. Homeopa-thy is highly individualised and takes account of the symptoms and signs of the disease, the patient's physical build, personality, temperament and genetic predispositions. Integrative medicine An approach in medicine that combines therapies based on patho-physio-logical understanding of disease with therapies exploiting the salutoge-netic potential of the diseased person, e.g. with anthroposophic medicines and therapies. Life forces Vitality forces that make human beings grow, feel healthy and regenerate after straining, injury and illness. They enable self-healing and recovery. Metabolic system The part of the body function that brings regeneration, cell growth and healing. Metabolic disorders Diseases of the inner metabolism such as diabetes mellitus, high choles-terol etc. Nerve-sense system or catabolic system The part of the body system where body cells and substances are destro-yed Phytotherapy Therapy with herbal medicinal products Potency In anthroposophic medicine, substances are made more powerful as a medical product by a process of diluting and shaking in a rhythmical way, which brings the original substance out of natural gravity and more open The System of Anthroposophic Medicine 56 | \u00a9 IVAA 2014, All Rights Reserved to the self-healing life process. Substances are usually diluted in a ratio of 1:10; these are called potencies D1, D2, D3 up to D30. Dilutions above D23, that is a substance that has been diluted 23 times in a ratio 1 ml to 10 ml, no longer contain molecules of the original substance. Natural science has, so far, no explanation for the efficacy of these higher dilu-tions. But 150 years of experience in homeopathy point to the fact that this special dilution process of higher dilutions has an influence on the life forces. Rhythmic system The balancing rhythmic activities in human physiology between the awa-reness of the senses and nerves and the metabolic system. The rhythmic system acts in any organ and function, though is mainly located in the cardiorespiratory system. Rhythmical massage therapy Gentle, deep soft massage technique with rhythmic movements, alter-nating the principles of strengthening and loosening, like the breathing rhythm or heartbeat. Rhythmical massage therapy aids the body's self-he-aling abilities. Salutogenesis The principle of concentrating on factors that support human health and well-being in contrast to factors that cause diseases. The term was coined by Aaron Antonovsky, a Professor of Medical Sociology (see Aron Anto-nowsky, Unraveling the mystery of heath. How people manage stress and stay well. Ann Arbor 1987). The 'salutogenic model' is concerned with the relationship between health, stress and coping. Spiritual The anthroposophic understanding of the spiritual dimension is that each human being is a unique immortal individual. This individual undergoes a lifelong process of development in illness and in health. In the context of anthroposophic medicine, the term 'spiritual' mostly relates to the sources of development of the individual personality, e.g. in a crisis, leading to major sense of responsibility, goodness, social awareness, self-awareness and self-confident knowledge about one's origin and future.
