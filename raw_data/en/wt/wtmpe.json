What are the symptoms of bipolar disorder? bipolar disorder is characterized by at least two episodes of mania or one episode of mania followed by one depressive episode. A manic episode is defined by a distinct period of persistently elevated or irritable mood, lasting at least one week duration with symptoms such as: - Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity - Reduced need for sleep - Pressure to keep talking - Flight of ideas or racing thoughts, - Easy distractibility - Increased goal directed activity or restlessness - Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).

What are the causes for bipolar disorder? An exact cause for bipolar disorder is still unknown. Several factors may be involved in the etiology, such as: Genetic factors: A person with a parent or sibling with bipolar disorder has 4 to 6 times higher risk of developing it, when compared to someone who doesn't. Biological abnormalities of the brain: Loss or damage of brain cells, imbalances in neurotransmitters, mitochondrial disorders are all considered in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder. 4. What are the risk factors involved in bipolar disorder? Lifestyle risk factors: - Extreme stress - Physical or sexual abuse - Physical illness - Substance abuse - Death of a loved one - Excessive worry, about work or relationships Age as a risk factor: Bipolar disorder usually develops around the age of 25 years, or between 20 to 30 years of age. However, few show symptoms only after 40 years of age. Gender as a risk factor: Bipolar disorder has been known to affect both sexes equally, however, women tend to have more depressive episodes and men have more manic episodes in their lifetime. Hormonal factors: The [thyroid](http://www.narayanahealth.org/thyroid-problems) hormones have an effect on brain functions as well as metabolism, growth and development. Abnormalities in the thyroid gland are associated with depression and bipolar disorder. Hypothyroidism, or reduced production of thyroid hormones is often diagnosed in such patients. 5. How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? Bipolar disorder causes changes in mood and behaviour that significantly alters life on a day to day basis. Affected people show intense emotional changes. Although bipolar disorder shows distinct symptoms, a single test does not confirm a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Diagnosis is achieved by a combination of methods. Before diagnosis, it may feel like something is not right and expressing yourself may be difficult. You may experience changes in mood and emotions. Feelings of hopelessness and despair can become intense. You may go from feeling full of energy one moment to feeling like your drowning in despair the next. Feeling low isn't uncommon, and is faced by many people from time to time due to stress or other factors. But, variations in mood associated with bipolar disorder are usually more extreme. Your friends or family may also notice that something is wrong. Seek help if severe mood variations affect your daily activities or make you suicidal. Physical examination There aren't any blood tests or brain scans that can diagnose bipolar disorder. Even then, a routine set of tests are done to rule out other causes such as hypothyroidism, substance abuse or side effects of any medicine.
