Consumer Health Educator. &amines questionable health practices, and the products and services that support them. Compares claims with available evidence of safety and efficacy and issues buyer beware messages when appropriate. In addition to specific information on controversial issues, the consumer health field includes consumer protection law, regulatory policies, marketing strategies, and human vulnerability. Professor Jarvis employs an epidemiological model to define, map, and analyze questionable health behavior and the public health problems of health misinformation, fraud, and quackery. ResearchMe thodologist . Teaches epidemiological and biomedical research methods. Has provided a laboratory where proponents of unusual diagnostic and/or treatment methods may explain their ideas and demonstrate their practices before students who are challenged to design studies that would test the procedures in question. Believes that most proponents of questionable healthcare have become convinced of the value of their practices because of personal experiences in settings where they have failed to apply proper controls for the clinical illusions that can fool competent, honest, and well-meaning healthcare. Encourages the open-mindedness that is essential for scientific progress, but decries emptymindedness--ie, the failure to have learned from studying the pitfalls that have befuddled clinicians and patients in the past. Teaches that no profession or culture--east or west--owns scientific methodology which consists of valid and reliable ways of teting ideas in the natural world; these yield intellectual products which become the beliefs of science; beliefs open to challenge, but which .. stand until new evidence based upon better methodology is forthcoming. Heallh Philosopher. Examines ancient cosmologies, ethnic and religion-based belief systems, and ideas that underlie behaviors that have health outcomes. Believes that diverse cultural belief systems are admirable for their sincere attempts to make sense of reality and mankind's place in the scheme of things, but that such systems were limited by prescientific notions about cause and effect and crude technology. Knowledge is progressive and change inevitable, but human nature has remained relatively unchanged.

ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE: A Critical Review A critical examination of alternative medicine approache s, including chiropractic and \"paranormal-based\" health treatments. Conflicts between alternative therapies and standard medicine, as well as patient rights and reliable sources of health information are emphasized. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.Define key terms used in reference to alternative medicine. Quackery allopathy Standard medicine vitalism Traditional medicine animism Eastern vs Western science / medicine monism Alternative medicine Complementary medicine Integrative medicine 2.Explain how quackery became \"politically correct\" in the 1990s. 1970s: Extent of questionable health behavior by American adults. 1980s: Congressional studies that identified quackery as the number one problem harmful to elderly consumers. Extent of questionable health behavior 1990s: American flirtation with quackery seen as marketing opportunity rather than social problem. Three forces driving the alternative medicine movement: economic; personal experience; ideologic 3.Describe historical facts (founder or foundation thereof, time and point of origin), theories, and practices of a variety of alternative and complementary health care systems. (Goal: to match origins, theories, and practices) Anthroposophical medicine \"healing crisis\" Ayuvedic medicine \"detoxification\" Chiropractic doctrine of correspondences Homeopathy Naturopathy Traditional Chinese Medicine 4.Describe important concepts from the psychology of deception. The physiology of deception The purpose of deception Two basic types of deception Different Kinds of Quacks Different Kinds of Users 5.Describe characteristic thinking patterns that have been observed in alternative practitioners. 6.Explain why alternative practitioners succeed despite the questionable nature of their procedures. 7.Point out how patients can be systematically deceived by dubious practitioners. Staging Taking control of the situation The invented disease The \"yet\" disease \"What's better\" How to avoid blame One-sided coin trick Patient subversion & recruitment Myths and wisecracks 8.Identify important cautions patients of alternative practitioners should understand. At your own risk Alternative providers not held to rational medical standards of conduct Compensation may be reduced Dangerous notions Financial exploitation ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A CriJical Review, William T.

Compare homeopathy. 1 Rooted in ancient theory that hypothesized four humors (black bile, yellow bile, blood, phlegm), four conditions (hot, cold, wet, dry) and balancing by \"opposites\"; eg, fever (hot) due to excess blood, therefore, cool by blood-letting. Coined by homeopathy inventor Hahnemann to describe medical practices of his day (c. 1810). 2 A system of medical practice making use of all measures proved of value in the treatment of disease. A proposition or situation offering a choice between two or more things only one of which may be chosen. Any medical practice or intervention that (a) Jacks sufficient documentation in the United States for safety and effectiveness against specific diseases and conditions; (b) is not generally taught in U.S. medical schools; and, (c) is not generally reimbursable by health insurance providers.2 A faker or fraud. 1 : serving to fill out or complete; 2: mutually supplying each other's lack. Complementary medical practices that are not part of standard medicine because they are incompatible with scientific thinking, ie, they are inseparable from a metaphysical worldview that is in confl!ct with the natural sciences, or they pretend to heal in a manner that would supplant medical intervention.3 2b Lacking originality, or individuality. Used to denigrate standard medicine as too conservative. An eccentric person that sincerely believes his oddball ideas. A system for the cure of disease based upon dogma set forth by its promulgator. (eg, anthroposophical medicine (Steiner), chiropractic [Palmer], homeopathy (Hahnemann], ergonomic medicine (Reich].) One who adheres to a cult. Doublespeak is language that pretends to communicate but does not, that makes the bad seem good, the repulsive appear attractive or at least tolerable. It is language that avoids, shifts, or denies responsibility, language at variance with its real or purported meaning. Basic to doublespeak is incongruity; the incongruity between what is said, or left unsaid, and what is; between the word and the referent. It perverts the essential function of language, which is communication, in order to mislead, distort, deceive, circumvent. Doublespeak is the deliberate use of language as a weapon or tool...to achieve their ends at the expense of others.4 A sect or school which professes to select what is best from all systems of medicine.5 Doctor relying upon experience alone. One who provides publicity; a press agent. The actions of a 'flack.'6 An intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing.7 One with marginal or extremist views. The deceptive promotion, advertisement, distribution or sale of articles, intended for human or animal use, that are represented as being effective to diagnose, prevent, cure, treat, or mitigate disease (or other conditions), or provide a beneficial effect on health, but which have not been scientifically proven safe and effective for such purposes. Such practices may be deliberate, or done without adequate knowledge or understanding of the article.8 [Note. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not require that intent to defraud be proved as is required in ordinary fraud cases.] A pattern of billing Medicare for services held not to be medically-necessary. c The act also made health fraud against any third party payer a criminal offense.9 Holding unorthodox opinions or doctrines. (Gr. hetero denotes \"other'' or \"different\" as opposed to homo \"the same\"). To promote by showmanship. Tending to produce iconoclasm or overthrow what is established (the influence of modern science).10 One who assumes an identity or title not his own for the purpose of deception. Used by proponents of unapproved drugs and devices, and unregulated medical care to sanitize their practices.11 The idea of integrating the \"best\" of standard (proven) and nonstandard (unproven) medicine popularized by Andrew Weil, MD (Ed. note: compare to eclectic). The term cannot hold up to close scrutiny because medical procedures cannot be judged as \"best\" un ti! they are tested. Erroneous or false belief; belief 1 state of mind in which trust or confidence is placed in some person or thing. 2 conviction of the truth of some statement or the reality of some being or phenomenon. Synonyms: faith, credence, credit. Wrong information.12 Not mere ignorance (not knowing) or stupidity (the inability to reason), but what people think is true but is not. When deeply-held, health misinformation becomes the misbelief that drive the decision-making process that can lead to needless tragedy. A person who sells quack medicines from a platform. An independent individual who refuses to conform with his group. Straight doctrine. Derived from the field of religion that institutionalizes belief by dogma. From Gceekphysikos \"nature\"; \"to denote that every practitioner of medicine was to be skilled in Nature and must strive to know what man is in relation to food, drink, occupation and which effect each of these has upon the other.\"13 From Greek psychikos \"of the soul\" [from psyche soul). 1 of or relating to the psyche; 2 lying outside the sphere of physical science or knowledge : immaterial, moral, or spiritual in origin or force. aUnited States Food and Drug Administration. bThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1997 (aka Kennedy-Kasse baum Act). crnsurance company case-reviev,ers who pave never seen the patients often serves as judges of whether or not a treatment was medically necessary. The language of the bill invites readers to believe that denial of reimbursement by a case-reviewer as \"medically unnecessary\" could be construed as constituting \"health fraud\" by physicians.

Characteristic of a sect; limited in character or scope. The historical and psychological study and classification of changes in the significance of words or word forms viewed as factors in linguistic development. Mixture of the art of patient care and the science of understanding and managing diseases and disorders of the mind and body. Scientific aspects rooted in the basic sciences (anatomy, physiology, biochemistry--including nutrition, microbiology, pharmacology, medical physics and more), and evidence-based procedures proved to be of value. The art of medical care includes all that is done to meet the psycho-social needs of patients. Standard medicine is highly tolerant of rituals and practices rooted in cultural traditions, but rejects any practices that may divert patients from necessary medical care. Standard medicine supports consumer protection and accepts legal accountability for errors. Standard medicine reflects the professional standards of the community in which it is practiced. 3 Medical care that does not conform to such standards is 11onstandard medicine. 1: The handing down of information, beliefs and customs by word of mouth or by example from one generation to another without written instruction; 2: an inherited pattern of thought or action (as a religious practice or social custom); 3: cultural continuity in social attitudes and institutions.\" (opposite to \"iconoclastic\"--see above). Traditional medicine involves indigenous practices that have existed since ancient times rooted in prescientific cosmological paradigms ( eg, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurvedic Medicine, Native American Medicine, Shamanism). Medical inteiventions not taught widely at U.S. medical schools, or generally available in U.S. hospitals: 19 Not orthodox. From the weasel's habit of sucking the contents out of an egg while leaving the shell superficially intact: a word used in order to evade or retreat from a direct or forthright statement or position. Weasel word(s have) become more than just an evasion or retreat. They can make you hear things that are not being said, accept as truths things that have only been implied, and believe things that have only been suggested. When you hear a weasel word, you automatically hear the implication. Not the real meaning, but the meaning it wants you to hear.20 Misnomer used to characterize the scientific method as culturally-based rather than universal. Although some aspects of the art of medicine are cultural, physical laws, human anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and so forth are universal. Cultures of both the east and west have employed scientific methodologies and have contributed to the world's body of scientific knowledge.

Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 3 HOW QUACKERY BECAME \"POLITICALLY CORRECT' ~rom 1~83 to 1994, the USA went_ from shock and indignation over quackery, to social acceptance. The history of changes m termmology used by the Amencan Cancer Society reveals that what has been historically shunned as \"quackery\" has gained a kind of \"political correctness.\" From its beginning in 1915, the American Cancer Society gathered information on quackery by what came to be called The Ad Hoc Committee on Quackery. In 1954, to avoid the liability associated with automatically labeling anyone a \"quack\" who's methods were listed the committee's name was changed to The Committee on New and Unproven Methods of Treatment. In 1970, the word \"treatment\" was replaced with \"management\" to include dubious methods of diagnosis and prevention. It was then called The Committee on Unproven Methods of Cancer Management. In 1989, the name was changed to The Committee on Questionable Methods of Cancer Management in order to differentiate between unproven methods that were not seen as promising and experimental methods that were moving through the scientific system. In 1995, because of the creation of the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine, and changes in ACS organization that designated it to _be a subcommittee, the name was changed to its present Subcommittee on Alternative and Complementary Methods of Cancer Management.\" Through all of these name changes, the work of the committee has remained the same--to examine unapproved and unpromising methods of cancer management and to warn patients not to use them. Marcia Angell, MD, Executive Editor, New England Journal of Medicine stated that the very name \"alternative medicine\" is Orwellian \"newspeak,\" implying that it is a viable option. Its a new name for snake oil. 1 Experts in the psychology of deception speak of \"sleight of mind\" techniques such as doublespeak William Lutz, editor of the Quarterly Journal of Doublespeak, explained, \"Doublespeak is language that pretends to communicate but does not, that makes the bad seem good, the repulsive appear attractive or at least tolerable. Doublespeak is the deliberate use of language as a weapon or tool ... to achieve their ends at the expense of others.\" 2 (Also see \"weasel words\" in glossary). \"Alternative\" medicine.Altemative is defined as \"a proposition or situation offering a choice between two or more things only one of which may be chosen\" (emphasis added) (Webster's Dictiona,y). Standard medicine abounds with treatment \u00b7 \u00b7alternatives, but all standard drugs and medical devices must be proved safe and effective, and all procedures must represent standards of care with responsible oversight by competent, accountable providers. Nonstandard \"alternative\" (distinguished hereafter by quotation marks) methods include a broad spectrum of procedures, and it is incorrect to refer to them in a manner that suggests that they are equally harmful, or have equal potential to be eventually proved to be of value. The only generalization that can be made about \"alternative\" methods is that they define themselves by what they are not: they are not part of standard health care. \"Alternative\" medical methods not only lack scientific proof of safety and/or efficacy, they often lack a plausible scientific basis. The National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative Medicine (NIHOAM) says that \"alternative\" medicine includes: Any medical practice or intervention that (a) lacks sufficient documentation in the United States for safety and effectiveness against specific diseases and conditions; (b) is not generally taught in U.S. medical schools; and, (c) is not generally reimbursable by health insurance providers. 3 \"Complementary\" Medicine. Stung by instances in which patients have been lured from life-saving therapy, some promoters have abandoned the concept of \"alternative\" medicine in favor of the more benign idea of \"complementary\" medicine. Complementary meaning \"1: serving to fill out or complete; 2: mutually supplying each other's lack\" (Webster's Dictionary). Complementary is a standard medical term applied to methods used to enhance patient care and comfort (ie, the \"art\" of medicine). Included are emotional support, compassion, and religious rituals that are meaningful to the patient. Because of differences in culture found among patients, and traditional religious tolerance, the range of acceptable practices is great on an individual level. Many institutions take a tolerance without endorsement attitude toward anything that is legal. However, complementary practices that are to be promoted within a medical institution have important limitations. Seemingly, the only reasonable objection to nonstandard complementary therapy would be if it had potential for direct harm. However, anyone familiar with patient care knows that the realities are not so simple. Psychological interventions are seductive. Common sense alone is enough for people to know that it feels better to approach life's difficult situations with optimism rather than pessimism. Psychological approaches to patient care (eg, imagery, visualization, meditation, laughter, denial, belief, prayer, etc) may improve patient optimism, and thus, the quality of their lives. However, if patients come to believe that their attitudes and mental activities evoke a \"mind over matter\" effect that is equally as powerful, or more powerful, than medical procedures on the biology of their diseases, they may abandon effective, albeit, unpleasant medical procedures in favor of emotionally satisfying psychological inteiventions. Another type of unacceptable \"complementary\" methods are those with an inseparable rati?nale which is_ incons~stent with scientific knowledge. For instance, acupuncture for pain control is not dependent upon ancient _metaphys1cal_nouons about chi and balancing yin/yang. Acupuncture's effect may be explained in modern terms of endorphm release, pam-gate theory, or counter-irritation. Therefore, a patient does not have to be indoctrinated with a metaphysical ideology in order to understand the rationale behind the therapy he is to undergo. On the other hand, Therapeutic Touch (TT) is inseparable ALTERNA1TVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T, Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 4 from the claim that energy fields surround the body, that these can be manipulated, and that energy is transferred from a \"healer\" to a patient. Further, TI involves \"non-contact touch,\" an oxymoron that encourages irrational, magical thinking at a time when personal judgment is necessary for making sound clinical decisions. Metaphysical ideologies are quasi\u00ad religious systems that encourage people to believe on the basis of faith more than evidence. Although these systems pay lipservice to any aspect of science that can be used to persuade people, they denigrate scientific thinking when it conflicts with the system. Complementary health care that indoctrinates people into a metaphysical belief system is a hidden method of evangelism. Sick people are psychologically vulnerable to being converted to new ways of thinking. Unscientific \"complementary\" medicine introduces confusion into patient care making it impossible to differentiate between the effects of standard medicine and the complementary treatment(s). Such care also exposes patients to deception by charlatans, or misguidance by cranks or ideologists who believe in their practices with delusional fervor. Complementary practitioners often employ a \"heads I win, tails you lose\" psychological strategy in which they take credit for any positive effects experienced by the patient, aqd assign blame for any negative effects to the patient's standard treatments. For example, because many potentially effective cancer therapies have unpleasant side-effects, and complementary treatments are usually \"feel good\" methods promoted with conviction and enthusiasm by devotees, the result may be to undermine the patient's confidence in standard therapies and reduce compliance, or have th~ patient wish to abandon standard care altogether. Cassileth reported that 40% of cancer patients who used both unapproved and approved therapies eventually abandoned the latter. 4 Since providers of questionable \"complementary\" therapies are often uncritical of questionable \"alternatives,\" and tend to be hypercritical of standard medicine, it is only a short step back from to the \"complementary\" to the \"alternative\" position for patients who have been flirting with fringe therapies. Cooperation with nonscientific \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" practitioners poses both legal and ethical dilemmas for responsible health care providers. Any method that has not met the minimum standard of safety is objectionable because it cannot be employed without incurring the liability for physical or psychological harm that may occur. Further, health professionals who consider patient w.ell-being a sacred responsibility are likely to have great reservations about cooperating with practitioners whose ideologies \u00b7 -'may undermine a patient's confidence in standard health care. Such practitioners are often two-faced behaving as expected in the medical setting, but act quite differently when in their own private settings. Physician interest in alternative / complementary medicine. Care must be used when interpreting reports that physicians are interested in alternative medicine. Physicians are primarily interested in what their patients are doing. They hear about alternative medicine in the media, so they are curious. Current studies of the attitudes of medical doctors toward alternative medicine consistently find a combination of interest in these topics coupled with ignorance about them. There is no trend to suggest that physicians perceive complementary medicine as useful and/or effective. 5 Unless predisposed to believing in a unscientific ideology, the more a physician learns about these procedures, the more negative his or her attitudes are likely to become. Important Milestones in A Changing Scene 1983 -The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Aging found medical quackery to be the #1 harmful consumer fraud aimed at elderly. 6 1984 -The U.S. House of Representatives independently confirmed that quackery was the #1 harmful consumer fraud aimed at the nation's elderly. It estimated that the elderly lose $10 billion a year to quackery.7 1987 -National Louis Harris poll found that 26.6% of the American public reports having used one or more questionable health care treatments. This translates a population estimate of approximately 46 million American adults.8 It was estimated that quackery cost S27 billion annually. 9 1990 -Congress passed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) in an attempt to control the use of deceptive language in labeling and advertising of foods and dietary supplements. 1991 -The NIH to established the Office of Alternative Medicine. Originally, the OAM's Advisory Committee was to be balanced between believers and skeptics, but the believers resisted. The result was that the report to the NIH on alternative medical systems and practices in the USA, Alternative Medicine: Expanding Medical Horizons10 was a picture of the situation through the eyes of true believers. The foreword reflected the attitude of the U.S. Public Health Service toward the report: ... it should be pointed out that this document does not reflect endorsement of these therapies or recommendations for research by the NIH, the U.S. Public Health Service, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (emphasis theirs). It reports on a series of opinions (emphasis added) expressed by nongovernment participants in the workshops ... _ ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Critical Review, William T. Jatvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. The Nlli cautions readers not to seek the therapies described in this document for serious health problems ~thout consultation with a li<=<:nsed physician. The Nlli further cautions that many of the therapies descn'bed have not been subjected to rigorous scientific investigation to prove safety or efficacy; and many have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (emphasis theirs). (p.vii) 5 1993 -A survey found that 34% of Americans used \"unconventional medicine\" in 1990. Expenditures associated with the u~e. of unconv~ntional therapy in ~99? am~unted to approximately $13.7 billion, three quarters of which ($10.3 bllhon) was paid out of pocket. This f11ure 1s comparable to the $12.8 billion spent out of pocket annually for all hospitalizations in the United States. 1 1994 -Congress passed the Dietary Supplements Health & Education Act which, instead of improving the labeling and advertising of supplements a~ the NLEA intended, weakened labeling requirements, and safety by limiting the FDA's ability to regulate these products. 1995-7 Due to media reports on the alleged high demand for nonstandard care, several managed care orgapizations announce that they will cover some forms of \"alternative medicine.\" 1998 -Sixty-four percent of 117 medical schools reported that they were offering either elective or required courses in alternative medicine. There was great diversity in the nature and content of such course. 12 FORCES DRIVING Tiffi ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MOVEMENT Ideology \u00b7 \u00b7The Fetzer Institute and its agenda. The Fetzer Institute was founded and endowed by John E. Fetzer (1901-91), a pioneer in broadcasting and former owner of the Detroit Tigers. The Fetzer Foundation was incorporated in 1962. It became the Fetzer Institute in 1990 when the focus of its mission changed from grant making to mind-body health education and research. Mr. Fetzer intended the Institute to pursue \"freedom of spirit,\" and endowed it with $230 million.13 FI is devoted to advancing beliefs about the relationship of body, mind and spirit. FI use of \"spirit\" refers to the alleged human soul. This is depicted by a stone relief of the ancient Egyptian wings and sun (ba and Ra) symbolic of the soul flying away and joining the sun god to circle forever in the heavens. FI funds the chair at Harvard of Dr. David Eisenberg who advances the cause of \"alternative\" medicine. A study by his grmr claimed that the use of unconventional medicine in the United States was greater than had been previously reported. This was inaccurate, but went unchallenged. FI, using Eisenberg, and journalist Bill Moyer, produced a PBS television series called Healing and The Mind. The Bill Moyers special avoided disconfirming evidence and promoted healing methods known to be ineffective. Moyers, who clearly lacked the skills needed to assess medical claims, presented what was little more than a travelogue in which a \"golly, gee whiz\" attitude was manifested toward every metaphysical claim no matter how transparent. Chinese qi gong charlatanism was presented with incredible naivete. The Moyer's show was an instance in which public television sold itself for infomercial use without warning its viewing audience. Contrary to Moyers' message that \"western science\" has failed to recognize the importance of the mind in health and disease, standard medicine has acknowledged that mental functioning can produce physical disorders, and be tapped for therapy, for at least a century. FI's reference to the \"spirit\" represents the ideological concept of vitalism: \"a doctrine that the functions of a living organism are due to a vital principle distinct from physicochemical forces\", and appears to be another effort to prove the existence of a human \"soul\" that manifested itself in 19th Century spiritualism, parapsychology, near-death and alleged \"past-life\" experiences. Vitalists attack medicine for being too scientific denigrating science as reductionist, materialistic, and mechanistic (i.e., versus holistic, ethereal, vitalistic). Zimmerman exposed the aggressive efforts by FI to \"broaden the view of science to include ways of knowing that are beyond the analytical and experimental models,\" to \"incorporate subjective and intuitive and appreciative ways of knowing\" into American health care. Zimmerman pointed out that FI's agenda is directly and provocatively antiscientific since science is based specifically upon analytical and experimental methods. He reports that \"Fetzer has acknowledged its leading role in the media blitz for alternative health. FI's director of international relations, Carol Hegedus said last year in reference to the 1993 New England Journal of Medicine study of the use of unconventional medicine by Eisenberg, and Bill Moyer's PBS-TV series Healing and the Mind that the 'synchronicity of it all is not random.' The effort was 'quite purposeful in creating attention' for the mind/body movement and its unconventional methods.\" Most shocking was the revelation that Consumer's Union has covered up the fact that FI \"facilitated\" its mind/body series and book Mind/Body Medicine. 14 This is one of the most significant developments in the promotion of quackery and the political destruction of responsible medicine in America. FI's subversion of Consumer's Union is troubling. FI publishes Advances which reports on mind-body medicine studies, philosophy, and speculation. Rather than advancing human thinking to accomodate the splendid scientific advancements represented by such ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A OiJicol Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 6 achievements as the human gnome project and the Hubble space telescope, Fl's agenda regresses human thinking to the prescientific era of monism and animism. M_oni~m holds ~hat there is onl~ one fundamental reality, that it is inseparable, and essentially metaphysical (beyond sc1ent1fic analysis and understandmg) and mystical. Nida and Smalley elucidate the concept in their description of animism (from anima, Latin meaning \"spirit\" or \"soul\"): The first assumption of most animists in that reality is all of one piece. That is to say, there is not the same water-tight distinction between human-beings and animals, or between animate and inanimate existence. Animals may be ancestors of men, people may change into animals, trees and stones may possess souls, and the mana (emphasis added) of a stick may be transferred to a man. In fact, in some groups,almost every object in the universe is viewed as possessing some amount of life force--the spiritual, nonmaterial substance without which nothing could exist and that in reality is i!s true character and secret of its power (emphasis added). This life force, or soul-stuff, exists in greater concentrations in famous men, strong charms, revered fetishes, and powerful gods. In essence the force is the same everywhere, it is only distributed in different quantities ... . 15 Seduction by Personal Experience Personal experience is fraught with hazards of misinterpretation. Nevertheless, personal experience continues to produce convincing personal testimonials used to sell dubious health care, and even leads people with scientific training into pathological science. Most people seem to understand the unreliability of personal experience on an intellectual level, but are unable to resist its influence when they are the players. When the influence of personal experience involves someone with financial resources or political power, the effects upon society are dramatic. Crusade ofa Multimillionaire. A set of publications vigorously promoting \"alternative\" medicine,Alternative Medicine Yellow \u00b7 \"Pages and Alternative Medicine; The Definitive Guitle is published by Burton Goldberg, a wealthy Florida land developer. Goldberg became a believer in alternative medicine, he says, because his girl friend's 19-year-old daughter was saved by unorthodox medicine. He alleges that the girl suffered from mental illness \"caused by hypoglycemia, an imbalance created by food allergies, problems in her pancreas, and an overgrowth of bad bacteria in her gastrointestinal tract.\"16 These are dubious diagnoses, but he believes in them and disdains doctors who say otherwise. His personal experience motivated him to expend a great deal of effort and expense to publicize alternative medicine. Although the book cover declares that it contains \"everything you must know about effective therapies\" (emphasis added), inside a carefully-crafted disclaimer that appears several times throughout the book hedges on the claim that therapies are effective by declaring that by definition, \"alternative\" methods \"include those that have not been investigated or approved by any government or regulatory agency,\" and that \"ultimately, you, the reader, must take full responsibility for your health and how you use this book.\" The idea that consumers must \"read the fine print\" to find the disclaimers reflects the traditional duplicity of caveat emptor. Abuse of Power by Political Leaders. Political insiders Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) and former Congressman Berkley Bedell (D-IA) forced the NIH to establish the Office of Alternative Medicine. In 1992, Tom Harkin (D-lowa) head of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee inserted an \"earmark\" on the NIH budget report directing NIH-chief Bernadine Healy, MD, to establish an office of alternative medicine. Agency heads respond to such earmarks because they fear their budget will following in the following year if they do not.17 Harkin's enthusiasm for alternative medicine was based upon his belief that a bee pollen preparation marketed by Royden Brown cured his allergies. A few months before, Brown paid the FTC a $200,000 settlement and agreed to stop making health claims, just like Harkin's, for his product. Some believe Browns' remedy may have been adulterated with an effective medication. This may never be known because the ingredients of Brown's bee pollen remedy were secret, and Brown died of a heart attack while basking in a hot tub a short time later.18 Harkin was inspired and aided by former Congressman Berkley Bedell (D-IA) who lobbied his former colleagues to gain support for the idea. Bedell believed that his Lyme disease had been cured by a special cow's milk product purchased from a farmer and that his prostate cancer had been cured by a quack cancer remedy from Canada (714X) which has been removed from the market there. Bedell also had standard therapy for these problems but gives no credit to them for his improved health status. Senator Orrin Hatch has done much to advance the cause of alternative medicine. Although a case can be made that Hatch is motivated by financial considerations (Utah is the home of the multibillion dollar herbal supplement industry and Hatch has some stock in a small supplement company), his strong, persistent advocacy for alternative medicine seems to stem more from his personal involvement. According to a Utah press report, Hatch has had chelation therapy and infusions of intravenous vitamins by a fringe MD.19 Hatch's support for alternative medicine was clearly expressed during the discussions of Senate Bill S3569 (aka the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill). S3569 included provisions for taking strong action against health fraud (estimated to b~ a $100 billion problem--10% of $1 trillion reimbursed health care costs--for 1997). Hatch expressed concerns to the bill's author, Senator William Cohen, that the bill's healt~ care fraud and abuse data ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Oitical Review, William T. Ja!Vis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. collection program would hurt alternative medicine. Hatch stated: the alternative medicine community has expressed concerns about this provision. I have received communications from, for example, the American Preventive Medical Associationd and the National Nutritional Foods Association.e While we are all supportive of strong efforts to weed out health care fraud and abuse, I hope that the Senator from Maine will agree that we do not want to create an opportunity for those who might want to eliminate or discourage alternative treatments by threatening fraud actions under the new language of the bill.20 7 Senator Cohen assured Hatch that he has \"long been interested in promoting alternative medical treatments and I do not have any desire to enact a new law which might treat such providers unfairly.\" Hatch asked Cohen if he \"would ... agree that the mere practice of unconventional or nonstandard therapies would not fall within the definition of fraud?\" Cohen answered that \"the practice of alternative medicine in itself would not constitute fraud.\" Hatch was also instrumental in widening the public purse to chiropractors beginning in the year 2000. White House budget estimators projected that the new policy would increase chiropractic reimbursement by more than $200 million over the next. 5 years. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposal would cost more than $900 million. Nevertheless, grass roots lobbying and Rep. Phil Crane (R-IL) pushed the bill through the House. The Senate estimated that the new policy would increase chiropractic reimbursement by $2 billion and nearly killed the bill. However, aggressive support from Orrin Hatch and Charles Grassley (R-IA) got it passed. Perhaps the fact Hatch has two daughters married to chiropractors is part of the reason for his support. 2 Washington State. In 1997 Washington state required health insurance companies to reimburse policyholders for \"alternative\" care if they have done so for standard care. The state insurance commissioner was a fan of alternative medicine. The federal employees insurance carrier, ERISA, sued to be exempted from the state law. King County \u00b7 \u00b7Washington also opened a taxpayer supported alternative medicine clinic. The County Council is made up of a number of devotees to naturopathy described in a New York Times syndication as \"rhapsodizing about garlic pills and the healing power of ginkgo tree extract.\" One member says that he owes his health to a dietary supplement of enzymes and vitamins. another extols acupuncture. The result is that the Council voted unanimously to establish a natural health clinic funded by tax-payers' money. They hope to use either state or federal money to start the clinic sometime this year. Costs are estimated to be Sl-2 million annually. 22 Economics Health Food/Dietary Supplement Industry Lobby. Efforts to improve the nutrition marketplace hit their zenith with the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA). When it came time to implement the intent of the NLEA on dietary supplements, the health food industry reacted. Health foods industry concerns about the NLEA were laid out in the lead article in Natural Food Merchandiser (Jan, 1992). An industry attorney referred to four new federal regulations that reinforce required truth in labeling as \"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" for the health food, herbal and dietary supplement industries. Worrying the health food industry was that: J) Unfounded health claims could not be made for foods. Claims were to be limited to associations between calcium & osteoporosis; fats & heart disease; fats & cancer; and, sodium & hypertension. Because the links between some of these food factors and specific diseases are still open to question, many health experts believe that government endorsement of health claims which are based on statistical associations is unwise. They believe that such claims should be based upon sound public health science as is done with immunization, fluoridation and pasteurization. The health food industry apparently is worried because this proposed rule undermines the fundamental concept of \"health foods\" which implies that special health benefits not generally available from conventional foods are conferred by their use. 2) Herbs whose only known use is for medicinal effect would be regulated accordingly. Ron Caleb, president of the herb Research Foundation, complained that the proposed restraints on herbals would be \"the worst news in decades for herbs, supplements and consumer health.\" 3) FDA would require food supplements to be limited to potencies similar to those found in conventional foods. One would think that an industry which constantly extolls the term \"natural\" would rejoice over such logical thinking. Not so. The so\u00ad called \"natural foods\" business is about as natural as silicone breast implants--pills are the engine that pulls its train. d An organization of renegade medical pr~ctitioners who employ chelation therapy . e A health food trade association. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A CriJicol Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 8 4) FDA would use Reference Dietary Intakes (RD/s) instead of Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) as a point of reference for nutrition labeling infomzation. J.B. Cordaro, chief salesman for the supplement trade association \"Council for Res~~nsible Nutrition\" alleges that this would adversely affect the public's health -a claim which is refuted by every nutnt10n and health pronouncement made by health and nutrition authorities in recent history (eg, NAS, US Surgeon General, US Dietary Guidelines). His real concern seems to have been his guess that this change could slash supplement sales by 40% by changing the public's perception of the levels of vitamins that are needed. How the Health Food Industry Deceived Congress and the Public. Starting in 1991, the health food industry rallied its forces for an all-out write-in campaign to congress to undo the advancements intended by the NLEA Recalling their success with the 1976 Proxmire Amendment, industry leaders hope to scare election-minded legislators into doing the dastardly thing--stand up for the well-heeled special interest groups rather than for public health and consumer protection. The industry used the Big Lie technique by using the false theme \"Write to Congress today or kiss your vitamins goodbye!\" Misled by this, people were outraged and responded by mail. There are at least 7,900 health foods stores, over seven million multilevel marketing company distributors (it is not known what proportion are in herbal and supplement sales), over 50,000 health care practitioners (eg, chiropractors, nutrition consultants, naturopaths, orthomolecular practitioners) and their deceived or deluded followers who will clamor for nonregulation. In reality, people who choose to believe these deviant providers will be unaffected by regulatory actions because they disbelieve the spokespersons of nutrition science and government regulatory agencies in preference to the sellers of nutritional magic. In 1994, congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health & Education Act deregulating products that sustain the ~uackery industry. The dietary supplement lobby reportedly paid $2.5 Million to congressmen to get their message across 3. Managed Care. Even more damaging to health care consumers has been the rise of so-called \"managed care.\" The failure .. of the Clinton administration to achieve the goal of a government sponsored health care financing program caused the health insurance industry to rush into a private system known as \"managed care.\" Under this system, physicians became subserviant to business people rather than the other way around. Thus, the guiding principles of commercialism gained dominance over the ethics of professionalism. Commercialism vs Professionalism. John McArthur, DBA, of the Harvard Business School and Francis Moore, MD, of the Harvard Medical School point out that: There are two contrasting streams, two distinct cultural traditions, for providing services in the United States: the commercial and the professional. While these two traditions stand in sharp contrast to each other, they have shared a central role in the evolution of our society and its institutions. It is our purpose here to explore threats to the quality and scope of medical care that arise when the tradition of medical professionalism is ove11aken (emphasis added) by the commercial ethic and by corporations seeking profit for investors from the clinical care of the sick.1 The differences between the cultures of commerce and professionalism is at the heart of the problems disrupting managed care today; and, as shall be shown below, involve the same principles that divide quackery and standard medicine. An editorial in the same issue of JAMA makes our point: \"The American Medical Association (AMA) [was) formed in 1847 for the purpose of setting up a code of ethics and distinguishing between physicians and quacks.\" And, \"Professional medical goals can be protected only if they are well understood. 24 The Culture of Professionalism. Professionalism is rooted in principles established by Hippocrates, the \"father of medical science.\" Hippocrates coined the term \"physician\" from physikos, Greek for \"nature,\" to denote that health and disease are natural, not supernatural, processes. The notion that healers possess supernatural powers (eg, faith healing, Therapeutic Touch, animal magnetism) lingers in the minds of many people, and is also seen in the messianic charisma of egomaniacal quacks. Hippocrates told physicians to stop taking credit for their cures, the body has its own inherent healing capabilities; therefore,post hoc ergo propter hoc (\"after it, therefore, because of it\") was faulty logic. The best that can be done is to aid these, and the worst that can be done is to impede these self-healing processes--p1imum non nocere, \"above all, do no harm.\" Further, because of the body's inherent healing ability, a physician could not know whether a remedy or nature brought about a cure; therefore, physicians could only learn what remedies do not work when a patient did not recover. The idea of learning mainly from failures also underlies the reality that science is better at finding what does not work than it is at making medical breakthroughs. Hippocrates urged physicians to seek out new remedies, but to be skeptical, ie, from Greek, skeptomai, \"look at something carefully,\" \"examine,\" and \"consider\" it. 25 Hippocrates taught humility, cooperation among physicians, social responsibility, and above all the commitment to the patient. McArthur and Moore point out: The fundamental act of professio\"nal medical care is the assumption of responsibility for the patient's welfare--an unwritten contract ... acknowledged by the physician that \"we will take care of you.\" The-essential image of the professional is that of a practitioner who values the patient's welfare above his or her own and provides service ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. even at a fiscal loss and despite discomfort or inconvenience. 26 By contrast, McArthur and Moore note that: When a corporation employing physicians seeks profit by selling their services, the physician-employees cease to act as free agents. Professional commitment to patient care is subordinated to new rules of practice that assure the profitability of the corporation. 9 The Culture of Commercialism. The commercial culture is rooted in the principles of Adam Smith, the \"father of modern economics.\" Smith is the hero to free market ideologists such as Milton Friedman, whose book Free To Choose strongly influenced Ronald Reagan, advocated abolishing the FDA Adam Smith held that the wealth of nations would mount with each worker--including the quack--doing what he did best. Sociologist Herbert Spencer taught that government should not suppress quackery on the basis of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Evolutionary progress meant that the fit should survive and prosper, whereas the unfit should perish. Society, like nature, was red in tooth and claw. Government action protecting those so unfit as to succumb to quackery only impeded society's progress. 27 The culture of commercialism celebrates the profit motive, the law of supply and demand, competition, advertising, and so forth. Free market ideologists advocate laissez faire, with its inherent doctrine of caveat emptor, \"let the buyer beware.\" Caveat Emptor I Caveat Vendor. Caveat emptor is based upon the equality of bargaining positions of buyer and seller. In medieval times this was practical because people bargained for common products with friends and neighbors. As trade expanded, buyers were forced to trust the word of strangers that items were what they were represented to be. During the 15th century the concept of caveat vendor (\"let the seller beware\") became the rule for marketplace situations in which buyers and sellers were on unequal terms.28 The judge charged the jury in a case involving the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act saying: \"This law was not passed to protect experts, especially not to protect scientific men who know the value and \u00b7 \u00b7meaning of drugs, but for the protection of ordinary citizens.\" 29 Justice Frankfurter also restated the principle of caveat vendor in a case interpreting the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: \"The purposes of this legislation ... touch phases of the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. 1130 Does regulation inlnl>it, and the free market system enhance, the development of useful new medicines? Economic libertarians such as Milton Friedman advocate abolishing the FDA and letting a free marketplace function on the belief that better products and services will result. History does not support this view. Americans deregulated medicine in the 1840s under Jacksonian democracy. A wide open health care marketplace did not result in a record of achievement. In 1860 Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes told the Massachusetts Medical Society that \"If the entire pharmacopeia were to be thrown into the sea, it would be all the better for mankind and all the worse for the fishes!\" 3 It was also a period referred to by historian Stewart Holbrook as \"the golden age of quackery\" because of the economic success of the patent medicine industry. 32 How much progress can be attributed to the evolution of technology, and how much to regulation? One guage involves chiropractic. During the same time period, chiropractic has been allowed to exist on its good intentions rather than proven merit. Although it has existed since 1895, chiropractic has yet to produce a single recognizeable contribution to the world's body of health care knowledge. Chiropractors have been permitted to reap the benefits of a health care delivery system without incurring any of the obligations. The same can be said for homeopathy and naturopathy. Apparently, the requirements of regulation do provide incentives for scientific improvement. Ac.countability. Professionalism supports the accountability inherent in the principle of caveat vendor. Standard medicine cooperates with the FDA regarding medicines and medical devices, and conducts peer reviews of other procedures. The FDA Center for Drug Safety has reported that 80% of reports on adverse reactions to drugs come from pharmaceutical companies themselves while virtually none are reported by the dietary supplement industry. 33 Commercial interests can escape accountability by providing label warnings. Such fulfills the \"duty to warn.\" The freedom allowed commercialism to confuse the issues in our society is exemplified by the tobacco industry. The industry uses free speech to misinform the public on the health effects of its products, while at the same time escaping accountability by placing warning labels on packaging and in advertising. Incompatibility of Profes.5ionalism and Commercialism. The hopeful idea for commercializing health care administration was that marketplace forces would stimulate inventiveness and marketplace efficiency. Unfortunately, the social planners did not fully understand the contrasting cultures they were trying to marry. And herein lies the common thread tying the problem of quackery to those perplexing problems within managed health care. Little wonder that it has been so e~sy for some marketing-minded HMOs to integrate \"alternative\" medicine into their programs. McArthur and Moore describe the heart of the problem: The fundamental objective of commerce in providing medical care is achieving an exce~s of revenue over costs AL1ERNATIVE MEDICINE; A CridcaJ Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. while caring for the sick, ensuring profit for corporate providers, investors, or insurers. A central feature in enhancing net of income over expense in a competitive market is a reduction in volume or quality of services so as to reduce costs, while maintaining prices to the purchaser. In this setting, the operation of market forces is hampered because patients and families can rarely acquire the information necessary to discriminate as to suitability and quality among alternative clinical services and providers. Without consumer input, market fo_rces often fail completely, or behave perversely ... In purchasing commercial services, the public has learned to beware both of low quality and excessive pricing, as expressed in the Latin phrase caveat emptor--\"let the buyer beware.\" The American public is gradually becoming aware that caveat emptor may soon become caveat morbidus--\"let the patient beware. 1134 10 Competition Among Professionals. In~erent in marketplace competition is advancing oneself as superior to others in the same business. Jameson states that \"it is the principle of self-advertisement that really defines quackery. 1135 Superiority claims automatically turns colleagues into competitors. Health professionals have traditionally worked together against humanity's common enemies of disease and death. The Sherman Antitrust Act exempts cooperative scientific endeavors from the rules governing the business community (conspiracy, restraint of trade). In the world of commerce, companies jealously protect trade secrets, and \"corporate espionage\" is a lucrative form of economic treason; scientists work in the open and readily share information. Describing protocols in terms so clear that it enables others to reproduce their work facilitates the gold standard of science--replication. Prohibiting secret remedies was the cornerstone of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act; and, one of the defining characteristics of quackery is claiming to have \"a secret remedy.\" Will It Sell vs Should It Be Sold? The world of commerce is driven by supply and demand. By contrast, in the world of professionalism, procedures found to be ineffective are discarded even though they would still attract consumers. Regarding \u00b7 \u00b7standard health products, from 1990 to 1992, the FDA banned, or proposed to ban, 749 ineffective ingredients used in nonprescription drugs and weight loss products grandfathered by the 1962 Harris-Kefauver Amendment. 36 There is no indication that the companies that sold these ineffective drugs would have discontinued marketing them just because they didn't work. The poorly regulated nonprescription medicine marketplace is now filled with unproven homeopathic remedies and dietary supplements. Standard health services are also subjected to testing. In the 1950s internal mammary ligation was widely used to relieve angina pectoris. Patients reported increased working capacity and less chest pain. Nevertheless, a test was done. It found that patients who received only an incision did just as well as those who got the surgery. 37 As a result, surgeons stopped using the technique, not because there ceased to be a marketplace demand, nor because patients were dissatisfied, but because it simply did not work. The discontinued mammary ligation procedure can be compared to the present-day marketing of chelation therapy for heart disease. Patient demand is high because they wish to avoid bypass surgery, and subjective reports of improvement mirror those given for internal mammary ligation. There is strong evidence that the procedure is worthless. However, maverick doctors have banded together to lobby for commercial standards. Their patients sometimes carry placards demanding that chelationists be excused from regulatory control. \"Medical Freedom Laws.\" The rules of commercialism are gradually displacing professionalism. At least 8 states have passed laws that prevent licensing boards from disciplining members for unprofessional conduct for substituting \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" methods for standard care. This effectively does away with the peer review process of professionalism, and puts patients on their own for spotting inappropriate medicine. Senator Orin Hatch, a chelation therapy user himself, weakened the health fraud section of the Kennedy-Kasselbaum Act by adding an amendment that provides some cover for nonstandard practitioners. Congress has been working on what is known as the Access to Medical Treatment Act, that will open the public purse to nonstandard \"alternative\" health care. Safety and Efficacy By Semantics vs Proof. Professionalism's rule of primum non nocere is supplanted by semantics. Homeopathy is touted as \"the natural way to promote recovery and restore health,\" 38 but offers no sound evidence that it is either safe or effective. Chiropractic and naturopathy claim to be \"natural and drug free\" ways to health, but lack proof of safety and efficacy. Traditional healing systems such as ayurvedic and Chinese Medicine claim that having existed for thousands of years validates them, but offer little that will pass for scientific evidence. \"Alternative-complementary\" medicine providers talk the talk, but clamor to have the standards of science set aside so they can qualify. Those who understand the duplicity of commercialism know that it is important to listen carefully to words, and to understand their meanings. An expert in the deceptive language used in advertising warns that: Weasel word(s) can make you hear things that are not being said, accept as truths things that have only been implied, and believe things that have only been suggested. When you hear a weasel word, you automatically hear the implication. Not the real meaning, but the meaning it wants you to hear. 39 ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 11 Patient Satisfaction vs Clinical Effectiveness. Clinical effectiveness is established when a procedure performs better than \"no treatment\" and/or \"placebo therapy.\" Placebo therapy can, by definition (literally \"I shall please\"), satisfy patients. Questionable remedies also can claim subjectively reported \"successes.\" Reported \"success\" with \"alternative\" arthritis remedies was from 8 to 56%.40 The percentages of cancer patients reporting satisfaction with \"unorthodox\" treatment were only slightly lower than their satisfaction with standard care.41 Patients of chiropractors were three times as likely as patients of family physicians to report that they were \"very satisfied\" with the care they received for low back pain, much more likely to have been satisfied with the amount of information they were given, to have perceived that their provider was concerned about them, and to have felt that their provider was comfortable and confident dealing with their problem,42 but there is no evidence that chiropractic care is more effective for low back pain. Customer satisfaction is not incompatible with sound medicine, but the art of care should enhance, not supplant, the science of care. Citations 1.

Theory/Cosmology: In Steiner's doctrine, Christ is a sun god come to earth, not to redeem humanity from sin, but to help the human race balance between the influences of Zoroastrian gods of light and darkness, Lucifer and Ahriman. Steiner's revelations typically blur religious, scientific and historical topics. His version of history includes epochs on the lost continents of Lemuria and Atlantis, which he claimed to have read with \"clairvoyant vision\" out of the mythical \"akashic\" record. Employing the occultist doctrine of correspondences expressed in the formula as above, so below, humanity is positioned below nine classes of supernatural beings in a cosmic hierarchy. Seven planets correspond to seven epochs of history, twelve constellations of the zodiac to parts of the body, four elements to human temperaments, and so forth. Steiner's mystical world view is deeply pessimistic. Steiner foretold the reincarnation of the dark god Ahriman early in the 21st Century. Steiner was a dogmatist stating emphatically that his revelation is the only truth. 1 Steiner called for a rejection of materialism as a basis for scientific research; he believed that the concept of God and that the \"the divine element in nature\" should be introduced into the scientific enterprise. Steiner's published works are said to be over 300 volumes that cover art, religion, science and agriculture. His concept of biodynamic farming involves composting manure to enrich the soil; a method to produce foodstuffs that would nourish the spirit as well as the body. Anthroposophy is taught in Waldorf Centers (named for the first such school created in 1919 for the children of the workers at a Waldorf\u00ad Astoria factory), six of which are in the United States. The Green Meadow School in Spring Valley, NY, is the largest Waldorf School in North America (300 students in 12 grades). Rudolph Steiner College, located at Fair Oaks, California, \u00b7 \u00b7ls an unaccredited school approved to grant degrees by the state. 2 Waldorf teachers do not go to colleges or enroll in national or regional teacher organizations, they train only a Waldorf institutes. Instructions are based upon Steiner's worldview. Physiology classes teach that \"the 12 senses\" correspond to signs of the zodiac, that the heart does not pump the blood/ that Newton was wrong: light cannot be divided into colors because it is pure spirit, and other of Steiner's crackpot ideas (see Dugan & Daar's \"Are Rudolph Steiner's Waldorf schools 'non-sectarian'?\" Free Inquiry, Spring, 1994, for details of the bizarre Waldorf educational program). In Europe, the absence of laws separating church and state enables Steiner schools to appear legitimate. James Randi complained that \"In Sweden the private, expensive and government accredited Rudolph Steiner schools teach children to cast horoscopes and believe that sprites inhabit trees and rocks.\"3 The Weleda Company of Spring Valley, NY, manufactures body care products inspired by Steiner's teachings. Census: There are about 25,000 members of the Society4 The greatest concentrations are in Germany, Holland, and in Switzerland where the Goetheanum and other facilities in Dornach still constitute an international center. There are about 2,000 members in North America. There are some 300 Waldorf Schools in 21 countries, with about 19 in North America. There are about 1,500 biodynamic farms and gardening enterprises in the world; about 19 of which are in the United States. There are about 200 centers in 20 countries for the care of the mentally retarded. Anthroposophical Medicine (AM). Anthroposophical Medicine refers to medical practitioners who adhere to Steiner's teachings. An undated monograph Medicine Today by Leviton states, \"While in the 1950s there were only a handful of American MDs practicing AM, by the late 1980s that number has grown to nearly 50, and continues to increase as the demand for spiritual holism in health care also grows.\" He also says that Anthroposophical medicine has flourished in Europe, particularly in Germany, Holland, and Switzerland, and that today over 1,000 trained MDs are in formal practice, while another 2,000 routinely prescribe Anthropsophical medicines.\" Iscador. The most visible uniquely AM medical remedy is Iscador, a mistletoe (ie, Viscum album) extract, first proposed as a cancer treatment by Steiner in 1920. lscador is promoted by the Society for Cancer Research, Arl~sheim, Switzerland (founded by Steiner). Iscador is listed by the American Cancer Society as a unproven cancer remedy'. AM practitioners frequently prescribe homeopathic remedies. Hazards. In addition to the likelihood that a follower of anthroposophy afflicted with cancer would substitute worthless Iscador for useful cancer therapy, the Steiner cult does not believe in immunization. Nine cases of whooping cough f For an explanation of Steiner's notion by a cadre of Steiner's disciples, many of whom are located at ~1erican medical schools, see :'The heart _is not a pump: A refutation of the pressure propulsion of heart function,\" Frontier Perspecti1\u00b7cs, Fall/Winter, 1995;5(1):15-24 ~Frontier Perspecmes 1s published by The Center For Frontier Sciences at Temple University in Philadelphia.

The term \"kinesiology\" was borrowed from the academic world where it stands for the study of muscle-movement. The terms \"Dental kinesiology,\" \"Applied Kinesiology,\" \"Behavioral Kinesiology,\" and Contact Reflex Analysis have all been used. The Practice. A-K has been used for the purpose offor \"positive\" and \"negative\" foods, determining the color to paint one's room, type of music to hear, how to walk, which teeth not to pull in orthodontic treatment, the fitting of oral splints to improve athletic performance, detecting cancer and more. A-K involves placing various substances somewhere in contact with the body. If subjects experience a \"strong or weak\" response, substances are judged to be \"good or bad\" for them. Personal, subjective experiences are very impressive to clients, especially when many regard themselves as skeptical at the outset. Many do not realize that super~cial skepticism is not an adequate defense against deception, nor does it prevent suggestion or operant conditioning from working. Few appreciate the role of suggestibility in such responses. For instance, when a symbolically substance such as sugar, which is viewed negatively by about four out of five people,1 its not surprisingly that a negative effect on muscle strength is experienced. Friedman and Weisberg found this to be true in a double-blind test, and were able to reverse the effect by telling dental students that they would experience strength because candy would give them \"instant energy.\" 2 Triano3 and Kenney4 found that A-K was invalid for making nutritional assessments. A-K has been associated with serious harm. A New York chiropractor used it to demonstrate alleged improvements in learning disabled children. The physical and psychological damage done to the kids by his treatments resulted in a $565,000 jury award (see Neural Organizational Technique, in section on Craniopathy). On the instructions of a holistic dentist, A-K was employed as a way of testing the \"purity\" of foods by the family of a diabetic who died while trying to substitute \u00b7 vitamins for insulin. His wife (an RN!) refused to accept the reality of his death keeping his mummified body in the house for 8-years. The technique was used by a clinical ecologist to tell a mother that her children were not allergic to peanuts with the result that when given peanut butter their allergic reactions nearly killed them. He eventually lost his license to practice medicine for employing nonscientific techniques. A-K was used by an Arizona chiropractor to assure a patient that she did not have cancer. She subsequently died due to lack of treatment. He was suspended from practice. Research Findings. Controlled studies of A-K have repeatedly shown that responses are random under conditions where both the tester and test subject are unaware of the substance being tested, but the A-K experience can be very persuasive under uncontrolled conditions because people can definitely feel the differences in responses. The subjective experience can be ovetwhelming and turns many patients into believers. A-K's originator, chiropractor George Goodheart, organized the International College of Applied Kinesiology (ICAK) in an effort to gain some control over the practice and its claims. Goodheart once expressed skepticism about using A-K to choose one's personal lucky star (subjects were tested while pointing at various candidate stars). Over time, ICAK has become more conservative in its claims for A-Kand now states that it is not valid used by itself. Parlor Trick or Power of Suggestion? Explanations of what is actually happening in A-K responses range from trickery by practitioners, who may vary the point of contact on the lever (arm or leg) thus improving their mechanical advantage whenever they want to obtain a weak response; or, who catch the subject off-guard to elicit weakness versus telegraphing the test thus allowing a split-second for the subject to prepare their response. However, I believe that it may be a mistake to dismiss all A-K practitioners as tricksters. It may be that A-K users are fooling themselves through the uncontrolled use of a potentially useful psychological assessment tool. Just as Mesmerism unwittingly exploited the power of suggestion--the same potent psycho-physiological phenomenon of clinical hypnosis, A-K could possibly be a means of testing for the psychological make-up of subjects ( eg, conditioning, expectation, suggestibility or other personality factors). On the other hand, A-K could turn out to be unreliable or not as good as other tests now in use. Unfortunately, we are not aware of anyone who is studying A-K scientifically to find some valid use for the method. Those who employ the Contact Reflex Analysis version of A-K often run their hand up or down on their test subject allegedly to \"switch on or off' the response. Subject's response to this motion supports the idea that the A-K involves the power of suggestion. Metaphysics and Mind Control. Whatever its legitimate value, if any, turns out to be, A-K is used to promote occult beliefs and ideologies as the following promotional message reveals: Applied Kinesiology is gaining broad recognition as a valuable diagnostic tool in the field of holistic medicine. Nobody knows what makes it work--they only know that it does work! The commonly accepted belief is that the body has its own innate knowl~dge of itself. The follO\\\\ing experiment in A-K will introduce you to a method of accessing knowledge you didn't know you had. It exists in the \"unused\" portion of the brain, the area that scientists, biologists, neurologists and neurosurgeons ALTERNATIVE MW.IC/NE; A Crilklll Reviav, William T, Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000, have been un able to understand or explain until now. What you will be doing is SILENTLY thinking or pondering a question that can be answered by a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" At the same time you will be looking for an INVOLUNTARY physical sensation to manifest itself in your fingers. If the experiment works, a \"yes\" will materialize in the index finger and a \"no\" in the middle finger. It may come as a tickle, a twinge, a twitch, a numbness, a pulling, a pulsation or even a change in temperature. What makes the experiment work? The answer is BEYOND SCIENCE FICTION!!! The \"unused\" area of the brain, unexplained until now, contains the most miraculous, incredible, audio/video transmitter/receiver that is connected telepathically to the intelligence that created the universe. Using this experiment, ask if that explanation is correct. we can access it in an i~stant for information, advice and direction in our daily lives. It is transmitting messages to us all day long and in our dreams at night. Unfortunately, most of us pay no attention to them. For those of you who have been successful, congratulations!! Believe it or not, you have just accessed THE SOURCE--the creative intelligence of the universe!! If you doubt that statement, ponder that question and see what answer you get for yourself. 5 (all emphases theirs) 15 The mechanisms described above bring to mind the operation of a Ouija board. Suggestion and ideomotor activity are responsible for the effects of A-K, but these forces are not apparent to the person who is experiencing the phenomena. People who are amazed by the subjective experience often become enamored with the technique, its proponents, associated practices, and most importantly, the attendant ideology. Thus, like other occult practices, A-K can be used in a mind control process if its power as a subjective experience is harnessed as a tool for persuading individuals that some greater \u00b7metaphysical \"truth\" is being demonstrated.

Ayurvedic theory holds that there are three governing pnnc1ples to every person called vata, kapha and pztta; and tha_t two of these dominates every individual. Vata relates to movement, circulation, nerve impulses and respiration. Kapha has to do with solidarity, muscularity and physical strengths, while pitta is associated with digestion and metabolism. According to ayurveda: \"perverted, negative and excessive use of time, intelligence and sense object (?) is the three-fold cause of both psychic and somatic disorders; and wearing of gems and ornaments promotes wealth, auspiciousness, longevity, prosperity; destroys calamity, produces happiness, charms and ojas. Practices: Ayurvedic practitioners analyze people for their personal combinations of doshas. Its primary methodology involves \"pulse diagnosis.\" After taking a person's pulse, \"doshas\" are established. Practitioners look for \"imbalances,\" analyze dreams, and other personal information. Ayurvedic practitioners utilize methods similar to those of fortune tellers relying upon \"cold reading,\" 1 the P.T. Barnum effect 2 multiple choice fishing expeditions to elicit information, opportunism and a \"one-sided coin\" (ie, heads I win, tails you lose) psychology.) Prescriptions: Some ayurvedic ideas are bizarre. Alcoholism, anorexia, nausea, poor digestion, advanced ascites, edema, and indigestion are treated by goat feces prepared by washing with urine. Constipation is treated with milk enemas, including the testicles of peacocks, swans and turtles. Epilepsy is treated with ass urine 3 Other prescriptions include ritualistic sacrifices to different vedic gods (called yagyas) to win their blessings. A letter soliciting donations for a believer suffering from endometriosis prescribed a yagya priced at $11,500; curiously, a less than recommended yagya was also said to be \u00b7 \u00b7 available for $8,500, as was a $3,300 yagya that would suffice 4 Promoters: Ayurvedic medicine is currently promoted by the Maharishi Ayurveda Corporation of America. These are the people who have been promoting transcendental meditation (TM) and now operate Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa. According to a study of TM conducted by the West German Government, TM and Ayurvedic Medicine represent the promotion of Hinduism in the West under the guise of science. The study states that the quality of the science upon which these rely is of doubtful validity. Problems: Promoters of TM have been the target of law suits and legal actions for fraud. In 1987, Robert Kropinski was awarded $138,000 by a federal court jury in his law suit against the World Plan Executive Council-United States and the Maharishi International University, Fairfield, Iowa. Kropinski contended that he suffered psychological and emotional damage. He said he was given false promises including the assurance that he could fly through a technique known as levitation. 5 In 1979, the New Zealand Consumers magazine reported the sad story of Shirley Koszti, a widowed paraplegic for 20 years, who paid TM promoters over $5,000 believing that she would be taught to levitate and be free of her wheel chair.6 :Expose: In 1991 the American Medical Association unwittingly published an article which extolled the value of ayurvedic medicine and products and services which bore the name \"Maharishi Ayur-Veda.\" 7 Later it was discovered that the writers had failed to disclose their financial interest in these products and services and that widespread deception was involved in their promotion. A subs~uent article detailing the true nature of Maharishi Ayur-Veda as a scheme put together by devotees of the TM cutt.8 Although the primary people were licensed medical doctors, they clearly demonstrated a greater allegiance to their guru, the Maharishi Mehesh Yogi, than to the tenets of ethical scientific medicine.

Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 17 CHIROPRACI1C Legal status & Census: All 50 states and the District of Columbia attempt to regulate chiropractic via licensure. DCs are also licensed in several foreign countries. There are about 64,000 DCs worldwide; 59,800 are in the USA 1 In 1990 California had the most in any single jurisdiction, and Minnesota had the highest number of DCs per capita. 2 ' Vitalistic theory: Spinal \"sublu_xations\" mechanically interfere with nerve flow (the Innate Life Force) weakening organs served by the nerves and making them more susceptible to disease ... thus, \"subluxations\" are the primary \"cause\" of the disease and restoration of nerve flow is essential to healing. Homewood describes chiropractic vitalism: The founder of...chiropractic appreciated the working of Universal Intelligence (God); the function of Innate Intelligence (Soul, Spirit or Spark of Life) within each, which he recognized as a minute segment of Universal; and the fundamental causes of interference to the planned expression of that Innate Intelligence in the form of Mental, Chemical and/or Mechanical Stresses, which create the structural distortions that interfere with nerve supply.3 Origin: Chiros (hand)+Practos (practice) literally means \"done by hand.\" Chiropractic was invented in 1895 by Davenport, Iowa layman, Daniel D. Palmer. Because he sold goldfish commercially Palmer is referred to by historians as a \"fish monger.\" It is more interesting to know that he practiced magnetic healing beginning in the mid-1880s at Burlington, Iowa.4 Palmer searched for the single cause of all disease. The standard story about chiropractic's \"discovery\" is that Palmer believed he had found the single cause of disease when he \"cured\" the deafness of janitor Harvey Lillard by manipulating his spine (Palmer may have learned spinal manipulation from Andrew Still's osteopathic school in Kirksville, Missouri). Lillard is said to have lost his hearing while working in a cramped, stooped position during which he felt something snap in his back. Palmer's version of this event has always been disputed by Lillard's daughter, Valdeenia Lillard Simons. She says that her father told her that he was telling jokes to a friend in the hall outside Palmer's office and, Palmer, who had ,been reading, joined them. When Lillard reached the punch line, Palmer, laughing heartily, slapped Lillard on the back \u00b7 \u00b7 with the hand holding the heavy book he had been reading. A few days later, Lillard told Palmer that his hearing seemed better. Palmer then decided to explore manipulation as an expansion of his magnetic healing practice. Valdeenia said \"the compact was that if they can make (something of) it, then they both would share. But, it didn't happen.\" 5 The true origin of chiropractic appears to have been of a more mystical nature than the Lillard tale denotes. Palmer was an active spiritualist and apparently believed that the idea of \"replacing displaced vertebrae for the relief of human ills\" came through communication with the spirit of Dr. Jim Atkinson, a physician who had died fifty years before in Davenport. 6 As a young man, Palmer regularly walked the six or seven miles to the estate of his spiritualist mentor, William Drury.7 It was one of Drury's followers who told him of her vision of a door with a sign on it reading \"Dr. Palmer.\" She said that he one day would lecture in a large hall telling an audience about a new 'revolutionary' method of healing the sick.\" 8 Predisposed to magnetic healing by his belief in spiritualism, Palmer was drawn to the practice by seeing the financial success of \"Dr.\" Paul Caster of Ottumwa, Iowa, who was illiterate. Palmer's grandson described his technique: He would develop a sense of being positive within his own body; sickness being negative. He would draw his hands over the area of the pain and with a sweeping motion stand aside, shaking his hands and fingers vigorously, taking away the pain as if it were drops of water. 9 Palmer began speculating that the flow of animal magnetism may become blocked by obstructions along the spine,1\u00b0 and taught that chiropractic was \"an educational, scientific, religious system\" that \"associates it practice, belief and knowledge with that of religion\" and \"imparts instruction relating both to this world and the world to come.\" \"Chiropractic,\" he said, \"sheds enlightenment upon physical life and spiritual existence, the latter being only a continuation of the former.\"11 In a well-intended effort to warn patients, some Medical Doctors wrongly state that \"chiropractors are all right if they stick to their training.\" Chiropractor Peter Modde succinctly explodes this notion in the title of his article, \"Malpractice Is An Inevitable Result of Chiropractic Philosophy and Training.\" 12 Modde pointed out that when a chiropractor fails to properly diagnose or treat a disorder, or to promptly refer a patient to a physician, it is because he/she is taught to believe that spinal analysis and adjustments are all-encompassing. That is what \"chiropractic\" is all about. It is only when a chiropractor doubts this central theory that they are able to move in the direction of rational health care. Individual chiropractors sometimes deny that they believe in Palmer's biotheological Innate Intelligence, but when pressed as to their basis for practice they must face the physiological facts described in a scientific brief on chiropractic: If there is partial blockage of impulses in a nerve fibre ... the impulse is transm_itted more slowly in_ a zone of pa~ti~l blockage, and resumes all (emphasis added) its characteristics as soon as ll reaches n~rmal us~ue. Thus, 1t 1s impossible for a partial blockage of nerve impulses in a particular zone to affect the flow, smce the impulses would resume their normal flow.13 ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A OiJical Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 18 Unsupported by science, chiropractors must either fall back upon Palmer's pantheistic views or admit that the \"subluxation\" t~e?ry is erron_eous. Without the subluxation ~he?ry, chiropractors are h~1ted m~~ahty _shared ~y _osteop~ths, physiatnsts, sports trainers, physical therapists and others. Without the theory, ch1ropract1c s claim that 1t 1s a umque and comprehensive \"alternative\" to standard medicine is lost. D.D. Palmer had li?1ited success in promoti~g chiropr?ctic. It was his son, B.J. Palmer, an eccentric promoter and Iowa radio industry p10neer, who developed ch1ropract1c mto a successful business enterprise. BJ believed that chiropractic was a business, rather than a profession. He proclaimed to chiropractors, \"Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell, and advertise.\" Appeal: Chiropractic combines metaphysical and mechanistic explanations of health and disease in a simplistic fashion. Chiropractors (DCs) have repeatedly outperformed other providers in assessments of patient satisfaction 14,15,J6_ DCs mostly treat back pain and are more sympathetic and supportive of patients' complaints. To DCs, back problems are significant to overall health while physicians consider such problems minor and self-limiting. Suggestion Therapy. Peter Modde, DC, stated that \"chiropractors success is based upon the instilling within patients the belief that they have a spinal bone 'out-of-place,' and that we chiropractors can 'put it back in place.' We pop their spines and let nature take its course.\" (personal communication). Modde was referring t0-DC manipulation as suggestive therapy. Sam Homola, DC, agrees. He says in his classic book Bonesetting, Chiropractic, and Cultism (Critique Books, 1963) The \"popping sound\" associated with \"putting bones back-into-place\" (though it may be accomplished by manipulating a normal joint) is one of the cleverest that most effective forms of suggestive therapy ever devised. (p.47) This has a tremendous psychological influence over the mind. While the popping sound itself is quite meaningless, this influence might possibly be used to advantage in curing psychosomatic conditions--provided the patient is informed that the bone is \"back-in-place\" and will stay there. By the same token, however, such treatment can cause a great deal of harm; that is by perpetuating a psychosomatic condition or even creating a new psychological illness. (p.95) Regarding DC-induced psychological illnesses, DC's have a history of trying to frighten people into buying their services. Cyriax described the reprehensible practice of offering free \"spinal check-ups\" for children, finding alleged minor displacements, \"correcting\" these, and then selling the anxious parent on regular check-ups for the child. Making a parent and child believe that her/she has a spinal weakness can easily create a persistent worry. This instilled fear has been labelled \"chiropractogenic neurosis\" 17 which can be another risk of DC care. An account of how this type of misdiagnosis can harm a child was described by Rojas.18 The fact that chiropractic treatment involves touching enhances suggestive therapy. Neher states that: Physiologically, touching generally quiets the body through the parasympathetic nervous system. This it can alleviate anxiety and elicit feelings of contentment and well-being. Because of its therapeutic impact, touching plays a large role in a wide variety of healing procedures: the massage of conventional hospitals, the laying on of hands of faith healing, and the \"energy flow: in the touch of psychic healing. 19 Neher describes the two stages of psychic healing: (1) the laying on of hands is used to relax patients and heighten their suggestibility; (2) conditioned therapeutic responses are elicited in the individual. 20 This scenario is consistent with what happens in chiropractic clinical care. Scientific status of Chiropractic's \"subluxation theory: Spinal Manipulative Therapy (SMI): Chiropractic's theory has failed tests of both validity and reliability. The \"subluxation\" which is the foundation of its theory, has never been demonstrated to exist. The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) is equivocal on the idea of the existence and importance of spinal misalignments,21 and the subluxation theory has been refuted by Crelin. 22 DCs have repeatedly failed field tests of reliability, ie, they have never shown that difference DCs can agree on the location of subluxations under blinded conditions. A 1963 critique of chiropractic's fundamental theory is still true: Chiropractors claim that subluxations ... cause a perturbation of the distribution of nervous impulses to tissues and cells. Neurophysiologists have developed methods of recording the passage of impulses in nerves. Exceptionally sensitive apparatus is available to anyone wishing to use it. No scientific study has ever been published on the subject by a chiropractor. No chiropractor has ever defined, either quantitatively or qualitatively, what chiropractic means by a perturbation of nervous impulses. Is it their number, their amplitude, their frequency, the speed of their profagation, or their wave patterns which are affected? All of these qualities can be identified, recorded, and studied. 2 ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 19 Political status of chiropractic's subluxation theory. Gatterman states that \"subluxation is the most loved and hated, hotly debated and consecrated term used by chiropractors,\" and that \"more than 100 synonyms for the subluxation have been ~sed.\"24 The ACA has backed away from the subluxation concept by stating that in only may exist, and only may be important. It states that: Chiropractic is based upon three related scientific theories: (1) Pathological influences may be influenced by disturbances of the nervous system. (2) Disturbances of the nervous system may be the result of derangements of the musculoskeletal structure. (3) Disturbances of the nervous system may aggravate pathological processes in various parts or with various functions of the body (emphases added). 25 Chiropractic's dilemma is that in order to be recognized as a separate entity, chiropractic must have some unique feature whereby to define itself and its scope of practice. Dentistry, podiatry, optometry, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and so forth, define themselves by anatomical regions and conditions limiting their scopes of practice. Chiropractic does not. Its uniqueness is the detection and correction of \"subluxations.\" All state practice acts mention subluxations specifically, or describe them in unmistakable language. Nearly 90% of people seeking chiropractic care do so for musculoskeletal problems.26 Even though many DCs continue to delude themselves into believing that their manipulations have a meaningful effect upon general health and a broad spectrum of diseases, the public has figured out that DCs sometimes can help them with back pain. Admitting that their services are merely a limited specialty--spinal manipulative therapy (SMT)--reduces DCs to \"therapists\" rather than \"doctors\" is a step down that few DCs are willing to take. Factionalism. Chiropractic is made up of a conglomeration of factions in conflict. Most obvious is the dichotomy of straights versus mixers represented by the presence of two separate national organizations, the International Chiropractors Association and the American Chiropractic Association respectively. At least a dozen different notions about how the spine should be ~rrected divide DCs. A government report described the chaos within chiropractic: Heated controversy regarding chiropractic theory and practice continue to exist. On-site and telephone discussions with chiropractors and their schools and associations, coupled with a review of background materials ... result in a picture of a profession in transition and containing a number of contradictions. There continues to be some disagreement with the profession regarding which conditions are appropriate for chiropractic care and regarding appropriate parameters for treatment. 27 The factions only come together when attacked from the outside world. In describing \"the chiropractic kaleidoscope\" of factions, Moore choose a colorful and telling analogy: A company of porcupines crowded themselves very close together one cold winter's day so as to profit by one another's warmth and so save themselves from being frozen to death. But soon they felt one another's quills, which induced them to separate again. And now, when the need for warmth brought them nearer together again, the evil arose once more. So that they were driven backwards and forwards from one trouble to the other, until they discovered a mean distance at which they could most tolerably exist. 28 Scientific status of Spinal Manipulative Therapy. The Rand Corporation's review of manipulative therapy is the best to date,29 but it is necessary that the original report be read. Secondary interpretations have been misrepresented 30 as proof of chiropractic's value. It is not often revealed that the Rand study did not come about because of some new indication of the apparent scientific merit of manipulative therapy, but because the chiropractic profession paid to have it done. Nor do they warn that four of the 9 evaluators of the studies were DCs favorably-biased toward SMT. Nor do they disclose that only 4 of the 22 controlled trials that they evaluated involved chiropractic manipulation (ie, versus safer, less forceful SMT techniques used by physical therapists, osteopaths, etc.). Nor do they usually communicate Rand's conclusion that \"the efficacy of spinal manipulation is neither proven nor disfiroven at this time.\" A 1993 report by a Canadian economist, Pran Manga who is himself a satisfied chiropractic patient i, declared that chiropractic was safer, more effective, and more cost effective than medical management of low-back pain, but these conclusions were refuted by Rand's Dr. Paul Shekelle who noted that Manga had looked at \"the exact same studies as the rest of us, and no one else has been able to come to those conclusions.\" 31 A meta-analysis of reviews of spinal manipulation awarded 76 out of a possible 100 points to the Shekelle's review, and 22 points to Manga's. 32 The report stated that \"the reviews with relatively high quality had a positive conclusion,\" but that \"strong conclusions were precluded by the overall low quality of the reviews.\" 11 According to 1J1e Digest of Chiropractic Economics (Mar-Apr, 1994, p.65) Manga spoke al the Palmer ~allege_ of Chir?practic in January and :began his presentation by telling students that his own chiropractor is a Palmer graduate.\" 11 appears that Manga 1s a cluropracllc devotee who has let his own personal experience color his reporting. ALTERNATWB MEDICINE; A Crilkal Revisw, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, Morch, 2000. 20 In December, 1994, the federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), issued clinical practice guidelines !or th~ treatm~nt of most acute, painfu!, low b~c~ proble~s. Among the recommended treatments was spinal manipulation es~ecially durmg the first four ~eeks. The chmcal studies that led to this recommendation was essentially the same data reviewed by the RAND corporatmn. The AHCPR report did not contain the word \"chiropractic,\" but the Associated Press proclaimed: \"Chiropractors get a boost and surgeons a setback in new, government guidelines on how to treat low back pain. For most sufferers, they say, problems will go away on their own within a month.\" 33 When asked by Dr. Stephen Barrett why he had mentioned chiropractors when the report did not, AP reporter Christopher Connell said that it was because they were best known for doing manipulative therapy. Apparently, Connell did not realize that chiropractic is not synonymous with either manipulative therapy or with the rational treatment of back pain. In 1996, the Rand Corporation conducted a review of the appropriateness of manipulation and mobilization of the cervical spine employing the same technique it had used to evaluate SMT for back pain. Only 11.1 % of 736 indications for cervical manipulation were judged appropriat~ by a panel of nine judges (4 DCs, 4 MDs, and 1 MD-DC). The most important finding was the paucity evidence for the benefit of these procedures. 34 The risks of cervical spine manipulation are well documented. Scientific status of Chiropractic Spinal Manipulative Therapy. Research methodologists attempting to statistically pool data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of chiropractic treatment of low back pain concluded: \"A vote counting of the avaHable RCTs provided no convincing evidence of the effectiveness of chiropractic for acute or chronic low back pain. All RCTs had serious flaws in the design, execution and reporting. There is certainly a need for further correctly executed trials.35 Major Risks: Direct Hami: Forceful neck manipulations can cause stroke and paralysis. A survey by the Stanford Stroke Center found that within a 2-year period, 56 strokes had occurred among patients within 24-hours after receiving neck \u00b7 -'manipulation by a DC. One patient died and 86% were left with permanent impairment. Most (53/56) involved intervertebral artery damage. The age range of patients affected was 21-60 with most occurring in young individuals. 36 The Manitoba College of Physicians and Surgeons advised doctors to warn patients about the risks of neck manipulation after it was found that six cases of brain stem injury resulting in permanent paralysis had occurred within the province in the past 3 years. Manitoba has a population of about one million, not all of who \\o to DCs; such an incidence of injury greatly exceeds the estimated 1-in-10 million risk associated with such procedures. 7 A bibliography of 113 documented, and 13 anecdotal reports of vertebrobasilar injury following SMT is available. 38 Repeated forceful neck manipulations may increase the risk of stroke, but this has not been studied. Former practitioner and chiropractic educator John Badanes, DC listed \"the dangers of chiropractic\" starting with the most serious and estimating the frequency of each: Failure to diagnose something serious Stroke with death Stroke without death Paralysis Pathologic fracture Non-pathologic fracture Ligamentous damage with ensuing ligamentous laxity Microfracture to the opposing facet joints Failure to diagnose something not serious Infrequent Infrequent Infrequent Infrequent Infrequent Infrequent Infrequent to Frequent Infrequent to Frequent Frequent Badanes says \"cracking the neck is a form of trauma even though it's intent is therapeutic. Damage is indeed extremely minor most of the time.\" He cites a letter from a puzzled chiropractic patient that appeared in the newspaper. I'm a 36-year-old woman. One week ago I had a stiff neck and went to a chiropractor. Immediately after he had aligned my neck, the right side of my lips and cheek went numb and I felt dizzy. I told the chiropractor of the problem but he sent me home. Within 90 minutes I began falling and vomiting. I returned to the chiropractor and he said this has happened before and I'd be fine. I was hospitalized and found that the cervical manipulation had ruptured an artery in my neck and caused a stroke. Now I am taking blood thinners and several months my neurologist will determine if I need surge3: to repair the artery. How often does this happen? Should my chiropractor have recognized the symptoms? 9 Badanes recoils at \"overly enthusiastic, but 'philosophically' sound, DCs who believes she will be better off if 'adjusted' no matter what her entering complaint. Adverse mechanical tension is put on a vertebral artery which dissects and causes a stroke. The DC is either too dumb and/or in denial to recognize the obvious signs and symptoms of an iatrogenic event, sends her home one time instead of calling 911...sends her home with his imbecilic assurances a SECOND time after she reports vomiting and passing out, and continues seeing his 'patients' while she is taken by ambulance to the emergency room!\" ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilkal Review, William T.

Chiros once boasted of their low malpractice rates, but apparently those days are over. According to the major insurer, 5% of chiros are defendants at any given time. From 1991-5, National Chiropractic Mutual Insurance Company (NCMIC) paid over $73 million for 1,403 losses. 48 The most common claims were for: Disc problems Fractures Failure to diagnose Prior condition aggravated Cerebrovascular accidents Burn accidents was the second in \"percentage of types of loss resulting in payment\" for 1990. The data were: fracture (21 % ); CVA (20% ); disc (19%) failure to diagnose (18%) vicarious (11 % ), soft tissue injury (8%).49 Only about half of chiropractors carry malpractice insurance, and many of those who do are under-insured. 50 This is bad news for people who are seriously injured by chiropractic \"adjustments.\" In February, 1997, NCAHF received a heart\u00ad breaking call from a woman who had been paralyzed from the neck down by a chiropractor. He had only $250,000 in coverage and had filed for bankruptcy to protect his other assets. Her lawyer was discouraged because the protracted defense being mounted by the chiro promised to chisel away at all of the money they could hope to get at in a settlement. In 1990, Tamara Joerns, of Bakersfield, California, a 27-year-old mother of three, was made a quadriplegic by a chiropractic neck adjustment. She lost her case against him because a judge ruled that the manipulation did not amount to substandard chiropractic care! Chiropractic Reformers. Chiropractors who reject the metaphysical biotheology, and anti-medical attitudes of chiropractic, but see value in manipulative therapy for limited conditions organized themselves into the National Association for Chiropractic Medicine (NACM) in 1987. 51 NACM practitioners focus on the conservative treatment of neuro-musculo\u00ad skeletal conditions. Treatment is mainly by manual therapy, but the use of drugs such as pain-relievers and muscle-relaxants are considered desirable if they are legally available. NACM's open rejection of the subluxation theory and chiropractic philosophy, and its acceptance of the scientific method set it apart from other factions within the chiropractic guild. This also has made it the target of scorn by _chiropractic's true believers. In 1994, NACM announced that it was giving up its struggle to reform mainstream chiropractic and was joining with an international group of manipulative therapists called Orthopractors. 51,53 Orthopractic therapy involves restoring a greater range of motion to the joints of the body through gentle and gradual mobilization, or more forceful manipulation. Among other things, orthopractors (1) provide patient education which is aimed at reducing pain and disability and having them become independent of care; (2) specifically reject the chiropractic subluxation theory; (3) do not use x-rays in diagnosis; (4) reject the use of manipulation to treat postural deformities in children (eg, kyphosis, scoliosis, unequal leg lengths), or a list of children's ailments (colic, eczema, learning disorders, infections, asthma, and more); (5) reject spinal manipulations for general health care; (6) support immunization; (7) reject the use of testimonials to promote their services; (8) reject homeopathy; and, (8) advise against sales promotions by chiropractors such as family plans, life-long spinal adjustments, free x-ray exams, and elementary school screening programs for scoliosis. 54 In addition to organizing like-minded practitioners, establishing a new profession requires state legislatures to pass new practices acts, developing education and training programs, and marketing the profession in a competitive setting. atations 1.

It is for this reason that information is included in this monograph. Theory. The Christian Science (CS) church was founded by Mary Baker Eddy in the 19th Century. Eddy taught that illness is an illusion because everything is created by God and He would not create illness and death. These, she believed, are the products of erroneous human thinking. Thus, CS believers do not learn about, think about, or admit to illness. Legal Status. CS Practitioners, and nurses in CS nursing homes, are not trained in health care. CS Practitioners are basically fee-for-service prayer providers, and CS nursing homes mainly provide custodial care. CS nursing homes are ~eimbursed by health insurance carriers and by the federal government through Medicare/Medicaid. In 1995, a public\u00ad mterest group sued the Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) asking the court to prohibit the use of Medicare funds for CS nursing home care. The CS Church voluntarily joined the DHHS as a co-defendant. A Federal District Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs with the judge stating that government reimbursement for such services violates the U.S. Constitution's principle of the separation of church and state. On January 23, 1997, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno sent letters to the U.S. House and Senate legal counsels advising them that the Julitice Department cannot no longer continue to defend the use of Medicare/Medicaid money for CS nursing. 1 Census. Tabulations from the Christian Science Journal reveal that the number of CS Practitioners has decreased from 4,965 in January, 1971 to 1,450 in February, 1991. Claimed Benefits. The CS Church claims that its methods of healing are equal, if not superior, to those of medicine. 2 A church document 3 purports to offer evidence of CS efficacy. The document is a review of unverified testimonials that have . .-appeared in of7,134 testimonials published from 1969-1988 included healings of bodily disorders. The total number of physical healings recounted in this period was over 10,000. Of these, 2,338 alleged to involve heatings of \"medically diagnosed\" conditions. Included were 27 alleged heatings of \"malignancy or cancer,\" 42 of \"tumor,\" 16 of polio, 68 of tuberculosis, 38 of pneumonia, 88 of health disorders, 23 of kidney disorders, 203 of broken bones, 71 of childbirth complications, 16 of scarlet fever, 16 of rheumatic fever, 11 of cataract, 12 of diabetes, 13 of pernicious anemia, 12 of rheumatoid or degenerative arthritis, two of gangrene, three of glaucoma, 7 of hepatitis, three of leukemia, 6 of multiple sclerosis, 7 of blindness, 48 of other vision deficiencies such as astigmatism or nearsightedness, 13 of goiter, 8 of curvature of the spine, 3 of crossed eyes, and one of cleft palate. The authors admit that none of these case were verified, but asked that they be believed on the basis of the integrity of those who reported them to the Church. Veracity. The veracity of CS testimonials are suspect. Believers in system are prone to denial. Illness doesn't fit the CS theory, therefore, even that which is obvious to others is denied. Former church member Emilie Sullivan said that she lost two babies due to reliance upon CS teachings. Her son Nicolas died of pneumonia at 8 months of age. She says that she never took pictures of him because he had always been sickly in appearance and the CS church expects all its members to \"express perfect health.\" 4 Huards. The dangers of the CS belief system are substantial and well-documented. Research Reports 1. A comparative longevity study of a college cohort of CS's graduating from Principia College (Elsah, IL) from 1934 to 1983 found that the cumulative death rate (proportion of survivors in 5-yr groupings) was significantly higher (P=.042 men, P=.003 women) than a control population at the University of Kansas in Lawrence; (26.2% v. 20.9% men; 11.3% v. 9.9% women. 5 2. Coroner records for King County, Washington, for 1935 through 1955 showed that the age of death for CS's was slightly below the average for the state. The CS death rate for cancer was double the national average, and at least 6% of the CS deaths were medically preventable. 6 3. A comparative longevity study of a college cohort of CS's graduating from Principia College (Elsah, IL) from 1945 to 1983 found that the cumulative death rate (proportion of survivors in 3-yr groupings) and overall mortality rates were 40 v 22/1,000 for men (P=.001) and 27 v 12/1,000 for women (P=.001) compared to a control population of the Loma Linda University College of Liberal Arts.7 Case Reports Nonpermanent Jnjwy (*Could have resulted in death without medical intenention) I.

Robyn Twitchell, 2, of Boston, MA, died of peritonitis and a twisted bowel in 1986 after a 5-day illness under care of a CS Practitioner who believed she had achieved a complete healing. (Swan, 1993) 9. Ashley King, 12, of Phoenix, Arizona, died of untreated bone cancer in 1988. (Swan, 1993) 10. Ian Burdick, 15, of Van Nuys, CA, died of untreated diabetes in 1987. (Swan, 1993) 11. Ian Lundman, 11, of Minneapolis, MN, died of untreated diabetes in 1989. His ex-CS father tried to intervene and have his son treated medically but was thwarted by his ex-wife. He subsequently sued in civil court and won $9 million in the first wrongful death suit against the CS church. 8 \u00b7 Multiple Reports. \u00b7 -'Rita Swan, PhD and Seth Asser, MD, examined the deaths of 172 children from families who relied upon faith healing from 1975 to 1995. 9 Four out of every five sick children who died after their parents put their trust in faith healing would most likely had survived if they had received medical care. Eighty-one percent (140) of the deaths were caused by conditions that had a chance of survival exceeding 90% when treated medically. Eighteen more of the children died of conditions with better than a 50% survival rate with medical care. All but three children would have benefitted in some way from medical care. Twenty-six percent of the deaths have occurred since 1988 when the American Academy of Pediatrics called for an elimination of laws that exempt parents from legal accountability for medical neglect for religious reasons. Evidence that the elimination of such laws would save lives is found in the fact that Christian Science church members in Canada are permitted by the church to seek medical help for their children because the law does not provide a refuge as it does in many U.S. states. Although the Christian Science church is probably the largest denomination that is opposed to medical care. The group with the most fatalities was the Faith Assembly (64). Christian Science was second with 28 deaths. The authors note that their data cannot be used to establish rates, however. Reporting of such deaths is not systematic. Curiously, despite the sympathy that Americans normally exhibit to the plight of children, very few cases of death due to religion-motivated medical neglect have received national press coverage, and reports in the medical literature are also rare. The authors have shown by their investigation that child deaths due to religion-motivated neglect are not only preventable, they are predictable and they will continue to occur as long as good people do nothing to stop them. Legal Status of Child Protection. The U.S. Supreme Court is clear on whether or not requiring parents to obtain medical care for children is constitutional. It has stated: \"The right to practice religion freely does not include the liberty to expose the community or child to communicable disease, or the latter to ill health or death ... Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion.\" 10 Many states exempt the parents of children who rely upon prayer for healing from prosecution for medical neglect. Some legal scholars believe that laws that specifically protect members of the CS church from prosecution for the medical neglect of children violate the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against the establishment of religion. This is yet to be tested in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Non-CS father of a diabetic child who died because his CS mother deprived of insulin based upon her CS faith successfully sued the CS church for wrongful death. He was awarded $5.2 million.11 This judgment was overturned on appeal, but was eventually reinstated and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1996.

EAV is not acupuncture, and involves neither \"acu\" nor \"puncture\"! EA V is a form of \"Energy Medicine\" that .uses a galvanic skin response (GSR) device (aka, electrodermal diagnosis). One such device is the Demzatron (others \u00b7 \u00b7 include the Acuscope, Interro and VEGA). These devices are not approved for diagnostic or treatment purposes. If sold for such, they would be declared \"misbranded\" under the 1976 Medical Device Amendment to the U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act. However, federal law only prohibits its distribution in interstate commerce. Because health care delivery is regulated by the states, the FDA does not have authority to prosecute anyone who employs a misbranded device in his or her practice. That is up to state licensing boards. Using an unapproved medical device could impact a malpractice lawsuit. Practice. The Dermatron is used to assess the \"electrical activity\" at alleged acupuncture points on the skin. In use, the operator probes the alleged acupuncture points on the patient's hand. The gauge has a finite range of zero to one hundred. A reading of 50 represents normal. High readings are theorized to indicate irritations or inflammation. Low readings are theorized to indicate degeneration worsening by degree. Sudden drops in readings are alleged to be significant to practitioners. Proponents claim to be able to prescribe with the Dermatron. 2 Scientific status. Despite anecdotal reports and theoretical papers which have been published by proponents, EA V remains unproven and of doubtful validity. Critics of GSR devices note that variations in pressure applied to the points can greatly affect readings. Skin moisture is also known to greatly affect galvanic readings. GSR devices also are capable of creating their own readings. Nansel and Jansen report that a GSR unit was \"able within about 5 seconds to decrease the resistance of any particular point not already in its lowest state of resistance to a level sufficient to generate a positive and resistant GSR reading where none had been detected previously.\" 3 RADIONICS Origin: In 1910 while examining a patient with cancer of the lip Albert Abrams, MD says he noticed a small area of the abdomen which gave a dull note when percussed with the fingers (but only when the patient was nude and facing West ... he claims this was due to the Earth's magnetic field). Abrams imagined a theory of electronic vibrations being the key to health and disease which he dubbed the Electronic Reactions of Abrams (ERA). Theory & Practice: Diseases have frequencies just as a radio station has and can be tuned into for diagnosis, prescription, and treatment. Founded upon the \"Oscilloclast\"; Abrams' \"black box\" for detecting and correcting the electronic vibrations. The wiring made no sense, but proponents of radionics say that the box is not important, rather, it is the sensitivity of the person operating it (just as with pendulums, dowsing rods, and spiritualist mediums).

RADIESTIIESIA . Medical Dowsing. form of a French wo~d for dowsing coined by Abbe Alex Bouly in 1927.5 The notion that the vitalistic Life Force produces a resonance via ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,\u00b7 A Critical &view, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 27 thought processes which can be discerned by people possessing a \"sixth sense\" who are referred to as sensitives, forms the basis for medical dowsing. Utilizing the same principles as those of water witching, 6 diviners determine nutrient needs by requesting \"yes\" or \"no\" responses from a pendulum (a weight suspended on a 15\"-18\" string). The amount of supplements alleged to be needed is determined by the length of the pendulum's swing. Sensitives are alleged to be able to discern Life Force resonances (ie, \"radiations) emanated by a sample of a patient's tissue or fluids (eg, spot of blood, lock of hair, fingernail clippings, saliva, urine, etc.) or a personal object (eg, picture, article of clothing or jewelry, etc.) by employing pendulums, dowsing rods, or electronic devices. Many of the wiring schematics of electronic \"black box\" devices that Vitalists employ make no sense mechanically. To outsiders this appears to be clear evidence of deliberate fraud, but devotees have their own explanation, they say: \"the blood spot means nothing, in itself; it simply serves to help tune the radiesthetist's mind to his patient's broadcasts.\" If he is sufficiently sensitive, he does not even need its help7 Metal rods, pendulums, water-witching twigs, and other divination devices move by ideomotor action (by ideas in the practitioner's mind). Such movement is not deliberate, but subconscious. Because of this, operators will swear that they are not causing the movement, but repeated tests have prov~d conclusively that they supply the force. 8 Dowsers who are aware of this fact argue that the method is desirable because it allows practitioners \u00b710 bypass their reasoning and employ intuition. Reasoning is denigrated on the basis that it is a process of the flawed human intellect. From a more practical perspective, the pendulum puts the practitioner in control of the situation in which opportunism based upon information supplied by the client will provide all that is needed to perform impressively for a client. ldeomotor Action (How The Dowsing Rod Dips). The mechanism behind the mysterious movement of dowsing rods, Ouija boards, pendulums, and the like, was discovered by England's great physicist Michael Faraday in 1853. The phenomenon t~at Faraday tested was \"table turning,\" which was associated with spiritualism. The practice of sitting around a table to . :commune with the \"other world\" reached epidemic portions in England in 1850. People with the idea in their minds that a tables would move in a rotary motion, right or left, as a signal from the spirits would experience it. Sometimes the table they would arise and the table would begin to move. They would follow from a walk even to a run. Sometimes the table would spin or run away, toppling as it went. Faraday approached the problem scientifically. First, he eliminated trickery by choosing trustworthy subjects. He checked for electrical and magnetic effects and found none. His first breakthrough came when he placed little pellets of soft cement between slippery pieces of cardboard laid on top of the table (with some glue to provide resistance). By analyzing the marks made by the pellets, he ascertained that the subject was moving the table and not vice-versa (the top layer of cardboard had moved more than the bottom). Faraday then built a more elaborate apparatus that provided a visual indicator (a vertical reed) enabling the subject to comprehend immediately whether the table or he was initiating the movement, and the phenomenon stopped. It was clear that the subject was unaware that they had moved the table just as water dowsers, Ouija board players, and pendulum diviners are unaware that they are responsible for the movement of their devices. Faraday expressed disappointment that it was necessary to have had to scientifically disprove a parlor phenomenon \"in the present age, and in this part of the world.\" After all, Englishmen thought of themselves as quite intelligent in 1850. 9 Faraday's report was not well received by the table turning community many of whose religious beliefs were tied to the spiritualist movement. Great debates abounded over Darwin's views on the origins of the species, and proof of the existence of a spirit world was sought by many as evidence of a human Soul, and assurance of an afterlife. Today, dowsers who are aware of the irrefutable evidence that the operator is responsible for the rod's movement, argue that the method is desirable because it allows practitioners to bypass their reasoning and employ intuition. They denigrated reasoning a process of the flawed human intellect. Some go as far as to point out that eating of the Tree of Knowledge constituted original sin. Historical examples illustrating public fears of science and technology (ie, the \"mad scientist\") include Dr. Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. ORGONOMY History and Theory. Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957) was born and raised in the remote eastern hinterlands of the Austrian Empire. After relocating in Vienna following World War I he became involved in the burgeoning psychoanalytic movement of Sigmund Freud and rose to prominence in the 1920s. A Communist, the rise of Nazism forced Reich to flee to America. Later in his career, his quest for the biological roots of the libido theory led him to formulate the orgone theory. Reich built a device, The Orgone Energy Accumulator, that was supposed to treat diseases by absorbing \"blue bions\" or \"Cosmic Orgone Energy.\" His bogus devices eventually cause Reich to run afoul of the FDA. After violating an injunction against distributing his devices he was imprisoned in 1956. He died of a heart attack shortly before he was to be released. 10,11 A group composed mostly of psychiatrists who use Reich's methods called the American College of Orgonomy (ACO), is based in Princeton, NJ. Toe ACO is very far to the right on the political spectrum. It publishes the Journal of Orgonomy keeping alive Reich's vitalistic theories.12 ALTERNATIVE MEDICINEj A Critical Review, William T.

Generally Recognized As Safe as determined by experts empaneled by the U.S. FDA. \"A plant or plant part valued for its medicinal, savory, or aromatic properties.\" Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary. Plant parts include leaves, roots, stems, bark, seeds, flowers, flower parts (pollen, petals, pistil, stamen) and their extracts. The names of some herbs employ the Latin name of the plant part involved (eg, leaves = folium; nuts = ma; roots = radix; seed = spenna). (also see \"Identifying herbs\" below). A book about plants with reference to their medicinal properties.(Webster's) One who collects or grows herbs; an herb doctor. (Webster's) \"Herbalist\" is not recognized legally and has no scientific standing (see \"pharmacognosy''). A term with no scientific or legal meaning that refers to \"the study of herbs\" (see pharmacognosy). Herbology is to pharmacognosy as the pseudoscience of astrology is to the science of astronomy. Use of the term \"herbology\" is generally indicative of either quackery or unreliable folk medicine. The same can be said for herbalism. A term with no scientific or legal standing commonly used to boost someone's status as an authority on herbs. Use of the titles ''Herbologist\" or \"Master Herbologist\" are indicative of either quackery or unreliable folk medicine. The same may be said of \"herbalist.\" Japanese herbal medicine in the Chinese tradition. 3 Literally \"knowledge of drugs or pharmaceuticals\"; an applied science which deals with the biolo;ical, biochemical, and economic features of natural drugs and their constituents. A practitioner is called a \"pharmacognosist.' IN PRAISE OF HERBS Every culture has a history of using herbal remedies in some way. Most of the herbal remedies from antiquity are today regarded as poisons or abuse drugs. Of all of the potent drugs in use today the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations know of only three: opium, belladonna which was used mostly as a poison, and ergot which was regarded purely as a poison. Senna, a laxative was known in 1618, and cinchona bark from Peru was used against malaria in the 17th century. 5 Dr. William Withering discovered of digitalis from foxglove in an old woman's herbal concoction in 1785. Willow bark, a source of salicin, served as the basis for aspirin, and Indian snakeroot was the source of reserpine, a medicine used to control blood pressure. Extracts from the seeds and roots of the autumn crocus provide colchicine, a drug for gouty arthritis, and birth control pills are made from Mexican yam. Several billion dollars worth of prescription drugs are derived from plants each year. As a result of the natural selection process, plants have developed defenses against bacteria, fungi, insect pests, and other natural enemies. This is why plants are sources of antibiotics, fungicides, pesticides, and other substances useful to humans. For example, in 1959, a review of 2,222 plants reported some antibiotic activity in 1,362. Most natural plant materials are too toxic for human use. 6 Some plant cytotoxins have anti-cancer effects (eg, taxol, vincristine). Science has not ignored natural sources of medicine, Lewis describes how extensive the search for cancer remedies from natural sources has been: It is important to know about the ongoing Cancer Drug Development Program inaugurated by the National Cancer Institute in 1955. By the early 1980s this rigorous and scientifically sound review process had been used to screen nearly three-quarters of a million potentially active agents, including chemical synthetics, products of fermentation, plant derivatives, marine animal products, and biological response modifiers. Each of the agents tested had some hope when review be7an, yet fewer than 70 made it to market. It is likely there are few if any effective cancer chemotherapeutic drugs among the discarded hopefuls. Natural plant substances can also cause cancer. The most outstanding example is tobacco. Other carcinogenic natural substances include fungi, actinomycetes, green plants, animals, and metals. 8 It is precisely because herbs are a source of potent drugs and toxicants that they should be marketed in a responsible and careful manner. Appeal of Herbal Remedies. Consumers have an highly optimistic opinion of the value of herbal remedies. Forty-two percent of American adults think herbal rem~dies can effectively treat serious m_nesses lik~ ~ncer: Fifttthree percent_ of herbal remedy users think that herbal remedies are as safe or better _than convenuo_nal med1c111es. F1fty-e1ght perce_nt t~mk herbals are equal or better in cost, and 65% think that herbal remedies are as effecuve or better than standard med1cauons. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Oilical Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 30 The l~ding pur~oses f?r which herbal remedies were used were: leadmg expert on herbal drug products has conceded--reluctantly--that no herb product is as safe, and more effective than standard drug for any medical purpose (indication). \"I'm not going to say [any herbal product is] more effe~tive pharmacognosist Varro E. Tyler, PhD, ScD, of Purdue declared. He appeared at drug firm Warner-Lambert offices in Ne;_, York in October, at a s~ience ~riter's briefing to launch the mainstream drug company's first two herbal products, Saw Palmetto Extract and Gmkgo Blloba Extract. They are being sold under W-L's Quanterra brand name/0 The Legal Status of Herbal Remedi~. Herbal remedies are legally classified as dietary supplements. As such they are governed by the Dietary Supplement Health & Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). The DSHEA required the FDA to use the general food safety provision which requires it to show that an ingredient is \"ordinarily injurious to health\" meaning it would be expected to harm most individuals who consume it. The FDA can also declare a supplement unsafe if it contains an ingredient for which there is inadequate information to provide reasonable assurance of risk. Future regulatory actions may tum on interpretations of terms \"substantial and unreasonable risk\" of illness or injury, and the agency's interpretations of these may result in a protracted public and legal debate. The report notes that \"consumers seem to believe that any product that appears in pill form has been reviewed for safety by FDA, which is not true for supplements.\" Also stated is that it has not yet been determined if the illnesses related to L-tryptophan \"were caused by the amino acid itself, contaminants, or a combination of both.\" The report notes that the courts are charged with being the final arbitrator in determining the safety of supplements if they have not been previously reviewed by FDA putting \"the final decision on a scientific matter in the hands of the legal system. 11 Half-truths allowed as health claims. Since 1906, among other things, articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, . ,mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; or articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or any other animal [Section 201.(g)(2), U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act]. have been legally defined as drugs (ie, medicines). The 1994 DSHEA further weakened consumer protection by allowing structure and function, but not specific disease claims. Labels may claim to \"help rebuild joints\" but not to \"treat or cure arthritis\"; or, \"relieves the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy\" but not \"prevents, treats, or cures benign prostatic hypertrophy\"; or, \"builds virility and sexual potency,\" but not \"prevents, treats, or cures impotence.\" Such label claims must include the disclaimers: does \"not claim to diagnose, mitif;ate, treat, cure, or prevent a specific disease or class of diseases,\" and that the claim has not been evaluated by the FDA 2 Are Justifications Given For the \"Free Ride\" Herbal Sellers Enjoy Legitimate? Patents & Natural Products. It has been widely proclaimed that the reason herbal product companies do no meaningful research is that natural products cannot be patented, therefore, they are unwilling to spend money on research and development It is true that substances in their natural state cannot be patented, but \"isolated natural constituents can be patented if they represent a novel composition of matter. \" 13 \"The University of Southern California has licensed the plant extract fingerprinting technology it invented to PharmaPrint, Inc., a company established by the university to develop, manufacture, test, gain FDA approval for, and sell or license pharmaceutical versions of natural medicines.\" 14 What makes these natural products patentable in the use of \"pharmaprint\" analysis to create a precise profile of the molecular components and quantifying their bioactivities. 15 Patents are analogous to contracts between the inventor and the public, which is represented by the US Patent Office. The government promises to exclude others from making, using or selling the patented product for a limited time period, while the inventor promises the government a full written description of the invention. The criteria that an invention niust meet is that it is (1) useful, (2) novel, and (3) nonobvious. Pharmaceutical utility is established when the results of standard drug-screening_procedures can be interpreted by skilled scientists as showing utility or drug effectiveness. Clinical tests are not necessary,' although they are helpful and desirable. Novelty is interpreted as whether the invention is original (ie, not part of \"prior art\" or public knowledge). The nonobvious requirement is vague but includes using existing tools to do a novel job, eg, using a nail and a wrench to remove corks from wine bottles. Finally, the ennoblement requirement is that the invention can be clearly described in a written document. 16 The International Association for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants developed a system of plant breeders rights (PBR) that is akin to patent protection that most developed countries adhere to. In addition, patents are routinely granted by developed countries for discoveries related to the particular uses of naturally occurring compounds, their synthetic variants, and processes for generating them. 17 High Cost of FDA Approval Herbal marketers argue that profits do not ju~tify the hi~h cost of moving an herbal rem~dy product through the standard FDA drug approval process. They add that it 1s not possible to patent herbal products which iThe FDA, not the US Patent Office, is responsible for determining the safety and efficacy of medicines. It is misleading to imply that a patent guarantees safety or efficacy. ALTERNATWE MEDICINE; A Crilkal Rwit:w, William T, Jervi8, PhD, All Rights Reserved, Murch, 2000. 31 further inhibits their willingness to make large financial investments in clinical trials. Robert Temple, MD, of the FDA's ~ffice_ of Drug Evaluation and R_ese~r~h rejects the view that trials are too expensive. He says that the drug industry uses high figures to show how expensive It 1s for them to stay in business. 18 The Pharmaceutical Marketing Association is the source of the data that claims it cost $231 million to develop a drug in 1990. This figure was evenly divided between direct and indirect costs. According to the PMA, the cost had grown from $54 in 1976 to $87 million in 1982, and $125 million in 1987; all were total costs evenly divided into direct and\u00b7 indirect costs 19 To my knowledge, there has been no independent confirmation of these cost estimates. It is known that creative accounting procedures can be used to run up costs. For instance, when the railroads decided to get rid of passenger trains they inflated operating costs by charging bridge and building maintenance to the passenger trains even though all trains used the facilities. How many of the high costs attributed to new drug development are for new buildings, CEO bonuses, special conferences, or whatever? Insight on the cost of drug development that can be used for comparison involves the Orphan Drug program. An \"orphan disease\" is one that affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the USA Pharmaceutical firms have little incentive to develop new drugs for orphan diseases because the potential market value is unlikely to make the investment profitl!ble. Congress passed the Orphan Drug Act in 1983. The act provided incentives such as: (1) seven years exclusive marketing rights; (2) research grants; (3) assistance with protocol design to assure conformity to regulatory requirements; ( 4) tax credits for 50% of clinical trial costs. The Orphan Products Grant Program funds $11.5 million annually (c.1998). Researchers may receive up to $200,000 a year for a maximum of 3 years for clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of orphan products. From 1983- 1998, a total of $115 million has been awarded and has funded 384 grant studies. During that same period, the FDA approved 182 orphan products. 20 Comparisons are always fraught with difficulty, but it seems clear from the foregoing data that the cost of development orphan products is far below the amount claimed by the PMA Further, the cost of p~oving the value of herbal remedies would be far less because these botanicals already exist and much is known about the .. naturally-occurring pharmacological substances they contain. Such products primarily need to be tested for safety and efficacy. The reality is that the herbal remedy product industry is a multi-billion dollar business that could easily afford to test its products if the law required it to do so. The fact that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are now selling herbal remedies proves that people in the business of marketing medications are guided more by regulatory requirements than the altruism of science. DHSEA Favors Quackery over Science. Popular culture celebrates the value of the rainforest as a source of medicines. Unfortunately, the romanticism fostered by Hollywood and others overlooks the rainforest's potential for quackery. Yale University economist Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, and Dr. Michael Balick, director of the Institute for Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden estimate that there are at least 328 new drugs that could be developed from the tropical rain forests. They say that there are about 750,000 potential extracts obtainable from the 125,000 flowering plant species of the tropical forests. They say that 375 million tests on these are possible, and that conservatively, one in a million tests results in a pharmaceutical suitable for commerce; therefore, the rain forest is estimated to contain 375 useful medicines. Forty-seven of these have already been found leaving 328 undiscovered. 21 Unfortunately, due to the lack of regulation brought about by the 1994 OSHEA, the dietary supplement industry can legally package and sell the 749,672 worthless extracts as herbal remedies--more than a 2,285:1 ratio favoring quackery! Who Markets Herbal Remedies? Reports vary on the channels through which herbal remedies are marketed. Estimated U.S. Market for Medicinal Botanicals 22 Natural Foods 32% Multilevel 27% Mass Market 17% Mail Order 8% Practitioners 7% Tea (all channels) 7% Specialty 2% MARKETING PROBLEMS Problems associated with herbal product manufacturing and labeling include: (1) improper identification of plants used in products; (2) adulteration of products with potent standard drugs (including prescription drugs); (3) variations in the dosages between, and within, herbal products; (4) poor manufacturing practices, eg, failure to identify and track pro.duct batches after production and distribution; (5) failure to provide information for proper use by consumers. And, (6) failure to track product-use for adverse effects. Identification of Plants Used in Products. In the late 1970s it was found that the consumer had less than a 50% chance of receiving a product that conforms to labeling in terms of quantity or quality.23 The probl~m begi~s wit_h the difficulty of identifying plant sources. There are four ways to name an herb: the English common name, tra_nshterauon of the herb name, the latinized pharmaceutical name, and the scientific name. The corresponding names for gmseng, for example, are ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. Jervis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 32 ?inseng, re~-shen, r~dix ginse~g, and :anax ginsen?. Common names are usually very loose. For instance, the name ginseng 1~ also apphed t~ P (Siberian gmseng). Transhterat1ons and pharmaceutical names have similar drawbacks, and some researchers find it difficult to trace them to the source species. 24 Boom & Bust Cycles. The herbal industry has admitted that boom and bust cycles pose problems. Demand for botanicals comes on very suddenly and strongly. For example, from 1997 to 1998 demand for kava grew by over 400%, and demand for St. John's wort grew by over 2800%.25 Good quality supplies are generally limited and the market is emptied out in days or hours. The scramble begins. Prices for even low quality goods skyrocket and companies end up paying high prices for poor material. Next, lot of specious or valueless material comes on the market. Growers/gatherers are encouraged by high prices and demand and good material is oversupplied just as consumers move on to the next hot herb.26 Adulteration. Investigations have revealed that herbal products have been adulterated with mood-modifying substances, or effective standard medications. It is impossible for consumers to detect such adulterations, but authorities have found it again and again. One popular herbal diet \u00b7 remedy was adulterated with the prescription antidepressant dimethylaminoethanol. Chinese herbal \"black pearls\" were found to be adulterated with the prescription anti-inflammatory agent phenylbutazone. Another herbal diet product that was bulk wholesaled to a number of companies under the name Fomiula One was found to be spiked with synthetic ephedrine hydrochloride and synthetic caffeine to boost the product's stimulating effects. Company employees gave sworn statements that they had been directed to conceal the fact that these substances were being added to the product. 27 None of these adulterations would have come to light except for the fact that users had suffered serious side-effects or died which prompted thorough investigations by authorities . . . The California Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch, initiated a study to screen imported Asian patent medicines for undeclared pharmaceuticals and heavy metal contamination using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry \u00b7and atomic absorption methods. Seventeen (7%) of243 products analyzed contained undeclared pharmaceuticals. The most common undeclared ingredients were ephedrine, chlorpheniramine, methyltestosterone, and phenacetin. Out of 251 analyzed for lead, arsenic and mercury, 24 contained at least 10 ppm lead (range 10 to 319 ppm; median, 29.8; mean, 54.9); 36 contained arsenic (range 20.4 to 114,000 ppm; median 180.5; mean 14,553); and, 35 contained mercury (range 22.4 to 5070 ppm; median 329, mean 1046). The U.S. Pharmacopoeia limits heavy metals in most pharmaceuticals to 30 ppm with lower limits for lead, arsenic, and mercury. Of 260 products investigated, at least 83 (32%) contained undeclared pharmaceuticals or heavy metals, and 23 had more than one adulterant. 28 Nearly one-fourth (23.7%) of 2,609 samples of traditional Chinese medicines were found to be adulterated with synthetic therapeutic substances in Taiwan. More than half of the adulterated products contained two or more adulterants. Four samples with either a rheumatoid or anti\u00ad inflammatory indication contained six different kinds of adulterants. Investigators state need for that labeling regulation. 29 Dosage Unreliability. Herbal products can vary greatly in dosage from brand to brand, and possibly within brands from time to time. Tests of several popular herbal remedies have found significant variation. For instance, the Los Angeles Times commissioned an analysis of ten brands of St. John's wort. Three had no more than half the potency listed on the label, and another four had less than 90% of the labeled amount. One of the lowest scoring products, with about 20% of the labeled potency, was from Sundown Herbals, a division ofRexall, the nation's #1 distributor of dietary supplements. Other lowest scorers were from Pure Source and Futurebiotics. 30 Tests by Consumers Union (CU)31 of 12 brands of echinacea found five-fold variations of the phenolic compounds caffeoyl-tartaric acid, chlorogenic acid, cichoric acid, and echinacoside. Likewise, great variations were found between and within brands of gingko biloba and ginseng products. Poor Manufacturing Practices. Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) are procedures that manufacturers must follow to ensure quality control and assurance. Included are measures to ensure sanitation of the facility and equipment, testing to ensure accurate identity and quantification of all ingredients, requirements to assure proper labeling, and other measures to assure that consumers are provided with safe, properly labeled dietary supplements. The GMPs for the supplement industry were drafted by the American Herbal Products Association, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the National Nutritional Foods Association, and the Utah Natural Foods Alliance. The FDA raised seven points of concern. 32 In July, 1999, the NNFA announced that Nature's Way and Wakunaga of America Co, Ltd were the first to have passed its GMP certification program. 33 \"Standardization.\" Standardization of herbal products means the manufacturer identifies one or a few ingredients of the herb and makes sure that each batch contains the same amount. The problem is that it is not always known what ingredients cause the desired effect (if there is one). For instance, most believe that hypericin is the active ingredient in St. John's wort, but recently hyperforin and other active compounds have been identified. Pharma ton, Inc. is marketing Movana claiming that it is more potent because it contains hyperforin. Further, if an herb exerts its effects due_ to a number of components working in concert, and standardization doesn't include all of the important ingredients, the results would be varied still. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crili&al Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights ReseNed, Morch, 2000. 33 ~so, standardized products could _still vary from one manufacturer to another. Standardizing herbal products is an improvement, but these products stlll are not as predictable as regular medications.3 4 United States Pharmacopeia. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) is now setting standards for at least 21 different herbal products in the National Fomiulary (NF). Manufacturers who meet the USP standards for purity, strength, and quality will be able to put \"NF on the label. This is similar to the \"USP\" that appears on prescription drugs and some vitamin and mineral products. For example, products labeled \"St. John's wort, NF must contain at least 0.04% total \"Feverfew, NF must contain at least 0.2% parthenolide. NF should not be confused with \"standardardized\" which some manufacturer's use to indicate that they put a consistent concentration of one or more ingredients in each batch.35 Lack of Information on Proper Use. ~.S. drug labels require: (1) description and clinical pharmacology (2) ingredients (3) indications J4) contraindications (5) warnings and precautions (6) adverse reactions (7) dosage and administration (8) overdosage. 6 Herbal products intended for medicinal use often do not contain even a portion of the kind of information people need in orcter to be able to use them p_roperly.

A telephone conversation with Richard Radkowski on 12/1/97 revealed that the Institute's work is an on-going effort, and the number of supplemental substances that has been evaluated has trebled since the encyclopedia was published. Because the growth curve makes a publication obsolete in about 6 months, no more printed versions are planned. Rather, an internet website should be up and running in about 6 months.

Promoters have touted Germany's Commission E as the \"most accurate information in the world on herbal remedies,\" and some have made it appear as if Commission E was the equivalent of the U.S. FDA, but neither is valid. Commission E obtains clinical reports from practitioners, which are of little value in a country with a strong tradition of romantic vitalism. In Germany, 70% of general practitioners employ alternative medicine. 37 It is true that Commission E has been responsible for the removal of over 100 herbal drugs from the marketplace, but a large dubious medicine industry still thrives there, with 90,000 of the 126,000 medicines on the market in Germany are \"homeojathic and natural medicines. 1138 Commission E monographs leave much to be desired.

No brand name particulars are given, so that prescribers can evaluate crucial data about herbal efficacy, quality, and safety ... The PDR actually prides itself on discussing not only 'scientifically verified applications but also uninvestigated folk uses with varying degrees of promise'.\" He says that the PDR runs the risk of becoming an encyclopedia of misinterpretable messages. Positive features noted by Marty are its identification guide with color pictures of 380 medicinal plants, details on 70 different botanicals that have caused human fatalities, and cautions about 27 other possibly lethal herbals. 42 atations 1.

Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 35 HOMEOPAIBY Legal Status/ Census: Three states (AZ, NV, CT) have separate homeopathic licensing boards. The 1993 directory of the National Center for Homeopathy (Alexandria, Virginia) listed about 300 licensed practitioners. About half of them were physicians. The rest were mostly naturopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists, veterinarians, dentists, nurses, or physician's assistants. In 1991, 36.9% of chiropractors reported using homeopathic remedies in their practices.1 With over 50,000 practitioners, chiropractors may represent a majority of those employing homeopathic remedies. Origin: Invented circa 1810 by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German physician who had abandoned medical practice after becoming disillusioned by his inability to cure patients. To earn a living, he began translating classical works into German.2 These included the occult teachings of 18th century European Masonry which were steeped in alchemy and spiritualism. In the process he became a master of ancient literature and occult ideas. 3 Hahnemann rightly rejected the harsh me~ical practices of his era which included bleeding, purging, vomiting and the administration of highly toxic chemicals! Physicians of that era based their practices on the ancient Greek humoral theory which attributed disease to an imbalance of four humors (ie, blood, phlegm, black and yellow bile) and four bodily conditions (ie, hot, cold, wet and dry) which they believed corresponded to four elements (earth, air, fire, and water). They attempted to balance the humors by treating symptoms with \"opposites.\" For instance, fever (hot) was believed due to excess blood because patients were flush; therefore, balance was sought by blood-letting in order to \"cool\" the patient. Hahnemann dubbed such practices \"allopathy\" allos (opposite) pathos (suffering). Contrary to the teachings of \"alternative\" medicine advocates, regular physicians do not prescribe on the basis of producing \"opposite symptoms,\" but on physiological effects.k Although regular medicine abandoned allopathy long ago, homeopaths continue to misrepresent medical doctors as \"allopaths.\" The antagonism engendered by this practice in the past was reflected in a statement in a popular guide for young doctors entering medical practice: Remember that the term \"Allopath\" is a false nickname not chosen by regular physicians at all, but cunningly coined, and put in wicked use against us, in his venomous crusade against Regular Medicine by its enemy, Hahnemann, ... an ever since applied to us by our enemies with all the insinuations and derisive use the term affords. \"Allopathy\" applied to regular medicine is both untrue and offensive and is no more accepted by us than the term \"heretics\" is accepted by the protestants, ... or \"niggers\" by the blacks. 4 Theory: 7/8's of all diseases are due to an infectious disorder called the Psora (ie, itch). Hahnemann's Organon states: This Psora is the sole true and fundamental cause that produces all the other countless forms of disease, which, under the names of nervous debility, hysteria, hypochondriasis, insanity, melancholy, idiocy, madness, epilepsy, and spasms of all kinds, softening of the bones, or rickets, scoliosis and cyphosis (sic), caries, cancer, fungus haematodes, gout --asthma the lungs, --megrim, deafness, cataract and amaurosis, --paralysis, loss of sense, pains of every kind, etc., appear in our pathology as so many peculiar, distinct, and independent diseases. 5 Only a small stimulus is needed to activate the body's self-healing powers. These powers are deemed to be of a vitalistic nature. Hahnemann is a child of the modern age of natural science, an adept in the chemistry of his day. But he can still hold a conviction that an immaterial vital entity animates our organism until death when the purely chemical forces prevail and decompose it. This vital entity which he characterizes as immaterial, spirit-like, and which maintains in health the harmonious wholeness of the organism, is in fact the wholeness of it. 6 Hahnemann's \"Aha, I have found the answer!\" experience involved his ingestion of cinchona bark, a remedy for marsh fever, the debilitating disease now call malaria. Hahnemann stated: I took for several days as an experiment, four drams of good cinchona twice daily. My feet and fingertips, etc, at first became cold. I became languid and drowsy, then my heart began to palpitate; my pulse became hard and quick, and intolerable anxiety and trembling but without a rigor; prostration in all the limbs; the pulsation in the head; jHowever, Hahnemann did not reject toxic chemicals per se, in fact, his \"provings\" required that toxic substances be used so he could record their adverse effects and use the information to counter the symptoms reported by patients. kA!though some medical practices may be construed as \"treating with opposites,\" science-based medicine has never been \"allopathic.\" For example, treating constipation with a method that induces a bowel movement (such as by a saline solution that dra~vs water into the int~tine), by treating di~rrhea with a substance that would have a constipating effect under normal circumstances--usually by absorbmg the excess water m the gut (Graedo11 s Best Medicine, 1991). These methods are based upon physiological rationale, not some cosmological notion of balancing the forces of nature. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilit:al Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. redness in the cheeks; thirst. To sum up, all the symptoms typical of the fever made their appearance. These paroxysms lasted from two three hours every time I repeated the dose, and not otherwise.7 36 From this experience, Hahnemann concocted his Law of Similia based upon the idea that like treats like which was a restatement the ancient doctrine of correspondences (ie, like is like, makes like, and cures like--eg, eat the heart of a lion for courage, eggs for fertility, gonads for virility, punish enemies via voodoo dolls, etc). Hahnemann conducted what he called provings in which he ingested toxic substances and recor_ded the symptoms they produced. Whatever symptoms he experienced became the basis for the diseases for which these would be administered. This shows that homeopathic remedies are symptom-based, however, the idea that symptom-based remedies somehow affect the \"vital force\" reveals homeopathy's ultimate commitment to vitalism. Also included is the Law of Infinitesimals which declares that the smaller the dose is the more effective it will be in stimulating the \"vital force\" of the body, and potentizing via sequential dilution (ie, beginning with a measured amount of \"Mother Tincture,\" dilute with 9 parts of a dilutant, shake 40 times [called \"succussion\"], dump 9 parts again; denote dilutions [3X = HP, 6C = 1a12J; and, included is the notion that when diluting solutions, tapping against a leather pad will double the dilution). Potentizing is also called dynamizing which means to act spiritually upon the vital forces. Fallaci~: (1) The Law of Similia and its inherent notion of \"provings\" have not been validated. (2) Every dose-response study in pharmacology that shows greater effects with increased dosages invalidates the Law of Infinitesimals. (3) \"Potentizing\" is invalidated both by pharmacology and common sense. (4) According to the laws of chemistry, there is a limit to the dilution that can be made without losing the original substance altogether. This limit, called Avogadro's number (6.023 x 10-23) corresponds to 24X (1 part in 1024). At this dilution there is less than a 50% chance that even one molecule of active material remains. Hahnemann himself realized that there was virtually no chance that any of the original substance remained at such high dilution, but explained it away in metaphysical terms: the thirtieth degree of dynamization represents a fraction that can hardly be written out any more. It is highly probable that during such dynamization (development of its true, inner medicinal nature) the material substance eventually dissolves completely into its individual spirit-like essence and that its crude state can be regarded as actually consisting of only this spirit-like essence, as yet undeveloped. 8 For numerical perspective consider the facts that 10 6 (one million) seconds equals 11.5 days, 1cf {one billion) seconds equals 32 years, and Hf (one trillion seconds) equals 32,000 years. 9 It has been calculated that 1030 represents a single drop in the volume of 50 earths. 10 Nevertheless, a home~athic book written by the then head of the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine refers to dilutions as great as lOOOC! Safety. Homeopathic remedies cannot be presumed to be safe due to their high dilution because not all are dilute enough to negate the pharmacological activity of their constituents. Kerr and Yarborough 12 reported a case of pancreatitis that developed in a patient ingesting a homeopathic remedy prescribed by a chiropractor. The manufacturer admitted that 40-45% of persons taking the remedy experienced a \"healing crisis\" (aka \"aggravations\" 1) that included abdominal pain. Classical homeopathy employed numerous toxic substances. Kerr found that two of six homeopathic remedies ordered by mail contained \"notable quantities\" of arsenic.13 The fact that reports of harm by homeopathic remedies are rare may be due to the reluctance of homeopathic devotees to report adverse effects.] Effectiven~. Homeopathic remedies may sometimes work because: (1) not all remedies are so dilute that they are devoid of an effective amount of an active- drug'n; (2) they have been adulterated with effective standard drugs (Morice reported that a homeopathic remedy called \"Dumcap\" appeared to be effective in treating asthma. Although labeled as containing revealed that the product was adulterated with therapeutic levels of antiasthma, steroidal drugs prednisolone and betamethasone 14; (3) they may only appear to work because of: (a) placebo effects; (b) natural remission over the extended period of time homeopaths allot for treatment; (c) misrepresentation by promoters11; (d) misexplanation.0 1A worsening of symptoms. This misguided notion causes homeopaths to misinterpret adverse reactions as a part of the healing process. The result can be that patients are delayed or diverted from proper treatment. m It is impossible to calculate the quantity of active ingredients in a homeopathic concoction without knowing the amount that was present in the \"Mother Tincture\" initially used in its preparation. 11(1) True believers, for whom homeopathy is a hygienic religion, may deny disease; (2) Promoters with a financial interest in sel~ing the products; or, with a self-interest in selling a good stoiy, may lie. For instance, Paul Klein, producer of the 1994 NBC-TV feature CURED!, adnutted as much. In the Winter, 1995 MediaCritic (\"Cure-ious\" pp.25-7) Greg Gutfeld writes, ''To produce CURED! Klein hired actors to reenact five episodes in which patients found relief or a \"cure\" through alternative therapies. One might be willing to abide such reenactments, including NBC's arrangements for the ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Oilical Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 37 Neo-Homeopathy. At least four types of homeopathy have evolved: (1) Classical: A single remedy is based upon a patient's total symptom picture; (2) Clinical: One or several remedies are administered for standard clinical conditions or conventional diagnoses; (3) Complex: Multiple remedies are mixed into a standard formula to cover both a patient's symptoms and clinical diagnosis; and, ( 4) Isopathy: Serial agitated dilutions are made from a causative agent in an infectious or toxicological condition. In addition to these, homeopathy has been connected to electrical devices, applied kinesiology, Anthroposophical medicine, and a plethora of other pseudomedical systems. Research. Proponents point to about two dozen studies which purport to find homeopathy effective. These have been criticized for poor design.15 A meta-analysis of 107 controlled homeopathic trials judged them \"not sufficient to draw definitive conclusion because of low methodological quality and the unknown role of publication bias 16. Adulterated \"homeopathic\" remedies have confused clinicians as being effective 17 In 1989 a leading French scientist at INSERM was disciplined for his part in a research fiasco which purported to show that homeopathic remedies worked via an ethereal energy imprint left homeopathically prepared water. The Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act requires each and every formulation to stand on its own if it is to be proven safe and effective for its intended purpose. Homeopathy received attention in 1994 because of a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial which compared 18 different homeopathic remedies with identically prepared placebos (said to be 85% not] with a 30C potency 1x10\u00b760) on the duration of diarrhea in 81 Nicaraguan children treatable by oral hydration. Researchers report a significantly better result with the homeopathic remedies than placebos 18. The study was done by homeopathy advocates, but asked its critics for an explanation of its results. The study's irregular design made its findings uninterpretable. Rather than testing a single remedy, 18 different ones were tested and the results grouped. Remedies were not compared with no treatment or standard therapy. Devotees attempting to validate homeopathy by testing specific remedies seem to be oblivious to the reality that a finding that a formulation labeled \"homeopathic,\" or prepared according to homeopathic theory, proved to be useful would not validate the entire homeopathic system of pharmacology, pathology, and metaphysics. Further, in order to yalidate homeopathic theory, a remedy not only would have to be proved effective in controlled clinical trials, but would \u00b7 \u00b7also have to subsequently shown to be more effective upon greater dilution. Authors of a meta-analysis of placebo\u00ad controlled homeopathic trials concluded that the clinical effects of homeopathy appear to be more than merely placebo effects, but that there was insufficient evidence that homeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition. The authors stated that \"further research on homeopathy is warranted provided it is rigorous and systematic.\" 19 [Ed Note. The authors did not discuss the possibility that homeopathic remedies could have been adulterated, or may have contained effective amounts of standard medicine. Homeopathic remedies are described by their number of dilutions rather than by quantitative analysis. No test of homeopathy can be given credence without a quantitative analysis by an independent laboratory.] Ernst re-evaluated Linde, et al's data confining the studies to those that scored 90 out of 100 possible points in at least one of the two rating systems, and those with dilutions exceeded Avogadro's number, and were administered according to classical homeopathic doctrine. Those remedies exerted only a placebo effect. 20 This supports the idea that many homeopathic remedies actually contain sufficient amounts of pharmaceutical ingredients to exert a physiological effect. Appeal: Homeopathy's appeal lies in its features as a complete system which calls more for deductive reasoning than skeptical, experimental science, and its emphasis upon emotional states of patients and art of health care. In practice classical homeopaths are advised to: (1) take time with patients (45 minutes on 1st visit); do not prescribe on 1st visit; (2) pay special attention to mental & emotion condition of patient; (3) prescribe only a single remedy at a time 21 Pathological Science? The sectarian nature of homeopathy raises serious questions about the trustworthiness of homeopathic researchers. Scofield appropriately stated: \"It is hardly surprising in view of the quality of much of the experimental work as well as its philosophical framework, that this system of medicine is not accepted by the medical and scientific community at large.\" Because homeopathy's \"laws\" contradict with the basic laws of physics, chemistry, and pharmacology, a caveat credited to American patriot Thomas Paine is appropriate. Paine warned, \"is it easier to believe that nature has gone out of her course, or that a man would tell a lie?\" Two guiding rules required by skeptics of paranormal research should be applied to homeopathic research, to wit: (1) extraordinary claims demand extraordinary explosion of a certain GM pick-up truck, but for one problem: the authenticity of the reenactments is doubtful. Klein says he purchased the stories from popular magazines (though he was vague on which magazines those were) as well as from people claiming to have been cured through alternative therapy. Assuming Klein really found these stories somewhere, he admits fiddling with them. \"We changed them around,\" he says, adding that he mixed details about several anecdotes in order to make one story. \"Combinations\" is how he describes these manufactured tales. \"Everyone does that.\" But neither the ostensibly \"real life\" medical doctors involved in the stories nor their patients were inteiviewed on CURED! to verify what supposedly happened.\" 0Homeopaths advance the erroneous \"healing crisis\" notion in which adverse reactions, or continued symptoms of illness, are explained as \"poisons coming out of the body.\" Thus, apparent failures are explained as clinical successes. People who believe such explanations will interpret failures as successes. The idea that good responses to treatment speak for themselves, and apparently bad responses are also good because the body is expelling toxins is indistinguishable from \"heads I win, tails you lose\" doubletalk. ALTERNAT/J/E MEDICINE; A CriJicaJ Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 38 evidence; and, (2) it is not necessary to prove fraud, rather, the research must be done in such a manner that fraud is not possible. A homeopathic study that does not include independent monitoring and quantitative analysis of the remedy is madequate and must be suspect. Further, a reverse dose-response curve would have to be demonstrated as well to validate homeopathic thinking. Homeopathic Propaganda To disguise homeopathy's absurdities, advocate Dana Ullman gave advice on presenting homeopathy to a \"skeptical scientifically-minded audience. Ullman advised: \u00b7 Don't use the term \"vital force\"; .. speak, rather, of the importance of \"immune response\" ... Don't talk about the Law of Similars ... rather, talk about homeopathy's ability to raise the body's resistance ... ; Don't talk about small doses; ... instead, speak about the \"inverse paradoxical action of drugs\" ... Don't assume that physicians are indifferent to the \"'Yhole person\" ... Concentrate, rather, on ... how the symptoms of a given disease can be unique to that person ... 22 Proponents say that homeopathy made major gains in popularity in the 1800s because of its success in treating epidemics. of cholera, typhoid, yellow fever, and scarlet fever. A mortality rate of 16.4% was recorded in homeopathic hospitals, compared to 51.8% in the orthodox. 23 There is no reason to believe that homeopathic treatments performed any better than doing nothing at all for the treatment of any epidemic fevers. The better survival of cholera patients showed that doing nothing was better than the heroic medical procedures of the time. Conventional treatment of the time for cholera included herbal enemas, sulfuric and nitric acid fumigations, vein cutting leeches, transfusions of bullock's blood and the ingestion of large amounts of either opium, mercury or turpentine. Thus, it was the failure of orthodox medicine, not the value of homeopathy that made the difference. Scientifically-minded people that something important had happened. They wanted to conduct controlled experiments but the homeopaths would not cooperate. 24 Homeopathy's only contribution to the \u00b7 \u00b7advancement of scientific medicine was making thinking-people realize how dangerous allopathic medicine was. To justify its Law of Similia, proponents cite the development of vaccines from the pathogens that cause a disease. But, the homeopathic paradigm includes more than this. Vaccines do not perform according to the rationale of homeopathic provings, the Law of Infinitesimals, potentization, and succussion. Further, homeopaths very often oppose immunization, which is one of the major risks it poses to its adherents. Major Risks: A survey showed that only 23% of Austrian homeopaths believe than immunization is important. 25 A UK study found that \"diversion by a homeopath\" was the leading cause of parental refusal to vaccinate. 26 Some substitute worthless homeopathic \"vaccines\" despite the fact that the UK's Council of the Faculty of Homeopathy supports conventional immunization and states that there is no evidence that homeopathic treatment produces satisfactory antibody levels.27 Apparently, UK homeopaths are such mavericks that they don't even listen to this official agency. In the USA, homeopathy appears to be a sanctuary for medical renegades. 28 A number of homeopathic practitioners have been in legal difficulty for promoting serious forms of quackery (eg, Laetrile for cancer, bogus energy medicine devices). Homeopathy is in conflict with the basic science of pharmacology and the fundamental principles of consumer protection law. Practitioners who accept and apply homeopathic principles in practice cannot be regarded as fully rational and worthy of the trust required of medical practitioners. Homeopathic Products. The recent increase in the use of homeopathy has been largely limited to the mass marketing of products. The homeopathic industry reports that sales of homeopathic medicines in non-homeopathic consumers, those that use proprietary medicines without much knowledge of homeopathy ... are way up. Yet, sales to physicians and consumers using the more traditional or technical homeopathic medicines are flat.29 The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act contains a section recognizing as drugs the remedies included in the Homeopathic Phamiacopeia of the United States. According to a historical account, homeopathy did not earn its recognition based upon scientific merit. Rather, this was \"mainly due to the efforts of Senator Royal Copeland, who also happened to be the foremost homeopathic physician of his day.\"30 The FDA does not require drugs labeled as \"homeopathic\" to demonstrate effectiveness as do regular drugs. This appears to be based upon a policy decision to keep FDA out of a political-legal battle. Homeopathic marketers would fight to be excused from meeting the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendment efficacy requirements contending that their remedies were grandfathered by the 1962 law. A food and drug attorney describes the laws regulating homeopathic products in \"Homeopathic drugs: what are they, and how are they regulated in the United States and in the European Union?\" 31 This well-written article provides the insight consumer health education specialists need to understand how a nonscientific form of health care imposes itself into the health marketplace in the late 20th ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 39 Century. It i_s cl~ar that an indefensible double-standard exists between homeopathic and science-based medicinal products. Worth readmg 1s the text of a debate that took place at the British Pharmacy Conference in 1992 following a resolution that p~ar~?cists should not be involved in the promotion and sale of homeopathic remedies. Eloquent arguments regarding the sc1entif1c status of homeopathy, the duty of pharmacists to be honest, and to guide the public in the face of pretentious pseudoscientific popular literature were followed by the defenses routinely offered for homeopathy. Points made by each of eight practicing pharmacists are also provided. The group voted against the motion which was a clear victory for scam over science. 32 In the USA, some segments of the pharmacists' profession are taking a stand for science. On May 3, 1995, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP)P passed the following resolution at its annual meeting in Dallas, Texas: Whereas, there has been an increase in the number of homeopathic products manufactured by U.S. and foreign companies that are available to the American public; and, Whereas, not all of these products are approv~d by the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States; and, Whereas, NABP believes that homeopathic products should meet the efficacy standards as determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Homeopathic Pharmacopeial Convention of the United States; Therefore be it resolved that NABP urge state boards of pharmacy not to recognize as a standard of practice the use of those homeopathic products which have not been determined to be safe and effective by the FDA and the Homeopathic Pharmacopeial Convention of the United States. The Future of Homeopathy. ~omeopathy withered in the last century because its absurdities became more and more apQarent, and students in . :homeopathic medical schools demanded that the schools become standard medical institutions. 33 The following reveal _the absurdities of the homeopathic proposition: \"If a little is good, and less is better, then none must be best of all.\" \"A drop of mother tincture in the ocean should produce a homeopathic remedy of monstrous potency.\" When they spike the punch at a homeopathic party, the less alcohol they put in the punch bowl, the drunker everyone gets; and conversely, the more alcohol in the punch, the less drunk people become. (Try to convince the Highway Patrol of that one!) If homeopathy is true then the results of every dose-response study ever done in pharmacology are delusions; if, however, such studies are true, then homeopathy is the delusion. Jarvis's Conundrum. If the administration of less and less of an active ingredient produces a more and more potent effect, why are children's dosages of homeopathic remedies halved (as is done with standard remedies); shouldn't they be doubled instead to make them weaker? According to the homeopathic paradigm, a 4X remedy is more powerful than a 3X remedy. Hypothetically, employing a 3X homeopathic concoction with a ratio of 100:1000 active to inactive molecules that would deliver 1,000,000 molecules of an active ingredient to the body, a 4X adult dose of the same medicine would have a ratio of 10:1000 active to inactive molecules. The latter would deliver 100,000 molecules of the active ingredient to the body. A half-dose of the 3X concoction would deliver 500,000 molecules of the active ingredient to the body, or 5 times as many molecules of the active ingredient as the full 4X dose. Hmmm. Homeopathic Weight Loss Patch? Commenting on the questionable worth of a \"weight loss patch\" that claimed to work through a homeopathic remedy that would filter through the skin, a North carolina physician stated that the answer to the country's weight problem is not a homeopathic patch, but homeopathic food. It would be cheap to produce and low in calories. 34 Citations I. National Board of Chiropractic Examiners. Job Analysis of Chiropractic. 1993. 2. Kaufman M.

ALTERNA111IE MEDICINE; A CriJicaJ Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 41 HYPNOSIS The Term. Hypnosis was coined by Scottish physician James Braid (1795-1860) as a replacement for \"Mesmerism.\" Origi?ally, Braid combined the Greek words for nerve (neuron) and sleep (hypnos) to form the term \"neuro-hypnotism,\" meanmg that hypnotism had imyortant medical uses and attnbuted to It cure and amehorat10ns that previously had been claimed for animal magnetism. Histmy. Magnetic healing was conceived by Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician. Mesmer was a gifted musician and a graduate of the prestigious University of Vienna medical school. His graduating dissertation dealt with planetary influence on man (1771). In experimenting with the magnetq he got the idea that the human hand possessed a similar power which he called animal magnetism. 2 The term \"animal\" was derived from the Latin word anima meaning \"spirit\" or \"soul.\" Mesmer promoted the idea of \"a subtle, universal substance which gives life and vitality; sickness is due to its loss or imbalance ... the power of animal magnetism [is] to awaken latent powers that enable people to penetrate the universal mysteries, to experience extrasensory perception and precognition, and to heal. \"3 Mesmer developed a method of therapy that is generally recognized to be akin to clinical hypnotism. Mesmer donned a purple cloak much like that of \"Merlin the magician,\" wielded a wand, and moved slowly around patients who held wands in a magical tub. More a huckster than a scientist, Mesmer did not share his methods with colleagues but franchised them to the public through the Societies of Harmony. Mesmer's questionable practices caused Louis XVI to empanel the Franklin Commission, headed by American scientist and patriot Benjamin Franklin, which exposed Mesmer as a charlatan. Patients and practitioners attested to being able to sense feelings of discomfort or heat emanating from objects that had been \"magnetized.\" A 12-year-old boy who believed himself to be sensitive to magnetism was selected. His eyes were b~ndaged (blindfolded) and he was led successively to four trees that, unbeknown to him, had not been magnetised and .. made to embrace each for two minutes. He felt strong symptoms and reacted dramatically at each. 4 Through this and other tests it became obvious to the Franklin Commission that the feelings sensed by believers was a product of their imaginations. In 1784, a practitioner named Puysegur induced a trance-like sleep in a young man he was \"magnetizing.\" He immediately realized that he had stumbled across something important. He traveled to Paris to be trained by Mesmer in the basics and then took his new skills into the provinces and began a series of animal-magnetic experiments. 5 The discovery of \"magnetic sleep\" marked the beginning of the modern era of psychological healing. Magnetic sleep uncovered a realm of mental activity that was not available to the conscious mind but could affect conscious thought and action. Because of the mysterious nature of the trance-like state, the methods employed by practitioners, and the attempt by Mesmer to franchise his discovery, mesmerism created intense controversies that continue to this time. The key to inducing magnetic sleep was \"harmonic rapport\" that led to \"mutual resonance\" between the practitioner and the patient. The first problem animal magnetists encountered with the community involved suspicions of sexual impropriety. Since all of the practitioners were men, and most of the patients were women, the intimacy of the magnetizing process was suspect. In its secret report to the king of France, the Franklin Commission stated: Ordinarily, the magnetizer has the knees of the woman gripped between his own; the knees and all parts below are therefore in contact. The hand is applied to the diaphragm area, and sometimes lower, over the ovaries. So touch is being applied to many areas at once, and in the vicinity of some of the most sensitive parts of the body . ... All physical impressions are instantaneously shared and one would expect the mutual attraction of the sexes to be at its height. It is not surprising that the senses are inflamed. The imagination, which is active, fills the whole machine [body] with a kind of confusion. It suppresses judgment and diverts attention, so that women cannot give an account of what they are experiencing and are ignorant of their state. (pp.148-9)6 Scandals abounded in which young women were reportedly seduced by Mesmerizers. One girl moved into the house of her physician and refused to return home. In a play called Animal Magnetism, published in 1789 and performed in both Dublin and London, the author presented the idea that animal magnetism could be used as a force to compel love.7 More troubling to some than the possibility of sexual abuse, was the trance itself. People behaved strangely in such a state which suggested demonic possession, out-of-body travel, thought transference, and other paranormal events. Practitioner's qParacelsus was the first to ascribe mysterious powers to magnets which he thought to be the philosopher's stone. He believed that the magnet cured epilepsy, hysteria, and spasmotic affections. It was such claims that apparently led to Mesmer's fascination with the magnet (Mackay C. \"The Magnetisers,\" in Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. 1841. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Oidcol Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 42 imagina!ions ran a\"'.a~ with _them as w~ll. Some believed that they could see into the body.' Various sects seized upon mesmensm as providmg evidence for its own particular world view. Psychics made the most of mesmerism. This is understandable given the fact that the term psychic is derived from the Greek termpsychikos, meaning \"of the soul,\" and from psyche \"soul.\" 1 of or relating to the psyche (ie, \"soul\"--in parenthesis added); 2 lying outside the sphere of physical science or knowledge: immaterial, moral, or spiritual in origin or force. (Webster's New Collegi,ate Dictionary) The followers of Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg (who claimed to communicate with spiritual beings in visions) were among the first to recognize the potential of mesmerism as actions of the spirits. 8 Andrew Jackson Davis based his practices as a \"medical clairvoyant\" (ie, one who diagnoses and prescribes based upon messages from the spirit world) on mesmerism. Spiritualists claimed that it represented proof of the existence of a soul capable of living separately from the body. Animal magnetism was associated with table turning, ouija boards, divination, psychic powers ( extrasensory perception, telekinesis, mental telepathy), and the gift of healing by touch. Phineas Quimby, who is believed to be the source of Mary Baker Eddy's ideology which led to the establishment of Christian Science, 9 was a major advocate\u00b7 of magnetic healing. The Society for Psychical Research was established out of the interest in mesmerism.s Daniel Palmer, the inventor of chiropractic, was a spiritualist and magnetic healer who practiced in a manner much like today's Therapeutic Touch nurses. Today the term \"hypnosis\" is used to refer to a variety of effects, and \"hypnotists\" may be legitimate physicians or clinical psychologists, or they may be laymen who have taken a short course in technique and now advertise themselves in the y~llow pages of the telephone book. _Stage hypnosis. Stage hypnosis is still done for entertainment. Like other exhibitions of magic and/or mentalism, the observed phenomena may be fakery, or somewhat real. By \"somewhat,\" I mean to say that things may not be quite what they appear to be. People have a strong tendency to go along with the act to quite a degree. Some hypnotists may wish to believe in the superiority of their wills, as if they acted upon their subjects in some way vaguely smacking of a master-slave relationship. But the tie that binds hypnotist and volunteer is much subtler and more precarious. It resembles the impressment technique of enlisting audience confederates ... .Impressment involves a secret communication between mentalist and spectator in the to make the latter cooperate in fooling the rest of the audience. 10 Even with stage hypnosis the need for a form of rapport is critical to success. Kaye points out that in clinical hypnosis a physician uses two or three sessions to establish rapport and progress the patient to the point where he/she is able to experience sensory illusions, while a stage hypnotist much achieve this almost immediately. Some magicians doubt the reality of stage hypnosis. Says one: \"I don't know that there is actually such a thing as hypnotic trance, at least on stage. I suspect that what really takes place is an extreme form of cooperation on the part of the volunteers.\" This view is both erroneous and correct. Anyone who has been hypnotized knows that suggestions may be responded to in spite of conscious awareness. The very fact that a subject may do what is told him, even though he is quite mentally alert, indicates that the success of the hypnotic entertainment depends a great deal on the good will of the volunteer.11 Kay says that young women make superior subjects for stage hypnosis once they get over their nervousness. Older people and young children are not good material because they have trouble sustaining concentration. Medical Applications of Hypnosis. The American Medical Association determined in 1958 that hypnosis \"has a recognized place in medicine.\" 12 Hall and Craslineck list the physiological aspects of hypnosis as (1) the relief of pain; (2) facilitating normal functioning (eg, normal bladder and bowel control when there is no organic cause for the dysfunction); (3) controlling interfering habits ( eg, cigarette smoking, eating disorders); and, the psychological aspects of hypnosis as affecting physical manifestations of psychological problems (tension headache, performance anxiety). problems of neurosis and self image.13 Dentists hypnosis as relaxation and distraction techniques, and more than half of dental schools include such training in their curricula. 14 ' Imagined visualization o{ the internal o~gans is easily explained by the fact that the brain rather than the eye itself is the center of sight. The eye receives and passes along impulses to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain forms the vision of sight from both the_sensory impulses it is receiving, and previous visualizations stored in its memory banks. This is well known to illusionists who make people misperceive what appears before them. s Crabtree devotes an entire chapter (13) to \"Animal Magnetism and Psychical Research. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Cri/kQl Revkw, William T. Jatvis, PhD, All Rights Resetved, March, 2000. 43 Sports psychologists use hypnosis to teach athletes to concentrate--to screen out all external stimuli, imagine themselves going through each part of the event, and focus on the mark, ball or whatever is the significant object involved.15 No surrendering of will is involved, rather, an assertion of will is done. Robert Baker says that self-hypnosis is like meditation. \"It's a turning in, forcing oneself to relax, concentrate, and imagine.\" 16 Consumer health educators described hypnosis as \"a temporary condition of altered attention during which suggestibility is greatly enhanced. The \"trance\" state may be used to uncover repressed memories or to increase the patient's control over a symptom or behavior. Hypnosis is not a treatment in itself but may accelerate the treatment process in properly selected cases. It has been used for anesthesia during childbirth and dental procedures and for relief of headaches and other painful conditions. Because everyone is not amenable to hypnosis, the therapist must have adequate training in both the administration of the procedure and the selection of patients.\" 17 Successful hypnosis is dependent upon the suggestibility of the subject. Stanford University's Ernest Hilgard validated tests of suggestibility that could be used to determine a person's suitability for hypnotherapy. 18 According to Robert A Baker, professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky, says that \"Hypnosis is real% nothing except social compliance, relaxation, and suggestion.\" Baker emphasizes the power of suggestion in the process. 9 atations 1.

Iridology is founded upon the belief that each area of the body has a corresponding area in the iris of the eye. \"lridologists,\" practitioners with no scientific or legal standing, claim to be able diagnose disease from the color, texture, and location of pigment flecks in the iris. They usually prescribe dubious remedies such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, gland products, colonies, homeopathic remedies and so forth, based upon what they allege to see in the eye. Some practitioners claim that the \"eye is the window to the soul\" which introduces a quasi-religious or paranormal factor to the method. Histoty? Proponents say that iridology was \"discovered\" by Ignatz Von Peczley around 1861. Von Peczley was a Hungarian physician who claimed that as a child he had accidently broken the leg of a pet owl and noticed that a black stripe simultaneously appeared in the lower part of the owl's eye on the same side as the broken leg. Some say that Von Peczley may have dreamed up the theory of iridology while he passed time in prison after having been arrested following the 1848 Hungarian revolution. After his release from prison, Von Peczley allegedly saved his mother's life with homeopathic remedies, recalled the owl incident, and began studying the eyes of his patients. Iridology was imported to the USA in 1904 by Dr. Henry Lane, w~o wrote Jridology, the Diagnosis of the Eye. For several years the leading proponent of iridology in the USA has been Bernard Jensen, a C8lifornia chiropractor. Jensen's main publications on the topic is two volumes entitled The Science and Practice of Iridology. Investigation. In 1981, J. William Santana, MPH, DHSc, completed an extensive investigation of iridology as a major study project while a graduate student at the Loma Linda University School of Public Health. Santana contacted leading iridologists and interviewed them to establish their theories and claims. In the course of following up on historical account of how iridology was \"discovered,\" Santana interviewed zoo veterinarians and even a woman near McAllen, Texas, known a~ \"the Bird Lady\" who cares for wounded wild birds. None could confirm that an owl's eyes would reflect a broken leg . . . The only one who was familiar with iridology gave his opinion that it was \"a medical farce.\" An interesting finding by Santana was that MDs who specialize in eye disorders (ophthalmologists) can recognize signs of a number of systemic diseases from examining the eyes, but iridologists that he consulted were not aware of real conditions revealed in the eyes. Santana designed a study of iridology that would have presented cooperating iridologists with pictures of irises (taken with a special camera used for such purposes) from patients suffering from known disorders and healthy controls to determine if they could separate the sick from the well patients and/or diagnose the conditions of the sick patients. Before the study could be initiated, the iridologists backed out. This was because several of them had been involved in a study at the San Diego Veterans Administration hospital in which they had failed badly. 1 Several studies since then have discredited iridology. NCAHF is not aware of any scientific evidence that confirms either the theory of iridology or the ability of iridologists to practice in a reliable manner. Consumers are advised to avoid this disproved health method. Ray-Id; A Pseudopsychology. Bill Caradonna, who teaches iridology at Bastyr University (naturopathic), has described his fascination with Ray-id iridology, a psychological/emotional system. 2 Ray-Id refers to an alleged beam of light [ray] illuminating the deepest ego [Id]). In the Rayid system, personality traits are linked to patterns seen in the iris. From appearances, Rayid iridology suffers from the same problems shared by tea-leaf, palm, and other types of psychological \"reading.\" Personality traits are complex and most people have some degree on any trait one decides to focus upon. Thus, it is easy to fit a person into whatever constellation of traits one chooses. This is why horoscopes can be applied to anyone regardless of their \"birth sign.\" Caradonna's paper is interesting as an example of how compelling pseudoscience can be for those who fail to test a system for its validity. Iridologists face extinction now that the iris is being used for personal identification at ATMs, etcetera, by a scanning device because like fingerprints and DNA, each individual has a unique iris, and the iris does not change throughout one's life.

Scheel in 1895 in New York; it is an Anglicized version of the term b~ _Hippocrates denote that every pracuuoner of med1cme was to be skilled m Nature and must strive to know what man is in relation to food drink occupation and which effect each of these has upon the other.\" 1 By this Hippocrates meant to displace the id~ tha; disease and healing were dispensed by the gods (ie, supernatural forces/ Naturopaths claim to be the \"true inheritors of the Hippocratic tradition in medicine,\" 3 but no link exists that would connect naturopathy to Hippocrates. Definition. The National Association of Naturopathic Physicians (NANP) definition was: Naturopathy (naturopathic medicine)--A system of treatment of human disease which emphasizes assisting nature. It embraces minor surgery and the. use of nature's agents, forces, processes, and products, and introduces them to the body by means that will produce health-yielding results. 4 History: Naturopathy has its roots in the Central European health spas such as that of Father Sebastian Kneipp's \"water cure,\" which was separate from the earlier hydrotherapy practices based upon the ideas of Vincent Priessnitz. Priessnitz hydropaths rejected drugs, bleeding, blistering, cupping, etc., and emphasized prevention through healthy habits and self\u00ad care. Encouraging self-reliance worked against the establishment of a guild of practitioners, and these ideas were eventually incorporated into standard preventive medicine. 5 A committee of Kneipp practitioners met in 1900 to broaden their practices to include all natural methods of healing. In 1902, German \"Dr.\" Benedict Lust (1872-1945) purchased the term \"naturopath\" from John Scheel and formed the Naturopathic Society of America and disbanded the Kneipp Societies. He also founded the American School of Naturopathy in New York. 6 Lust listed ND, DO, DC, and MD after his name. his !\\1D was alleged to be from a homeopathic and eclectic medical college, but on the witness stand he was apparently unable \u00b7 \u00b7to prove graduation. He claimed osteopathic licensure in New Jersey. He was convicted o practicing medicine without a license in New York.7 Naturopathy is also considered by some to be an heir of the Thomsonian, eclectic, and homeopathic . movements. Factionalism. Naturopathy is divided into at least two major factions. The American Naturopathic Medical Association (ANMA) is made up of practitioners from a variety of nonaccredited programs including correspondence schools. Other organizations that represent a diverse group of practitioners include the American Naturopathic Association founded by Lust, and the National Association of Naturopathic Physicians (NANP) which was once described as a merger of the ANA and the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) (Cohen WJ. Independent Practitioners Under Medicare, Dept HEW, 1968, p.127). This merger must have dissolved because currently AANP is made up primarily of graduates of Bastyr College of Natural Health Sciences in Seattle, Washington, and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon. Graduates of these two schools control the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education, an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Office of Education. A study of all 296 naturopaths in Canada divided practitioners into two different world views: scientific and holistic. NDs with scientific world views reported choosing treatments based on the available scientific evidence while holistic practitioners included a careful exploration of the patient's spirituality and their own intuition. Open-ended interviews with 16 naturopathic students at Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine and 41 practitioners found that people did not change their views but reported a new found appreciation for the others point of view by the time they completed their training.8 Legal status: In 1903 the Supreme Court of North Carolina was first to legally recognize naturopathy as a separate and distinct healing profession. As of 1998, 11 states (AK, AZ, CT, HI, ME, MT, NH, OR, UT, VT, WA) and Puerto Rico license naturopaths. 9 Florida does not issue new licenses but grandfathered existing NDs in 1985. Based upon a controversial court ruling, Idaho permits NDs to practice as long as they don't prescribe drugs or engage in procedures specifically assigned by law to Medical Doctors. Philosophy: Naturopathy's attention to prevention by lifestyle, self-care, and conservative healing methods appears to be much like the general beliefs of Preventive Medicine, an established specialty of standard medicine. However, its jabs at the \"allopathic\" straw man (see explanation about how the term a/lopathy is abused under the section on homeopathy) is typical of anti-science practice guilds. Naturopathy's opposition to proven preventive pr~ctices such as in:imuni~t~on, fluoridation, and pasteurization reveals that ideology over-rides true comm1tment prevenuve med1cme. Its belief in Vitalism (Vis Medicatrix Naturae) can be seen in its tendency to overstate the body's self-healing power, and the beneficence of \"natural\" remedies (eg, whole herbs alleged to be superior to drugs extracted from them). Orthodox medicine assumes that the world is chaotic, mechanistic. We believe in the-Vital Force which has ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,\u00b7 A Critical Review, William T.

Our way is to research the mystery and beauty of the life force, in which we have faith. Our power and our responsibility is to bring the life force into the light.10 46 Naturopaths claim to be the inheritors of the Hippocratic tradition because they pay lip service to the Vzs Medicatrix Naturea, but their belief in the \"life force\" reveals that they do not understand the most important point of Hippocrates's revolutionary proposition that the healing power of nature was not a supernatural force. Theory: \"The primary cause of disease is reaction to the unnatural environment. .. When the body is weighted down by toxins in excess of the amount with which the vital force is able to cope, then enervation ... supervenes and there is a lag in the body's ability to expel the \"ash~s of metabolism ... Enervation leads to the secondary cause of so-called disease-\u00ad toxemia. Toxemia is the state of auto intoxication resulting from the accumulation of poisons in the body--poisons taken in from without in the form in incorrect food, impure water, vitiated air, etc. and which are not thrown off by the body itself by the processes of metabolism. The presence of these poisons in the blood stream and tissues causes the vital force to make efforts to eradicate toxemia, and these efforts are what is called \"diseased crises.\" ... Disease, therefore, is not a hostile entity to be attacked, but is rather a manifestation of the vital force in its efforts to continue to live and to remove anti-vital conditions caused by man's deliberate, or ignorant, breaking of the laws of health and life ... Disease, then, is the result of stagnation and accumulation of filth in the blood stream and the tissues.11 Comment. The basis for nature cure is found in the notion that the body innately knows what is best for it. Disease symptoms should not be suppressed because they represent the body's natural healing processes. Although selective e~amples may be cited to support the idea, it cannot be applied as universally as naturopaths believe. More dangerous is .. the corollary belief in the so-called healing crisis which holds that adverse reactions associated with their practices (herbal remedies, fasting, colonies, etc.) are due to \"toxins\" being expelled; and, that the worse are these adverse symptoms the worse would have been the future diseases being prevented. This false belief allows a naturopath to assert that the patient is \"getting better\" if they feel good, bad, or indifferent. Because patients must rely upon the clinical interpretations of their doctors for explanations of their health status, such clinical judgments should be based upon sound science and not fanciful theories such as the healing crisis. Training & Practices: Naturopaths are eclectic (select what they personally likes from a cacophony of philosophically-based procedures), and empirical (practiced by subjective clinical experience in much the same manner as medicine in the prescientific era). Naturopathy must ultimately be judged by the validity of its practices. Included in the curricula of naturopathic training schools are a mixture of pseudomedical practices (eg, homeopathy, herbalism, colonies, reflexology, iridology, dubious dietary practices, fasting, food combining, acupuncture, energy medicine) and established practices (eg, physiotherapy, massage, manipulation, hypnotherapy, counseling) available in the health marketplace from practitioners with a science-based training. Much financial support for naturopathic education comes from the health foods industry, herbal trade associations, homeopathic suppliers, and other's who disdain consumer protection law and science. At least one college offers preceptorships at Mexico border clinics which traffick in cancer quackery. Major Risks: Complications of natural childbirth; belief in the \"healing crisis\"; misuse of herbs and drugs; megavitamin therapy; discouragement of childhood immunizations; delay in, or diversion from, proper medical care for patients afflicted with life-threatening .conditions or which there are effective medical interventions available. Many naturopaths advance unfounded claims for herbal remedies. Included are such false ideas that (a) herbs can't harm, only help; (b) natural herbs are superior to standardized medications which have been approved by the FDA; and, (c) the Doctrine of Signatures is meaningful as a guide to selecting the \"correct\" herbal remedy.

Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 47 TI-IERAPEUTIC TOUCH History and Theory. Therapeutic Touch (TT) was developed by Dolores Krieger, RN, PhD, as a result of Dona !<unz, an e~ntri:, sel!-st:led \"fifth-generation sensitive\" the American Theosophical Society. Krieger assisted Kunz m her studies of Oskar Estabany who claimed to have healing power in his hands. 1 Krieger curried favor with nurse theorist Martha Rogers, chair of nursing at New York University by fitting her activities to Rogers' theory of \"unitary man.\" Rogers theorized that all persons are highly complex fields of various forms of life energy, and these fields of energy are coextensive (ie, \"having the same spatial or temporal scope or boundaries\" 2) with the universe and in constant interaction and exchange with surrounding energy fields. Wellness, she believed, is a product of the harmonious exchange between an individual's energy field and the environment. TT advocates generally consider it to be part of \"energy medicine,\" but TT may be also related to ayurvedic (Hindu) medicine because Krieger theorized that \"Prana\" is \"at the base of the human energy transfer in the healing act.',3 Advocates have invented the diagnosis of energy field disturbance, \"The state in which a disruption of the flow of energy surrounding a person's being results in a disharmony of the body, mind, and/or spirit,\" 45 to justify the use of TI. Practice. TI is an intuitive practice engaged in mainly by \"holistic\" RN's involving the near \u00b7laying on of hands with great compassion. Practitioners do not actually touch clients. Non-contact \"touch\" is an oxymoron typical of new age terminology. The TT procedure involves: (1) Centering: a meditative process; (2) Assessment: healer scans patients alleged energy fields with the hands searching for temperature changes, tingling, pressure or pulsation; (3) Unruff1ing the field: when healer perceives a sense of pressure while scanning the body she/he is said to be bumping against stagnant energy--the procedure is to sweep the energy downward with the hands paving the way for an energy transfer; (4) alleged Transfer of Energy to healee. In practice, TT closely resembles the technique employed by Magnetic Healer Daniel D. Palmer the founder of chiropractic (see chiropractic section). \u00b7 \u00b7 Lln.k: to Witchcraa Witchcraft is the practices of wicca, an ancient fertility religion. Wicca is the root of the word wicked6 because it worships both good and evil as equal, opposite, and co-eternal. Wicca is enjoying a resurgence as neopaganism, New Age, and ecofeminism. A political faction within the nursing profession, reacting to male resentment stemming from traditional RN-MD subservience, is advancing Wicca because of its traditional elevation of women. TT is indistinguishable from Pranic healing as described in a how-to manual on witchcraft7. Buckland adds preparation details for the healing ritual. A circle is drawn around the patient who lies on his back with his head towards the east. It is recommended that both the healer and patient be naked. The federal government's Equal Opportunities Employment Commission (EEOC) considers TT to be among a number of \"new age\" techniques derived from eastern religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. As such, employers may not require employees to participate in IT training programs if it is contrary to their beliefs.8,9 In the USA RNs who object to having TT imposed upon them can object on the basis of the EEOC rule. National League for Nursing Endorsement. TT has gained status because it is endorsed by official nursing groups such as the National League for Nursing (NLN), the federally recognized accrediting agency for schools of nursing.' NLN has qualified some very strange courses for continuing education credit. An \"energy intensive workshop\" approved for nursing CE credit teaches \"Basic Energy Healing which cites \"understanding the human aura,\" \"how to access your intuitive, psychic centers for deep insights,\" and a \"step-by-step system for releasing stress and integrating the physical, emotional, mental & spiritual bodies.\" And, \"Heightening Intuitive Awareness\" which teaches how to \"access information from you own and others masters and spirit guides, sense angelic presence, exorcise entities and releases trapped spirits, channel past life information, contact people who have passed over, explore fourth and fifth dimensional realities, and scan the physical and emotional bodies for blockages.\" 10 Potential Hazards. TI advocates general state that the procedure is not a cure for any disease, and that it is not a substitute for standard medicine, but complementary to it. However, they also say that by using the method patients can sometimes avoid using medications or the need for surgery. By this, TT advocates are employing a very old strategy of deflecting the criticism that they are diverting patients from effective care, while putting forward the claim that TT is a substitute for proven medicine. NCAHF has been told of a patient who canceled scheduled surgery, and another who discontinued standard cancer treatment, after TI treatment and indoctrination. In both cases, the decision to quit standard therapies was not immediate, but the fruition of the idea that a more fowerful source of healing was possible through \"adjusting one's energy field.\" 1 ftHealing Touch\" (H1). An off-shoot of TI is a form of psychic healing being called \"healing touch\" (HT).u HT does not 1Tois may soon end. The Department of Education's National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity recommended in June, 1996, that the NLN's 54-year recognition be ended. At the time of this writing, the NLN's final appeal rests with DOE Sec!etary Richard W. Riley. (Canavan K. \"Department of Education rejects NLN appeal,\" American Nurse, 1996). uPersonal communication with Bela Scheiber, 3/16/97. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Critical Revit:w, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 48 pretend to be scientifically-based. The work of Krieger, Quinn and others who have published reports on TT is ignored. HT may represent an attempt to put this type of treatment on a quasi-religious level. Critical Resource. The National Therapeutic Touch Study Group (NTTSG) has published a 180-page Survey of Therapeutic Touch \"Research\" as of March, 1997. \"Research\" is placed within quotation marks because it becomes clear that most of the work falls short of what deserves the name. The tome provides a history of why and how the document came to be. It contains the following sections (italicized) and contents: Describing TT presents TT in the words of leading TT proponents themselves. State of the Art reveals where TT actually is. This is important because proponents claim to have established TT scientifically. Rosa shows that TT is a \"pseudoscience.\" Trans-Research Claims cites claims made by TT researchers that have not even been addressed by their research. This section more than any other speaks to the amount of quackery in TT. Historical Survey provides a fascinating snapshot of how TT came to be. The \"Research\" organizes 137 papers into 7 categories: metabolic change, hematology, analgesia, relaxation, other mental states, effect on practitioners, qualitative research, and miscellany. Abstracts and critiques of each study follows under each category. There are 4 annex sections: Bibliography, categorization of Quinn's Reading List (purported to justify TT in an academic setting to a committee investigating TT at the University of Colorado in 1992); Government Statements, and Development of TT. The last section is a comprehensive article entitled \"Hand to hand combat: what happens when a skeptical nurse takes on pseudo-nursing?\" that presents the whole sordid story of TT and its development. It is well-suited for use as a handout for students. This monograph is an essential item for anyone who wants to be fully informed on the realities behind this New Age nursing pseudoscience. It also serves as a model for others who may be evaluating a controversial field to emulate. The project was carried out by Linda Rosa, RN. Order from the NTTSG, 711 W. 11-year-old Emily Rosa caused enormous embarrassment to the proponents of Therapeutic Touch (TT) through the publication of an experiment that she performed for a junior high school science project when she was \u00b7nine.12 Emily's simple experiment was aimed at the most basic assumption of TT, which is that there exists an \"energy field\" around the body that can be sensed, and favorably altered, by a TT practitioner. If there is no energy field, or if it cannot be sensed, there is no basis for the sequential notion that the field can be altered by hand-waving. Emily simply tested whether or not 21 experienced TT practitioners could sense an energy field if they could not see whether or not anyone was actually within close proximity. They couldn't, which showed that their perception of an energy field was a product of their imaginations, not reality. Citations 1. Rosa L. \"Therapeutic Touch,\" Skeptic, 1994;3:(l):40-9. 2.

ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Cridcal Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 49 'IRADffiONAL CHINESE MEDICINE The.~xpressio? \"Chinese M~!cine,\" as use? by proponents of \"alternative\" healthcare, encompasses certain aspects of trad1t1onal Chmese folk med1cme, and a vanety of techniques which only claim to be based upon Chinese ideas. \"Chinese Medicine\" is not synonymous with standard healthcare in China. The latter is predominantly science-based as it is elsewhere in the world. To separate the mishmash of practices being promoted under the guise of \"Chinese Medicine,\" and to understand their rationale, it is necessary to have insight into ancient Chinese cosmology, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and to know something about contemporary methods promoted as forms of Chinese medicine. Ancient Chinese Cosmology Five Elements. Ancient Chinese cosmology is founded on the idea of searching for the tao (pronounced \"dow\") ie, the \"way\" or \"path\" of nature. The universe consists of a vast indivisible entity made up of five elements: earth, metal, water, wood, and fire. The expression \"five elementsh derives from two Chinese words: wu (\"five\") or \"walk\"). Its implicit meaning is \"five processes.\" Qi, Chi The elements are alleged to be manifestations of chi (aka, Qi, pronounced \"chee\") the alleged \"life energy\" (curiously, the Chinese consider both breath and \"breaking wind\" to be manifestations of chi). Creation / Destruction. Each of the five elements creates and destroys one another: Wood creates Fire (wood is flammable) Fire creates Earth (ashes result) Earth creates Metal (metal is found in the ground) Metal creates Water (melting metal becomes liquid) Water creates Wood (by being watered a tree grows) Wood destroys Earth (growth depletes soil nutrients) Earth destroys water (soil soaks up water) Water destroys Fire (extinguishes flames) Fire destroys Metal (causes metal to melt) Metal destroys Wood (the ax fells the tree) Each of the five elements symbolizes a group of physiological functions. For example, metal represents decay, and wood represents growth. As is found in all cosmological systems, every factor has influence. The weather: heat injures the heart; cold injures humidity the spleen; and, dryness injures the kidneys. The winds: the east wind injures the liver, throat and neck; the south wind injures the heart, chest, and ribs; the west wind injures the lungs, shoulders, and back; the north wind injures the kidneys and hips. which have not be scientifically shown to exist. Correspondences. Closely associated with the elements are the five planets Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, and Mercury. Each planet is endowed with astrological qualities of personality and behavior (these differ from Chaldean notions). The elements and planets are also correlated to other images and concepts by a system of \"correspondences\": Elements: Wood Fire Metal Water Earth Planets: Jupiter Mars Venus Mercury Saturn Emotion: Anger Joy Sorrow Fear Compassion Fluid: Tears Perspiration Mucus Saliva TISSues: Ligaments Arteries Skin & Hair Bones Muscles Orifices: Eyes Ears Mouth Genitals Nose Viscera: Liver Heart Lungs Kidneys Spleen Flavor: Sour Bitter Tart Salty Sweet Climate: Wind Heat Dryness Cold Humidity. Color: Green Red White Black Yellow Directions: East South West North Center Season: Spring Summer Autumn Winter Late Summer-Early Autumn Seasonal Character: Blossoming Ripening Harvesting Storing Preserving Guiding Rules of Behavior for High Officials: Exercise mildness Instigate Sit in judgment Retreat Contemplate Yin and Yang. Two primordial potencies, yin and yang, are believed to regulate the universe bestowing power unto all things. Yang represents the male positive energy, producing light, warmth, and fullness. Yin is female, negative, the force of darkness, cold, and emptiness. Yin and Yang each exist within each, manipulate heaven and earth in the waxing and waning of seasons and days, and exert their power over human beings. Diseases occur when the balance between Yin and Yang are disturbed. Critique. The ancient Chinese had no concept of modern physiology, bioche~i~try, nutrition, or mechanisms of healing known today. Dissection of the human body was not done, so there was very hm1ted knowled~e of anatomy. There was no knowledge of the existence of cells, the circulation of blood, the function of nerves, or the existence of hormones, and so forth. Thus, ancient Chinese cosmology is a product of the imagination that even proponents-ha~e describe~ as \"~oo rigid to describe physiological functions accurately.\" However, like any \"system\" it can be used as a gmde for makmg diagnoses ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 50 ~n~ ~rescriptions, and ~n be used to rationalize the result of subjective experience. The same clinical illusions (eg, self\u00ad hm1tmg ~spects of _t~e diseases themsel:es, _variati~ns in symptoms, the placebo effect, the effects of psychotropic herbs) that deceived pract1t10n~rs of other h~ahng ideologies will provide ample clinical \"evidence\" of effectiveness for the system to b~ perpetuated. In t~is wa~, TCM i~ no more, or less, to blame for perpetuating error than is ancient Hindu ayurvedic medicme (uses pulse diagnosis, prescnbes strange remedies including animal feces and drinking one's own urine), Greek humoral medicine (provid~ reaso~s for bleeding, pu~ging, blistering, Egyptian (overemphasized enemas and drenches), native Amencan (tobacco was highly valued), or any other healing \"system.\" After all, it wasn't until so-called \"double-blind\" research methods were developed that modern medical scientists became able to separate clinical illusions from realities. CLASSICAL TCM Diagnostic Methods Based Upon TCM.v Pulse Diagnosis. TCM practitioners analyze six pulses at each wrist. They use such expressions as \"bolstering-like,\" \"confined,\" \"floating,\" \"leather,\" \"soggy,\" and \"wiry\" to describe their findings. A \"wiry\" pulse, for example, signifies liver disease. Tongue Diagnosis. TCM theory assigns areas of the tongue to internal organs, and various tongue conditions to internal organ conditions. For example, lateral tooth marks allegedly signify a \"spleen Qi deficiency.\" Physiognomy. TCM physiognomy postulates that areas of the face correspond to internal organs. None of the TCM \"diagnostic\" methods have been scientifically validated, and modern Chinese medicine does not use such methods. Patient Interview. TCM practitioners interview patients as they take pulses, look at tongues, and study facial features. The patient's psyche is probed to determine personality characteristics in terms of yin or yang, hot or cold, and so forth. This introduces a huge subjective factor into the situation, imbues the practitioner with seemingly great insight, and enhances the \"power of the situation.\" The effect of asking a large number of specific personal questions on the patient is the perception that diagnoses are tailored specifically for him or her. People will rate the same analysis of themselves significantly more accurate if they believe it has been highly personalized. Psychologists have dubbed this \"the PT Barnum effect.\"1 Treatment Methods Based Upom TCM Acupuncture Theory: A vitalistic energy force, Chi with opposing features yin and yang flow through meridians, and organs have corresponding points on the body. Internal organs, which were thought to be intermediaries between the body and nature, were assigned qualities representing emotional states, colors and seasons. Originally there were 365 acupuncture points. This was based upon astrology with one for every day of the year, there are now over 2,000. Dr. Felix Mann, Dean of British acupuncturists stated: \"Acupuncture points and meridians do not exist. There are so many acupuncture points that there is no skin left which is not an acupuncture point.\" 2 TCM practitioners do not rely upon specific acuQuncture points. The idea that there is a point for each Western diagnosis is demeaned as \"formula\" acupuncture.3 A traditional acupuncturist might treat ten tension headache patients in ten different ways, because of differences in the patients deduced from a variety of traditional methods of diagnosis. Several have claimed to have discovered a link between anatomy and alleged acupuncture points. Baldry's book 4 breaks with TCM and attempts to redefine acupuncture in conventional medical terms. It is the stimulation of trigger points, not traditional acupuncture points, that may have clinical value. 5 Others have suggested that acupuncture points may have decreased electrical resistance,6 or that nerve bundles may explain acupuncture points. Cho, et af state that when the alleged vision-associated acupoint (VAl) which is located in the lateral aspect of the foot is stimulated, activation of the occipital lobes of the brain is seen by functional MRI (fMRI), while stimulation of a control points 3-5 cm away produced no such response. However: (1) The authors only speculate about of possible mechanism. The authors admit in the introduction that \"How acupuncture works is largely a mystery and has been never scientifically proven or experimentally verified.\" This paper was intended to offer a mechanism for acupuncture. It suggests that acupuncture \"works\" through a trinity of acupoint-cerebral cortex-end organ route, rather than by affecting the end organ directly. 8 (2) The validity of [MRI instrumentation is questionable. fMRI records changes in blood flow (which can be affected by vFor a descriptive analysis of how a TCM practitioner utilizes pulse and tongue diagnosis, see Faze! M. \"Now show me your tongue: a taste of medicine in China,\" The Lancet, 1995;346:1687-8. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 51 peripheral physical stimulation), but also records brain activity due to thoughts and other mental activity regardless of the source of stimulation. Mere attention modulates fMRI scans. 9 (3) Chance alone may account for the correlation. Given that there are over 2,000 alleged acupuncture points, and a given number of brain lobes, chance alone could account for the fact that a few would match. ( 4) So what? Does this observation have clinical significance? Is the mere stimulation of the occipital lobe therapeutic? Histmy. Acupuncture dates back to the golden age of China (circa 5th century BC), which was the time in which lived Lao Tzu, the spiritual father of Taoism and Khung Fu-tsu (aka confucius). 10 The West accepted and rejected acupuncture four times in the last 300 years before its latest resurgence. At the beginning of the 19th century the acupuncture craze started in France. Acupuncture's rejection each time after a period of vogue was because accounts of its virtue were too marvelous and evidence, except for \"the most treacherous kind, the evidence of success,\" was totally wanting. Considering the diseases in which the greatest success had been obtained were attributable to the influence of the imagination.11 The time period and location were the same as for the testing of Mesmerism and Perkins Metallic Tractors, the success of each of which had been shown to be due to the ima1ination.1213 Among those using acupuncture in medical practice around 1880 was the notable physician, William Osler. 4 Legal status: All states permit acupuncture to be performed. Some limit its use to physicians, others permit lay practitioners under medical supervision, and some permit unsupervised lay practitioners. Lay persons who perform acupuncture may use titles such as: Certified Acupuncturist (CA), or Master Acupuncturist (MA) which can be granted by state licensing boards, Diplomate of Acupuncture (Dip! Ac) given by the National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncturists, Oriental Medical Doctor (OMD, MOD) which is unrecognized, or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) . .Education & Training. Fourteen schools or colleges of acupuncture are accredited in the USA Programs of study run from \u00b7 \u00b7 3-4 academic years, and are offered at the postgraduate level. 15 No American school granting a Ph.D. in acupuncture is accredited. Admission standards for Chinese medicine schools in the USA do not instill confidence. A veteran administrator of Chinese medical education in the USA stated: There are more than fifty acupuncture and/or Chinese medicine schools in this country. Most of them are very small, under-funded, and barely surviving. There is no entrance examination and the admission is not competitive. Occasionally, several elite student (sic) attend these schools but only finding themselves dropping out from the class after several weeks. If these elite students would have gone through the whole program, they would still be unable to integrate this ancient medicine into modern scientific medicine language to explain to consumers. 16 Census. The American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine represents about 1,500 U.S. acupuncturists.17 The National Acupuncture Headquarters (AAAOM) estimates there are probably about 9,000 practicing acupuncturists. There are 2,289 NCCA certified acupuncturists. The AAMA estimates there are 1,500 physicians trained in acupuncture, and 2,000-3,000 additional physicians who have been exposed to enough short courses to use acupuncture in the practices occasionally. 18 Clinical Value of Acupuncture Consumer Health Evaluation. In 1991, the National Council Against Health Fraud completed a 3-year study of acupuncture in the health marketplace, and a review of the scientific literature and concluded that: (1) Acupuncture is an unproven modality of treatment. . . (2) Its theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relauonsh1p to present scientific knowledge. . . . . (3) Research during the past twenty years has failed to demonstrate that acupuncture 1s effecllve agamst any disease. (4) Perceived effects of acupuncture are probably due to a combination of expectation, suggestion, counter-irritation, operant conditioning, and other psychological mechanisms. (5) The use of acupuncture should be restricted to appropriate research settings. (6) Insurance companies should not be required by law to cover acupuncture treatment. (7) Licensure of lay acupuncturists should be phased out.19 The placebo effect and Value of acupuncture as a psychological aid. The placeb~ effect is the perc~ptio~ ~f benefit resulting from the act of treatment rather than the treatment itself. More than 30 vanables have been 1dent1f1ed that can affect placebo response. 20 Some of these mechanisms are operative in animals which brings into question the popular, unproven belief that animals do not respond to placebos, an argument often employed by acupuncture defenders. Placebo therapy is appropriate for dealing with behavioral conditions such as chronic pain, addiction, eating disorders, weight management, and so forth. Procedures that have no other than placebo value may be used as a psychologica[ aid (PA) to treatment. The effects of a PA goes beyond what is normally thought of as a placebo.

A meta-analysis of the effects of acupuncture on chronic pain concluded that \"the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain remains doubtful.\" 22 Ulett's group at the University of Missouri Medical School found that adding electrical stimulation increased endorphin production and doubled the analgesia of acupuncture. 23 Addiction Therapy. A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of acupuncture on addictions concluded that claims that acupuncture is efficacious for cigarette smoking, heroin or alcohol addiction are ... not supported by results from sound clinical research. 24 The 19'J7 NIH Acupuncture Consensus Conference. The media announced to the public that the NIH had given its blessing to acupuncture following the Nov 3-5, 1997 NIH Consensus Conference. Some sources reported this story as \"NIH approval of acupuncture.\" To properly interpret this event one must first appreciate the nature of an NIH consensus statement. According to NIH, consensus statements are prepared by a nonadvocate, non-Federal panel of experts based upon presentations and discussion at the conference. Such statements are NOT policy statements of the NIH or the Federal Government. The make-up of the consensus panel did not instill confidence in the claim that it \"substantially consisted of nonadvocates.\" Even if the panel had been unbiased, the conference presentations were clearly unbalanced. When ~CRHI reviewed the literature on acupuncture up to 1989, it found a predominance of negative findings. Two major meta- . :analyses, 25 that covered the same time period found the same predominance of negative outcomes. Negative findings also predominated the 1993 FDA review of acupuncture. 26 There were no major scientific findings since then that would change the view that acupuncture is mostly a powerful placebo and/or a psychological aid for use in managing behavioral disorders. A balanced program would have contained a representative proportion of negative studies, but this was not the case. An objective consensus panel functions much like a jury at a court trial. It bases its verdict upon the evidence that was presented. If significant adverse data is omitted from the evidence, the jury cannot be blamed for an erroneous conclusion. The consensus conference appeared to be bent on putting the best face possible on acupuncture. European Commission Evaluation, 19'J8.27 A diverse group of professionals delegated by their national governments examined the key areas of debate within healthcare that could lead to more informed discussions on unconventional medicine in the future. The commission reviewed the social context of unconventional medicine, clinical and basic research, and constraints for research results being applied in practice. Below are the Commission's comments on the usefulness of acupuncture: Nausea/Vomiting. We estimate that acupuncture and acupuncture-like interventions (acupressure, electrical or laser stimulation at acupuncture points, etc.) have been investigated in more that 250 controlled trials and in a much larger number of uncontrolled prospective studies and case series. The majority of the controlled clinical trials involve a comparison of \"true\" acupuncture with a \"placebo\" or \"sham\" acupuncture ... Good evidence from controlled trials for a clinical effect which is both superior to placebo and clinically relevant is up to now available only for the stimulation of the point P6 for nausea and vomiting, 28 especially for post-operative vomiting.29 Pain. Despite its widespread use--also in academic hospitals--the evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of various pain conditions is not convincing. Results are contradictory and the methodological quality of the majority of studies is at least partly inadequate. 30 Asthma. The results of controlled clinical trials for asthma treatment are contradictory.31 Smoking Cessation. There is increasing evidence that \"true\" acupuncture has very little or no effect over \"sham\" acupuncture while the unspecific effects seem to be of similar size of other treatments (ie, nicotine chewing gum) which have been shown to be superior to placebo. This suggests that the placebo effect induces by acupuncture might be of similar size as the combined unspecific and specific effects of another treatment. However, the available evidence is insufficient to allow a reliable assessment of this hypothesis. 32 Stroke rehabilitation. The addition of acupuncture to the ordinary treatment yielded some promising results.33 Mental Health Applications. Because of the enduring aspects of human nature, including the natural tendency of magical thinking, ancient cosmologies have functional value if the patient holds a prescientific (superstitious) world view.34 Hu.ards. The frequency of complications from using acupuncture in the USA and Canad~ is unknown. Pra~titioners do not systematically report such events. The medical literature, legal documents, and media accounts contam _reports of fainting, hematoma, convulsions, punctured lungs, local infections, hepatitis B, AIDS, bacterial endocardius, contact dermatitis, and nerve damage. These would result from misplaced needles, unsterile needles, and individual patient or ALTERNA11VE MEDICINE; A CriJical Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 53 practitioner factors. The Institute of Community Medicine at the University of Tromso, Norway asked 1135 randomly selected doctors and 197 acupuncturists to report adverse effects they had seen caused by acupuncture. Reports of harm came from 12% of the doctors and 31 % of the acupuncturists. Type of Adverse Effect Mechanical Injury Infection Psychiatric problems Fainting during treatment Increased pain Nausea / Vomiting Delayed \"doctor contact\" . Miscellaneous other Total number of patients . Number of Patients Seen by Acupuncturists . Physicians 10 32 2 92 0 132 25 25 0 ...1. 201 20 10 31 10 10 ...1. 202 Researchers believe that this is an underestimate of adverse effects because they think that some are never reported by the patient. Since only 10% of Norwegian doctors were surveyed, the actual numbers of adverse effects are likely to be ten times greater than these numbers represent. Researchers note that acupuncturists encounter mostly immediate adverse effects, while doctors encounter adverse effects seen some time later. They conclude that adverse effects by acupuncture are more than \"occasional,\" and that there should be an increased focus on who should practice acupuncture. 35 Reports of Hann. A 59-year-old female experienced lead intoxication from Chinese herbal pills prescribed by an herbal a~upuncturist. 36 Four cases of hepatitis B among persons receiving acupuncture at a chiropractic clinic in Orange Coun~, . :Florida.37 Hepatitis B in 21-yr-old male Korean-American athlete treated for groin muscle pull in Seoul, S. Korea. 8 Four cases of ~seudomonas chondritis of the ear in patients receiving treatment from the same Santa Clara County (Calif) acupuncturist. 9 A 64-year-old female experienced insomnia, tremor and headache from a ginseng product (Natrol High). Three years later she experienced similar symptoms from a ginseng tonic prescribed by an acupuncturist. 40 A 64-year-old, healthy, active female with no previous le~ disease experienced thrombophlebitis associated with acupuncture needle insertion into the calf to relieve neck pain. 1 Endocarditis in 59-yr-old female with prosthetic heart valves (such patients said to be at high risk when undergoing any kind of i~ection). 42 A 30-yr-old female, and a 35-yr-old female each developed lipoatrophy following acupuncture treatments. 3 Two cases with no other risk factors believed to be HIV\u00ad infected by acupuncture. 44 A 17-yr-old boy with no other risk factors treated for rugby related tendinitis for 6-weeks. 45 A total of five fatalities are documented in the literature. 46 An overview that identified 126 documented cases of hepatitis associated with acupuncture, HIV infections, and a variety of other problems is cited. 47 Moxabustion / Moxil>ustion Moxabustion (cauterization with moxa) is the practice of burning small quantities of Chinese wormwood (Artemisia vulgaris) on the skin. While acupuncture is employed for diseases with an alleged \"excess of yang,\" moxabustion seeks to restrain an excess of yin. Acupuncture is theorized to be \"cold,\" while moxabustion is \"hot.\" Many moxabustion points are alleged to correspond with acupuncture points, but others do not. Chinese doctors rely upon drawing that mark unfit points for moxabustion. 48 Moxibustion involves an application of heat to acupuncture points either in the manner of moxabustion, or with an external heat source.49 Qigong Qigong (pronounced \"che-gong\"; Qi= the vital force, gong Mandarin =skill [ Cantonese equivalent = kung]); literally \"to work the vital force\" or \"practicing with the breath\" ie, breathing exercises). 50 Qigong exercise is basically self-suggestion, a form of autohypnosis, similar to relaxation techniques imagery, and meditation. There are many qigong exercise methods including active exercise, quiet exercise, exercise while sitting, standing or walking. All types aim at achieving special repose, as if one is asleep but not asleep, awake but not awake. This response is self-hypnosis. 51 Qigong exercises are regarded as valid methods for relaxation, improving psychosomatic disorders, and \"improving the immune system,\" although quality assessments of the research are not generally available. TCM Diet Therapy An old Chinese saying is to: \"Let food be your medicine, and medicine your food.\" Foods and pharmaceutical herbs are not fully separable in a cosmological system. The curative effect of a food, or food-drug mixture, depends upon its \"nature\" and \"flavor.\" The \"natures\" are: cold, hot, warm, and cool. The \"flavors\" are: salty, sour, sweet, bitter, and pungent. TCM practitioners seek to neutralize illness by prescribing foods and food-drug mixtures whose nature and flavor antagonize the nature and flavor of the disease. In his book, Chinese System of Food Cures (1986), Henry C. Lu, PhD, recommended eating fifteen to twenty-five oysters with meals to cure tuberculosis of the lymph nodes and goiter (or one may use oyster sauce as seasoning if fresh oysters are not available). For weight loss, Lu suggested eating meat cooked in a sauce whose \"warm,\" ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,\u00b7 A CriJicaJ Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. \"hot,\" and \"pungent\" ingredients have rendered it \"very yang. \"w TCM Herbalism 54 According to a report by the Dept of Clinical Pharmacology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's Prince of Wales J:Iospital, at least 7,000 species of medicinal plants are used in China. Of the 150 species most commonly used, 10 are tOXIC. In Hong Kong, most cases of serious poisoning are related to caowu, the root of Aconitum kusnezoffii, and chuanwa, the ofAconitum carmichaeli, which are used to treat rheumatism, arthritis, bruises and fractures. These contain variable amounts of highly toxic alkaloids including aconitine. Signs and symptoms include neurological (paraesthesia and numbness, muscle weakness), cardiovascular (hypotension, ventricular ectopic beats, arrhythmias), or gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Main causes of death related to aconitine are cardiovascular collapse and ventricular ar_rhythmias. Anticholinergic poisoning is common and mostly due to yangjinhua or naoyanghua (flowers of Datura mete/ L and Flos rhododendri mollis respectively) used to treat asthma, chronic bronchitis, pain from injury, epigastric pain, and toothache. These may contain scopolamine, hyoscyamine, and atropine. Infants are at greater risk than adults due to lower body weight and inadequate hepatic dru_g biotransformation and d~toxification enzymes. one survey showed that 28-51 % of Hong Kong Chinese infants were given chuenlin by their mothers which contains the alkaloid berberine. Berberine can displace bilirubin causing a rise in free bilirubin and increasing the risk of brain damage. Stephania tetrandra and Magnolia officinalis found in a slimming regimen has been associated with rapidly progressing fibrosing interstitial nephritis. Liquorice is commonly used in confectionery and can cause hypokalemia and sodium and water retention. Misidentification by similar appearance or confusion of nomenclature causes poisonings by mistake. Adulteration (with cheaper, more toxic substances); inclusion in proprietary medicines of western drugs without warnings of possible side-effects; and, the fact that some contain toxic heavy metals (cadmium, lead, arsenic, mercury). 52 The lack of legal control over herbal practice in Hong Kong dates back to the Nanking Treaty of 1842, in which Chinese medicine was . -'protected from control as part of \"Chinese customs and usages.\" This is under review by a government appointed working _ party. Following a report of a mini-epidemic of life-threatening aconite poisoning, initiatives were undertaken to improve the situation. 53 Biologist/botanist Bill Burley of Seattle warns that Chinese \"herbs\" are not only plants. Some are derived from animal sources (eg, antlers, donkey skin gelatin, earthworms, human placenta, bat feces, insects, bear gallbladder, charred human hair, toad skin secretion, seal penis, oyster shell, fossil mammal bone [called \"dragon bone\"] or mineral sources (eg, talc, borax, magnetite). Problems caused by TCM herbalist practices include that: (1) One name may apply to several substances. Herb names are derived from Chinese characters and these often refer to more than one species or substance. (2) Substituting another herb presumed to have the same or similar physiological effect is common, standard practice in TCM herbalism. [Editor's note. The effects sought are often based upon alleged \"correspondences\" associated with the dubious diagnostic techniques described earlier in this review.] (3) Frequently in TCM several herbs are combined. TCM practitioners claim to customize herbal prescriptions for individual patients. Usually one herb will be considered \"primary,\" another \"secondary,\" and others added for interactive effects. Scientifically, this complicates efforts to evaluate remedies (ie, assigning credit or blame for clinical outcomes). ( 4) There is little, if any, effort to standardize the chemical components of TCM herbal remedies. The wide variations among herbal substances makes evaluations extremely difficult. Because of all these factors, it is very difficult to know what drugs are ip.volved in TCM. Further, these problems are not limited to TCM, but apply to all types of traditional herbal medicines:'4 TCM Herbal Disaster. The unscientific nature of TCM herbalism can lead to serious problems. For instance, in Brussels, Belgium, a court trial began in June, 1998, against doctors, pharmacists, and importers of Chinese herbs. In 1990-91, some 100 women were diagnosed with total destruction of their kidneys through interstitial fibrosis. Their medical conditions were all traced to a group of \"alternative\" doctors who prescribed cocktails contain Chinese herbs Stephania tetranda, Magnolia officinalis, and possibly phen-fen. S. tetranda is called Fan Ji in Chinese. In some batches Fan Ji was had been replaced with Fangchi, aka Aristolochia, which contains aristolochic acid which is nephrotoxic and carcinogenic. Some 2,000 Belgian people got prescriptions; 5% of them developed destroyed kidneys.55 Chinese Patent Medicines. The California Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch, initiated a study to screen imported Asian patent medicines for undeclared pharmaceuticals and heavy metal contamination using. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and atomic absorption methods. Seventeen (7%) of 243 pro~ucts analyzed c~nta1?ed undeclared pharmaceuticals. The most common undeclared in?redients were ephed~me, chlorphemramme, methyltestosterone, and phenacetin._ Out of 251 analyzed for lead, arsemc and mercury, 24 con tamed at least 10 ppm lead wFor more information see Whang J. \"Chinese traditional food therapy,\" J Am Diet Assoc, 1981;78:55-7. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 55 (range 10 to 319 ppm;_ median, 29.8; mean, 54.9); 36 contained arsenic (range 329, mean 1046). The U.S. Pharmacopoeia limits ?eavy. metals m most pharmaceuticals_ to 30 ppm with lower limits for lead, arsenic, and mercury. Of 260 products mvesugated, at least 83 (32%) contamed undeclared pharmaceuticals or heavy metals, and 23 had more than one adulterant.56 Nearly one-fourth (23.7%) of 2,609 samples of traditional Chinese medicines were found to be adulterated with synthetic therapeutic substances in Taiwan. More than half of the adulterated products contained two or more adulterants. Four samples with either a rheumatoid or anti-inflammatory indication contained six different kinds of adulterants. Labeling regulation is needed. 57 NEO-AND PSEUDO-TCM Methods are promoted which claim Jo be based upon TCM. These may be categorized as Neo-TCM (fully-rooted in traditional Chinese cosmology), and pseudo-TCM (those which utilize only a fraction of traditional Chinese cosmology, and which may be exploiting the TCM concept for marketing purposes). Diagnostic Methods Bi-Digital 0-Ring Test. Developed by Yoshiaki Omura, MD, DSc, the test alleges to be an improvement upon tongue diagnosis. The subject holds in one hand: (1) a slide with a specimen of an internal organ or tumor, and (2) a rod (possibly bamboo). Supposedly, when the subject places the tip of the rod on the skin above \"identical\" tissue, or on an area of the tongue alleged to correspond with the tissue or organ, the muscle tone of the forefinger and thumb, which are touching to form the \"O-Ring,\" will reveal if there is a \"match.\" Ir.is Diagnosis. Another form of diagnosis postulates that every body organ corresponds to a location on the iris, the colored . -'portion of the eye surrounding the pupil. Electroacupuncture According to Voll (EA.VJ. EAV uses a galvanic skin response (GSR) device such as the Dermatron, but there are others (eg, Acuscope, Interro, VEGA). Such devices are not approved for diagnostic or treatment purposes. If sold for medical use, they would be declared \"misbranded\" under the 1976 Medical Device Act. However, Federal law only prohibits the interstate distribution of unapproved devices; health care delivery is regulated by the states. Thus, the FDA does not have authority to prosecute anyone who employs a misbranded device in his or her practice. That is up to state licensing boards. It should be added that having used an unapproved medical device could have a negative impact in a malpractice lawsuit. The Dermatron is used to assess the \"electrical activity\" at alleged acupuncture points on the skin. In use, the operator probes the alleged acupuncture points on the patient's hand. The gauge has a finite range of zero to one hundred. A reading of 50 supposedly represents normal. High readings are theorized to indicate \"irritations\" and eventually \"inflammation.\" Low readings are theorized to indicate \"degeneration\" worsening by degree. There are other features such as sudden drops in readings that are alleged to be significant to practitioners. Proponents claim to be able to both diagnose and prescribe utilizing the Dermatron. Various dubious preparations are prescribed on the basis of the readings. Despite anecdotal reports and theoretical papers which have been published by proponents, EA V remains unproven and of doubtful validity. Critics of the Dermatron note that variations in pressure applied to the points can greatly affect readings. Skin moisture is also known to greatly affect galvanic readings. Galvanic devices also are capable of creating their own readings. Nansel and Jansen report that a GSR unit was \"able within about 5 seconds to decrease the resistance of any particular point not already in its lowest state of resistance to a level sufficient to generate a positive and resistant GSR reading where none had been detected previously.\" 58 The prescription of dubious homeopathic remedies by practitioners further undermines EA V's credibility. Pendulum Divination. Pendulums and dowsing rods are alleged to be sensitive to Chi. A practitioner may use a pendulum or dowsing device in many creative ways, however, the ultimate effect is a pretense that the actions of the device is an indicator of a disturbance in energy flow. Treatment Methods Acupoint/Meridian-Centered Methods. More than 50 neo and pseudo-TCM treatment methods are employed by \"alternative\" practitioners. Most claim to be based upon the theoretical points or meridians. A partial list appears below: Acupowder Treatment involves application of an herbal powder to acupoints. Acupuncture Energetics is the practice of acupuncture with the intention of treating acupoints so that they \"resonate\" with \"archaic pathways\" of the \"bodymind.\" Auricular Magnet Therapy invol\"'.es taping magnetic balls or pellets to acupoints on the outer portion of the ear. Burnt Match Moxibustion involves rapidly tapping one or more acupoints with the head of a burnt match. Direct Moxabustion (aka, Festering Moxibustion, Scamng Moxibustion) involves placing small cones of moxa on specific acupoints and burning them almost to the skin. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Criticol Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. Endo-Nasal Therapy involves the stimulation of acupoints inside the nose. Homeoacupuncture is the injection of homeopathic solutions into acupoints. Homuncular Acupuncture involves forms of acupuncture that employs a map made of a miniature human being (homunculus) superimposed upon the ear (auricle), face, hands, or feet. Laser Acupuncture applies laser beams to acupoints. Pointing Therapy involves manually poking, pressing, pinching, patting, knocking, or pounding acupoints. Sonoacupuncture involves applying ultrasound to acupoints. . Zhenjiu is a combination of acupuncture and moxibustion. 59 Qigong \"Masters 56 In 1979 China started a mass exercise program. A Shanghai physician announced that he had invented an instrument that discovered special emanations of electricity, heat, and magnetism coming from the palms of Qigong practitioner's hands. Many people soon claimed to have the ability to emit these forces. Some claimed that they could kill bacteria, change the molecular structure of substances, probe the human body like an x-ray machine, cure disease by remote control, and change the world climate. Many scholars, including some famous scientists, believed them. Despite the lack of evidence, the mass media spread stories about this around the world. This harms scientific applications of Qigong exercises. 60 Bill Moyers' public television series Healing and the Mind featured Qigong masters allegedly transmitting mysterious forces to patients who responded to the waves of their hands as if connected by a force. T~ts of Qigong. Alcock, et al devised a test of a Qigong master (Dr. Lu) at the Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine. When the patient could see the Qigong master she reacted as if connected, but when screened from view the subject writhed independent of what the Qigong master did. It was clear that both knew what was expected of them and acted accordingly. 61 Honglin Zhang, head of the Department of Qigong Research, Institute of Acupuncture and ~oxibustion, China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, in Beijing refers to qigong masters as \"pseudo-qigong.\" 62 Mr. Yang Guisheng has practiced as a qigong master since 1981 in the Shandong Province, China. During this period, Mr. Yang reportedly had treated more than 300 patients with cerebral paralysis claiming to have 80% full or significant improvement. It was on this basis that Mr. Yang was invited to the USA to conduct a limited demonstration of his technique on individuals with chronic hemiplegia due to ischemic stroke. Six subjects participated in the demonstration. All treatments took place in a 400 sq.ft. room where the practitioner had ample space to maneuver himself and the patient. Four of the 6 subjects underwent seven 30 minute sessions. One was treated only once, and another twice, because the practitioner felt that his treatment would not be effective on them. Although the practitioner appeared to have a motivating effect on the subjects, no new voluntary movements were acquired by any subject. 63 Death Attributed to Qigong Master. John Heninger, 69, wealthy founder of Heninger Toyota in ca1gary, Alberta, canada, suffered from a degenerative muscle disease. Desperate for help he turned to a self-proclaimed \"Qi Gong Master\" for healing. The \"healer\" was Hou Shu Ying, a Chinese immigrant who is a resident of Toronto, Ontario. The \"medicine\" prepared and used by Ying was a mixture of burned rice, water, sugar, and an unmeasured dose of strychnine. Ying claimed that the concoction would \"build and regenerate muscle.\" The tragic result of Yt}'s treatment was that Heninger died of respiratory paralysis shortly after ingesting the concoction on October 4, 1988. Pro-Science Developments in China Wu Xianghong, a doctoral candidate in philosophy and science at Renmin University of China, Beijing, wrote about the popularity of paranormal beliefs in China. Unsophisticated scams of a simplemindedness not seen in the USA since the 1920s, such as claiming to turn water into gasoline and electronic \"growth pads\" in shoes to help short men grow taller, are rampant there. It wasn't until November, 1994, that China had a truth in advertising law. Since then fraudulent ads have diminished, but Wu says that \"pseudoscientific businesses, especially in the field of medicine, haven't been contained.\" He says that although new medicines are required to pass a clinical test \"the necessary control group is usually neglected, or it is not under rigorous control.\" He adds that the effectiveness of Chinese medicine cannot be tested by scientific standards because the theory behind them is not empirical. Several examples of current flim flam practices are detailed. Among them is the \"China Soft Shell Turtle Extract\" alleged to be the \"secret formula\" used by China's winning team of long distance woman runners. Their coach, Ma Junren, sold the formula to a financial group in Chang Zhou. A inspection of the production line failed to find any trace of turtles. Ma is also connected to another company that sells a product called Life Atomic Energy. Wu says that China is so concerned that widespread ignorance and superstition are holding back progress that in December, 1994, a proclamation was issued which stated: Public education in science has been withering in recent years, at the same time activities of superstition and ignorance have been growing ancl antiscience and pseudoscience cases have frequently been happening. Therefore, effective measures must be applied as soon as possible to strengthen public education ~n science. The level of ALTERNATWE MEDICINE; A Crirical Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. public education i~ science and te~hnology is an important sign of national scientific accomplishment, and is a matter of overall importance relatmg to the promotion of the economy, the advancement of science, and the development of the society. We must pay attention and carry out the public education with consideration of a strategy to modernize our socialist country and to make our nation powerful and prosperous. Ignorance is never socialist nor is poverty. 65 57 Wu says that it is planned to advocate education with the three aspects of science: scientific knowledge, scientific method and scientific ideas. He states that the fear that the government will suppress the paranormal by political power instead of persuasion. He believes that such an approach is likely to result in more cases of paranormal claims. atations. 1.

Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 59 DECEPTION Deception Seen in Nature. Natural deception can be seen in the camouflage of animals that allow them to blend in with their surroundings. Some species of animal behave in deceptive ways. Several species of birds pretend to be wounded in order to lure predators away from their nests. There also is the trick used by pack dogs to lead prey into ambush. Lying by small children is believed to be part of their normal development as they learn to take control of their own lives (discussion of this is beyond the scope of this publication). Deception in Military Situations, Sports, and Entertainment The diversionary tactic is a standard military maneuver. The use of illusion in war includes camouflage and other creative ways of fooling the enemy regarding the size, strength and nature of one's own forces.x In sports, football quarterbacks regularly attempt to deceive the defense by deft movements and ball handling; basketball and football players \"deke\" (from decoy) their opponents as they fake a movement in one direction and go another. Tennis players \"look\" their opponents away from where they eventually hit the ball. Stage magicians engage in \"conjuring,\" which literally means \"to perform feats of sleight of hand and illusion\" 1 for entertainment. The audience knows that what is being done involves trickery, and part of the fun is trying to figure out how the tricks are accomplished. Magicians have a code of ethics which asks that they not reveal their methods. The reason is that knowing destroys the illusion taking away the entertainment value and ultimately the magician's ability to earn money by performing. The Physiology of Deception. Deceivers take advantage of the foibles of perception. On the reflexive level shared by humans and animals, deception involves taking advantage of the ordinary. An animal approaches what appears to be an opportunity . :for a meal and ends up in a trap. Likewise, a human being can approach a situation that looks ordinary and end up the victim of a thief or murderer. On a higher level of perception, the human imagination becomes the mechanism of deception. As Professor Ray Hyman has put it: Can I speak to the dead? I don't think I can, but I can imagine speaking to the dead. It is the ability to imagine something that makes it seem feasible. If it is feasible, it seems possible. If it is possible, it may be probable. Probability can be expressed in terms of chance such as one in a million, or billion. This process allows an idea to evolve to the point that it sounds very much like a scientific proposition. This same process can be used to imagine UFOs, the Loch Ness monster, flying like Superman. I remember a sad, tragic story of a family who took their IO-year-old diabetic son to a faith healer. The faith healer pronounced the boy miraculously cured. Because they could imagine him to be a healthy boy, the parents discontinued his insulin shots. When his health failed, they could imagine him recovering, so they persisted in their faith. When the boy died from lack of insulin, they refused to turn him over to the morticians. Instead of a funeral, they held a resurrection service because they could imagine him rising from the casket. They could imagine themselves going about proclaiming the miracle and turning many hearts to God. After they came to their senses, they wrote a booW about their experience. To their credit, they did not engage in self-justification, but admitted their folly and advised others to be careful about pushing their faith too far. The eyes, ears, nose, skin, and muscles transmit neurological signals, but it is the brain that sees, hears, smells, and feels touch, temperature, orientation and so forth. The brain does its work by using both immediate input and input from previous experience. The latter process is called filling-in. An outstanding example of the filling-in process involves alleged \"close-encounters\" with aliens. People who claim to have seen space aliens most often describe them in ways very similar to the images created by the media. Media illustrations form the basis of mental images that can be replayed in the brain as expectation when emotions are aroused and judgment is clouded. Ah, but, critics may say, the media images are constructed from reports by those who claim to have been abducted, thus, the similarity of their appearances is proof that space aliens exist. Such an argument seems plausible until it is cast in the perspective of history. In years past, people reported seeing such paranormal creatures as mermaids,2 sea serpents,3.4. 5 and fairies in the waters6 and woodlands (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the unflappable detective Sherlock Holmes, was so convinced that fairies existed in the woodlands and became the dupe of a trick photography hoax). The proof that the filling-in process is at work in fanciful paranormal sightings lies in the fact that today's sighting match today's mythology, and yesteryear's sighting matched yesteryear's mythology. x For a fascinating account of how the skills of a stage magician were utilized in military deception during World War II, see Fisher D. The War Magician. New York: Berkeley Books, 1983. YParker L. We Let Our So11 Die. Haivest House, 1980. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. JaIVis, PhD, All Rights ReseIVed, March, 2000. 60 Magi~ians take. advantage of .the filling-in process when they perform illusions. By taking advantage of our previous expenences wh~c~ have est?bhshed what we consider to be normal or natural, the magician surprises us with something unexpected. This 1s entertamment. However, when a con artist uses our imaginations to make us believe we are going to make some .easy. money, the failure to deliv~r on ou~ expectations disappoints and outrages us. Worse yet, when a quack creates the 1llus10n of a cancer cure, and falls to dehver on our expectations, the results are a tragic. The most effective quacks have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to maintain the deception even in the face of failure. Sometimes the decedent's surviving loved ones have been set up for a similar fate should cancer strike them. Illusion and Allusion. 1\\vo basic types of deception are illusion and allusion. Illusion refers to staging an event in which something is made to appear different than it actually is. Stage magicians (conjurers) create the illusion of sawing a person in half, making a person float in the air, and so forth. Allusion involves lying, ie, alluding to something that the mark (the one being deceived) must accept on faith. Illusion takes advantage of what Hyman calls \"the power of the situation\" (ie, the \"you shoulda been there,\" and \"see~ng is believing\"). Relatively minor illusions can be used to advance major allusions. For example: a conjurer may make a dove disappear into thin air (an illusion), and then tell their audience about the time they made an elephant disappear (allusion). Having witnessed the disappearance of a dove made the audience willing to believe that the magician actually made an ~lephant disappear. Another way of differentiating these two basic types of deception is refer to them as sleight-of-hand (illusion) and sleight-of-mind (allusion). Con artists of all types use illusion and allusion in their scams. Several have written books on these methods. Many of these books have been depicted in popular motion pictures, with The Sting being the most elegant. In real life, however, con artists are not the lovable rogues portrayed by Hollywood. They are social predators who steal money and the personal dignity of their victims. When they invade the world of health care, they may also steal a person's chances to heal. Gf><ll of the Deceiver: Take Control of the Situation. The conjurer uses illusions to take control of the situation. He .. tJemonstrates the technique and interprets what is happening. The event happens too fast for careful analysis, so observers _normally accept what the trickster tells them they are seeing at face value. For example, a black box medical device can effectively employed to take control of the situation and create the illusion that something is happening. The patient knows no more about how the device is supposed to work than what they are told by the practitioner. Knowing about the basics of deception can help make people more alert and analytical when they encounter deceivers. The machine may buzz and snap, gauges change their readings, and so forth, but none of this has any meaning until the operator interprets it. It is no different than what happens when a legitimate doctor reads and x-ray or a blood test. Unless the patient is an expert also, he or she is totally reliant upon the veracity of the practitioner. Likewise, in chiropractic, joints may pop and crackle, but this has no real meaning--only the meaning that the chiropractor assigns to it, ie, \"the bone is back in place.\" This is no different psychologically from the explanations that a honest physician gives his/her patient about their prognosis--the difference lies in the validity of the explanation because it is founded upon sound evidence. Another important difference is that legitimate practitioners are not using the explanation as a means of mind control by which they will convert the patient to an off-beat healthcare system. Mind-control is the vehicle for the exploitation that is the ultimate goal of the deceiver. The important message of learning about the psychology of the clinical gimmicks is the fact that the patients have no information on the nature of his disease and must rely entirely upon the practitioner to provide such information. The requirement of trust on the part of the patient and trustworthiness on the part of the practitioner is foundation of responsible health care. Different Kinds of Quacks. Most quacks can be put in one of three broad categories, charlatans, hucksters, and cranks. Charlatans are deliberate fakers. Insight into the psychodynamics of quackery is seen in studies of the psychopathic personality disorder. Reid, et al 7 present a series of research papers that included enlightening work by Dr. Robert Hare who has done work on psychopaths for more than twenty years. Hare states, \"You find psychopaths in all professions. He's the shyster lawyer, the p~sician always on the verge of losing his license, the businessman with a string of deals where his partners always lose out. Psychopaths are \"social predators who charm, manipulate, and ruthlessly plow their way through life, leaving a broad trail of broken hearts, shattered expectations, and empty wallets. Completely lacking in conscience and in feelings for others, they selfishly take what they want and do what they please, violating social norms and expectations without the slightest sense of guilt or regret.\" 9 Hare describes characteristics of the psychopathic personality as lacking a capacity to feel compassion or pangs of conscience. Psychopaths exhibit glibness and superficial charm, grandiose sense of self-worth, pathological lying, conning/manipulative behavior, lack of guilt, proneness to boredom, lack of empathy and others often seen in quacks. Hare says that such people suffer from a cognitive brain defect that prevents them from experiencing sympathy or remorse. Health hucksters are business people \u00b7who idealize entrepreneurialism and free enterprise. When they engage in quackery, ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 61 the~ are merely exploiting _opportunities offer~d by the public's interest in health'. To them the marketplace is the best ~esung ground for ideas. If 1t sells, they reason, ~t-must be good. Hucksters work at the psychology of selling. Showmanship 1s a hallmark of the health huckster, and celebnues are often used as accomplices. Some of Hollywood's leading stars have allowed themselves to be used to promote quackery's agenda. Health hucksters are unconcerned about the scientific validity of their wares. Customer \"satisfaction,\" \"closing the sale,\" and \"the bottom line\" are their primary concerns. Only 1-in-10 (10%) persons who has used a questionable product reports that the product was not effective at all; 32% of questionable product users believes the treatment effective\", another 33% \"somewhat effective,\" and 14% \"slightly effective. 10 Cranks are delusional people who sincerely believe in themselves and their nostrums. They likely to be as honest as anyone, and often exhibit selflessness and generosity. Science historian George Sarton had cranks in mind when he observed that ~t is not true that_ all quac_ks are cr~oks, _e:'}'ert f hysicia~s are as greed~ as quac~; the difference between them hes not so much m greedmess as m a lack of cnt1c1sm. \"1 Crankism may someumes be difficult to recognize because it involves new ideas. However, anyone advocating a health-related idea who seeks scientific acceptance must expect to undergo a great deal of scrutiny, critfcism, and testing before it can be accepted. The persistence a pioneering scientist needs to continuing pursuing a good idea requires a level of self-confidence and drive that may be indistinguishable from crankism. True scientists differ from cranks in that they are more committed to the justice of their methods than any result they may obtain. True scientists are willing to admit that an idea may be wrong; and, that even if correct, has reasonable limitations. Cranks are willing to accept any support for their results, no matter how faulty, persist in the face of reasonable controverting evidence, and are often more grandiose in their expectations about the value of their theories. Medical scientists focus upon clinical evidence of safety and effectiveness with less attention to the mechanisms of action until something has proved worthwhile. Cranks often focus upon elaborations about theorized mechanisms of action rather than demonstrating that their methods significantly alter the natural variations that can be expected in the course of a disease, are better than a placebo, or improve upon the standard methods currently in use. Cranks are apt to be paranoid, i~terpreting normal scientific criticism as \"opposition\" or even \"persecution.\" Cranks may be more dangerous than . :charlatans because while the latter may limit their claims in order to avoid bringing the law down upon themselves. Characteristic Thinking Patterns of Nonscientific Healthcare Providers (NSPs). Consumer health education specialists William Jarvis, PhD, and William London, EdD listed common characteristic thinking patterns they have seen in their combined fifty years of reading the literature and observing behavior. 1. Antiscience Bias. A NSPs are hypercritical of standard care, but overlook the shortcomings of \"alternative\" health care. B. NSPs complain that negative reports about their favored healing system or methods are due to bias, yet see no bias in those who provide positive reports despite the fact that very often positive reports are from sources with a direct financial interest in alternative medicine, dietary supplements, \"organically grown\" foods, \"health foods,\" and the like; or, an ideological interest in hygienic religions such as vitalism, transcendental meditation, vegetarianism, or some ancient cultural worldview (eg, Taoism, ayurveda). C. NSPs demand near-absolute proof of the value of procedures outside of their system, but are willing to accept low quality evidence to support their methods. (1) Willing to accept personal subjective experience (testimonials) as proof of the value of a procedure or system. They seem to understand the clinical mirages of placebo response, suggestion, coincidental recovery, etc, on an intellectual level, but don't think they can be fooled by such illusions. (2) Willing to assume that a practice has validity merely because it has survived for a long period of time (eg, several thousand years for acupuncture, 100 years for chiropractic) (3) Cast the burden of proof for their theories to their opponents rather than accepting such responsibility themselves in accordance with the rules of science. (4) Speculate on theoretical mechanisms of action rather than employing properly designed, controlled clinical trials. D. NSPs do not acknowledge the limitations of their favored methods or healing system. E. Because they already know in their hearts that \"it works,\" NSPs argue that the use of a \"no-treatment\" or \"placebo\" control group is unethical because it denies the control group the benefits of their favored remedy. F. NSPs extol science when it agrees with their views, but condemn science when it does not. 2. Distort Basic Concepts (history, language, learning processes, physics, physiology). A NSPs distort the history and meaning of the term allopathy, and claim it is an accurate reflection of modern scientific medicine. B. NSPs confuse open-mindedness with empty-mindedness. Open-mindedness is a willingness to examine new and un~s.ual ideas. Empty-mindedness is a failure to study or apply the lessons of the past that taught how uncontrolled chmcal experiences can deceive competent, honest, well-intended practitioners. Empty minds like wastebaskets are unguarded receptacles for trash. \u00b7 ALTERNATWE MEDICINE; A Oilkal Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 62 C. NSPs accept the common intellectual fallacies that: (1) anything is possible; and, (2) nothing is known for certain (ie, cultural relativism: all knowledge exists within a particular cultural context only. There are no absolute truths. Science is a product of Western thought. D. NSPs dichotomize science as \"Western\" vs \"Eastern,\" and use this dichotomy to justify the lack of evidence for claims. E. NSPs distort prevailing scientific theories ( eg, quantum mechanics, relativity) to justify \"vitalism.\" F. \"innovative,\" or \"leading edge\" practitioners. G. NSPs overemphasize or exaggerate the power of the mind to control biological processes. H. NSPs assert that the failure to have scientifically proved the value of their favored procedures is due to the inadequacies of science. They claim that scientific methods are inadequate due to the \"reductionism\" of science, and its requirement that outcomes be quantitatively measured. I. NSPs advance pseudophysiological concepts, such as: (1) Cleansing, detoxification, or purification of the body via the bowels, sweating, emetics, fasting, etc. (2) The \"healing crisis\" in which adverse reactions that would concern standard providers are interpreted as \"poisons\" being expelled froin the body; thus, bad reactions are seen as good. Of course, good reactions are also seen as good, therefore, the \"heads I win, tails you lose\" psychology of quackery is employed. (3) Body Wisdom. Akin to the \"healing crisis\" is the notion is that the body inherently \"knows\" what is good for it. Symptoms are seen as body wisdom at work which should not be \"suppressed.\" 3. Exlu'bit Paranoia and Grand Delusion. A NSPs view criticism of their activities as \"opposition,\" and regulatory or disciplinary actions as \"persecution.\" B; NSPs claim to be innovators, ie, modern-day Galileos (aka, Columbus, Semmelweis) whose theories will eventually be confirmed by science. C. NSPs often discourage patients from obtaining second opinions from other practitioners. They demand absolute loyalty and compliance or else they will not render care. 4. Oppose the Principles of Consumer Protection Law, the Regulatory Process, and Principles of Fair Competition. A NSPs oppose Food & Drug regulatory requirements: (1) Fail to fully disclose the nature of products or procedures used (ie, claim to have secret remedies, mysterious devices, or miraculous methods). (2) Fail to demonstrate the safety of procedures prior to general use or marketing. (3) Fail to demonstrate the effectiveness of procedures prior to general use or marketing. (4) Fail to conduct post-marketing surveillance to discover unanticipated reactions. B. NSPs disdain principles of fair competition. (1) Engage in self-promotion claiming superiority to other providers. (2) Use false or misleading advertising. (3) Fail to warn of potential adverse effects of their methods. (4) Fail to fully inform patients of the limitations of their methods. . C. NSPs often oppose the concept that practicing health care is a privilege not a right, and that such a privilege is granted only to competent and trustworthy individuals. (1) Incompetence. a) Unwillingness to submit to tests of competence, inspection, and oversight. b) Questionable use of standard methods (eg, inappropriate off-label use of approved procedures).\u00b7 c) Use of disproved and unproved methods without proper research protocols. (2) Untrustworthiness. a) Unwillingness to accept accountability for misconduct. b) Ignore conflicts of interest (eg, sell prescribed items directly to patients, or accept kickbacks). D. NSPs reject the caveat vendor (seller beware) principle of consumer protection law that requires that providers be accountable; argue for caveat emptor (buyer beware) in which the patient bears all loses without hope of redress (aka, \"health freedom,\" \"medical freedom,\" in Congress: Access to Medical Treatment Act.\") 5. Political Aggressiveness. A NSPs form societies characterized by mutual tolerance toward each other's questionable practices (in contrast with the critical analytical debate and peer review of scientific groups). . B. NSPs organize lay people (clients, customers, patients) into political pressure groups that will lobby to enable the continued availability of questionable practices. C. NSPs lobby for third-party reinrbursement on the basis of market demand rather than proven value. The characteristic thinking patterns of NSPs can impair clinical judgment at times when good thinking is essential. ALTERNAT/JIE MEDICINE; A Crili&aJ &view, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 63 Different Kinds of UseIS Self-care may involve the use of folk medicine, home remedies, over-the-counter products, etcetera. \"Extended self-care\" includes the use of nonmedical healthcare practitioners. Quackery from the consumer's perspective involves people engaging in questionable health behavior, use of treatments of unproved safety and/or efficacy for the purpose to which they are applied. People who are attracted to questionable alternative / complementary health care products and services may be placed into one of two major categories: ideologists or pragmatists. Pragmatists are those who are willing to try almost anything to resolve their health problems. Such people have no strong philosophical commitment to their health practices. Ideologists are people with deeply-held, questionable belief systems. These may be thought of as \"hygienic religions.\" The term \"religion\" is used in a generic sense (ie, does not necessarily include a belief in God), rather to reflect that ideologists are \"bound together by their beliefs\" (Latin re-and ligare \"to bind together\" 12). Further, like believers, ideologists base \"life and death\" decisions on faitfl, work at converting others to their beliefs, are willing to be martyrs, and contribute substantial sums of money to advance their causes. Most people are pragmatic on health & nutrition matters, but a persistent, highly motivated minority are ideolog~c and sustain the alternative medicine movement over time. A cultural beliefs survey of 1,036 Americans funded by the Fetzer Institute and the Institute for Noetic Sciences divided people into 3 groups: 47% modernists 29% heart/anders (trans-modernists). Of the latter, 13% were labeled \"greens,\" and 11 % as \"New Agers deeply committed to the inner life.\" New Agers and greens are more ideolo~ical in their world views. Fifty-two percent of cultural creatives reported using alternative health care in the past year. 1 This is far higher than has been reported for any other group. 9ther studies have reported behavior fitting the pragmatic vs ideologic dichotomy. A major American homeopathic journal . : acknowledged that although there has been a lot of favorable publicity about homeopathy, and sales of homeopathic . medicines to consumers who use these without much knowledge of homeopathy \"are way up,\" sales to physicians and consumers using the more traditional homeopathic medicines \"are flat.\" 14 The two categories, (ie, consumers \"without much knowledge of homeopathy,\" and \"traditional users\") cited by the homeopathic report is worthy of note; they seem to be very much like the ideologists and pragmatists identified by National Analysts. The 1996 survey of herbal supplement users found also divided consumers into two similar categories, \"first time tryers\" and \"more traditional users.\" Most of the growth in use was coming from \"first time tryers\" who, compared to traditional users, were: (a) more likely to have purchased supplements in a supermarket or drug store, vs a health food store; (b) more likely to be light users of herbal supplements, and less likely to also be taking vitamins (overall, 64% of herbal supplement users also take vitamins, 36% do not); (c) less knowledgeable about the herbs they used; (d) were more concerned about the safety and efficacy of the supplements they were trying. A marketing analyst stated that herbal marketers \"were not off to a good start with consumers.\" The high cost of herbal supplements is discouraging to consumers, and less knowledgeable and skeptical new users can easily be disappointed if near-term results do not live up to expectations and claims. The analyst emphasized the need for \"education\" by herbal marketers. 15 In public health terms of \"susceptibility,\" there is a significant degree of susceptibility to quackery among the general public because: (1) they practice rampant empiricism;z (2) have unrealistic expectations of nutrition and the power of the mind to affect physical health. Increased risk was found among people in search of superhealth. These were found to be more likely to hold fallacious beliefs. Key among these were unrealistic expectations about nutrition as a likely route to superhealth. High risk people were identified as \"committed health food users,\" and \"those who use chiropractors for virtually every medical condition. High risk people also exhibit negative attitudes toward standard medicine and consumer protection agencies. High-risk people sustain quackery within society. atations 1.

Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 65 HOW QUACKS SUCCEED ~a~y who have_ studied !he psy~holo~ used by quacks have marveled at their ability to deceive and manipulate their vicums. One wnter says There 1s no mmd more sensitive to the needs or fancies of society than that of the truly gifted con man.\"1 A cancer researcher who has carefully analyzed cancer quackery believed that legitimate doctors could benefit from studying quacks' style: . It seems clear that the medical community must acquire the skills of the medical quack and combine these skill with his professional capabilities of effective diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. 2 Quacks often have the same psychological make-ups as their victims. Both are prone to wishful thinking, ideology, miracle-seeking, straw-grasping, and self-delusion. To some degree, we all share one great vulnerability: In the face of the Great Leveller, Death, we are all children listening fearfully for the footsteps of Doom relieved only by the whisperings of hope; the quack is the peddlar of hope. 3 There are four main categories of human desire with perpetual appeal at which nostrums have always been aimed: (1) love potions; (2) fountains of youth; (3) cure-alls; (4) super performance (physical and/or mental). People want to believe that the quack's claims are true. The willingness to face hard realities takes more courage than some can muster. We must challenge people to have the courage to face and cope with reality. McKeown lists five important tasks of clinical medicine: (1) reassurance; (2) treatment of acute emergencies; (3) cure; (4) care; (5) comfort. 4 Of these, quacks may outperform regular physicians mainly on the first. They can also deliver good care and comfort. Why alternative practitioners succeed. Having tracked health fraud, misinformation and quackery as public health problems for more than 25 years leads the presenter to conclude that little has changed today besides an increased attention to nonstandard health practices within society, and a revision of the language that is being used in reference to them. The presenter believes that alt-med succeeds because providers: (1) use buzz-words that \"nontoxic,\" \"holistic,\" employ \"feel good\" methods (herbal uppers & downers, hands-on procedures such as massage and manipulation that increase suggestibility,5 and give patients \"pep-talks\"); (3) exploit the wishful thinking of patients (from superhealth to super cures); (4) exploit the symbolism of \"good\" vs \"bad\" foods, including the guilt induced by people's pursuit of pleasure; (5) have a \"never-say-die\" approach that strings patients along; (6) exude self-confidence ... The quack's quint~ntial quality of success. If there is one quality that helps quacks to succeed in the face of evidence, reason, convention and common sense it is because of the self-confidence they exude. The ability to instill confidence in their victims is a quality of \"con artists,\" but this term suggests deliberate deception. Remember that the delusional quack is sincere. Sincerity, commitment, self-confidence, and enthusiasm are difficult for victims to resist--especially when they are psychologically vulnerable. Legitimate health professionals must also be confident. Not to the point of quacks, but more so than our scientific conservatism usually dictates. Bertrand Russell once said, \"the trouble with the world was that the ignorant are too full of confidence and the knowledgeable too full of doubt.\" It is an observation worth remembering when confronting quackery. User's inability to discern benefits or harm. In 1972, the U.S. Department of Commerce published its study of \"the nature and prevalence of fallacious or questionable health beliefs and practices, and susceptibility to them\" among American adults. The study was funded by seven government agencies.00 The study had four phases: Phase I: A questionnaire was developed using interviews of 38 people suspected to have experienced quackery or expressed false 00National Institute of Mental Health, Food and Drug Administration, Administration on Aging, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Vocational Rehabilitation Administation, Agricultural Research Setvice (USDA), and Veterans Administration. ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A CriJicaJ Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 66 beliefs, and 250 randomly selected respondents. Phase II: Depth interviews with 37 identified as being susceptible to misinformation or having engaged in questionable practices. Previous research suggested that feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness might be involved in susceptibility to fallacious health practices; feelings of insecurity or mild paranoia, fatalistic beliefs, and optimism may make quick and easy solutions seem more attractive. Six traits were tested for: purposelessness & anomia, insecurity, pessimism, fatalistic thinking, belief in intervention by God. These were analyzed by a skilled psychologist at National Analysts. Phase III: A questionnaire of over 200 items was administered to 2839 adults in a national area probability sample during the summer of 1969. No one respondent was asked all of the questions. The researchers attest that the study can be assumed to be a valid representation of the U.S. population. Phase IV: Follow-up Depth Interviews were done with eight groups consisting of at least eight subjects per group, and nine individual Depth Interviews. This is probably the highest quality study ever conducted on questionable health behavior. Its findings continue to be useful and are the basis for a great deal of marketing in the health arena. Among the most practical findings were: \u00b7 1) Many people do not distinguish between a cure and symptomatic relief, and are not even aware that a distinction exists. Anything that makes them feel better is curing them. 2) Simple unaided recovery, when it happens to coincide with a trial period, will make many people believe they hit upon something that will help them. 3) The operation of the placebo effect is sufficient to prevent the trial and error process from eliminating ineffective treatments. If people think something might help them, many will actually feel relief, even with a sugar pill. Thus, trial of a health treatment selected randomly will produce a number of people attesting that it works. Citations 1. Holbrook S. The Golden Age of Quackery. Macmillan, 1959.

These are slick courses with manuals that teach systematic and deliberate deception. Included is self-deception of the DC as well as psychological manipulation of their patients. Personal self-deception begins with a deluded self-concept. To become, ACT AS IF! To become a millionaire, \"THINK, ACT AND FEEL LIKE A MILLIONAIRE!\" (emphasis theirs). \"Sleep in the biggest bed imaginable\"; \"Buy the biggest or best wash cloth, towel, soap, razor, tooth brush, and/or shaving lotion available.\"; \"Spread dollars worth of change in all the places you look daily ... put a $100 bill in your billfold ... Let this system remind you that everywhere you turn that you are becoming a millionaire. \"1 Clinical self-deception is expressed in 'the manual's statement, \"Seeing is not believing, believing is seeing!\" This refers to an important clinical pitfall that scientists attempt to avoid by using double-blind methods of observation. Observers do selectively observe by both \"seeing what they want to see,\" and \"seeing what they are looking for.\" Staging. The success school managers teach chiropractors to be actors: to look like real doctors, talk like real doctors, and employ the mannerisms of real doctors. Actors perform on stages, and the chiropractor's stages include: (1) the community (i.e, public relations image and marketing); (2) the waiting room; (3) the treatment area; and, (4) \"backstage,\" where the audience cannot see or hear. Tricks taught for community use include: Get brightly colored \"keep smiling\" cards printed with your name and address on the from and with a blank back. Write on the back: \"Mary, the doctor cured my headaches of 10 years--Joan.\" Leave these cards, with similar comments on them, all over town. You can take your business cards and write on the back of it: \"Bill, these are the people that got rid of my headaches. They are tops. The best. Call them, Charlie.\" These cards can be left just about anywhere. Your wife or receptionist may call the hardware store and say: \"I am trying to locate Dr. so-and\u00ad so. He is on a house call in your area of town and we need him very urgently at his office. He said that when he finished with the house call he was going to stop by your store and pick up something. They will usually page for the doctor.\" Circle your name and telephone number in the yellow pages of every phone book you come across. 2 Tips on staging the waiting room include the following: People don't like to go into an office that is empty. If you act busy, you will become busy. One method of giving an illusion of being busy is to have a friend call your office on cue. For example: The receptionist sees a patient entering your office. She dials your friend and says, \"one is coming,\" and hangs up. A few minutes later, the friend calls the office and the receptionist talks into the phone, following this script: \"Yes, Mrs. Jones, Dr. So-and-So has been very successful with headache cases. However, in your individual case, it will be necessary to arrange for a consultation. Your receptionist should write down the appointment in the appointment book with a different colored ink so that she will know that it is not an actual appointment. Patients do not like to glance at an appointment book and see it blank. Have a coat hanging on the rack in the reception room. When the patient is in the reception room, the doctor can open and close doors in the back of the office giving the impression of being busy.3 Staging the treatment area may include creating the illusion of being very scientific. One practice-builder suggested that a closet have a \"laboratory\" sign placed on the door. The chiropractor is advised to have the patient ushered in while he is in the closet. After a few moments the \"doctor\" is to walk out thumbing through some papers or x-ray films to create the illusion that he has been busy doing important lab work. Sociologists, one of whom trained and worked as a part-time assistant, analyzed chiropractic office techniques, described treatment room staging: the practitioner and his assistants constituted a performance team in that they cooperated in the staging of a behavioral routine which served to supply the patient with a specific and consistent set of definitions and expectations within the total configuration of the chiropractic setting. This cooperative teamwork was not immediately observable except in the most overt instances of normal role performance. In a dramaturgical sense, the practitioner could have been view as not only the lead actor but also the behind the scenes director. He was primarily responsible for the appearance of the setting and behavioral regulation of the actors within it. For example, the assistant, while in the waiting room, by design had had the opportunity to \"read\" the patient, and at that time made a tentative judgment of the patient's receptivity to chiropractic health care . .... the practitioner's \"reading\" of the patient's receptivity and willingness to empathize with_chiropractic philosophy, ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Critical Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. was essential to his procedure of typing\"b patients. 4 68 Backstage interaction takes place in a setting where persons can be off-guard with other actors and prepare for front performances. In describing his training as a chiropractic assistant: Part of my backstage training consisted of the appropriate use of \"stage talk.\" \"Don't come on too strong with words; you can scare people sometimes by talking over their heads; use words like 'honesty,' 'sincere,' 'love,' things like that. Leave the big stuff to me.\" The problem of presenting a consistent front to the audience was a major concern for the practitioner. Of special importance for was the manner in which assistants prepared the patient for his entry into the adjustment area, particularly, for the first time. He discussed and rehearsed with us the manner in which we should defer to his knowledge and experience ... 5 Purpose of Deception: Take Control of the Situation. It is not difficult for a health care provider to take control of the clinical situation. After all, the patient has sought him/her out for help, so they have an initial psychological advantage. As the practitioner takes a history, he/she gains insight into the persons psychological make-up. Their perceptions, past experiences, expectations, frustrations, and so forth. This sets the stage for employing principles of the cold reading. \"First request, then command,\" the manual advises. Take control of the situation. \"Dominate, but don't domineer,\" the manual states. Learn to control patients with a spirit of love. \"Lather Love Lavishly\" the manual repeats again and again. Some of the gimmicks taught are presented below . . : The Invented Disease. Taking a cue from the American Cancer Society's (ACS) seven danger signals of cancer, chiropractors often advertise \"danger signals indicating a need for chiropractic.\" Rather than scientifically established danger signals used by the ACS, those cited by chiropractors run from seven to sixteen and actually include more than forty different alleged signals many of which are ordinary symptoms such as fatigue, general body tension, a crick in the neck, or others that normal, healthy people experience from time to time. A devotee of a chiropractor, who's unique method was to inflated balloons he inserts into the noses of his patients on the notion these with have a effect on the bottom side of their brain cage, once exclaimed in her enthusiasm for him: \"why, he cured me of a disease I didn't even know I had!\" This trusting soul had very likely been the victim of the \"invented disease\" ploy. A chiropractic practice-building manual states: \"If the patient still doubts his need for treatment, say, many serious diseases (eg, heart disease, cancer, stroke, kidney disease) can be far advanced long before a patient feels any symptoms.\" This is true, but the reality is that chiropractors have nothing to offer in the prevention or treatment of any of these disorders. The \"Yet\" Disease. Many people go to chiropractors for bursitis, a condition for which manipulation--and most other therapies--are ineffective. Rather than telling the patient the truth, that only time will heal the condition, the chiropractor is advised to employ the clever \"yet\" disease ploy. Chiro to patient: \"Has the condition reached the other shoulder Patient: \"No, the other shoulder problems often spread,\" (untrue); \"we're going to do our best to keep it there in the one shoulder.\" After months of treatment, the condition is not better, but it never did reach the other shoulder, satisfying the patient that the treatments did some good. \"W7iat's better'!' The manual advises: \"Ask the patient, what's better? If the patient states that nothing is better, and restates his trouble, say: 'but the adjustment took so well yesterday some improvement should have been noticed, think hard now, isn't something better? ' If patient tells of conditions that are better, say, 'wonderful,\" great,\"good for you!'\" The \"what's better?\" ploy is enhanced by the addition of the power of suggestion. With each succeeding visit the chiro is advised to greet the patient with suggestive, encouraging remarks, such as: \"Your eyes are brighter\" \"You're getting a spring in your step\" \"I hope you're feeling as good as you look!\" . ,, \"Did you know that you will live longer and have fewer colds as a result of these adjustments? bbTypes of patients are: (1) the one-timer or one-shot patient; (2) the problem patient (troublemakers); (3) the regular patient (convens). ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A CriticlJl Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. 69 How to avoid blame. Among the most despicable ploys taught by the manual are those designed for patients who have \"become discouraged.\" Some of the tactics recommended were: A Emphatically declare that the spine (cause) is better. B. Remind him that\" ... at one time he did feel better (if he did) so your adjustments must be doing some good ... \" C. \"What would you do if you quit?\" Patients usually have no alternative treatment. D. Reaction: \"New life is going into the nerves supplying the affected organs which have been causing your suffering. Thus, this upsetting condition is actually a blessing in disguise.\" To outsiders, these deceptive tactics provide clear evidence that chiros are complete charlatans. But, ideologic sectarian practitioners with a quasi-religious devotion to their healing system work at converting their patients to their world-views. In the minds of \"true believing\" DCs; such are justified as necessary evils that will keep patients coming back for spinal adjustments based upon the chiropractor's ideological faith that popping the spine will enable the Innate Life Force to flow more freely thus enhancing the body's self-healing capabilities. One-Sided Coin Trick. Nonstandard practitioners generally employ a kind of \"heads I win, tails they lose\" psychology. When things go well they take the credit, but when things go badly they blame standard medicine. Patient Subversion is an especially serious matter when life-threatening diseases are involved. Cassileth found that 40% of cancer patient who started out by mixing nonstandard therapies and approved therapies eventually abandoned the latter. 6 Promoters of the Macrobiotic Diet, teaches patients that cancer tumors are nature's way of isolating toxins. They must be left in place as receptacles for toxins in the healing process.7 . _.Patient Subversion and RecruitmenL Sharing patients with alternativists exposes them to subversion and recruitment. Chiropractors, who fancy themselves to be pediatricians, instruct colleagues on how to lure patients from medical doctors to themselves: Ask the parent, \"Did your pediatrician check this on your child (ie, posture, palpation, EMG, etc)?\" Inevitably, the parent will say \"no,\" which does two things. One, it makes the parent realize that their pediatrician may have overlooked the cause of their child's health problem. T\\vo, it begins to shift the credibility and authority from the pediatrician to the chiropractor. 8 Converting patients to believing in the chiropractic paradigm of cause and effect in disease and treatment (ie, subluxations are the cause, a properly-aligned spine via chiropractic manipulation) was the key to success taught by BJ Palmer, the man who turned chiropractic into a successful business enterprise. Ex-Chiropractor Peter Modde noted that, \"BJ Palmer wrote 36 books, but in reality, he wrote one book over and over, 36 times. The message was always the same. Sell the patient on chiropractic. If they become discouraged, sell them again. If they begin to lose faith, sell them again. No matter what happens, keep selling them on chiropractic!\" Chiropractic supersalesman James Parker told how to convince patients that spinal misalignment and adjustment are the keys to health: \"Use the 'Why?' torture chamber,\" he says. Patients will soon run out of answers to their problems. When they do, substitute chiropractic answers.\" The art of inquiry places all questioning into based upon the understanding that the \"why?\" question is inexhaustible because any answer can be followed up with another \"why?\" question until the mechanics of cause and effect are exhausted and only philosophical and theological answers remain. Why? questions may be how? questions in disguise. \"Why did the airliner crash?\" really asks \"how did the airliner come to crash?\" How? questions deal with cause and effect. 9 Myths & Wisecracks Used to Sell Patients Alt-Comp Healthcare. Alternative practitioners are much better at dealing with standard medicine than vice versa. They can make patients believe that their lack of full acceptance by the scientific community is due to some failing of the latter, not because of shortcomings of their field of endeavor. Alternativists have been at war with standard medicine forever, and are much better at the fight than SM providers. Some of their stock weapons against medical science are as follows: Myth: Standard medicine is not proven either: \"only 10-20% of medical technologies in current use have been tested by clinical trials.\" Comment: The claim that \"only 10-20% of current medical technologies are proved by clinical trials\" was based upon an unfortunate statement by Kerr White while serving on a OTA project. White revealed that he may have inadvertently been its source: ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Crilical Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. Some 20 years ago, as a member of the original Health Advisory Panel to the US Congressional Office of Technology Assessment I ventured the 10-20% figure again and invited anyone to provide more timely data. No one could. The figure was immortalized in OT A circles and publications for almost a decade. In countless addresses and conferences I often challenged others to provide better evidence but none was forthcoming. So the northern industrial town \"armchair\" assessment persisted. 10 70 White said that he had based his 10-20% estimate on a 1963 paper11 that reported on a survey of the prescribing practices of 19 family doctors in a northern British town for two weeks (one in December 1960, and another in March 1961). The survey wasn't trying to evaluate the science of medical practice. Its purpose was to look toward controlling prescribing costs in terms of \"standard\" (ie, \"generic\") versus \"proprietary\" drugs. The \"intent\" of each prescription was analyzed according to how specific it was for the condition. These were divided into categories of \"standard\" or \"proprietary\" drugs. Intent was \"specific\" for the condition for which it was prescribed only about 10% of the time; \"probable\" 3.6%. From these data White estimated that 10-20% of the medicine practiced was evidence-based, and that the combined placebo and Hawthorne effects accounted for another 20-40%; and the rest (which he refers to as a \"mystery\") accounts for 40-70%. Little about the survey's setting was relevant to standard American medicine in 1978, much less today. The survey was done in England, which has no law comparable to the FDCA Time-wise, the 1963 survey report was coincidental with the 1962 Harris-Kefauver Amendment that for the first time mandated premarketing efficacy for medications. The OTA report's statement that \"only 10 to 20 percent of procedures currently used in medical practice have been shown to be efficacious by controlled trial\" created a myth that has been damaging to the image of standard medicine. Promoters of unproven \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" medicine have made great use of the statement to justify their practices. However, the intent of the OTA Report was not to advocate an open marketplace, or that there be less science in health care. Its purpose was to find ways for improving .. tlie process through which the safety and efficacy of health care technologies are established. David Eddy, MD, PhD, has also been quoted as stating that \"only about 15% of medical interventions are supported by solid scientific evidence.12 Correspondence with Dr. Eddy did not clarify how he arrived at his estimate.13 It may have been the mid-point of the \u00b7 OTA's 10-20 percent statement. Wisecrack: \"The mind is like a parachute .. .lt works best when opened.\" Comment: Scientists are open-minded, but not empty-minded. One who is empty-minded has failed to take into account, the many ways personal experience has fooled scientists in the past. Double-blind, controlled clinical trials evolved because of the many instances in which competent, honest, observers who were trying their best to be objective, were fooled by clinical illusions. Franklin Commission (1781) used the same method to test animal magnetism that was used by school girl to test Therapeutic Touch.1 4 Patients and practitioners attested to being able to sense feelings of discomfort or heat emanating from objects that had been \"magnetized.\" A 12-year-old boy who believed himself to be sensitive to magnetism was selected. His eyes were bandaged (blindfolded) and he was led successively to four trees that, unbeknown to him, had not been magnetised and made to embrace each for two minutes. He felt strong symptoms and reacted dramatically at each.15 Through this and other tests it became obvious to the Franklin Commission that the feelings sensed by believers was a product of their imaginations. Likewise, Emily Rosa, 11, tested the ability of over 20 Therapeutic Touch practitioners to sense the presence of her hand when unable to see whether or not it was present. Their inability to do so revealed that the practitioners were deceived by their own imaginations. In 1799 John Haygarth, MD, designed a controlled test in which he treated five patients suffering with rheumatic pain with wooden tractors disguised to resemble the metallic versions. Four of the five experienced relief with the fictitious tractors. One patient reported a warming sensation in his knee, an ability to walk much better, and pain relief lasting nine hours. Another patient reported tingling sensations lasting two hours when the wooden tractors were applied. The next day the same five were treated with metallic tractors with nearly identical results. As a result of this experiment, Haygarth stated: This method of discovering the truth, distinctly proves to what a surprising degree mere fancy deceives the patient himself; and if the experiment had been tried with Metallic Tractors only, they might, and most probably would have deceived even medical observers. 16 Roberts, et al. measured the deceptiveness of clinical illusions by reviewing medical and surgical treatments that were thought to be effective at the time they were reported in the literature, but which were later found to be ineffective in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. A random search and analysis settled upon glomectomy for treating asthma, levamisole for treating herpes simplex, photodynamic inactivation for treating herpes simplex, organic solvents for treating herpes simplex, and gastric freezing for treating duodenal ulcer. In all, 6,931 patients were involved. 40% were reported to have excellent outcomes, 30% good outcomes and 30% poor outcomes. It was concluded that nonspecific effects in healing could be expected to produce positive effects in 70% of cases on average in treatments that had failed under ALTERNA.11VE MEDICINE; A CriJical Review, William T. Jaivis, PhD, All Rights Reseived, March, 2000. 71 controlled conditions. Researchers believe that these effects are optimum when both the doctor and the patient believe strongly that the treatment is efficacious.17 Myth: \"They laughed at Columbus when he said the world was round, but he was proven to be correct and so will my healing art be someday proved true.\" Comment: They also laughed at Bozo the Clown, and their have been many more of them. Every oddball claims to be a misunderstood innovator in the tradition of Galileo and Columbus. A senior lecturer in physical sciences and engineering at Western Australian Institute of Technology, writes of his insightful experiences as editor a journal entitled Speculations in Science and Technology. Speculations was developed as a kind of Hyde Park for writers with unusual ideas in the hope that a gem might emerge from the rubbish. The nature of the manuscripts received, and information on the personalities who submitted them, is described: \u00b7 More than once, I took writers to task on the editorial page of Speculations, on one occasion in a column that I headed \"They Laughed At Columbus' and Other Author Syndromes.\" As I said at the time, the rejections our writer-innovators had experienced at the hands of other publishers weighed heavily on their minds and caused a syndrome characterized by the following reasoning: (1) they laughed at Columbus. (2) He turned out to be right. (3) They are now laughing at me. ( 4) Therefore, I will turn out to be right. (5) Therefore, your criticisms are due to jealousy, stupidity, and the like. Writers afflicted with this syndrome devoted a great deal of space in their papers to praising their own idea. More than half of the submissions included accusations of an establishment conspiracy (or even a Jewish plot) and derogatory comments about the high priests of science. 18 .. Wisecrack: Scientists say that bumblebees cannot fly, ie, scientist are blind to the obvious truth that alternative medicine works. Comment: This claim is obviously wrong because science begins with descriptive observation and then proceeds to determine mechanisms of action. No scientist would state that bumblebees should not be able to fly because bumblebees do fly. The scientific question would be, how does such a large insect manage to fly with such small wings? Nevertheless, anti-science apologists get a lot of mileage out of this folksy declaration. After hearing this wisecrack stated by various three different proponents of various pseudosciences in as many months, I decided to get to the bottom of the matter. In January, 1979, I wrote to the chief aeronautical engineers of Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, and Douglas. The answers were consistent. Insects have moveable wings while aircraft have meed wings. Research into how insects fly is relatively recent because of interest in advanced military systems and short take-off and landing operations. Two supplied me with an article from Colliers magazine that dealt with the myth that scientists say bumblebees cannot fly, which stated: This wisecrack, concocted by someone with only a dim idea of aerodynamics, has been printed millions of times in various places, and is still in circulation and an inspirational piece. Just what it is supposed to inspire, no one knows. The fact is that the bumblebee is constructed according to the laws of aerodynamics. At the Northrop plant at Hawthorne, California, where they build Black Widows, the personnel usually eats in an open-air dining room. Bumblebees often hang around the place waiting for crumbs. One day a visitor from the East told a couple of aeronautical engineers it must be a mirage: bees couldn't fly; it was scientifically impossible. This got under the hide of the engineers, and with the visitor had gone they got out their slide rules and caught a bee and measured its wingspread and fuselage. They studied it .... they found a book which said that the Germans, some years ago, had built and oscillating machine that measured Jnsecktenflugels and such things, and had proved that bees could really fly. So the Northrop experts built their own Jnsecktenflugals machine and covered many old blueprints with calculations--all during lunch hours, so as not to interfere with production and \"Hap\" Arnold raising hell. The result was two formulas (that showed how the bumblebee takes off and maintains flight).1 9 McMasters described in greater detail the possible history of the idea that some scientist once declared that bumblebees should not be able to fly according to aerodynamic principles. The story involved a dinner conversation between a biologist and a Swiss professor famous for his pioneering work in gas dynamics. A failure to properly examine insect wings caused him to miscalculate the lifting power of air as it flowed over the wings. In any case, the idea that bumblebees fly by some db . I . aeronautlca engmeers.- Wisecrack: Science doesn't have all of the answers. Comment: Science doesn't claim to have all of the answers (in fact, scientific testing produces more information about what ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A Critical R~, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. n doesn't work than what does). In the field of health care we are not attempting to answer the great transcendent questions about \"Where we came from\" \"why we are here?\" or \"where we are going.\" We are probing the beginnings of the universe, the infinity of space or time in retrospect. Rather, we ask practical questions that help us judge the worth of something in the diagnosis and treatment of human ills. Alternative practitioners have traditionally substituted patient satisfaction for true clinical effectiveness. Their ability to convert patients to their way of thinking generally puts the patient on the side of the alternative practitioner when disputes arise.

Patients Attend Nonstandard Healthcare Providers At Their Own Risk. Patients, and many physicians, are unaware that patients are faced with different standards of conduct and accountability when they attend nonstandard providers. Acupuncturists, chiropractors, naturopaths, etc, do not practice medicine, therefore, they cannot be held to medical standards of conduct. Case. An Oregon woman fell on her tail bone. She went to a chiropractor instead of a physician. He x-rayed her back, but didn't see the fracture. After some time, she developed chronic, severe back pain. A physician found that the failure to immobilize her fractured vertebra had caused bone spurs to develop. She sued but lost because, in the eyes of the law she had gotten what she had paid for--she had chosen the chiropractor \"at her own risk.\" Other chiropractors had testified that he had followed standard practice for chiropractors.1 However, such a defense is not likely to work if it can be shown that patients believed that they were choosing medicine, and that the physician who encouraged or made the referral knew, or ought \"to have known, that the safety of the \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" procedure was unproven. This, of course, is inherent in the definitions of such procedures, and primum non nocere (\"primarily, do no harm\") which goes back to the Code of Hammurabi of 1700 BCE, is the oldest consumer protection principle in history. Compensation for Wrongful Practices May Be Reduced. Patients should also know that when they knowingly elect to choose controversial, unapproved healthcare, their ability to be compensated may be affected. Jury awards to the victims of cancer quackery have been reduced by the percentages that the courts decided the patient assumed their own risk for . .-by signing a declaration that they understood that the therapy was not approved by the FDA, and was not generally accepted as valid by most physicians. Of course, the CAM provider presents these disclaimers as necessitated by a biased bureaucracy to the overly hopeful patient. Case. A jury awarded a cancer patient $2.5 million for physical damage caused by cancer that was ineffectively treated by the unapproved methods used by Nicholas Gonzales, MD, of New York City. 2 The original amount of the award was $4 million, but the jury reduced the amount by $1.5 million because they felt that no sensible person would believe Gonzales' lies. 3 Case. The estate of Cecelia Czjewski, a 66-year-old woman who died of cancer under the care of the notorious maverick Emanuel Revici, MD, was awarded 90% of a $1.5 million judgment by Judge Mary Johnson Lowe. The victim assigned 10% of the blame in her own death for choosing Revici who she knew to be controversial. Lowe also ruled that as a matter of law, there was no express assumption of risk by the patient when she signed an \"informed consent\" agreement with Revici. 4 Dangerous Notions. Chiropractors, naturopaths, and homeopaths subscribe to a potentially-dangerous belief in what is called the healing crisis, detoxification, or aggravations. The idea is that what standard medicine would regard as an adverse reaction that calls for a change in, or elimination, of a medication is regarded as a positive sign because \"the poisons are coming out.\" If the patient feels better, it speaks for itself, but if the patient gets worse, this misguided belief can prevent him from taking prudent action, as it did in the case of the death of Bivian Lee (BL). Case. 36-yr-old BL had retired from seven years as a player in the National Football League. Seeking a new career, he decided to become a distributor for HerbaLife, a multilevel marketing company that sold a line of herbal products. The company's product line had been hastily put together with little attention to safety or effectiveness. Products contained herbal laxatives, diuretics, stimulants, and other pharmacological constituents. BL was told by his HerbaLife sales trainer that in order to be a successful salesman, he would have to become an HerbaLife user. Among the literature he was given was an explanation about what to expect from taking herbal products written by a Stanley Bass, ND (Doctor of Naturopathy), DC (Doctor of Chiropractic), PhC (Philosopher of Chiropractic) entitled: \"What to symptoms expect when you improve your diet.\" Bass stated in his monograph that users should expect adverse reactions such as nausea, weakness, diarrhea, chills, fever, headaches, and more. These symptoms were alleged to be poisons coming out of the body that had been accumulating there as a result of eating modern foods with preservatives, pesticide residues, and the like. Bass claimed that, unexpelled, these poisons would become serious diseases in the future. He urged readers to rejoice when the symptoms were bad because the worse the symptoms were, the worse were the diseases of the future being avoided. BL began taking the herbs and soon began experiencing adverse symptoms. He faithfully persisted not even confiding ill his wife that he was experiencing some very serious problems. After about two weeks of suffering, he blacked out. His wife became ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; A CriJkal Review, William T. Jarvis, PhD, All Rights Reserved, March, 2000. alarmed and questioned him on what had been happening. The next day, Friday, she made an appointment for BL to see a physician on Monday. Sadly, BL never fulfilled the appointment. On Monday morning he collapsed and died in the presence of his stunned family, including his 7-yr-old daughter. The cause of death was determined to be cardiomyopathy. BL had been in excellent physical health 6 months prior to his death when he had a physical examination for a life insurance policy. BL was within 8 lbs of his football playing weight and appeared to be in exceptional physical condition. BL's wife sued HerbaLife for the wrongful death of her husband. A pathologist was ready to testify that the HerbaLife products could have caused the condition, but the company had experts ready to testify that cardiomyopathy was often idiopathic (of unknown origin). However, BL's wife did not contend that the herbal products were responsible for BL's death, but that BL would have seen a physician much sooner if he had not been for his expectations of adverse reactions from having read Bass's article. She contended that the information that had been provided by a company representative, had caused him to ignore adverse symptoms that it is reasonable to assume that he otherwise would have seen a physician about much earlier. HerbaLife attorneys had experts that would testify that in some cases cardiomyopathy is irreversible once it has began, while Mrs. BL had experts that would testify that the sooner BL sought medical care the better were his chances of survival. The HerbaLife company settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and sealed the records on the case. 5 Financial Exploitation. 74 Despite claims of cost-effectiveness, studies of alt-comp healthcare (mostly chiropractic) have found that these add to costs without increasing patient outcomes.cc If chiropractors could deliver cost-effective care health insurers would embrace them. Few do. In fact, in most cases insurers have been forced by law to include chiropractic coverage due to effective lobbying. Many insurers control costs by requiring deductibles at the beginning of care, and limiting either the total amount of reimbursement per year, or the number of treatments. The chiropractic guild has numerous practice-building companies .. -tliat teach them how to increase income by promoting unnecessary care. The main ways this is accomplished is either by convincing people to get regular \"preventive maintenance,\" or signing patients up for excessive treatments. A recent ~complaint by a consumer involved the latter. Case. On 4/17/98 a patient reported to NCAHF that she had chosen a chiropractor from a list provided by her insurance company seeking relief from back pain. She is allowed 10 visits a year to a chiropractor, coverage for diagnostic x-rays, with a co-pay of $15 per visit. After 5 visits, and minor temporary relief, she was told that she had \"subluxations\"dd that would require 56 visits to correct. The only option was to sign up for the entire course of treatments. Patients are usually told that the failure to correct these as soon as possible could lead to serious long-term effects. The reality is that manipulative therapy for back pain is effective within a short time if it is going to be at all, and that prolonged manipulation can destablize the back if ligaments are stretched. atations 1.
