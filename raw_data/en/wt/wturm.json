Alumni Spotlight Featured Student YSU did an excellent job at combining a strong Western foundation with an exceptional Chinese medical program. I transferred to YSU from another school that thought teaching Western medicine was not necessary. YSU's program integrated the two, which felt more complete to me. Also, the nutrition program at YSU is what initiated my love of nutrition as a healing modality. YSU provided me the solid foundational understanding of Chinese medicine that I needed to succeed, not only at passing my Boards, but also to continue to succeed and grow as a successful healthcare provider.
