Limitations may include the type of vaccines that can be administered and patient age limitations. Know if your state requires pharmacists to have a collaborative practice agreement, protocol, or standing order. If your state does not provide a sample standing order, model standing orders are available at the Immunization Action Coalition's website: [Vaccine Standing Orders for Healthcare Providers](http://www.immunize.org/standing-orders/). Know if your state requires pharmacists to report vaccines given and who received them to your state immunization registry. PioneerRx has included this below in the [State-Specific Guidelines](#state-specific-guidelines). PioneerRx integrates with [Immslink](https://pioneerrx.webflow.io/connected-vendors/scientific-technologies-corporation-stc) to assist with reporting to your State Immunization Information System. STC reports your immunization transactions to the appropriate State Immunization Information System (IIS) and returns patient immunization histories and vaccine recommendations when available. In order to administer immunizations, you must become certified by an Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) accredited immunization and delivery course. These courses can be found at: You will also need to be CPR/BLS certified through the [American Heart Association's](https://cpr.heart.org/en/course-catalog-search) or [American Red Cross'](https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/bls-training/bls-for-healthcare-providers) Basic Life Support for Healthcare Providers course or its equivalent and maintain current certification.Pharmacists should also take bloodborne pathogen training for compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). APhA offers [free accredited CE training on bloodborne pathogens](http://elearning.pharmacist.com/products/6015/osha-training-protecting-against-bloodborne-pathogens) for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Obtain a standing order from a licensed physician if required by your state. If permitted by your state, standing orders are encouraged as they allow a pharmacist to administer vaccinations according to a physician-approved protocol without a direct prescription or order. For general guidance on immunization standing orders, refer to the Immunization Action Coalition's document on [Using Standing Orders for Administering Vaccines: What You Should Know](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3066.pdf). If required by your state, submit your application and required documents to your state board. See [State-Specific Guidelines](#state-specific-guidelines) section. If required by your state, submit your application and required documents to your state board. See [State-Specific Guidelines](#state-specific-guidelines) section.
