Back2Nature Chiropractic is so much more than that bringing you a highly personalized and unique experience not just for treatment, but also for prevention By implementing care through techniques such as highly detailed muscle testing, adjustments, nutritional guidance, soft tissue release, and meridian balancing the nervous system is returned to its proper functioning, putting the body back in balance; helping you feel better than you ever have Why Back2Nature Chiropractic? -A personalized approach- I personally sit with you and I take the time to hear what is happening with you and/or your family. I am not driven by volume, allowing me to really get know my patients so that I can always provide what is best for you. -A Holistic Approach- As a chiropractic physician I have a holistic outlook based on an understanding that everything is connected. While things may be painful at one location, it could be other locations or even the diet that resolves the issue The first appointment Process 1). Call- Simply give me a call to set up an evaluation. I can answer all your questions and give you all the information you need to feel comfortable for your in-person appointment. 2). Evaluation- Detailed muscle testing occurs at every first appointment. Ranges of motion will be accessed, including the spine to determine the current function of the body and what is needed to change the adaptive neuronal habits that have developed. I use a variety of techniques to get your body functioning at full capacity New to chiropractic? Watch here! -Testimonials- \"I had been struggling with a hip/hamstring issue for over 8 months that caused me pain when I was running and sitting for long periods of time. Over the 8 months, I regularly went to a traditional chiropractic for care that was minimally helping. After only one visit with Dr O'Day, my entire hip and hamstring felt better and after only a couple visits my pain was completely gone. I was so impressed that he took the time to holistically examine how my body was functioning and figured out exactly what it needed to get my functioning back at full capacity\" Jenn W., Triathlete Your East Orlando Chiropractor and Applied Kinesiologist -Back2Nature Chiropractic- Our Journey At B2N we assess the health of the spine, joints, and nervous system through a detailed neurological exam, hands-on palpation and techniques such as Applied Kinesiology, Diversified, Basic and Cox flexion/distraction. This approach allows the doctor to see certain adaptations the body has adopted due to the normal (and sometimes not-so-normal) stresses of life. Pain relief is a positive side effect of chiropractic care; it is not the primary goal. Optimal balance of the nervous system is the goal. With balance comes resilience (or a higher level of adaptability) so that when stress is encountered, over-reaction doesn't occur. -Dr. O'Day- Hello. For newbies considering if a chiropractor is right for you... Or anyone searching to better understand what it is that we do Chiropractic is an opportunity An opportunity to learn An opportunity to take control and change how your body is functioning For neuro-musculo-skeletal chiropractic is a leader in effective care "}
