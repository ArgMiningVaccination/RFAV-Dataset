Carbon dating A technique used to determine the age of carbon-bearing minerals, including wood and plant remains, charcoal, bone, peat and calcium carbonate shell. When an organism dies, it stops absorbing radiocarbon and the amount already within it starts to decay and reduce. The rate at which this occurs is a known quantity: it takes 5,730 years for half of the radiocarbon available in the organism to decay. By comparing the amount left in a dead organism to the available radiocarbon levels in the atmosphere, it is possible to estimate when that organism died.

D Decarboxylase An enzyme in the blood and brain that catalyses the decarboxylation of amino acids, beta-keto acids and alpha-keto acids. This chemical reaction removes a molecule of carbon dioxide from carboxylic acid and creates, for example, an amine from an alpha-amino acid, and dopamine Decarboxylase inhibitor the conversion of levodopa (dopa) to dopamine by preventing a decarboxylase chemical reaction from taking place. By preventing levodopa from breaking down outside the brain, each dose of levodopa is more effective and much lower amounts of can be given, avoiding many side effects. Deep brain stimulation Deep brain stimulation or DBS uses one or two surgically implanted medical devices called neurostimulators, similar to cardiac pacemakers, to deliver electrical stimulation to precisely targeted areas on each side of the brain. Stimulation of these areas appears to block the signals that cause Parkinson's motor symptoms. As a result, many patients achieve greater control over their body's movements. Deep brain stimulation is also known as: - SCP - Stimulation C\u00e9r\u00e9brale Profonde (French) - (German) - - Stimolazione Cerebrale Profonda information see: [Deep brain stimulation](/living-well/therapies/surgical-treatments/) Delirium A state of excitement and mental confusion.

Dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor Dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI) is a medication that is given with levodopa (often in the same tablet) to improve its action by blocking the conversion of levodopa to dopamine. This allows more levodopa to reach the brain and, as a result, smaller doses are needed and side effects limited. The DDI used in co-careldopa (Sinemet) is carbidopa; in co-beneldopa (Madopar) it also: [Types](/about-parkinsons/treatments/types-of-medication/) of medication. Dopamine A neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, produced in the substantia nigra, which is part of the basal ganglia in the brain.

Double-blind study A clinical trial in which neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving the active treatment and who is receiving placebo. This is in contrast to a single-blind trial where the researchers know, but not the participants, who is in which group, or an open-label trial in which both participants and researchers know who is receiving the active treatment or placebo. See also: [Clinical trials](/about-parkinsons/treatments/clinical-trials/). Drug-Induced Parkinsonism A term used to describe when Parkinsonism develops or Parkinson's symptoms worsen after taking certain medications.

Hamilton depression rating score A questionnaire used by doctors to rate the severity of depression. Heartburn A form of indigestion usually felt as a pain behind the breastbone (in the front of the chest, over the heart). Heartburn has, in fact, nothing to do with the heart. Heartburn occurs when the acid contents of the stomach pass backwards up into the food pipe (the gullet or oesophagus). The pain of this can rise in the chest and may radiate to the neck, throat or angle of the jaw. The pain can be so severe and, due to the painful area, people have been known to think they are experiencing a heart attack. Most people have stomach acid reflux at some point in their lives, either as heartburn or acid regurgitation. Also called pyrosis or stomach acid reflux. Herbal medicine A complementary therapy that uses plants or plant extracts to treat illness. See also: [Herbal medicine](/living-well/therapies/complementary-therapies/herbal-medicine/). High blood pressure High blood pressure or hypertension, is a medical condition in which the blood is pumped through the arteries by the heart with too much force. The pressure of which can damage the inside walls of blood vessels. This most commonly happens when the blood vessels and arteries become too narrow forcing the heart to pump harder to move blood through the body. Blood pressure rises and falls throughout the day. However, if the pressure remains constant and greater than or equal to 140 over 90 mmHg (a systolic pressure above 140 with a diastolic pressure above 90), it is considered to be high blood pressure. Systolic is the pressure when the heart beats (squeezes blood into the body). Diastolic is the pressure between heart beats. In a normal adult, a blood pressure close to 120 over 80 mmHg is considered to be normal.

Homeopathy A gentle, holistic therapy that works by using natural substances to stimulate the body's own healing power to clear itself of any imbalance, treating the whole person not just the illness. These substances, when used in larger quantities, would cause symptoms that are similar to those of the illness or disease. Hence, the word 'homeopathy' means 'similar suffering' in Greek. See also: quality of life: a measure that assesses the effects of chronic illness. It is used to better understand how an illness interferes with a person's day-to-day life.

P Pallidotomy A surgical procedure involving the placement of a tiny electrical probe in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) area of the basal ganglia in the brain - the part of the brain that controls movement. The intention is to use the probe to destroy surrounding brain cells, via the emission of radiowaves, in order to reduce brain activity in that specific area. This may help relieve motor symptoms such as tremor and rigidity. Before surgery, detailed brain scans using MRI are carried out to identify the precise location for treatment. Until the late 1990s, pallidotomy was the most common type of Parkinson's disease surgery. However, doctors now rarely perform pallidotomy due to risks involved. Instead, deep brain stimulation is preferred, a procedure that does not destroy brain tissue and has fewer risks than pallidotomy. Palpitation Irregular or forceful heartbeat.

Quinine sulphate tablets Medicine usually used to treat malaria that is also prescribed for night time leg cramps. R Radiocarbon dating A technique used to determine the age of carbon-bearing minerals, including wood and plant remains, charcoal, bone, peat and calcium carbonate shell. Carbon dating measures the loss of radiocarbon (carbon-14 or C14). All living things contain radiocarbon: plants absorb it from the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, and animals/humans take in by eating plants or animals. When an organism dies, it stops absorbing radiocarbon and the amount already within it starts to decay and reduce. The rate at which this occurs is a known quantity: it takes 5,730 years for half of the radiocarbon available in the organism to decay. By comparing the amount left in a dead organism to the available radiocarbon levels in the atmosphere, it is possible to estimate when that organism died. Also called carbon dating or carbon-14 dating. Randomised study A clinical trial in which participants are randomly assigned to receive a test medicine, or a placebo. See also: [Clinical trials](/about-parkinsons/treatments/clinical-trials/) Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder A sleep disorder that involves abnormal behaviour during the REM phase of sleep that is characterised by the absence of normal muscle paralysis. It is associated with movement ranging from simple limb twitches to more complex and sometimes violent activity in which people appear to be unconsciously acting out their dreams and which can lead to falling out of bed, crying, shouting or even hurting their bed partner. See also: [Sleep](/pd-info/symptoms/sleep/). Rasagiline A MAO-B inhibitor used See also: [Types](/about-parkinsons/treatments/types-of-medication/) of medication. Reflexology A therapy based on the principle that the anatomy of the body is reflected by reflex zones on the feet and, to a lesser extent the hands. By using specific techniques of holds and pressures on these zones, healing is initiated and accelerated in the corresponding areas of the body. For more information, see: [Reflexology](/living-well/therapies/complementary-therapies/reflexology/). Reiki A Japanese word meaning Universal Life Force, Reiki is an energy healing therapy. The practitioner places his or her hands on the body to channel energy into the body, thereby reducing stress, increasing energy and creating feelings of peace and wellbeing. For more information, see: [Reiki ](/living-well/therapies/complementary-therapies/reiki/). REM sleep Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a normal stage of sleep characterised by the rapid movement of the eyes. It is physiologically different from the other phases of sleep and is the phase when vividly-recalled dreams mostly occur. See also: [Sleep](#). Respiratory Relating to breathing (respiration) and the movement of air in and out of the lungs, and the use of oxygen to produce energy and carbon dioxide waste. Response rate The number of patients who respond to a treatment or medication. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a condition characterised by unusual, painful sensations in the calves and/or thighs (often described as 'burning' or pins and needles) which result in an involuntary urge to move the legs.

Treatment is provided for issues with sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, satisfaction, erectile dysfunction, premature or rapid ejaculation, delayed or inhibited ejaculation, painful sex, and the inability to perform sexually due to medical disabilities, mental problems, abuse or any obsessive behaviour. Shiatsu massage This relaxation and healing method uses the fingertips and thumbs in massage and manipulation to apply pressure to specific points of the body. This causes the stimulation and release of the 'meridians' (paths of the body) through which energy flows. Also called acupressure. Sialorrhoea Increased salivary flow. See also: [Eating, swallowing](/about-parkinsons/symptoms/motor-symptoms/eating-swallowing-and-saliva-control/) and saliva control. Small intestine The section of the intestines between the stomach and the colon, and includes the duodenum (closest to the stomach), the jejunum, and the ileum (closest to the large intestine). Most digestion occurs here as it is where food is broken down into nutrients that the body can absorb and use. Social worker A trained professional who assists with the social, emotional and financial needs of the person with Parkinson's, their carer and family. In some countries, state-funded social workers may be provided to help in accessing available services and appropriate benefits. Somnolence Sleepiness. Spasmodic Dystonia Dystonia that affects the vocal chords or speech muscles causing strained and difficult speaking. Also known as laryngea dystonia.

For example, the external anal sphincter, which closes the anus, and the internal and external urinary sphincters, which close the urinary canal. Statistical outlier An observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample of the population. Statistical significance A statistical interpretation of data that indicates that a result is unlikely to have occured by chance. Stereotactic techniques Surgical techniques that involve using a frame to keep the patient's head still during surgery. The neurosurgeon will then employ special medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerised tomography (CT) to map the brain and locate the surgical site. Stiffness Rigidity of the limbs or joints that makes movement and bending difficult. Stratified A method which separates patients taking part in a study into groups based on different characteristics. Striatum Part of the basal ganglia in the brain controlling movement, balance and walking. It connects to and receives impulses from the substantia nigra, the area of the brain that produces dopamine. Stroke An interruption of the blood supply to the brain. A stroke happens when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted because a blood vessel in the brain is blocked or bursts open. Subcutaneous infusion The administration of fluids (medication) directly into subcutaneous tissues (beneath the skin). Substantia Nigra The area of the brain within the basal ganglia where dopamine is produced. Subthalamic nucleus The Subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a part of the basal ganglia and one of the target sites for deep brain stimulation. Subthalamotomy A surgical procedure involving the placement of a tiny electrical probe in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) area of the basal ganglia in the brain - the part of the brain that controls movement. The intention is to use the probe to destroy surrounding brain cells, via the emission of radiowaves, in order to reduce brain activity in that specific area. This may help relieve motor symptoms such as tremor and rigidity. Before surgery, detailed brain scans using MRI are carried out to identify the precise location for treatment. Surgical Ablation Removal of a tissue body part through surgery. Symptomatic To do with the symptoms or signs of a disease or illness. Symptomatic Dystonia Dystonia that occurs as a symptom of other diseases or syndromes including Parkinson's. Also known as secondary dystonia. Systolic The pressure exerted when the heart contracts. T Tai Chi A healing and fighting art which emphasises the mind/body connection, focusing on developing the ability to centre oneself and not be easily distracted. Practitioners believe the mind is the most important single factor in being able to achieve excellence in all areas of life, including health. The physical side of Tai Chi is a series of coordinated, rhythmical and seemingly effortless moves that aim to increase the body's movement range, aids relaxation, reduces stress and assists with good balance and posture. Also known as T'ai Chi or Tai Chi Chuan. See also: [Tai Chi](/living-well/therapies/complementary-therapies/tai-chi/). Tartar A hardened or calcified plaque that forms from mineral salts in the saliva and deposits on the teeth. A cause of tooth decay and gum disease, it requires scaling by a dentist or dental hygienist to remove. Also known as calculus. Thalamotomy A surgical operation in which a specific group of cells within the thalamus - the part of the brain that controls some involuntary movements - is surgically destroyed. Before surgery, detailed brain scans using a CT scan or MRI scan are done to identify the precise location for treatment. Although the positive effects on tremor are immediate, this procedure is often poorly tolerated because of increased complication and risk, including vision and speech problems. Other less destructive procedures are preferred, such as subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS), since this procedure can also improve tremor as well as other symptoms of Parkinson's disease. For more information, see: Deep brain stimulation [ (DBS).](/living-well/therapies/surgical-treatments/) Thalamus The part of the brain that relays sensory information to the cortex. It is one of the target sites for lesioning surgery used to treat Parkinson's. Tincture A solution prepared by steeping or soaking medicinal substances (especially plant materials such as herbs) in alcohol, vinegar or glycerol. More commonly used in complementary therapy practices than conventional medicine. Tolcapone A COMT inhibitor used to treat Parkinson's disease. See also: [Types](/about-parkinsons/treatments/types-of-medication/) of medication. Toxins Poisonous substances produced by living cells or organisms which are harmful to humans, animals or plants. Trade name of medication The name by which a medication is marketed. For example, 'Sinemet' (carbidopa-levodopa) or 'Madopar' (levodopa and benserazide). Transdermal Patch A medicated, adhesive patch which releases a dose of medication through the skin into the bloodstream. For example, Rotigotine, one of the dopamine agonists used to treat Parkinson's disease, is administered in this way. Treatment discontinuation Discontinuation or withdrawal from a treatment during a clinical study. Tremor Rhythmic shaking of a part of the body. It is one of the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease although it is not experienced by everyone. See also: [Tremor](/about-parkinsons/types/essential-tremor/). U-V U Undifferentiated cells Cells that have not yet expressed signs of their future. UPDRS The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a scale used to follow the progression of Parkinson's disease. The recently updated version of the scale is in four sections: Part I: Non-motor aspects of experiences of daily living Part II: Motor aspects of experiences of daily living Part III: Motor examination Part IV: Motor complications See also: [Rating Scales](/about-parkinsons/symptoms/rating-scales/). Urethra The tube that connects the bladder to the outside of the body. Urinary infections Infections involving any part of the urinary tract. Urinary tract The part of the body that makes and expels urine. It includes the kidneys, bladder, ureters and urethra. V Vascular Parkinsonism A form of atypical Parkinsonism in which Parkinson-type symptoms, such as rigidity, slowness, shuffling steps and speech problems are experienced. It is caused by one or more small strokes in the corpus striatum (the part of the brain that receives information about position and movement), rather than by a gradual loss of nerve cells as happens in Parkinson's disease. It can be difficult to distinguish from Parkinson's. But the primary difference is that symptoms caused by stroke tend to appear suddenly and do not progress, whereas those of Parkinson's are gradual in appearance and worsen over time. Also known as arteriosclerotic Parkinsonism. More information and support on stroke is available from the [Stroke Association](http://www.stroke.org.uk), or the [Stroke Alliance of Parkinson's and Parkinsonism. Vasodilation Widening of the blood vessels which causes the blood flow to increase. Vector A carrier molecule, often used to deliver a therapeutic gene to target cells. Venules The smallest divisions of the veins. Videofluoroscopy Videofluoroscopy is a radiographic procedure that provides objective information on the four stages of swallowing, on the time it takes food to pass and any difficulties in its movement. Food or liquid containing barium is given in different consistencies. The barium allows progress through the mouth, pharynx and oesophagus to be video recorded and observed. Therapy techniques and compensatory postures can also be tried out during the assessment and their effectiveness can be evaluated. W-X W Wearing off The gradual return of symptoms that occurs at the end of a dose of levodopa. This pattern appears when a person with Parkinson's disease has been using levodopa for many years. See also: [Wearing off](/about-parkinsons/symptoms/motor-symptoms/wearing-off-and-motor-fluctuations/) and motor fluctuations. X Xadago A medication that may be used for the treatment of motor symptoms in Parkinson's. It is also under investigation for other symptoms of the condition. See also: [Types](/about-parkinsons/treatments/types-of-medication/) of medication. Xenograft The transplant of cell tissue or organs from one species to another. Y-Z Y Yoga A system of personal development involving an integrated approach of mind and body control to promote health and inner peace. It usually involves gentle activities designed to maintain fitness, suppleness and muscle tone as well as to strengthen the body's own healing powers. Breathing is important and, together with meditation and visualisation exercises, is thought to help energise body and mind, reduce stress and improve concentration and clarity. See also: [Yoga](/living-well/therapies/complementary-therapies/yoga/). Young-onset Parkinson's Medically, young-onset Parkinson's disease describes someone who develops the symptoms of Parkinson's after the age of 21 years and before the age of 40. In other contexts, the term may be used to mean people of working age (usually under 65). Although there is no difference in the treatments available to younger and older people with Parkinson's, the management of the disease in younger people is different. It has to take into account the fact that they will live with the disease for much longer than most older people, that their response to the medication can be much more sensitive and that they are at a different stage in their lives, for example needing to earn a salary and raise children. Also called early-onset Parkinson's disease. Z Zonisamide A medication that may be used for the treatment of motor symptoms in Parkinson's. It is also under investigation for other symptoms of the condition. For more information, see [Types](/about-parkinsons/treatments/types-of-medication/) of medication. "}
