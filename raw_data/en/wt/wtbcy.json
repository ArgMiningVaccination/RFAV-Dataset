The results from a large sample suggest there is no clinically significant increase in odds of constipation in lumbosacral radiculopathy compared with nonradicular low back pain.

Pain medicine is meeting these challenges by returning to its origins: the Bonica model of multidisciplinary pain care. The 2018 Academic Consortium White Paper detailed the historical context and magnitude of the pain crisis and the evidence base for nonpharmacologic strategies. More than 50% of chronic opioid use begins in the acute pain care setting. Acupuncture may be able to reduce this risk. Objective This article updates the evidence base for acupuncture therapy for acute pain with a review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on postsurgical/perioperative pain with opioid sparing and acute nonsurgical/trauma pain, including acute pain in the emergency department. Methods To update reviews cited in the 2018 White Paper, electronic searches were conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for \"acupuncture...

We hypothesise that utilisation of CSMT for newly diagnosed rLBP is associated with reduced odds of benzodiazepine prescription through 12 months' follow-up.DesignRetrospective cohort study.SettingNational, multicentre 73-million-patient electronic health records-based network (TriNetX) in the USA, queried on 30 July 2021, yielding data from 2003 to the date of query.ParticipantsAdults aged 18-49 with an index diagnosis of rLBP were included. Serious aetiologies of low back pain, structural deformities, alternative neurological lesions and absolute benzodiazepine contraindications were excluded.

This study will be the first to investigate the association between utilization of chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for radicular low back pain (LBP) and MRI utilization. We hypothesize that adults with incident radicular LBP receiving chiropractic SMT will have reduced odds of undergoing a lumbar MRI over a 6-week follow-up window as the primary outcome as well as at 6-months and 1-year, and findings will be maintained after controlling for key confounding variables. Methods: A national database of aggregated electronic health records (TriNetX) will be queried for adults age 20-70 with incident radicular LBP with a search window January 1, 2011 to one year preceding the search date. Patients with lumbar radiograph, computed tomography, MRI or a diagnosis warranting early appropriate MRI in the preceding 90 days will be excluded. Propensity score matching will be used to control for variables associated with lumbar MRI utilization. The odds of lumbar MRI at 6-week, 6-month, and 1-year follow-up windows following the index date of LBP diagnosis will be calculated. Results: Measures of association will include the number and percentage of patients undergoing lumbar MRI in each cohort and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and p-values for each follow-up window before and after propensity matching. Conclusions: This study will utilize a large propensity-matched sample to evaluate lumbar MRI utilization in recipients of chiropractic SMT relative to other forms of care. The results of this study will serve as a marker of MRI guideline concordance in the management of patients with radicular LBP.

As there is limited evidence for individual therapies and no singular treatment for PCS, guidelines endorse a multidisciplinary approach. This case describes a post-COVID patient benefiting from acupuncture within a comprehensive approach alongside symptom-titrated physical activity (STPA).Case: A 50-year-old woman presented upon Long-COVID Clinic referral to an outpatient hospital-affiliated acupuncturist with 8 months of fatigue, anosmia, chest pressure, palpitations, and other symptoms following mild assay-confirmed COVID-19. Prior/concurrent medical testing demonstrated multisystem-inflammatory involvement (pericardial effusion, thyroid dysfunction, elevated D-dimers). Cardiology/pulmonology cleared the patient for exercise to tolerance considering serious pathology was absent. The acupuncturist's Traditional Chinese Medicine impression was of Qi deficiency of t...

While prior acupuncture studies are promising as an alternative opioid-sparing approach to pain reduction, successful conduct of a multi-center pilot study is needed to prepare for a future definitive randomized control trial (RCT). Methods: Acupuncture in the Emergency Department for Pain Management (ACUITY) is funded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. The objectives are to: conduct a multi-center feasibility RCT, examine feasibility of data collection, develop/deploy a manualized acupuncture intervention and assess feasibility/implementation (barrier/facilitators) in 3 EDs affiliated with the BraveNet Practice Based Research Network. Adults presenting to a recruiting ED with acute non-emergent pain (e.g., musculoskeletal, back, pelvic, noncardiac chest, abdominal, flank or head) of 4 on a 0-10-point Numeric Rating Scale will be eligible. ED participants (n = 165) will be equally randomized to Acupuncture or Usual Care. At pre-, post-, and discharge time-points, patients will self-assess pain and anxiety using the Numeric Rating Scale. Pain, anxiety, post-ED opioid use and adverse events will be assessed at 1 and 4 weeks. Opioid utilization in the ED and discharge prescriptions will be extracted from patients' electronic medical records. Acupuncture recipients will asked to participate in a brief qualitative interview about 3 weeks after their discharge. ED providers and staff will also be interviewed about their general perspectives/experiences related to acupuncture in the ED and implementation of acupuncture in ACUITY. Results: Recruitment began on 5/3/21. As of 12/7/21: 84 patients have enrolled, the responsive acupuncture intervention has been developed and deployed, and 26 qualitative interviews have been conducted. Conclusion: Successful conduct of ACUITY will provide the necessary framework for conducting a future, multi-center, definitive RCT of acupuncture in the ED.

Methods A systematic review was conducted on articles in PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase published through December 2020. The study was listed in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020159193). Major categories of variables extracted included study details and demographics, interventions, and outcomes. Results The literature search yielded 3,316 records, with 264 assessed for full-text review. Of those, 23 studies (including 8,464 patients) were specific to pain conditions as a main outcome. Studies included chiropractic, acupuncture, multimodal individualized intervention/programs, physiotherapy, and anthroposophic medicine therapy.

We assessed the feasibility of a yoga-based MBI called RISE (resilience, integration, self-awareness, engagement) for residents among multiple specialties and academic medical centers. Methods We conducted a waitlist controlled randomized clinical trial of the RISE program with residents from multiple specialty departments at three academic medical centers. The RISE program consisted of six weekly sessions with suggested home practice. Feasibility was assessed across six domains: demand, implementation, practicality, acceptability, adaptation, and integration. Self-reported measures of psychological health were collected at baseline, post-program, and two-month follow-up.

Its diagnosis depends on the recognition of signs and symptoms atypical to common degenerative lumbar disorders and its treatment requires timely and coordinated care. A 26-year-old woman presented to a chiropractor at a hospital-based outpatient clinic with a 6-month exacerbation of radiating pain and paresthesia from the right gluteal region into the leg and foot. She was previously treated for over 3 months for suspected lumbosacral radiculopathy with physical therapy. Multisegmental neurologic deficits inconsistent with her prior lumbar imaging prompted further investigation. Pelvis and hip MRI identified a 7\u00d75 cm mass extending through the greater sciatic foramen which compressed and infiltrated the lumbosacral plexus, sciatic nerve, and superior gluteal nerve, and was confirmed via biopsy to be...

Methods: Using a qualitative exploration of reflections on a yoga-based retreat at Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health, nested in a larger study, the current inquiry aims to explore long-term perceptions of an occupation-oriented program designed to improve resilience. Called RISE (resilience, integration, self-awareness, engagement), the immersion program was a 5-day professional development for professionals in high-stress jobs.

Methods Education professionals who attended a 3-day yoga-based RISE (resilience, integration, self-awareness, engagement) program were recruited to participate. RISE was administered at the Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health. Measures of psychological and occupational well-being, and health-related behaviors were completed before (baseline), after (post), and 2 months after RISE (follow-up). Forty-four participants completed baseline and post and were included in the analysis. Of those, 33 participants also completed the follow-up. Paired samples t tests were used to compare scores between time points.

Frontline professionals from education, health care, human services, and corrections participated in the RISE (Resilience, Integration, Self-awareness, Engagement) program and completed questionnaires at baseline, post-program, and 2 months following RISE. Paired samples t tests revealed improvements in mindfulness, stress, resilience, affect, and sleep quality from baseline to post-program (all Ps < 0.001, N = 55), which were sustained at the 2-month follow-up (all Ps < 0.01, N = 40). Participants also reported increases in exercise, fruit, and vegetable consumption post-program (all Ps < 0.001), all of which persisted at the 2-month follow-up (all Ps < 0.01) except exercise. These findings suggest that RISE improved indices of psychological health and healthy behaviors that remained 2 months following RISE. Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text.
