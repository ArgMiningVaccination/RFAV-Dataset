We can also expect a fair share of stress and unwanted disruptions to our ordinary routines. Whether you're looking to prepare yourself for the upcoming festivities or merely cleanse after it's all over, it's a great idea to employ a few self-care practices. Among those we recommend is spiritual, or energy, healing which involves using the senses to address emotional disturbances. Taking a spiritual approach to healing can have benefits for your body, mind, heart, and soul. In these challenging times it's more important than ever to make sure you're in a balanced state so you can deal with whatever- or whomever- the holidays bring your way... Energy Healing Techniques Acupuncture Derived from traditional Chinese medicine, [acupuncture](https://www.nature.com/articles/vital288) is the practice of inserting very thin needles at strategic points all over the body. While that may sound scary, it's a safe practice with few side effects. Many believe acupuncture is specifically for physical pain relief, but it treats the mind, body, and soul together by restoring your body's natural flow of energy, or [chi](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/health/a27079502/what-is-chi-energy/). Reiki If you're not into the whole needle thing, Reiki is a much less invasive option. According to The International Center for Reiki Training, the word Reiki is made of two Japanese words. Rei which means \"God's Wisdom or the Higher Power\" and Ki which means \"life force energy.\" Therefore, the word Reiki literally translates to \"spiritually guided life force energy.\" What to expect: Your practitioner will gently touch or hold their hands over your body, targeting key energy points. There are a series of 12 to 15 different hand positions, each designed for specific effects. Reiki promotes overall wellness by balancing your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy. Use the [Mindbody](https://www.mindbodyonline.com/) app as a resource to find experienced practitioners who specialize in energy healing practices! Meditation Meditation is a simple concept but can be difficult to master because it involves stilling the mind...and just being. There is no \"correct\" way to meditate, but there are certain strategies to help you be successful. You can focus on your breath, a [mantra](https://www.thehealthy.com/alternative-medicine/mantra-definition/), a particular object, thought, or activity. It's ultimately about finding your center and maintaining a mentally clear and emotionally stable state. Some people meditate quietly while others listen to music or a human guide. You will need to try different methods to understand what works best for you. If you don't know where to start on your meditation journey, try apps like [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) or [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) to guide you in this challenging, but rewarding practice! Smudging Another practice that rids negative energy is burning sage, or smudging, which originated from Native American tribes many centuries ago. You can sage pretty much anything! Jewelry, furniture, open space, and most importantly yourself. The key is to buy high-quality, ethically sourced, [California White Sage](https://www.vogue.com/article/sage-how-to-cleanse-energy-home-office-smudging). Not only does sage cleanse bad energy, but it has antimicrobial and antibacterial properties that cleanse bacteria, fungi, and viruses from the air. Palo Santo translates to \"holy wood\" which comes from a tree native to South America. It has anti-anxiety properties due to the high amount of limonene released when it's burned. It is not only effective at repelling negative energy, but pests like mosquitoes, ants, termites, and flies. Our CEO [Tiffany](https://www.instagram.com/tiffanyleeschade/) recommends cleansing your body with Palo Santo smoke instead of sage because of its subtle smell. Join us on our journey to a more balanced state! All of these energy healing practices are affordable, practical, and most importantly, beneficial. Remember to always guard your energy and release anything that no longer serves "}
