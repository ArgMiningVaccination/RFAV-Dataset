It comes as a surprise to many that there is a strong connection between vitamins and HPV, or human papillomavirus. 5 Vitamins that Are Significant in Healing HPV If you recently received a positive indication for HPV or have an abnormal Pap test, you are very likely feeling worried and uncertain about what to do next. First, know that you do not have to stand by waiting for your next medical appointment. There are several natural options that you can take right now to proactively assist your body in its recovery from the HPV virus. You are in the right place! There are many HPV articles, podcasts, and other resources found here on the Dr. Doni website and I encourage you to explore and empower yourself with this vital information. Today, I want to ensure that you understand that there is a significant, and often surprising, connection between the following five vitamins and your HPV healing journey. We'll be reviewing the benefits and recommended dosage of folate, vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E. 1. [FOLATE](https://drdonistore.com/5-MTHF-5-mg-60-vegetarian-capsules_p_331.html) [Folate](https://drdonistore.com/5-MTHF-5-mg-60-vegetarian-capsules_p_331.html) (vitamin B9), also known as 5-MTHF, not to be confused with FOLIC ACID, plays a critical role in lowering the HPV associated risk of developing higher grades of CIN, which are the abnormal cells found on the surface of the cervix (or vaginal or rectal tissue). By way of definition, methylation is your body's ability to use B vitamins, influenced by your genetics and stress exposure. HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE LIKE 40% OF WOMEN, THIS PROCESS DOESN'T HAPPEN IF your body doesn't receive the [active form of folate](https://doctordoni.com/2017/12/taking-folate-with-mthfr/) your body needs. Here's the important takeaway, your body needs the right type of folate in dosages specifically matched to your body to get the full benefits. We need to look at lab tests and even genetics to know the best dose for you. A common dosage range is: 1 to 10 mg of 5MTHF (methyl-folate) per day. It's always best to check with your practitioners and your body to be sure you are taking the right amount for your case. 2. [VITAMIN C](https://drdonistore.com/Dr-Donis-Vitamin-C-Support-60-capsules_p_1200.html) [Vitamin C](https://drdonistore.com/Dr-Donis-Vitamin-C-Support-60-capsules_p_1200.html) is another antioxidant supplement that can help boost your immune system function. A strong immune system is critical to help your body to fend off HPV. Several lines of evidence suggested that antioxidants found in vitamin C can play a protective role against high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection and cervical cancer. Source: [Nutrients 2020 May; 12(5): 1384](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7284420/) Vitamin C is water soluble and is quickly metabolized and eliminated in the urine, but your body doesn't make it naturally, which is why vitamin C food sources like oranges, grapefruits, and broccoli are recommended as part of a healthy diet. However, you will likely need to increase your intake with a trusted vitamin C supplement. The body can take in approximately 500mg of vitamin C at a time. Take your vitamin C in two or three doses throughout the day instead of consuming a large amount all at once (which could result in loose stools). A common dosage range is: 500 to 1000mg twice per day. To learn more about the health benefits of vitamin C, read this article: [10 IMPRESSIVE BENEFITS OF VITAMIN C (AND WHY YOU NEED MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU DO)](https://doctordoni.com/2022/01/vitamin-c/). 3. [VITAMIN A](https://drdonistore.com/Dr-Donis-Vitamin-A-Support-100-soft-gels_p_1344.html) It's incredibly common for women who have HPV and/or dysplasia to be deficient in vitamin A, which is known for its antiviral properties. [Vitamin A](https://drdonistore.com/Dr-Donis-Vitamin-A-Support-100-soft-gels_p_1344.html) also helps to improve healthy cell function, and that's so important when trying to grow new, normal cells on the cervix. While many people attempt to get their vitamin A from beta-carotene supplements, some people are genetically predisposed to not be able to convert beta-carotene into Vitamin A effectively. This explains why in clinical nutrition and naturopathic medicine; we will often go straight to using actual vitamin A. It is important to know, at the same time, that vitamin A is a fat-soluble hormone (like vitamin D), which means it can build up in your system over time. This is why you'll read warnings about vitamin A. I want you to know there is a safe and effective way to use vitamin A to fend off HPV and help heal your cervix (or vaginal cells). Human Papillomavirus has emerged as a distinct cause of cervical changes in young women. Its prevalence is continuously growing and is considered at epidemic proportions with 20 million Americans already infected and 5.5 million new cases reported annually. Source: Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Tracking the Hidden Epidemics., Trends in STDs in the U.S. 2000, Atlanta, Georgia, 2000 It is best to work with a practitioner to guide you, to use the clinical doses for a short period of time - 3 to 6 months - and to always monitor how you feel and adjust accordingly. If you are trying to conceive or find out that you are pregnant, it is important to keep your dose of vitamin A under 10,000 iu per day. A common clinical dosage range is: 10,000 iu to 50,000 iu per day. 4. [VITAMIN D](https://drdonistore.com/Dr-Donis-Vitamin-D-K-Support-60-capsules_p_1203.html) [Vitamin D](https://drdonistore.com/Dr-Donis-Vitamin-D-K-Support-60-capsules_p_1203.html), which is synthesized within the skin in response to sunlight, is also a supportive nutrient for strong immunity. A study published in a 2010 edition of \"Nature Immunology\" found that vitamin D is essential for activating killer T cells of the immune system so they can detect and eliminate invading pathogens, potentially preventing serious infections. [KILLER T CELLS](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cytotoxic-t-cell), which are produced in the thymus gland, have the potential to eliminate viruses such as HPV. Further, there are anecdotal reports that vitamin D applied directly to warts suppresses their growth. Is your vitamin D deficiency being overlooked? Dr. Doni outlines a clear-cut explanation of the science, symptoms, and correct supplementation in this article: [THE VITAMIN D EPIDEMIC](https://doctordoni.com/2022/02/vitamin-d-deficiency/). A common clinical dosage is: 5000 iu per day. It is important to monitor your vitamin D (250Hvitamin D levels) in your blood to identify the best dose for you. 5. VITAMIN E I have included vitamin E in the lineup because, several epidemiological studies have suggested that it could reduce the risk of cervical cancer. Source: [PLoS One 2017; 12(8): e0183395](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5567498/) Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that improves immune system function, lowers your risk of developing cervical cancer, supports healthy reproductive function, decreases inflammation in your body, aids in tissue production and helps repair damaged tissues. A common clinical dosage range is: 25 to 200 iu per day. This amount can be found in high quality multivitamin along with other nutrients to support healing from HPV. You can find all of these nutrients (and more) in my [HPV Support Package](https://drdonistore.com/HPV-Support-Package_p_1140.html). Healing HPV: Next Steps While HPV is a very common virus, it can be shocking to receive positive test results. After all, there are no symptoms - and it can cause cancer. What's worse is that the standard medical approach does not include options to help you in HEALING HPV once you have it. That's why I have an online store of highest quality supplements, so you have access to order [the nutrients you need to help your body heal](https://drdonistore.com/HPV-Support-Package_p_1140.html). It's also why I developed a range of different programs to help you and many other women to get HPV and your pap results to negative using natural approaches.
