Reiki (pronounced \"ray-key\") is a form of holistic healing which enhances the body's ability to heal itself. As a result, it elevates your physical, emotional, and spiritual healing by harmonizing the body, mind and spirit. Reiki is a simple, safe and gentle hands-on energy technique that is used to address a variety of issues including: - Stress Reduction - Pain Management - Depression - Anxiety - Insomnia - Trauma or Grief - Medication Side Effects - Relaxation - General Well-Being - Complements any medical or psychological treatment A Reiki treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance that flows through and around you. After a treatment, you will feel relaxed, rested and refreshed. The Usui Ryoho method of Reiki is the sacred healing practice founded by Sensei Usui Mikao of Japan. Sensei Usui (1865-1926) developed Reiki after attaining enlightenment by spending 21 days on Mount Kurama. After descending the mountain, Sensei tried Reiki on himself and family members. He found that the healing effects were immediate. To share Reiki's benefits of well-being with the general public, Sensei Usui set up a Reiki center where he began to teach and give treatments. Consequently, his teachings spread across the country and many branches of schools developed in Japan. In Hawaii, Mrs. Hawayo Takata heard of the beneficial effects of Reiki. She traveled to Japan to learn Usui Ryoho Reiki and introduced it to the United States in 1938. Theory of Reiki Treatment Stress, trauma and illness restrict the natural flow of Ki (or Chi or Prana) life force energy through the body. By restoring Ki to the body, a Reiki session rejuvenates the body's ability to relax and de-stress, and supports its ability to heal itself. Long term imbalances in the body sometimes require multiple Reiki sessions in order to facilitate the level of relaxation needed by the body to bring the system back into balance. Nature of Services Provided During a Reiki treatment, the client lies down or is seated, fully clothed. The Reiki practitioner places their hands on or above the body and allows the Reiki to radiate from the hands. In addition, sessions may also involve the practitioner sweeping their hands above the body in various ways, or incorporating breath or vocal tones to break up energy blocks. The energy of Reiki can reach anywhere in the world. For those who are in the hospital or who live far away from the practitioner, Distance/Remote Reiki can be sent.
