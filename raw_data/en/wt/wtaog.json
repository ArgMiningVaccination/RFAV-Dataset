Worldwide numerous researches were done to know about the effective management of cases with antipyretics, antivirals, steroids, and other investigational therapies. Also seeing the high infectivity of the virus, social distancing and masks were being promoted to prevent its spread.[ [4]] Vaccination against infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 is the most cost-effective public health intervention. Researchers have worked enormously to develop effective and safer vaccines against COVID-19 infection. Two Indian-made vaccines were granted Emergency Use Authorization which were covishield (developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and manufactured by Serum Institute of SII) and covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited).[ [5]] As stated by one the members of National Institute for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog that the side-effects of covishield and covaxin were are 'less than negligible' as compared to other COVID-19 vaccines. The most common side effects experienced after both the vaccines were pain redness at injection site, mild fever, headache joint pain, and muscle pain.[ [6]] Despite the awareness campaign on the importance of vaccination, several factors contribute to limiting the adherence of the population to this intervention which includes long-term adverse events of these vaccines leading to the growing anxiety and vaccine hesitancy.[ [7]] Knowledge on what happens post-vaccination among the general population is still limited. Conducting research to access the after effects of COVID-19 vaccination will help people to gain knowledge regarding the same. This will help in lowering the apprehension about adverse effects post vaccination and it will also increase the public confidence in vaccine safety thereby accelerating the vaccination process against COVID-19.With mass vaccination coverage anticipated, findings from immediate post-marketing data on COVID-19 vaccines can guide regulatory decisions and public health practice to maintain a positive benefit-risk balance. As a result, following study has been planned with aim and objective to evaluate the occurrence of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) after first and second dose of covishield and covaxin along with assessing the factors associated with these Adverse effects. Materials and Methods Study design A longitudinal study was conducted during the period of 1st August 2021 to 30th November 2021 in a tertiary care health center of Uttar Pradesh and rural health teaching centre (RHTC) attached to the health center. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee of the Tertiary Care Centre. Participants The eligible participants of this study were adults above the age of 18 years who attended the health centers either to receive their first or second dose of covishield or covaxin. Individuals with current confirmed infection of SARS-CoV or any history of contact with confirmed cases were excluded from the study. All the participants who did not give written consent were excluded from the study. Participation in the study was entirely voluntary. The participants were allowed to withdraw themselves from the study at any instance during the entire study duration without any need to justify their decision. Sample size All the adults attending the health center to receive vaccination against SARS-CoV during the period of 1st August 2021 to 31st October 2021 were included in the study. Method This study was conducted in the vaccination clinic of tertiary care center and RHTC attached to it. All the adults attending the vaccination clinic were approached, and the study was described to them. The people who were willing to participate in the study were made to sign the consent form and data were collected based on the questionnaire. As per the government supplies, either covishield or covaxin was administered to these participants as first dose. The second dose was administered based on the type of vaccine administered in the first dose. The vaccine was administered by a trained vaccinator into deltoid muscle. After the vaccination, the participants were observed at the health facility for 30 min for any AEFI. These participants were followed up telephonically on seventh day from vaccination on the mobile numbers provided by them in the questionnaire. Leading questions were asked regarding any adverse effects faced by the participants during the seven days. If any participant did not attend the call, then he was contacted two more time on the subsequent days. If the participant did not respond during the three attempts made, he was no longer a part of the study sample. Data collection Data were collected using a structured and pretested questionnaire which was translated into the local language. The questionnaire was categorized into four parts: Socio-demographic factors, comorbid and addiction features, COVID exposure, and vaccination parameters. To ensure that the questionnaires prepared in English and the one translated into local language were conceptually equivalent, forward and back translation methods were implemented. A Pilot study was conducted on ten adults from both the facilities (five each). The questionnaire depicted an excellent face validity and content validity index (CVI) greater than 0.8. The data collected from the pilot study was not included in the study sample. Based on results of the pilot study, necessary changes were made, and the study was proceeded with the modified questionnaire. Data analysis After the data collection, it was cleaned and statistically analyzed using SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA. All the data were subjected to descriptive analysis while associations were calculated using Chi-square or Fischer exact test while any comparison of mean was done using independent t-test. All inferential tests were carried out using a confidence interval of 95% and significance level of 0.05. Ethical consideration Protocol was submitted in Institutional Ethical Committee. Informed written consent from the participants were obtained after informing that the participation will be voluntary and there will be no harm to the participants in the study. The confidentiality of the information obtained from the patient was maintained, and the identity of the patient was not revealed. Result [Figure 1](javascript:void(0)) shows that out of 610 people with whom the study was started, 78 were lost to follow up and the study was continued with 532 participants. [Table 1](javascript:void(0)) depicts that out of 532 participants, 250 (47%) came for their first dose while 282 (53%) came for second dose. For both the vaccines (covishield and covaxin) and for both the doses, maximum participation was shown by males and those belonging to age groups 18-30 years. On observing the educational status of participants who were willing for vaccination, it was observed that most participants who came for first dose were educated upto class 9th (25.6%) while those coming for second dose were illiterate (22%) and graduates (22%). Majority of the participants in both the groups were residents of rural area. Also, those belonging to Hindu religion showed maximum participation in both the groups. Out of 532 study participants, 209 (39.3%) observed adverse events after vaccination. As shown in [Table 2](javascript:void(0)), the highest reported symptom in the first dose for covaxin was local tenderness (39.3%), and for covishield it was fever (30.5%). While in the second dose, the results were reversed as maximum reported symptom for covaxin was fever (22.2%) and for covishield it was local tenderness (17.5%). No statistically significant association was observed between adverse events and first dose of respective vaccines. However, a statistically significant association was found between second dose of covaxin (9.2%) and covishield (17.5%) for the symptom local tenderness (p < 0.05). Participants who developed Adverse effects after covishield did not belong to any specific age group or gender [ [Table 3](javascript:void(0))]. The education status and employment status were comparable so was their religion and residence settings. However, among comorbidity status, adverse effects faced by obese participants were significantly greater than participants with normal weight after administration of first dose. After second dose administration, diabetic participants faced significantly greater side-effects compared to the non-diabetics. Similar to the findings of covishield, people vaccinated with covaxin who developed adverse effects were comparable regarding age, gender, education status, religion and residence setting [ [Table 4](javascript:void(0))]. Although, a significantly higher number of participants of working class (private and business) developed adverse effect after second dose of covaxin. Covaxin was found to be relatively safer for participants with comorbidities. Discussion In the present study out of 532 participants, 128 were respondents after first dose of covishield, 122 after first dose of covaxin, 185 after second dose of covishield, and 97 after second dose of covaxin. Maximum participation was shown by males and those belonging to age groups 18-30 years. The short-term adverse events of both the doses with both the vaccines were observed. Symptoms were mild in severity and short-lived. No serious adverse events attributable to vaccines were reported. In the present study, maximum participation was shown by participants belonging to age group 18-30 years. On the contrary, study done by Sultana et al. (2021) in Bangladesh[ [8]] reported that out 623 study participants most of the respondents were between 30 and 60 years of age, and 40.4% were female. In the present study, out of the 532 participants, 250 (47%) came for their first dose, while 282 (53%) came for second dose. Whereas study done by Kumar et al. (2021) in Bengaluru[ [9]] reported that 35.5% (583 out of 1638) of the study participants had taken COVID vaccine, of which 533 (91.42%) were partially vaccinated and remaining 50 (8.5%) were fully vaccinated. In the present study, 209 (39.3%) study participants observed adverse events after vaccination. Also, the highest reported symptom in the first dose for covaxin was local tenderness (39.3%) and for covishield it was fever (30.5%). While in the second dose, the results were reversed as maximum reported symptom for covaxin was fever (22.2%) and for covishield it was local tenderness (17.5%). Whereas study done by Sultana et al. (2021) in Bangladesh[ [8]] reported that a total of 8.5% respondents had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Three hundred and seventeen participants reported various side-effects after taking the vaccine, which is about 50.88% of the total participants. The majority of participants (37.07%, 231 out of 623) reported swelling and pain at the injection site and fever (25.84%, 162 out of 623). A study done by Klugar et al. (2021) in Germany reported that 88.1% of the German health care workers reported at least one side effect following vaccination against COVID-19.[ [10]] Also, study done by Konu et al. (2021) in Togo[ [7]] reported that the most adverse events were injection site pain (91.0%), asthenia (74.3%), headache (68.7%), soreness (55.0%), and fever (47.5%). Also, a survey conducted by Jayadevan et al. (2021) in India[ [11]] reported that 65.9% of respondents reported at least one post-vaccination symptom such as tiredness (45%), myalgia (44%), fever (34%), headache (28%), local pain at injection site (27%), joint pain (12%), nausea (8%) and diarrhea (3%) as the most prevalent symptoms. The benefit of study is fear of the unknown is a driver of vaccine hesitancy. By describing what to expect, the findings of this study will be reassuring to those who are fearful of the new vaccine. The fact that post-vaccination symptoms were mild, predictable, and short-lived will help reduce vaccine hesitancy. In our study, adverse events were reported more by males as compared to females for both the vaccines and for both the doses. On the contrary, study done by Kumar et al. (2021) in Bengaluru[ [9]] reported that adverse events were more likely to be reported by women (74.7%) compared to men (58.6%). Similarly, a survey conducted by Jayadevan et al. (2021) in India[ [11]] reported that post-vaccination symptoms were more likely to be reported by women (74.7%) compared to men (58.6%). Also, maximum side effects were shown by those belonging to age group 18-30 years. There was a clear linear correlation between age and post-vaccination symptoms, suggesting that vaccine reactogenicity declined with age. There are few limitations in the study. The first limitation is that the difference in the number of participants those who received first and second dose of both covaxin and covishield therefore, it was difficult to compare between the first and the second dose side effects. The second limitation is that the optimal sample size was not reached for the number of participants. Moreover, this study only described self-reported side effects from the respondents, and because of purposive sampling, the generalizability of the study's outcome might be affected. Conclusion The short-term adverse events of both the doses with both the vaccines were observed. The symptoms were mild in severity and short-lived. No serious adverse events attributable to vaccines were reported. Our study showed that the vaccine was safe and well-tolerated. In conclusion, despite the occurrence of mild adverse effects, vaccination against COVID-19 remains an important strategy to fight against this pandemic. Conducting such kind of studies might help to curtail the vaccine misconceptions and fears among the general population and encourages more people to participate in the mass vaccination program in the coming days. Key points - Short-term and mild adverse effects were presented after vaccination with both the types of vaccine. - Metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity were found to have some significance in presentation of adverse effects after vaccination with covishield. - Adverse effects after covaxin were unaffected by comorbidity status making it safer.
