It is also important to understand vaccines only affect a part of our immune system. Vaccines do not have to be our only option. Our body's entire immune system is our best defense against ever quickly evolving viruses, whether you get the vaccine or not. Some factors that decrease our overall immune system and lend to a higher potential of catching the flu are fear, stress, poor diets and poor sleep. We can reduce our potential of catching the flu by: - Stress and fear management (become knowledgeable), and maintain a proper sleep regime. - Wash hands frequently and before eating, up to 10x a day. - Deep breathing 2-3 x a day increases surfactant anti-microbial proteins A & D in the lungs. - Reduce sugars (breads, pasta -high glycemic), it significantly impairs immune function. - Reduce the use of acetaminophen, alcohol and cigarettes, impairs immune function. - Eat a variety fruits and vegetables (quantity should be half of all our meals). - Moderate exercise will help move the lymph, improving drainage and immune function. - Contrast showers: 1 minutes hot, 30 seconds cold. Repeat 3 times, ending with cold. - Eat one clove of raw garlic a day with meals, best antimicrobial food Having a nutritious diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, is our best way to support our immune system. The high levels of refined sugars in junk food bring down your immune system for 4-6 hours, put you at greater risk for the flu. Main support for flu prevention are multivitamins, probiotics, Vitamin D3, selenium, glutamine, and a homeopathic remedy. Flu vs. Cold and their treatment - Flu = Fever, chills, headache and exhaustion, vomiting and diarrhea - If you suspect you have the flu, stay home for at least 7 days after all symptoms have gone, this is the time in which you are still contagious. - Do not suppress a fever which is less than 38.5oC /101oF with medication, a \"normal' fever helps circulating lymphocytes create a 10 fold in IFN-gamma activity, essential for fighting viruses! Also, acetaminophen reduces your natural antioxidant mechanism, glutathione. Let the fever run its course! - \"Starve a fever, feed a cold\", by not eating large meals, you will naturally shift the immune system to fight viral infections. In all likelihood, you won't have much of an appetite. Always be sure to stay well hydrated. - Probiotics have shown to reduce symptoms such as cough, runny nose and lowers fever. - Vitamin C limits symptoms of the flu. - Glycyrrhiza can be used to treat coughs and upset stomach. - A couple of slices of ginger in warm water can help with nausea. If you have a high fever, above 38.5oC /101oF, that persists, or you are experiencing severe symptoms (i.e. difficulty breathing) go to emergency room!
