Chiropractic is a manual method for maintaining the health and the treatment of locomotor disorders and their consequences. The spine houses a significant part of the central nervous system. All body coordination and communication passes through the nervous system, using the entrance and exit gates distributed along the spine. Hence, the integrity of our spine is necessary for bodily balance. The aim of chiropractic is to restore innate freedom of movement to the spine and all the joints in the body in order to maintain the exchange of unlimited information between the brain and all the organs. A chiropractor examines the individual mobility of each joint. Each functional disorder is then corrected. Chiropractic does not replace traditional veterinary medicine. It expands the treatment options with regard to functional disorders of the spine, internal organs and disorders of a biomecanic origin. How does chiropractic work? - Subluxation: Mobility is reduced with chiropractic subluxation of an intervertebral joint. This loss of mobility also affects the nervous system since the spinal nerves originating from the spinal cord pass between two vertebrae. These nerves ensure the flow of information between the brain, the muscles, the skin and all the organs. Subluxation therefore results overall in - A locomotor function deficiency causing stiffness, muscle spasms, pain and loss of performance etc. - Internal organ deficiency (digestive, urinary, immune etc.), - Compensatory reactions on other joints, causing secondary blockages, further deteriorating the condition of the animal further. - Adjustment: Through quick and very precise manipulation, the chiropractor restores the natural mobility of the joint, this correction is called an adjustment. The anatomical barriers of the joints are never exceeded during chiropractic adjustment. When should chiropractic be used? In small animals, blockage symptoms arise through pain, problems with movement or position, and functional and sensory deficiencies. Here are some examples: - Pain to the touch (pain in the neck or back ...) - Non-specific lameness, abnormal gait - Difficulty moving (stairs, jumping) - Decreased performance - Position altered (sits in a puppy position or always lies on the same side, etc.) - Irreversible diseases (dysplasia, osteoarthritis, etc.) with compensation in the spine - Discopathy (after radiological examination) - Licking-associated dermatitis - Recurrent digestive problems - Functional difficulty urinating and defecating - Recurrent inflammation of the anal glands - Geriatric Chiropractic results Chiropractic treatment corrects disorders of the musculoskeletal function and restores joint mobility by precise adjustments. The correction is done by the practitioner's hands thanks to a rapid low-range pulse on the joint concerned. A visible improvement is observed in the majority of animals after 1 to 3 sessions. Patients presenting with blockages as a result of chronic disease (spondylosis, osteoarthritis and hip dysplasia, etc.) take more time to respond. They often respond very well to treatment performed at regular intervals every 2 to 6 months.
