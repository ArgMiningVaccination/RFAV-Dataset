Editorial Guidelines Updated on November 21, 2022 Photo: ANUSHA RAJESWARAN Essential oils\u2014extracted from leaves, fruit peels, petals, and other plant parts\u2014capture nature's subtle fragrances and can refresh your living space. That's why contributor Anusha Rajeswaran decided to create this all-natural spray, which you can spritz throughout every room in your home. All you'll need to recreate this project is unscented witch hazel, dried flowers, distilled water, and your favorite essential oils. You can mix and match the former for a signature scent: Try combinations like wild orange and tea tree, lavender and rose, or green tea and cucumber. What You'll Need Materials Spray bottles Essential oils Distilled water Unscented witch hazel Dried flowers Instructions Pour 25 to 30 drops of essential oil in your bottle. Fill the bottle halfway with witch hazel. (Note: Witch hazel helps the oil and water combine and will help the scent linger for a longer period of time.) Fill the rest of the bottle with distilled water. This ratio works pretty well no matter the size of the bottle. Shake bottle to combine all the ingredients. Insert a sprig of dried flowers and herbs to finish off your fragrant spray. Originally appeared: MARTHA STEWART "}
