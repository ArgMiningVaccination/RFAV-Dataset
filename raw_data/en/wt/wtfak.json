Biocompatible and biodegradable polymer nanofiber devices are currently fabricated using sophisticated engineering techniques. Such nanofiber structures have proven efficacious for the localized delivery of therapeutic agents for the treatment of wounds due to their unique physical-chemical properties such as large surface-area-to-volume ratio, high porosity, improved cell adherence, cellular proliferation and migration, as well as controlled in vivo biodegradation rates. The remit of this communication is to highlight the methodology used for the fabrication of nanofiber mats and dressings for the localised delivery of herbal products and plant-derived ingredients for wound healing.", "sitename": "AIMS Materials Science", "date": "2016-11-14", "cleaned_text": "| [1] || Chirayil C, Mathew L, Thomas S (2014) Review of recent research in nano cellulose preparation from different lignocellulosic fibers.
