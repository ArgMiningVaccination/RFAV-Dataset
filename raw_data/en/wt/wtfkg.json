More recently, supporters have introduced goji berries to the rest of the world with claims of many potential health benefits. Modern science is investigating these claims, and researchers have backed many of them. Here are seven possible benefits of the goji berry with the scientific evidence supporting them: 1. Protects the eyes Goji berries are believed to protect against age-related eye diseases. Goji berries can help vision because they contain high levels of healthy [antioxidants](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506.php), especially zeaxanthin. The same antioxidants can also stop damage from: - UV light - free radicals - oxidative [stress](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/145855.php). [One study](https://journals.lww.com/optvissci/Pages/ArticleViewer.aspx?year=2011&issue=02000&article=00012&type=Fulltext) reported in the American Academy of Optometry's journal Optometry and Vision Science found that seniors who drank goji berry juice for 90 days increased zeaxanthin and other antioxidant levels significantly. A second study reported in the journal Drug Design, Development and Therapy shows goji berries protect the retina from the [ganglion cells responsible for glaucoma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552899) 2. Provides immune system support Goji berries contain healthy antioxidants. [Antioxidants](http://immunopathol.com/PDF/ipp-1-e02.pdf?t=636686403740307537) are known for their immune-boosting qualities and their ability to fight harmful free radicals and [inflammation](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248423.php). Goji berries contain large amounts of [vitamins](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/195878.php) A and C, similarly to other berries, including [blueberries](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287710.php) and raspberries. Vitamins A and C are vital for building immunity and preventing illnesses, ranging from the common cold to [cancer](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/cancer-oncology/). 3. Protects against cancer High levels of antioxidants, including [vitamin C](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325067), zeaxanthin, and carotenoids, are responsible for fighting cancer cells. Antioxidants slow [tumor](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/249141.php) growth, reduce inflammation, and help to remove harmful substances from the body. [Research on mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552899) 4. Promotes healthy skin Goji berries contain [beta-carotene](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/252758.php), which is an essential plant phytochemical. Beta-carotene is known for its ability to promote healthy skin. Beta-carotene is an ingredient used in skin creams to: - improve skin health - reduce skin irritation - manage the effects of the sun - manage the impact of aging One [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20354657) 5. Stabilizes blood sugar Goji berries may be helpful in controlling the release of sugar into the blood. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4475782/) [insulin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/whatisinsulin.php) and glucose levels in the blood. The same study linked goji berries to [increased HDL levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4475782/) [type 2 diabetes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/type2diabetes.php). HDL is known as good [cholesterol](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/9152.php). 6. Improves depression, anxiety, and sleep Research from 2016 that was done using rats shows goji berries can improve [depression and anxiety-like behaviors](http://dergipark.gov.tr/download/article-file/413046). [Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18447631) In this study, healthy adult participants consumed 120 milliliters of goji berry juice daily or a [placebo](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/306437.php) drink for 14 days. They completed questionnaires to record their feelings of wellbeing, neurological and psychological health, musculoskeletal symptoms, and digestive and cardiovascular complaints, as well as any adverse effects of the juice each day. The researchers took measurements to record each participant's [blood pressure](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270644.php), body mass, weight, [pulse](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/258118.php), and vision before and after the 14 days of study. The group given the goji berry juice reported improved energy, ability to focus, enhanced athletic performance, mental acuity, and feelings of calmness and contentment by day 15. The study also showed improved quality of sleep in those who consumed the goji berry juice, and none experienced negative effects related to drinking the juice. 7. Prevents liver damage Goji berries have been used to treat liver disease in traditional Chinese medicine. [Research on animal models](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277126/) [Research on human liver cancer cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277126/) Goji berries are often called a superfood because they contain chemical compounds called phytochemicals that are produced by plants. Phytochemicals in goji berries include polysaccharides, beta-carotene, and zeaxanthin. Polysaccharides are a primary characteristic of the goji berry. These are an essential source of dietary fiber. A study using aging mice found that [polysaccharides in goji berries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874106006775) helped with improving immune function and increasing total antioxidant activity in the body. Beta-carotene is responsible for the orange-red color pigment in goji berries. Beta-carotene is vital for eye health, bone health, skin health, and cell development. The amount of beta-carotene in goji berries is among the [highest of all edible plants](http://www.chalcogen.ro/523_Bunghez.pdf). Zeaxanthin plays a crucial role in supporting the immune system. Many researchers believe that [zeaxanthin can prevent macular degeneration](http://www.chalcogen.ro/523_Bunghez.pdf), a progressive vision impairment that occurs when the central part of the retina, or macula, deteriorates.
