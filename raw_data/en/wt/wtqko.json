Patients are administered potentized individual substances - selected in accordance with the totality of characteristic symptoms - with a view to stimulating and supporting the organism's natural capacity to heal itself. The choice of individual homeopathic medication is informed by the law of similars. Once any remediable cause has been dealt with, the residual symptoms - i.e. any deviations from the healthy state as perceived by the actual patient or as perceived and observed by those around them and their doctor - are the expression of a disruption and weakening of the so-called life force. These symptoms are referred to as the totality of characteristic symptoms for a patient. Not only do these symptoms encompass the disease/diagnosis as per the criteria used in conventional medicine, they also encompass the various changes occurring at a physical, psychological and emotional level. According to the law of similars, the patient should be given the homeopathic medication that best reflects their state at the time. Classical homeopathy predominantly uses individual substances. Mixed preparations consisting of various individual substances (complex substances) are not really used. 1 Hahnemann S.: Organon 6 der Heilkunst [Organon 6 of the Art of Healing].
