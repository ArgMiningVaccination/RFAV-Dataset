Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and f air presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ; this includes the design, implementation, and mainten ance of internal control relevant to the preparatio n and fair presentation of consolidated financial sta tements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on thes e consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with a uditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to f inancial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United St ates. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assuran ce about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain a udit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedure s selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material m isstatement of the consolidated financial statement s, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair prese ntation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's int ernal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriatene ss of accounting policies used and the reasonablene ss of significant accounting estimates made by managem ent, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis f or our audit opinion. 18/310 - 2 - Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statement s referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Foundation as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for th e years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of Ameri ca. Other Matters Supplementary Information Our audits were conducted for the purpose of formin g an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The supplementary information included in the consolidated schedule of expenses on page 30 is presented for purposes of additional a nalysis and is not a required part of the consolida ted financial statements. Such information is the respon sibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and o ther records used to prepare the consolidated finan cial statements. The information has been subjected to th e auditing procedures applied in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and certain addit ional procedures, including comparing and reconcilin g such information directly to the underlying account ing and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselve s, and other additional procedures in accordance wit h auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information i s fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the co nsolidated financial statements as a whole. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated October 21, 2016, on our consideration of the Foundation's inter nal control over financial reporting and on our tes ts of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, r egulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe t he scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on com pliance.

AN D SUBSIDIARIES (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 7 - (1) Nature of Organization and Significant Accounting Polic ies: (a) Organization and purpose --Florida International University Foundation, Inc. (the \"Foundation\" or the \"Organization\"), a direct suppor t organization (\"DSO\") and a component unit of Florida International University (the \"Universit y\"), is organized to encourage, solicit, receive and administer gifts and bequests of property and f unds for the advancement the University and its objectives. The Foundation is a tax-exempt organiza tion as defined by Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Wolfsonian, Inc. was established in 1986 to crea te and operate a museum and research center in Miami Beach, Florida, and to support a comprehens ive program focused on the collection, exhibition, interpretation, preservation, research and publication of the decorative, design and architectural arts. The Mitchell Wolfson, Jr. Collect ion of nearly 27,000 objects of art and rare books dating from the late nineteenth to the mid-tw entieth century has been loaned to the Wolfsonian, Inc. It encompasses furniture, sculptures , paintings, books, graphics and other works of art on paper, as well as archives relating to the period. Through a series of academic study and fellowship programs, national and international trav eling exhibitions, and scholarly initiatives, the Wolfsonian, Inc. promotes public education and awaren ess of the social, historical, technological, political, economic, and artistic material culture of Europe and America in the 1885-1945 periods. The Wolfsonian, Inc. is a tax-exempt organization as defined by Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. As more fully explained in Note 2, the Foundation wa s party to the gift agreement (the \"Agreement\") on July 1, 1997 with the Wolfsonian, Inc ., whereby the Wolfsonian, Inc. agreed to amend its articles of incorporation and bylaws with the intent of transferring control of the Wolfsonian, Inc., all of its assets, interest, and obligation s, to the Foundation. Foundation Enterprise Holdings I, LLC (\"FEH I\") is a Florida limited liability company of which the sole member is the FIU Foundation, Inc. On March 29, 2011, the FEH I became the owner of real property located at 1035 and 1049 Washington A venue, Miami Beach, Florida (\"Property\"), pursuant to an agreement with Mitchell Wolfson, Jr. and the Washington Storage Co. (\"WSC\") to convey Property to the FEH I for the benefit of the Wolfsonian-FIU. As part of the agreement with the WSC, the FEH I executed an Assignment and Assump tion of Leases on March 29, 2011, and assumed all of the rights formerly held by WSC with regard to its lease agreements. Foundation Enterprise Holdings II, LLC (\"FEH II\") is a Florida limited liability company of which the sole member is the FIU Foundation, Inc. On Decem ber 10, 2012, FEH II became the owner of real property located at 301, 311, and 321 Washington Avenue, Miami Beach, Florida (\"JMOF Property\"), pursuant to an agreement with the Jewish Museum of Florida, Inc. (\"JMOF\") and the University as explained in Note 2. Foundation Enterprise Holdings III, LLC (\"FEH III\") is a Florida limited liability company of which the sole member is the FIU Foundation, Inc. On June 14, 2013, FEH III was organized pursuant to a gift agreement with Mitchell Wolfson, Jr. which transferred the gift of real property located at 100 East Flagler Street (Floors 2, 8, and 9), Miami, Florida, for the benefit of the Wolfsonian-FIU. See Note 1(u) describing agreement e ntered into after year end to sell the property. 25/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION, INC. AN D SUBSIDIARIES (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 8 - (1) Nature of Organization and Significant Accounting Polic ies: (Continued) Foundation Enterprise Holdings IV, LLC (\"FEH IV\") is a Florida limited liability company of which the sole member is the FIU Foundation, Inc. On February 25, 2014, FEH IV purchased real property (\"Islamorada Property\") located at 85932 O verseas Highway, for the purpose of leasing to the University's College of Arts and Sciences to se rve as the staging area for the Aquarius Reef Base, an undersea research laboratory. A donor pledge d a gift to be paid in five annual installments to support the acquisition of this property. FEH I, FEH II, FEH III and FEH IV have not elected un der Section 301.8801-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations to be classified as separate corpor ations or entities from its single member (the Foundation) for federal tax purposes. FEH I, FEH II , FEH III and FEH IV are treated, therefore, as \"disregarded entities\" for federal tax purposes und er the Income Tax Regulations and are simply components or divisions of its single member for federal tax purposes. (b) Principles of consolidation --The consolidated financial statements of the Foun dation and its subsidiaries for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2 015, include the accounts of the Foundation, Wolfsonian, Inc., FEH I, FEH II, FEH III, and FEH IV, bas ed on the Foundation's controlling economic interest in the five entities. The Foundat ion's controlling economic interest in the Wolfsonian, Inc. was the result of the gift agreement between the two entities, which became effective on March 26, 1998 (see Note 2). The Foundation's controlling economic interest in F EH I was the result of a split interest agreement for the acquisition of a commercial real estate propert y on March 29, 2011. The Foundation's controlling economic interest in F EH II was the result of a gift agreement for the acquisition of museum property and its financial assets a nd obligations on December 10, 2012. The Foundation's controlling economic interest in F EH III was the result of a gift agreement for the acquisition of real property which was finalized on July 1 , 2013. The Foundation's controlling economic interest in F EH IV was the result of a purchase of real property on February 25, 2014. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. (c) Basis of presentation --Financial statement presentation follows the requ irements of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 958, Not- for-Profit Entities. Under ASC 958, the Foundation is required to report information regard ing its consolidated financial position and activities according to three classes of net assets : unrestricted net assets, temporarily restricted ne t assets, and permanently restricted net assets. Assets are presented according to their nearness of conversion to cash. Liabilities are presented accor ding to the nearness of their maturity and resulting use of cash. (d) Basis of accounting --The consolidated financial statements of the Foun dation have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting and acc ordingly reflect all significant receivables, payables and other liabilities. 26/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION, INC. AN D SUBSIDIARIES (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 9 - (1) Nature of Organization and Significant Accounting Polic ies: (Continued) Revenue, expenses, gains and losses are classified ba sed on the existence or absence of donor- imposed restrictions. Accordingly, the net assets an d changes therein are classified and reported as follows: (i) Unrestricted \u2014Net assets which are free of donor-imposed restric tions; all revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that are not changes in p ermanently or temporarily restricted net assets are classified as unrestricted. (ii) Temporarily restricted \u2014Net assets whose use is limited by donor-imposed s tipulations that either expire by passage of time or that can b e fulfilled or removed by actions of the Foundation pursuant to those stipulations. (iii) Permanently restricted \u2014Net assets whose use is limited by donor-imposed s tipulations that neither expire with the passage of time nor ca n be fulfilled or otherwise removed by actions of the Foundation. (e) Use of estimates --The consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that aff ect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financ ial statements and revenue and expenses during the perio d reported. These estimates include assessing the collectability of contributions receivable and the fair value of investments. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effec ts of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determi ned to be necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (f) Cash equivalents --The Foundation considers all highly liquid invest ments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents . (g) Promises to give --Contributions are recognized when the donor makes a promise to give to the Organization that is, in substance, unconditional . Contributions that are restricted by the donor are reported as increases in unrestricted net asset s if the restrictions expire in the year in which t he contributions are recognized. All other donor-restr icted contributions are reported as increases in temporarily or permanently restricted net assets dependin g on the nature of the restrictions. When a restriction expires, temporarily restricted net assets ar e transferred to unrestricted net assets. The Organization records unconditional promises to give at fair value when received and subsequently at net realizable value which is based on prior years' collection experience and management's analysis of specific promises made. Th e receivables are further discounted to reflect their present value. The Foundation determines an a llowance for uncollectible receivables based upon management's judgment about such factors as pr ior collection history, type of contribution, and nature of fundraising activity. Decreases in ne t realizable value are recognized as provision for uncollectable pledges in the period the decrease oc curs. Increases in net realizable value are not recognized unless they represent recoveries of prev ious provision for uncollectable pledges incurred; increases are recognized as additional co ntribution revenue when the promise to give is collected. 27/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION, INC. AN D SUBSIDIARIES (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 10 - (1) Nature of Organization and Significant Accounting Polic ies: (Continued) (h) Contributions --Contributed goods and services are recorded as co ntributions at their estimated fair value at date of receipt. (i) Contributed services \u2014Donations of contributed services are recognized a s contributions at their estimated fair value, if the services (a) cre ate or enhance non-financial assets or (b) require specialized skills, are performed by people with th ose skills, and would otherwise be purchased by the Foundation. Services provided by volunteers thr oughout the year are not recognized as contributions in the consolidated financial stateme nts since these services are not susceptible to objective measurement or valuation. The consolidated statements of activities include s ervices received from University personnel and these services are measured at the cost recognized by the University. Refer to recent accounting pronouncements described in this note for further i nformation. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the contributed services total $897,826 and $89 9,905, respectively. (j) Investments and investment income --Investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values and all investments in deb t securities are measured at fair value (see note below) in the consolidated statements of financial position. Investment gains and losses (including realized and unrealized gains and losses on investm ents as well as interest income and dividends) are included in the consolidated statements of acti vities as an increase or decrease in unrestricted net assets unless the gains or losses are restricte d by donor or law. Restricted gains and losses and investment income where the restrictions are met in the same reporting period as the income is earned are recorded as unrestricted support. (k) Fair value measurements --ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value as the price that would be received to s ell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires financial sta tement preparers to disclose information about their fair value determinations in their financial statements. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier hierarchy to maximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs, and to establish classification of fair valu e measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market partic ipants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be obse rvable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market particip ants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from source s independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the rep orting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricin g the asset or liability developed based on the best available information. See Note 5 for a summary of the inputs used as of J une 30, 2016 and 2015, in determining the fair value of the Foundation's investments. (l) Property and equipment --Property and equipment are defined as assets with an initial individual cost of more than $1,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of 5 years and are recorded at historical cost. If contributed, the ass et, with the exception of the collection of decorative and propaganda arts, is recorded at the f air value at the time of donation. If donors stipulate how long the assets must be used, the cont ributions are recorded as restricted support. In 28/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION, INC. AN D SUBSIDIARIES (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 11 - (1) Nature of Organization and Significant Accounting Polic ies: (Continued) the absence of such stipulations, contributions are recorded as unrestricted support. Additions, improvements, and other outlays that significantly e xtend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Other costs incurred for repairs and maintenance are expen sed as incurred. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated u seful lives of the assets, ranging from five to forty years. The Foundation has elected to exercise the option o f not capitalizing the items that meet the definition of \"collections\" as prescribed by accoun ting principles generally accepted in the United States. Therefore, the fair value of the donated coll ection of decorative and propaganda arts are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financia l statements. Purchases of collection items are recorded as decreases in unrestricted net assets in the year in which the items are acquired or as temporarily or permanently restricted net assets if the assets used to purchase the items are restricted by donors. Proceeds from deaccessions or insurance recoveries are reflected as increases in the appropriate net asset classes. (m) Deferred revenue --Deferred revenue is comprised of advanced licensi ng and royalty fees. In July 2015, Bank of America waived its right to recei ve the unearned portion of advances at the expiration of the agreement ending December 31, 2015 . As a result, the Foundation recognized revenue related to the advanced licensing and royal ty fees during the fiscal year in the amount of $1,478,584. During the fiscal year, a balance was added for def erred revenue related to unearned contributions. The Foundation entered into a challenge gift agreem ent to receive matching contributions up to $1 million for the benefit of a Chair of Transition St udies in the Vaclav Havel Center for Human Rights and Diplomacy. The donor made an initial adva nce of its matching funding payments to the Foundation in June 2016 in the amount of $250,000. O nce the required matching donations are received, the Foundation will recognize contribution reve nue. (n) Split-interest obligations --The Foundation received a contribution of propert y in which the donor retains a life interest. The asset is a comme rcial real estate property and annual cash distributions are made to the donor under the terms of the agreement. The Foundation recorded the Property based on the fair value of the asset recei ved. Initial recognition and subsequent adjustments to the asset carrying values are report ed as a change in value of split-interest obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial s tatements. Obligations under split-interest agreements are rec orded when incurred at the present value of the anticipated distributions to be made to the donor d esignated beneficiaries. Distributions are paid over the lives of the beneficiaries. Present values are determined using appropriate discount rates and actuarially determined life expectancies. Oblig ations under split-interest agreements are revalued annually at June 30 to reflect actuarial e xperience; the discount rate is not changed. Any resulting difference between the asset and liabilit y is recognized annually as revenue. The net revaluations together with any remaining recorded o bligation after all trust or gift obligations under terminated agreements have been satisfied, are recor ded as net changes in the value of split-interest obligations. 29/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION, INC. AN D SUBSIDIARIES (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 12 - (1) Nature of Organization and Significant Accounting Polic ies: (Continued) (o) Funds held for others --In March 2016, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a grant in the amount of $9,500,000 to the University , with annual increments in the amount of $1,900,000 payable over five years in support of re search in the area of minority health and health disparities. Pursuant to the terms of the grant, th e NIH requires that the funds be held as an endowment for a period of at least 20 years. There after, the funds may be used to support this research initiative. The University transferred th e first installment of $1,900,000 in June of 2016 t o the Foundation to be held as a term endowment. The endowmen t will be managed consistent with the Foundation's policies and procedures. In addition, the b alance also includes funds deposited with the Foundation for management on behalf of a family fou ndation in the amount of $62,240 and $12,190 as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (p) Program services --Program services expenses on the consolidated sta tements of activities include amounts transferred to related parties or a mounts disbursed directly to third parties to benefit the University or its DSO's. These expenses include salaries, scholarships, and other program related expenses. (q) Income taxes --The Foundation is exempt from income taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The subsidiaries are Limited Liability Companies which are wholly owned by the Foundation and therefore are disregarded for tax purposes. However, the Foundation is subject to income tax on unrelated business income. The Foundation's primary source of unrelated business income is from certain investments in priv ate equity partnerships. Income taxes incurred during the year, if any, are estimated to be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting principles generally accepted in the Uni ted States of America require management to evaluate tax positions taken and recognize a tax li ability (or asset) if the organization has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Management has analyzed the tax positio ns taken and has concluded that as of June 30, 2016, there are no uncertain positions taken or expe cted to be taken that would require recognition of a liability (or asset) or disclosure in the cons olidated financial statements. If the Foundation were to incur an income tax liability in the future , interest and penalties would be reported as income taxes. The Foundation is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in prog ress. Management believes the Foundation is no longer subject to income tax examinations from years prio r to 2013. (r) Concentrations of credit risk --Financial instruments that potentially subject th e Foundation to concentrations of credit risk consist principall y of cash and cash equivalents in banks, investments, and promises to give. In addition to insurance provided by the Federal De pository Insurance Corporation (FDIC), all deposits are held in banking institutions approved by the State Treasurer of the State of Florida to hold public funds. Under Florida Statutes Chapter 2 80, Florida Security for Public Deposits Act, the State Treasurer requires all Florida qualified p ublic depositories to deposit with the Treasurer or another banking institution eligible collateral. In the event of a failure of a qualified public depository, the remaining public depositories would be responsible for covering any resulting losses. Accordingly, all amounts reported as deposit s, with the exception noted in the preceding paragraph, are insured or collateralized with securi ties held by the entity or its agent in the entity' s name. 30/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION, INC. AN D SUBSIDIARIES (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 13 - (1) Nature of Organization and Significant Accounting Polic ies: (Continued) The Foundation maintains certain investment account s with financial institutions which are not insured by the FDIC. These funds may be subject to insurance by Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), subject to various limitations. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately $228,600,000 and $230,500,000 was held in these account s, respectively. The Foundation believes that the number, diversity and financial strength of the issuers mitigate the credit risks associated with all investments. (s) Recent accounting pronouncements --In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-14, \"Presentation of Financial Statements of Not-for-Pr ofit Entities.\" The ASU is effective for Foundation's fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. ASU 2016-14 aims to improve not-for-profit entity financial sta tements to provide more useful information to donors, grantors, creditors, and other financial state ment users. The standard significantly changes how net assets will be presented on the face of the financial statements, as well as requires additional disclosures for expenses by nature and f unction and for the liquidity and availability of resources. Management is still evaluating the impac t of this pronouncement on the Foundation's financial statements.

AN D SUBSIDIARIES (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 16 - (5) Fair Value Measurements : Accounting Standards Codification No. 820 (ASC 820), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , establishes a framework for determining fair value through a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs in valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Th e three-level valuation hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for ide ntical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowe st priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A finan cial instrument's categorization within the valuati on hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is s ignificant to the fair value measurement. The inputs are summarized in the three-level valuation hie rarchy as follows: Level 1 - Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices fo r identical assets or liabilities in active markets (e.g., exchange traded securities). An active m arket is defined as a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 - Valuation is based on significant observable inpu ts, either directly or indirectly, at the measurement date such as: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in a ctive markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities i n markets that are not active; (iii) observable inputs, other than quoted prices, fo r similar or identical assets and liabilities; or (iv) inputs that are derived from or corroborated b y observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 - Valuation is based on unobservable inputs for an asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that o bservable inputs are not available. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, t hat is, an exit price from the perspective of a market participant. Therefore, unobservable inputs r eflect the Investment Manager's own assumptions about the assumptions that market parti cipants would use in valuing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Unobserv able inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which mi ght include the Investment Manager's own data. The Investment Manager's own data used to deve lop unobservable inputs are adjusted if information is reasonably available without undue c ost and effort that indicates market participants would use different assumptions. Investment types wh ich have been valued using this approach generally include investments in investee funds that hav e lock-ups that are greater than 12 months. Equity investments that are listed on national secu rities exchanges, quoted on NASDAQ or on the over- the-counter market are valued at the last reported sale price, or in the absence of a recorded sale, at a value between the most recent bid and asked prices. Mutual funds held by the Foundation which are deemed to be actively traded, are valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value (NA V) and to transact at that price. Fixed income secur ities are valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities. This includes basing value on yield currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar cr edit ratings. Alternative investments for which quoted ma rket prices are not available include hedge funds a nd private investments. The estimated fair value of alt ernative investments is based on the net asset valu e of the fund or other valuation methods. The Foundation reviews and evaluates the values and assesses the valuation methods and assumptions used in determini ng the fair value of the alternative investments. Because alternative investments are not readily mar ketable, their estimated value is subject to uncert ainty and therefore may differ from the value that would have been used had a readily available market for such investments existed and differences could be material. 34/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION, INC.

The bond proceeds were used to acquire, construct and equip the multi- function support complex located on the University campus in Miami-Dade County and to pay issuance cost s. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding principal balance due under this note payable amoun ted to $5,420,000 and $6,165,000, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, total interes t incurred and paid was $101,667 and $208,532, respectively. On December 1, 1999, the Foundation entered into a le tter of credit agreement with a commercial bank that permitted the Foundation to borrow up to $13,00 0,000 through December 15, 2004, bearing interest at the prime rate plus 2 percent. On November 29, 2 004, this agreement was extended, with the same terms and conditions, through December 15, 2009. There were two additional extensions subsequent to that date through July 30, 2010. The Foundation must pay an annual commitment fee of 0.45 percent on the unused portion of the commitment. Borrowings un der the financing agreement mature 90 days after the date of the borrowing. Under the letter of credit agreement and loan agree ment noted above, the Foundation is obligated under certain debt covenants with which they are in compliance. The bonds were repurchased by the Trustee under the SunTrust Bank letter of credit due to the diminishing ability to remarket the variable rate d emand bonds in the public marketplace. On July 30, 2010, the commercial bank converted the variable rat e demand bonds into a five year tax exempt qualified loan. After the initial 5 year period, th e bank would have the right to require the Foundati on to refinance the bank qualified loan or could agree to extend the maturity date for an additional five ye ar period. The Foundation agrees to pay interest at a rate of 67% of one month LIBOR plus 1.68% (4.67% at June 30, 2016). The bond maturity date of May 1, 20 22 remains unchanged. The Foundation paid $52,213 in refinancing fees to complete this transac tion. Since the terms remained substantially the sa me and the present value of the cash outflows is not subs tantially different, this is not considered an exchange of debt instruments and therefore, all remains unchanged.

AN D SUBSIDIARIES (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 27 - (15) Endowments: The Foundation's endowment consists of funds establ ished for a variety of purposes. Its endowment includes donor-restricted endowment funds. As requi red by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, net assets associated with endowment funds are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restri ctions. Interpretation of Relevant Law The Board of Directors of the endowment has interpr eted the Florida Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act as requiring the preservati on of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment funds absent expl icit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a resul t of this interpretation, the Foundation classifies as pe rmanently restricted net assets (a) the original va lue of gifts donated to the permanent endowment and (b) th e original value of subsequent gifts to the permane nt endowment. As of June 30, 2016, endowment net assets consisted of the f ollowing: Temporarily Restricted* Permanently Restricted Total Endowment net assets, July 1, 2015 $ 24,545,818 $ 206,408,578 $ 230,954,396 Endowment investment return: Interest, dividends and realized gains 2,268,363 - 2,268,363 Unrealized gains (6,262,015) - (6,262,015) Total endowment investment returns (3,993,652) - (3,993,652) Contributions and other revenues 1,900,000 3,296,014 5,196 ,014 Appropriation of endowment assets for expenditure (6,856 ,170) - (6,856,170) Appropriation for administrative fee (2,314,825) - (2,314,825) Provision for uncollectible promises to give - (40,000) (40,000) Endowment net assets, June 30, 2016 $ 13,281,171 $ 209,664,592 $ 222,945,763 45/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION, INC.

Return Objectives and Risk Parameters The Foundation has adopted investment policies and spending polices for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment a ssets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor-rest ricted funds that the Foundation must hold in perpetuity or for donor-specified periods. Under th is policy, as approved by the Board of Directors, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce a long-term rate of return on assets while assuming a moderate level of invest ment risk. The Foundation expects its endowment funds, over time to achieve, at a minimum, a real (inflation adjusted) total return, net of investment management fees, that is consistent with spend ing requirements. Strategies Employed for Achieving Objectives To satisfy its long-term rate-of-return objectives, the Foundation relies on a total return strategy i n which investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and dividends). The Fou ndation targets a diversified asset allocation that places a greater emphasis on equity-based investmen ts to achieve its long-term return objectives within prudent risk constraints. 46/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION, INC. AN D SUBSIDIARIES (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 29 - (15) Endowments: (Continued) Spending Policy and How the Investment Objectives Rela te to Spending Policy The Foundation's spending policy states that the Fi nance and Audit Committee will recommend, subject to approval by the Board of Directors, the a nnual spending distribution to be made to endowed accounts. In June 2015, the Board approved a resolution to determine the spending distribution as a percentage of the endowment's ave rage market value (gift corpus plus undistributed investment earnings since inceptions) over twelve consecutive quarters ending on December 31 and distributed at the close of the Foun dation's fiscal year. In prior years, the spending distribution was determined as a percentag e of the endowment's average yearly market value. Spending distributions are dependent on the Foundat ion's investment returns and are therefore not guaranteed. If in any given year investment losses reduce the endowment's market value below original corpus, future spending distributions are c ontingent on first restoring the endowment to its original corpus, before any distribution is made for spending. This is consistent with the Foundation's objective to maintain the purchasing power o f the endowment assets held in perpetuity or for a specified term as well as to provide addition al real growth through new gifts and investment return. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the amount incl uded in the endowment's temporarily restricted balance and approved for future spending on program services was $6,856,171 and $6,390,843, respectively. 47/310 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 48/310 Project Name Program Services General and Administrative Fundraising 2016 2015 Academic Affairs 1,683,783 $ - $ 17,327 $ 1,701,110 $ 1,803,639 $ Administrative Reserve - 67,067 67,067 53,664 Advancement operations - - 896,785 Golden Banking fees office operations - 399,346 463,133 Capital Campaign - - 5,670,752 5,670,752 3,847,611 College of Communication, Architecture & the Arts 980,1 53 - - 980,153 749,473 College of Arts, Sciences & Education 1,655,377 - - 1,655,377 1,460,608 College of Business Administration 1,665,801 - 79,340 1,745,141 2,091,911 College of Engineering & Computing 1,246,931 - - 1,246,931 1,061,271 College of Law 996,125 - of Medicine 3,839,711 - 229,176 4,068,887 2,807,316 College of Nursing & Health Sciences 900,846 - - 900,846 621,110 Contributions to University Building Program 927,746 - - 927,746 2,384,638 Depreciation & amortization - 747,892 - 747,892 677,202 Division of Research 346,723 - 26,448 of Governor's assessment - 36,165 - 36,165 36,254 Foundation Enterprise Holdings I, LLC - 146,329 - 146,329 146,647 Foundation Enterprise Holdings II, LLC - 54,261 - 54,261 55,341 Foundation Enterprise Holdings III, LLC - 171,309 - 171,309 164,488 Foundation Enterprise Holdings IV, LLC - 20,431 - 20,431 26,759 Frost Art Museum 346,651 - 261,825 General Reserve - 22,070 - 22,070 46,179 Green School of International & Public Affairs 599,132 - - 599,132 - Honors College 89,028 - - 89,028 77,734 Human Resources 18,197 Interest consultant - 572,658 - of Engagement 77,380 - 334,646 - 334,646 961,926 School of Computing & Information Sciences 342,498 - - 342,498 219,377 School of Hospitality Management 991,754 - - 991,754 School of Public Health - 25,973 Student Access and Success 598,357 413,118 Student Affairs 97,594 - 85,953 94,289 - 93,934 University College 40,767 - - 40,767 2,206 University Support - 25,000 - 25,000 276,392 University Wide Scholarships and Programs 1,500,067 897,826 - 2,397,893 Utilities $ 4,812,526 $ 7,116,332 $ 33,041,302 $ 29,955,774 $ FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION, INC.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the consoli dated financial statements, we considered the Foundation's internal control over financial report ing (internal control) to determine the audit proce dures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the p urpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Foundation's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an o pinion on the effectiveness of the Foundation's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control d oes not allow management or employees in the normal course of per forming their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material missta tement of the entity's financial statements will not be pr evented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis . A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enoug h to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over financia l reporting was for the limited purpose described in th e first paragraph of this section and was not designe d to identify all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weakness es or significant deficiencies. Given these limitati ons, during our audit, we did not identify any deficienci es in internal control that we consider to be mater ial weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that hav e not been identified. 51/310 - 32 - Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whe ther the Foundation's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of it s compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompl iance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objecti ve of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's int ernal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and complianc e. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. Gainesville, Florida October 21, 2016 This page intentionally left blank 52/3105.2.2 B. FIU Research Foundation, Inc.

(the Research Foundation), a direct support organization and component unit of Florida International University, as of and for the years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Research Foundation's basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements The Research Foundation's management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 56/310 - 2 - Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the Research Foundation as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, and the respective changes in financial position and its cash flows thereof for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Matters Required Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's discussion and analysis on pages 3 - 8 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. Blended Component Unit The financial statements of the Florida International Research iWASH Initiative Limited (iWASH) are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and its interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). iWASH is a blended component unit, is presented in the Research Foundation's financial statements, and has a December 31st year-end. iWASH is audited by other independent auditors. Since the iWASH year end and presentation is not compatible with the Research Foundation's presentation as it is presented under the international accounting standards and not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, the financial statements and notes related to iWASH are presented on separate pages 15 - 30 along with the respective Report of the Independent Auditors. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated October 20, 2016, on our consideration of the Research Foundation's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements, and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Research Foundation's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

BLENDED COMPONENT UNIT Florida International Research iWASH Initiative Lim ited Florida International Research iWASH Initiative Lim ited was incorporated under the Tanzania Companies Act of 2002 on February 22, 2010. The co mpany, Florida International Research iWASH Initiative Limited, is a \"not for profit company.\" In January 2010, Florida International University r eceived a cooperative agreement funding award to support the Tanzania Integrated Water, Sanitation a nd Hygiene Program (iWASH). The company was established in Tanzania by the Florida Internationa l University Research Foundation, Inc. in order to implement the iWASH program in Tanzania. The fundi ng is obligated under the USAID Strategic Assistance Objective #13 \"Biodiversity Conserved in Targeted Landscapes through Livelihood Driven Approaches,\" and is under the bilateral Economic an d Technical Cooperation Agreement signed between the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania a nd the Government of the United States of America. Current funding is for the period January 1, 2010 through February 29, 2016. The company has a December 31 year end. For additional informa tion on this component unit, see the blended component unit section in Note 1 of the financial s tatements on page 12. 62/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATIO N, INC. (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (Continued) - 7 - In January 2014, USAID granted the Program a two-ye ar 'with cost extension' to February 2016, so activities in early 2015 had to gear up quickly. Ov erall, the iWASH Program progressed well during the period from January to December 2015. Our partners Winrock International, and local partners SAWA and SEMA and IDYDC in Iringa continued to work to improve water supply to the co mmunities. As a result of the activities carried ou t during this period, the iWASH program provided wate r supply to serve 61,335 people. Moreover, the intervention of the program increased 1,758 househo lds capacity to adapt to climate variability and change. In addition, 5,651 people in program targe t area gained access to improved sanitation facilit ies. The iWASH Program support to increase the instituti onal capacity to sustainably manage water resources has taken many forms, including the formation of fo ur Water User Associations (WUAs), and extended training to 6 other WUAs in the Basin. Also, 8,794 people received training in natural resources and w ater resources management related activities. The goal of Tanzania iWASH Program is to support su stainable, market-driven water supply, sanitation, and hygiene services to improve health and increase economic resiliency of the poor in targeted rural areas and small towns within an integrated water re source management framework. The period from January to March 2010 was the \"set up phase\", during which the company was established. The iWASH Office in Morogoro was esta blished in April 2010. The full activities of the program commenced in July 2010 and ended on Februar y 29, 2016 . During this term, the key achievements of the iWASH Program included: Over 200,000 people obtained improved access to water for drinking and productive purposes through new or rehabilitated wells, gravity schemes , or deep borehole schemes. This was achieved through implementation of a 'demand driven approach' working with a network of likeminded local implementing partners. At least 3700 household benefited from the prod uctive use of water, increasing their economic or livelihood resilience to climate variability. This was achieved through implementation of the 'Multiple Use Services' (MUS) approach. Over 250,000 people were sensitized on sanitati on and hygiene, and more than 28,000 school children and their teachers gained access to improv ed sanitation, and at least 11,400 people gained access to improved household sanitation thro ugh ~ 2,280 new or improved household latrines. Nearly 100 small-scale private sector WASH prov iders received training through iWASH and the implementing partners and are actively providing WA SH products and services on a commercial basis (including Rope Pumps and hand drilling servi ces). Over 1000 people in basins, local government, a nd communities have been trained on water resources management (WRM) and 30 professionals wer e supported to obtain Master's degrees in WRM related subjects. Also, a diverse range of rese arch and studies have increased understanding of water resources within the Wami Ru vu Basin, and elsewhere. 63/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATIO N, INC.

The Research Foundation pro vides direct support to Florida International University in matters pertaining to research, and h as been designated by the FIU Board of Trustees as a University Direct Support Organization pursuan t to \u00a71004.28, Florida Statutes. The financial reporting entity covered by this repo rt includes the Organization and its component unit. The financial reporting entity covered by th is report has been defined by GASB as the Research Foundation and those component units for w hich the Research Foundation is financially accountable. Blended component units, although leg ally separate entities, are, in substance, part of the government's operations, and therefore, data fo r these units are generally combined with the data of the Organization. (b) Blended component unit --The Florida International Research iWASH Initiati ve Limited (iWASH) was incorporated in Tanzania on February 22 , 2010, under the Tanzania Companies Act of 2002. The entity is a not-for-profit company as defined by the laws in Tanzania. This entity was established for the sole purpose of serving as the legal entity to implement the development initiative known as Tanzania iWASH Program. The financial statements of iWASH presented are pre pared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and its interp retations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The iWASH board consists of two members, one of whom is authorized as the Research Foundation's representat ive at any meeting of the company and is entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of t he company as if it were an individual member present at the meeting including power to vote. iW ASH is fiscally dependent on the Research Foundation. Accordingly, iWASH is a blended compon ent unit and is presented in the Research Foundation's financial statements. iWASH has a Dec ember 31 year-end and it is presented under the international accounting standards. The Resear ch Foundation has a June 30 year-end and is presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Acc ounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States of America.

Complet e financial statements for iWASH can be obtained by writing to: Controller, Florida Intern ational University Research Foundation, Inc., 11200 S.W. 8 th Street, Miami, FL 33199. 69/310 FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATIO N, INC. (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: (Continued) - 13 - (c) Basis of presentation --The financial statements of the Research Foundati on have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles g enerally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) as applied to governmental units. T he Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the accepted standard-setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The Research Found ation reports under the GASB standards because it meets the criteria regarding the popular electio n of officers or appointment of a controlling majority of the members of the Organization's gover ning body by one or more state or local governments and because it is a direct support orga nization. Therefore, the Research Foundation is reported as a governmental entity. The Research Foundation met the criteria to use ent erprise fund accounting and financial reporting. Accordingly, the financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting, which recognizes r evenue when earned and expenses when a liability is incurred, regardless of timing of the related cash flow. (d) Use of estimates --The preparation of financial statements in confor mity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that a ffect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of current events and actions it may unde rtake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. (e) Flow assumption for restricted assets --If both restricted and unrestricted assets are av ailable for use for a certain purpose, it is the Research F oundation's policy to use restricted assets first, then use unrestricted assets as needed. (f) Operating revenues and expenses --The Research Foundation's statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position distinguishes between operating and nonoperating revenue and expenses. Operating revenue results from excha nge transactions associated in matters pertaining to research, which is the Research Found ation's principal activity. Other sources of revenue, including investment earnings, are reporte d as nonoperating revenue. Operating expenses include all expenses incurred in matters pertaining to research, other than external financing costs.

(A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: (Continued) - 14 - The application of GAAP requires management to eval uate tax positions taken and recognize a tax liability (or asset) if the organization has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not wou ld not be sustained upon examination by taxing authori ties. Management has analyzed the tax positions taken and has concluded that as of June 3 0, 2016, there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability (or asset) or disclosure in the financial statements. If the Organization were to incur an income tax liability in the future, intere st and penalties would be reported as income taxes. T he Organization is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress. The Research Foundation's income tax returns for the pa st three years are subject to examination by tax authorities, and may change upon examination. Man agement believes the Organization is no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to 2013. (h) Transfers --For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, trans fers from the University to support the operating expenses of the Research Foun dation totaled $27,658 and $123,000, respectively. (2) Deposits: In addition to insurance provided by the Federal De pository Insurance Corporation, all deposits, excep t for the bank account in Burkina Faso, West Africa a re held in banking institutions approved by the Sta te Treasurer of the State of Florida to hold public fu nds. Under Florida Statutes Chapter 280, Florida Security for Public Deposits Act, the State Treasur er requires all Florida qualified public depositori es to deposit with the Treasurer or another banking insti tution eligible collateral. In the event of a fail ure of a qualified public depository the remaining public de positories would be responsible for covering any resulting losses. Accordingly, all amounts reporte d as deposits, except for the bank account in Burki na Faso, West Africa are insured or collateralized.

These financial instruments arise directly from the Company's opera tions. The Company has not traded in financial instruments throughout the year ended December 31, 2015. The main risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are credit risks and market risk. The Company's management is responsible for the est ablishment and oversight of the Company's risk management framework. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as summarized below. LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will no t be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company's approach to managing liqui dity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its l iabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses o r risk damaging the Company's reputation. The Company monitors its exposure to liquidity risk using projected cash flows from operations. The Company's exposure to liquidity risk is conside red low due to existence of sufficient cash and bank balances. The Company has a policy not to utilize debt or ove rdraft facilities. MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk that changes in market pric es, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Company's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage an d control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return. The Company does not trade in financial markets and accordingly, there is no material exposure to market risk except as described below. I NTEREST RATE RISK The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in ma rket interest rates relates primarily to cash and bank balances. Bank account balances are monitored monthly, and kept at the lowest possible operations balance. A fluctuation of interest rate s due to the changes in economic conditions will not have a material impact on the financial positio n of the Company; therefore no sensitivity analysis has been presented. 87/310 - 30 - FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY iWASH INITIATIVE LIMITED (A COMPONENT UNIT) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 NOTE 9 - FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED ) C REDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Or ganization if a counterparty to a financial instrum ent fails to meet its contractual obligations, and aris es principally from the Organization's balances receivable and money maintained in bank accounts. There is no credit risk to the organization because there are no receivable balances. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Company is exposed to currency risk on bank bal ances which are denominated in foreign currency. The Company manages this risk by ensurin g that foreign currency bank balances are kept at the minimum amount possible. In the recent year s, due to the depreciation of the local currency, the Company has not experienced any adverse effect from its foreign currency denominated bank balances. FAIR VALUES The Company's financial instruments are cash and ca sh equivalents and other payables. These financial instruments realize over a short term res ulting in the financial instruments' carrying amounts reasonably approximating their fair values. NOTE 10 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS At the date of signing the financial statements, th e Company's Management is not aware of any other matter or circumstance arising since the date of the end of the reporting period, not otherwise dealt in these financial statements, which signific antly affected the financial position of the Company and results of its operations. NOTE 11 - CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS The Company's Management confirms that there were n o significant contingent liabilities as at the date of the end of the reporting period. Similarly , there were no significant commitments for operational or capital expenditure as at the same d ate. NOTE 12 - ULTIMATE HOLDING ENTITY The organization's ultimate holding entity is Flori da International University, an entity incorporated and registered in the United States. 88/310 REPORTING SECTION 89/310 - 31 - INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS Board of Directors Florida International University Research Foundation, Inc.: We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the Florida International University Research Foundation, Inc. (the Research Foundation), as of and for the years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Research Foundation's basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated October 20, 2016. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the Research Foundation's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Research Foundation's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Research Foundation's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 90/310 - 32 - Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Research Foundation's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. Gainesville, Florida October 20, 2016 91/3105.2.3 C.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements The Corporation's management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 95/310 - 2 - Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, and the changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Matters Required Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's discussion and analysis on pages 3 through 7 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated October 17, 2016, on our consideration of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Current assets mainly depict cash, cu rrent prepaid rent, and investments. The current a sset decrease is principally a result of decreased inves tments and receivables due to lower pledged revenue s in the current year.

Operating Expenses The Athletics Finance Corporation categorizes expen ses as operating or non-operating. GASB gives financial reporting entities the choice of reportin g operating expenses in the functional or natural classifications. 100/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (Continued) - 6 - The following summarizes the operating expenses by natural classifications for the fiscal years ended June 30: 2016 2015 2014 Amortization of prepaid rent 1,304,083 $ 1,304,083 $ 1,304,083 $ Gameday/Event day contractors $ 2,457,568 $ 2,287,002 $ Operating Expenses June 30, Operating expenses were $2,252,946 for the fiscal y ear ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of 8.3% over th e June 30, 2015 fiscal year.

The following summarizes the Athletics Finance Corporation's non-operating revenues and expenses f or the fiscal years ended June 30: 2016 2015 2014 Interest income 69,426 $ 1,295 $ 1,527 $ Interest expense and fiscal charges (1,340,192) (1,342,489) (1,579,690) Unrealized loss on investments - (33,606) Revenues (Expenses) (1,270,766) $ (1,374,800) $ (1,585,439) $ Non-operating Revenues (Expenses) June 30, Non-operating expenses were $1,270,766 for the fisc al year ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of approximately $104,000 over the June 30, 2015 fisca l year. 101/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (Continued) - 7 - TRANSFERS TO FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY Transfers to Florida International University repre sent $750,000 in the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The transfers were related to release of conference payments transferr ed back to Florida International University.

DEBT ADMINISTRATION As of June 30, 2016, the Athletics Finance Corporat ion had $30,718,607 in outstanding bonds payable, representing a decrease of approximately $697,000, or 2.2%, from fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Additional information about the Athletics Finance Corporation's bond payable is presented in note 4 t o the financial statements on page 16. ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT THE FUTURE The University has pledged a significant portion of game guarantee revenue and Conference USA distribution revenues to the Athletics Finance Corp oration. The Athletics Department, including the Football Pr ogram, joined Conference USA effective July 1, 2013. Since joining Conference USA, the conference' s television rights contract ended. Also, due to conference realignment and the loss of certain tele vision markets from the Conference, the new agreement is less favorable than the previous year' s agreement. This will result in lower conference revenues for the Athletics Department and in turn, the Athletics Finance Corporation.

FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 106/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 11 - (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: The following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies and practices of the FIU Athletics Finance Corporation (the Athletics Financ e Corporation or the Organization), which affect significant elements of the accompanying financial statements: (a) Reporting entity \u2014The Athletics Finance Corporation is a Florida not -for-profit corporation and a direct support organization and component uni t of Florida International University (FIU or the University) and was organized in the State of F lorida on November 20, 2006. The Athletics Finance Corporation is a tax-exempt o rganization as defined by Section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Athletics Finance C orporation provides direct support to FIU in matters pertaining to the financing of the FIU Foot ball Stadium and subsequently managing and operating the facility and has been designated by t he FIU Board of Trustees as a University Direct Support Organization pursuant to \u00a71004.28, Florida Statutes. (b) Basis of presentation The financial statements of the Athletics Finance C orporation have been prepared in conformity with accounting princip les generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) as applied to governmental units. T he Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the accepted standard-setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The Athletics Fina nce Corporation reports under the GASB standards because it meets the criteria regarding t he popular election of officers or appointment of a controlling majority of the members of the Organiza tion's governing body by one or more state or local governments. Therefore, the Athletics Financ e Corporation is reported as a governmental entity. In accordance with GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis - For State and Local Gover nments, the Athletics Finance Corporation met the criteria to use enterprise fund accounting and financial reporting. Accordingly, the financial statements are reported using the economi c resources measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting, which recognizes revenue when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of timing of the related cash flow. (c) Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformi ty with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts r eported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are b ased on management's knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. (d) Cash and cash equivalents Amounts reported as cash and cash equivalents consi st of cash on hand, cash held by a trust institution and inves ted in money market funds, and investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash a nd cash equivalents that are externally restricted to make debt service payments, maintain sinking or reserve funds, or to purchase or construct capital or other restricted assets, are classified as restricted. 107/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: (Continued) - 12 - (e) Investments Amounts reported as investments consist of investme nts in money market funds. In accordance with GASB Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application , money market funds are recorded at amortized cost, which is generally equivalent to fair value, and are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. In vestments that are externally restricted to make debt service payments, maintain sinking or reserve funds, or to purchase or construct capital or other restricted assets, are classified as restrict ed. (f) Derivative financial instruments and fair value mea surements\u2014 The Athletics Finance Corporation entered into an interest rate swap agre ement to reduce its exposure to market risks from changing interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the differential to be paid or received is accrued and recognized in interest expense and may change a s market interest rates change. The fair value of the derivative liability is presented in the sta tements of net position. The Organization uses the synthetic instrument method to evaluate the effecti veness as of the end of the reporting period. The Organization determined the interest rate swap met the criteria as an effective hedging transaction. Therefore, the change in the fair value in the effe ctive interest rate swap is presented in the statements of net position as a hedging derivative in deferred outflows of resources. The Organization categorizes its fair value measurement s within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hier archy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2 inputs are significant other observ able inputs; Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs. See Note 5 for additional info rmation on the interest rate swap. (g) Income taxes \u2014The Organization is a not-for-profit corporation, as described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and as such is subject to federal income taxes only on unrelated business income. There were no income ta xes resulting from unrelated business income during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Accounting principles generally accepted in the Uni ted States of America require management to evaluate tax positions taken and recognize a tax li ability (or asset) if the organization has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Management has analyzed the tax posit ions taken and has concluded that as of June 30, 2016, there are no uncertain positions taken or exp ected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability (or asset) or disclosure in the fina ncial statements. If the Organization were to incu r an income tax liability in the future, interest and pe nalties would be reported as income taxes. The Organization is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress. The Athlet ics Finance Corporation's income tax returns for the past three years are subject to examination by tax authorities, and may change upon examination Management believes the Organization is no longer s ubject to income tax examinations for years prior to 2013. (h) Prepaid rent \u2014Pursuant to two (2) ground sublease agreements, th e Organization prepaid a portion of their rent obligation to the University. The prepaid lease payments will be amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the sublease. 108/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: (Continued) - 13 - (i) Operating revenue and expenses \u2014The Athletics Finance Corporation's statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position dis tinguish between operating and non-operating revenue and expenses. Operating revenue results fr om exchange transactions associated with managing and operating the FIU Football Stadium, wh ich is the Athletics Finance Corporation's principal activity. Other sources of revenue, incl uding investment earnings, are reported as non- operating revenue. Operating expenses include all expenses incurred to manage and operate the FIU Football Stadium, other than external financing costs. (j) Flow assumption for restricted assets \u2014If both restricted and unrestricted assets are available for use for a certain purpose, it is the Athletics Finance Corporation's policy to use restricted assets first, and then use unrestricted assets as needed. (k) New accounting pronouncements -- For the year ended June 30, 2016, the organizati on implemented GASB Statement No. 72, which was issued in February 2015. GASB Statement No. 72 seeks to improve accounting and financial report ing by clarifying and enhancing the guidance for determining a fair value measurement for financ ial reporting purposes and for applying fair value to certain investments and disclosures relate d to all fair value measurements. (l) Subsequent events -- The Athletics Finance Corporation has been in ne gotiation with a bank to refinance the bonds payable. As of the date of t hese financials, the terms have not been finalized; therefore, the impact is not readily determinable. (2) Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Athletics Finance Corporation to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash in banks an d investments. (a) Deposits \u2014In addition to insurance provided by the Federal D epository Insurance Corporation, all deposits are held in banking insti tutions approved by the State Treasurer of the State of Florida to hold public funds. Under Flori da Statutes Chapter 280, Florida Security for Public Deposits Act, the State Treasurer requires a ll Florida qualified public depositories to deposit with the Treasurer or another banking institution, eligible collateral. In the event of a failure of a qualified public depository, the remaining public d epositories would be responsible for covering any resulting losses. Accordingly, all amounts rep orted as deposits (includes cash and restricted cash) are insured or collateralized. (b) Investments \u2014In addition, the Athletics Finance Corporation mai ntains investment accounts with financial institutions that are not insured by the FDIC. Fund shares are not guaranteed by the U.S. government. Current and future portfolio holdi ngs are subject to risk. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, $4,327,782 and $4,489,953, respectively, were held in these accounts. The Athletics Finance Corporation believes that the number, diversity and financial strength of the issuers mitigate the credit risks associated with all investments. 109/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 14 - (3) Investments: Investments are made in accordance with the trust i ndenture. The Organization invests in the Fidelity Institutional Money Market Government Portfolio - C lass III Fund (Fidelity Money Market Fund). This is a money market fund seeking to provide current i ncome consistent with stability of principal by investing in a portfolio of short-term, U.S. treasu ry and government securities. These investments include repurchase agreements collateralized fully by U.S Treasury and government securities. The Fun d limits its investment to those that would enable it to qualify as a permissible investment for federal ly chartered credit unions. Investments are made in a ccordance with the Trust Indenture dated as of December 1, 2009 (the \"Trust Indenture\") between th e Miami-Dade County Industrial Development Authority and Regions Bank, as trustee. This trans action is further described in Note 4. The investme nts were reported at amortized cost of $1,637,743 and $ 1,821,049 as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, which is generally the equivalent of fair value. (a) Credit risk \u2014Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of securiti es in which the Fund invests may default on the payment of interest or principal on the securities when due, which would cause the Fund to lose money. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the money market mutual fund investments were rated AAAm by Standard & Poor's. (b) Concentration credit risk \u2014All of the investments at June 30, 2016 and June 3 0, 2015 are held with Regions Morgan Keegan and are invested in money market funds. According to the bond indenture, the Organization can invest the bond pro ceeds in these investment vehicles; there are no stated limitations on the amount that can be invest ed in any one issuer. The short term nature of the investments is due to liquidity needs, since those funds are being used for operating expenses, debt service payments and stadium construction costs. (c) Interest rate risk \u2014A portfolio's weighted average days to maturity (W AM) reflects the average maturity in days based on final maturity or reset date, in the case of floating rate instruments. WAM measures the sensitivity of the f und to interest rate changes. A portfolio's weighted average life (WAL) calculation is based on a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest. WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit or tightening liquidity conditions. The Fidelity Money Market Fund prices of fixed-inco me securities generally fall when interest rates rise. Interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of fixed-income securities with longer maturities. The money market mutual fund WAM at Ju ne 30, 2016 and 2015 was 42 and 33 days, respectively, while the weighted average life (WAL) was 90 and 82 days at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 110/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 15 - (4) Long-term Debt: The debt activity for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: Beginning Ending Due Within Balance Additions Payments Balance One Year June 30, 2016: 2009 Tax Exempt Capital Improvement Revenue Bonds (Series A) 30,000,000 $ - $ - $ 30,000,000 $ 371,428 $ 2009 Taxable Capital Improvement Revenue Bonds (Series B) 1,415,877 - 697,270 718,607 718,607 31,415,877 $ - $ 697,270 $ 30,718,607 $ 1,090,035 $ Beginning Ending Due Within Balance Additions Payments Balance One Year June 30, 2015: 2009 Tax Exempt Capital Improvement Revenue Bonds (Series A) 30,000,000 $ - $ - $ 30,000,000 $ - $ 2009 Taxable Capital Improvement Revenue Bonds (Series B) 2,092,444 - 676,567 1,415,877 697,270 32,092,444 $ - $ 676,567 $ 31,415,877 $ 697,270 $ On December 1, 2009, the Athletics Finance Corporat ion issued $30,000,000 of Miami-Dade County Industrial Development Authority Revenue Bonds Seri es 2009A and $5,310,000 of Miami-Dade County Industrial Development Authority Taxable Revenue Bo nds Series 2009B. These bonds were issued and secured under and pursu ant to a trust indenture. Repayments of the bonds will be payable from pledged revenues, which are al l operating and non-operating revenues. Principal payments for the bonds began March 1, 2010. Intere st payments are made on a quarterly basis. The interest rate on the Series 2009A Bonds is equal to the sum of 63.7% of three-month LIBOR plus 1.90%. The interest rate on the Series 2009B Bonds shall b e at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 2.65%. The total proceeds from the new bond issue were use d solely to retire and current refund the outstanding Series 2007 A and B bonds and pay costs of issuance of the bonds and other refinancing costs. The bonds are secured by operating and non-o perating revenues as well as University athletic fe es, not to exceed 5% of the total athletic fees collect ed. Total principal due at June 30, 2016 and 2015, was $30,718,607 and $31,415,877, respectively. 111/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (4) Long-term Debt: (Continued) - 16 - The Athletics Finance Corporation has funded a debt service reserve fund in accordance with the bond indenture requirement of maintaining an amount equa l to the maximum allowable debt service on the bond in the current and any future fiscal year. Th is debt service reserve fund totaled $2,690,039 and $2,668,904 as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respective ly, and is presented in restricted investments. The Athletics Finance Corporation is required to ma intain minimum deposits of $1,000,000 with Regions Bank. The deposit is to be held in an interest-bea ring additional reserve fund and is presented in restricted cash. The interest rate on these bonds is both fixed and variable and is subject to a hedge agreement (see Note 5) that was entered into to reduce the exposur e to market risks from changing interest rates. In terest is computed on the basis of the actual number of da ys elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days. The aggregate maturities of these bonds as of June 30, 2016 are as follows: For the Year Ending June 30, Principal Interest Total Principal and Interest 2017 1,090,035 $ 1,649,191 $ (5) Derivative Financial Instruments: (a) Objectives \u2014As a means to lower its borrowing costs and increa se its savings, the Organization entered into an interest rate swap agr eement in connection with its $30,000,000 2009A Miami-Dade County Industrial Development Auth ority Revenue Bond issuance (Refunding Bonds). The intention of the swap agreement was to effectively change the Organization's variable interest rate on the bonds to a synthetic fixed rat e of 5.50%, which is the fixed rate payable by the Organization under the swap agreement of 3.60% plus 1.90%. (b) Terms \u2014On December 22, 2009, Athletics Finance Corporatio n entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the floating rate on $21,00 0,000 of the principal amount of the 2009A Bonds. This represents the fixed portion of the ta x exempt bonds payable mentioned in Note 4 above. Under the swap agreement, the Athletics Fina nce Corporation agrees to pay a fixed rate of 3.60% and receive a variable rate equal to 63.7% of three-month LIBOR. The swap agreement has a maturity date of March 1, 2033. 112/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (5) Derivative Financial Instruments: (Continued) - 17 - (c) Fair value \u2014The Athletics Finance Corporation swap had a deriv ative liability of $5,351,887 and $4,165,629 at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectiv ely, as reported in the statements of net position. The negative fair value was determined us ing a mark-to-market value and represents the closing mid-market values. It was classified in Lev el 2 of the fair value hierarchy at June 30, 2016 and 2015. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of the Series 2007A ineffective interest rate swap was $1,622,154 and $1,718,999, respectively. This inte rest rate swap was not terminated when the bonds were refunded in December 2009. The interest rate on the refunded Series 2009A bonds reflects a higher rate due to not terminating this interest rate swap. Accordingly, the fair value of $1,622,154 of the ineffective Series 2007A interest rate swap at June 30, 2016, is being amortized over the remaining life of the refunded Series 2009 A bond. The synthetic instrument method evaluates the effec tiveness by quantitative approach. The synthetic instrument method evaluates effectiveness by combining the hedgeable item and the potential hedging derivative instrument to simulate a third synthetic instrument. A potential hedging derivative instrument is effective if its t otal variable cash flows substantially offset the variable cash flows of the hedgeable item. The Org anization determined that it met the criteria of the synthetic instrument method. Therefore, the ch ange in the fair value of the effective interest rate swap is presented in the statements of net pos ition as a deferred outflow of resources in the amount of $3,729,734 and $2,446,631 at June 30, 201 6 and 2015, respectively. (d) Credit risk \u2014As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Athletics Financ e Corporation was not exposed to credit risk because the swap had a negat ive fair value. However, should interest rates change and the fair value of the swap become positi ve, the Organization would be exposed to credit risk in the amount of the derivative's fair value. The swap counterparty (Regions Bank) was rated A3 by Moody's Investors Service, BBB+ by Standard a nd Poor's and BBB by Fitch Ratings at June 30, 2016. (e) Basis risk \u2014Basis risk arises when different indexes are used in connection with a derivative. Given that both the bond and the interest rate swap are based on 63.7% of the three-month LIBOR rate, there is limited basis risk. (f) Termination risk \u2014The derivative contract uses the International Swa p Dealers Association (ISDA) Master Agreement, which includes standard te rmination events, such as failure to pay and bankruptcy. The schedule to the Master Agreement i ncludes an \"additional termination event\". That is, the swap agreement may be terminated if: ( i) the loan or other indebtedness in connection with which a transaction entered into by the Athlet ics Finance Corporation for the purpose or with the effect of altering the net combined payment fro m a floating to fixed or a fixed to floating rate basis is repaid, whether upon acceleration of princ ipal, at maturity, or otherwise, or for any other reason ceases to be an obligation of the Athletics Finance Corporation, with or without the consent of the counterparty (Regions Bank); or (ii) any cre dit support document expires, terminates or ceases to be of full force and effect. Also, the s wap agreement may be terminated or assigned by Athletics Finance Corporation if the counterparty's (Regions Bank) long-term, senior, unsecured, unenhanced debt rating is withdrawn, suspended, or falls below at least two of the following: a) \"Baa3\" as determined by Moody's; or b) \"BBB+\" as de termined by Standard and Poor's; or c) \"BBB\" as determined by Fitch. 113/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (5) Derivative Financial Instruments: (Continued) - 18 - (g) Swap payments and associated debt \u2014Using rates as of June 30, 2016, debt service requirements of the variable-rate debt and net swap payments, assuming current interest rates remain the same for their term, are as follows: For the Year Ending Interest Rate June 30, Principal Interest Swap, Net Total 2017 260,000 $ Variable-Rate Bond As rates vary, variable-rate bond interest payments and net swap payments will vary. (6) Unearned Revenues: The Athletics Finance Corporation and the Universit y have pledged future revenues in order to meet certain minimum bond requirements under the issue o f bond-related debt to finance the stadium project. Operating revenues may include athletics fees colle cted by the University, fund raising revenues, conference payments, naming rights revenues. Non-op erating revenues include capital gifts and investment revenues related to any of the above. Operating revenues related to the sale of football stadium suites and club seats have been deferred. Revenues are unavailable until the year they are earned. Suite sales will be recognized annually bas ed on their corresponding contracts. The following schedule presents sales commitments u nder suite agreements and ticket sales that expire on June 30, 2021: For the Year Ending June 30, Amount 2017 172,614 2018 83,800 2019 80,000 2020 80,000 2021 40,000 Total 456,414 $ 114/310 FIU ATHLETICS FINANCE CORPORATION (A DIRECT SUPPORT ORGANIZATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 19 - (7) Related Party Transactions: (a) Related party revenues \u2014In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding dated March 5, 2010, the University manages stadium-relat ed activities, collects revenues on behalf of the Athletics Finance Corporation, and remits revenues timely as required under the existing trust indenture. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2 015, the Athletics Finance Corporation received revenue for NCAA and conference payments, athletic support, suite revenue, ticket sales, sponsorship revenues, rental income, contributions and other operating revenues.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 117/310 - 21 - Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Corporation's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. Gainesville, Florida October 17, 2016 118/3105.2.4 D.

(the FIU HCN), a component unit of Florida International University, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively com prise the FIU HCN's basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. Management's Responsibility for the Financial State ments The FIU HCN's management is responsible for the pre paration and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ; this includes the design, implementation, and maint enance of internal control relevant to the preparat ion and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on thes e financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing sta ndards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial a udits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United Sta tes. Those standards require that we plan and perfo rm the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whet her the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain a udit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected d epend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor consi ders internal control relevant to the entity's prep aration and fair presentation of the financial statements i n order to design audit procedures that are appropr iate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expre ssing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity 's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such o pinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overa ll presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis f or our audit opinion. 122/310 - 2 - Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the FIU HCN as of June 30, 20 16, and the changes in its financial position and it s cash flows for the year then ended in accordance wi th accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Matters Required Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in the Uni ted States of America require that management's discussion and analysis on pages 3 - 9 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not part of the basic financia l statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be a n essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operat ional, economic, or historical context. We have applie d certain limited procedures to the required suppleme ntary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States o f America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the infor mation and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inqu iries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any as surance. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated September 21, 2016, on our consideration of the FIU HCN's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regu lations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over f inancial reporting and compliance and the results of that te sting, and not to provide an opinion on internal con trol over financial reporting or on compliance. That repo rt is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the FIU HCN's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 3 - The management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) pro vides an overview of the financial position and activities of The Florida International University Academic Health Center Health Care Network Faculty Group Practice, Inc. (the FIU HCN) for the fiscal y ears ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and should be re ad in conjunction with the financial statements and no tes thereto. The MD&A, financial statements and not es thereto, are the responsibility of management. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - CURRENT YEAR The FIU HCN transitioned from a full risk clinical model to a Management Services Organization model (MSO) in FY 2015-2016. In this model, revenues der ive from management fees of services provided to Student Health Services, Herbert Wertheim College o f Medicine (HWCOM), Office of International Affairs (OIA), Embrace, and from leases to Miami Ch ildren's Hospital and Gastro Health. The net patien t revenues and respective AR for patient services pro vided since July 1, 2015 are recorded under the boo ks of the HWCOM as a result of this financial model. The FIU HCN assets totaled approximately $4.0 milli on at June 30, 2016. This balance reflects an approximate $2.2 increase from June 30, 2015, resul ting primarily from the increase in cash from MSO fees and the OIA educational program. The increase in cash allowed for a decrease in the liabilities f or the loan due to Florida International University (the U niversity or FIU) by approximately $0.3 million whi le the total liabilities increased by approximately $0 .1 million. This increase in liabilities comes fro m the increase in payable accruals and the increase in un earned revenue related to the pre-paid rotations un der the OIA program. Liabilities totaled approximately $9.7 million at June 30, 2016. The FIU HCN's operating revenues totaled approximat ely $5.6 million for the 2016 fiscal year, an approximate $0.36 million decrease from the 2015 fi scal year. This amount was comprised of management fee revenue (approximately $2.5 million) , OIA educational program revenue (approximately $2.6 million), rental income (approximately $0.49 m illion) as well as prior year net patient service revenue (approximately $0.06 million). Operating e xpenses totaled approximately $3.3 million for the 2016 fiscal year, representing a decrease of approx imately $5.4 million over the 2015 fiscal year due to the following: (a) administrative positions realign ment, (b) cost of teaching faculty and their clinic al support staff along with associated benefits were a bsorbed by HWCOM; (c) leases, rentals and operating expenses related declined to the closure of Sunset and Department of Health (DOH) clinical sites; (d) some clinical operating expenses were also absorbed by H WCOM as a result of the change in financial model t o MSO. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - PRIOR YEAR The FIU HCN assets totaled approximately $1.8 milli on at June 30, 2015. This balance reflects an approximate $900 thousand decrease from the 2014 fi scal year, resulting primarily from termination of the lease for clinical facility in Market Square Ga rage (PG5) requiring that lease improvements be wri tten off. While assets decreased, liabilities also incre ased by approximately $2.9 million, totaling approximately $9.6 million at June 30, 2015, compar ed to approximately $6.7 million at June 30, 2014. The increase in liabilities was a result of the inc rease in the loan agreement with the University, wh ereby the University loaned the FIU HCN an additional app roximate $3.1 million to offset losses from operations. The total amount loaned by the Universi ty to FIU HCN is approximately $8.3 million as of June 30, 2015. 124/310 THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC HEALT H CENTER HEALTH CARE NETWORK FACULTY GROUP PRACTICE, INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (Continued) - 4 - The FIU HCN's operating revenues totaled approximat ely $6 million for the 2015 fiscal year, an approximate $1.5 million increase from the 2014 fis cal year.

Operating expenses totaled approxi mately $8.6 million for the 2015 fiscal year, representing an increase of approximately $1.3 mill ion over the 2014 fiscal year due to the following: (a) salaries of administrative, clinical and suppor t staff of HWCOM and their associated benefits; (b) contracted services for additional rotations of international programs, and operations of on campu s, Sunset and DOH clinical sites; (c) other operating expenses for project management services.

FIU HCN operated in four clinical sites during fiscal year 2015; Modesto A. Maidique Campus, Broward, Sunset and the DOH facilities. In addition, clinical services were provided via a contract with DOH at their Sexu ally Transmitted Infections clinic. This contract terminated at the end of the fiscal year 2015. Due to negative financial outcomes from clinical operat ions, on January 2015 FIU HCN undertook a restructuring t hat resulted in elimination of the Family Medicine, Pain Management and Cardiology lines of business an d divestment of clinical facilities at Sunset and Department of Health. FIU HCN transitioned to a Man agement Services Organization model in fiscal year 2016 where management services are provided to HWCOM, OIA, Student Health Services and Embrace.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (Continued) - 8 - Operating expenses totaled approximately $3.3 milli on for the 2016 fiscal year. This represents a decr ease of approximately $5.4 million from the fiscal year 2015 primarily due to the restructuring and reclassification of administrative positions that t ook place in the first quarter of the fiscal year a nd the change in financial model from a full risk clinical model to the MSO model. As part of the MSO model, the cost of teaching faculty staff and clinical sup port staff of the HWCOM and their associated benefi ts are not absorbed by the FIU HCN in fiscal year 2016 . Operating expenses totaled approximately $8.6 million for the 2015 fiscal year. This represents an approximate $1.3 million increase over the 2014 fiscal year and was primarily due to: (a) salaries of administrative, clinical and support staff of the H WCOM and their associated benefits; (b) contracted professional and consulting services; higher billin g and collection fees due to increased clinical ser vices , additional software and increased user licenses and (c) other operating expenses; for project manageme nt consulting. These operating expenses all were incu rred related to the expansion of medical services a nd the faculty practice plan. Non-Operating Expenses Non-operating expenses include interest expense on the loans owed to the University for prior years st art- up costs and working capital cost and the loss on d isposal of equipment. Fiscal year 2015 loss on disposal of capital assets relates to the facility build out resulting from the termination of the lea se of the FIU PG5 clinical facility.

ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT THE FUTURE FIU HCN will continue to operate as a management se rvices organization for FIU. As we enter the FY 2016-2017, FIU HCN revenues will derive from manage ment fees related to the Student Health Clinics, HWCOM, Embrace, the International programs graduate certificate as in prior year with an additional 15% of the programmatic fee of all other internatio nal programs and the leases from Miami Children's Hospital and Gastro Health. In fiscal year 2017 th e management service revenue from HWCOM will change from a 15% of gross patient service charges to a cost reimbursement model up to 2.1 million dollars in reimbursement. This will include the co st of the clinical support staff for the teaching f aculty and associated benefits, the administrative cost to operate the clinical sites and the allocation of t he percent effort of FIU HCN administrative support st aff. All cash collections related to patient servi ces provided since July 1, 2015 will continue to be rev enue and receivables of HWCOM as well as the risk associated with collections on patient services to cover faculty practice effort at the clinics. 129/310 THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC HEALT H CENTER HEALTH CARE NETWORK FACULTY GROUP PRACTICE, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 - 13 - (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: (a) Reporting entity --The Florida International University Academic Hea lth Center Health Care Network Faculty Group Practice, Inc. (the FIU HCN), a Florida not-for-profit corporation, is a component unit of Florida International University (FIU). The FIU HCN exists exclusively to support the mission of FIU to improve and support h ealth education at the FIU in the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine (HWCOM), the Robert St empel College of Public Health and Social Work, the College of Nursing and Health Sciences, a nd departments in the College of Arts and Sciences with clinical activities. The FIU HCN has been granted tax-exempt organization status as defined by Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenu e Code. FIU HCN transitioned to a Management Services Organization model in fiscal year 2016 whe re management services are provided to HWCOM, Office of International Affairs (OIA), Stude nt Health Services and Embrace. Additionally, FIU HCN also receives sublease revenu e. The FIU HCN was organized in the State of Florida o n February 21, 2008 and on August 9, 2012, the FIU HCN changed its name from The Florida Inter national University College of Medicine Health Care Network Faculty Group Practice, Inc. to The Florida International University Academic Health Center Health Care Network Faculty Group Pra ctice, Inc. (b) Basis of presentation --The financial statements of the FIU HCN have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally acc epted in the United States of America (GAAP) as applied to governmental units. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the accepted standard-setting body for establishing gov ernmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The FIU HCN reports under the GASB stan dards because it meets the criteria regarding the popular election of officers or appointment of a controlling majority of the members of the FIU HCN's governing body by one or more state or local governments. In accordance with GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements\u2014and Management's Discussion and Analysis\u2014for State and Local Governm ents, the FIU HCN met the criteria to use enterprise fund accounting and financial reporting. Accordingly, the financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement f ocus and accrual basis of accounting, which recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when a liability is incurred, regardless of timing of the related cash flow. (c) Use of estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformi ty with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts r eported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are ba sed on management's knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. (d) Cash and cash equivalents --The FIU HCN considers all highly liquid investmen ts with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. In addition to insurance provided by the Federal Depository Insurance Corpor ation, all deposits are held in banking institutions approved by the State Treasurer of the State of Florida to hold public funds. Under Florida Statutes Chapter 280, Florida Security for Public Deposits Act, the State Treasurer requires all Florida qualified public depositories to deposi t with the Treasurer or another banking institution , eligible collateral. In the event of a failure of a qualified public depository, the remaining public depositories would be responsible for covering any resulting losses. Accordingly, all amounts reported as deposits (includes cash and restricted cash) are insured or collateralized. 134/310 THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC HEALT H CENTER HEALTH CARE NETWORK FACULTY GROUP PRACTICE, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: (Continued) - 14 - (e) Capital assets --Capital assets are reported at historical cost le ss accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capital assets consist of fixed a nd moveable medical equipment and leasehold improvements. Depreciation and amortization are cal culated using the straight line method over the following estimated service lives, which consist of 10 years for leasehold improvements, 5-15 years for moveable equipment and 7 years for fixed equipm ent. (f) Flow assumption for restricted assets --If both restricted and unrestricted assets are av ailable for use for a certain purpose, it is the FIU HCN's policy to use restricted assets first, and then use unrestricted assets as needed. (g) Operating revenue and expenses --The FIU HCN's statements of revenues, expenses, a nd changes in net position distinguishes between opera ting and nonoperating revenue and expenses. Operating revenue results from exchange transaction s associated with providing management services to HWCOM, Student Health Clinics, Embrace, the management of the educational program for the OIA which are earned under the terms of the agreement with the American University in Antigua (AUA), and the subleases to Miami Children' s Hospital and Gastro Health. Operating expenses include all expenses incurred to provide m anagement services, other than external financing costs. (h) Net patient service revenue and patient accounts re ceivable --Patient service revenue is recognized as revenue in the period when the servic es are performed and is reported on the accrual basis at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients. Net patient service revenue includes amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by third-party payor programs. Net patient service revenue also includes an estimated provisio n for bad debts based upon management's evaluation of collectability of patient receivables considering the age of the receivables and other criteria, such as payor classifications. Patient accounts receivable are reported net of bot h an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts and an allowance for contractual adjustmen ts. Individual accounts are charged-off against the estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts when management determines that it is unlikely that the account will be collected. The contractual adjustments represent the difference between established billing rates and estimated reimburseme nt from patients and third party payors. The FIU HCN does not require collateral or other security f or patient accounts receivable. (i) Educational program revenue --Educational program revenues are earned under the terms of the agreement with the AUA and consist of monthly t uition revenues earned at the start of each program cycle. Additionally, an advance payment of program fees for the core certificate program is amortized monthly on a pro-rata basis over the life of the agreement which is sixty four (64) months. In addition, FIU HCN receives program revenue under OIA from the International Visiting Medical Student program administered to in ternational students through collaboration with various institutions. (j) Income taxes --The FIU HCN is a not-for-profit corporation, as d escribed in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and is exempt from federal income taxes, except for unrelated business income. There were no income tax es resulting from unrelated business income during the year ended June 30, 2016. 135/310 THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC HEALT H CENTER HEALTH CARE NETWORK FACULTY GROUP PRACTICE, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: (Continued) - 15 - Accounting principles generally accepted in the Uni ted States of America require management to evaluate tax positions taken and recognize a tax li ability (or asset) if the FIU HCN has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Management has analyzed the tax positi ons taken and has concluded that as of June 30, 2016, there are no uncertain positions taken or exp ected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability (or asset) or disclosure in the fina ncial statements. If the FIU HCN were to incur an income tax liability in the future, interest and pe nalties would be reported as income taxes. The FIU HCN is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdic tions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress. FIU HCN's income tax r eturns for the past three years are subject to examination by tax authorities, and may change upon examination. (k) Reclassifications --In order to facilitate the comparison of financia l data, certain June 30, 2015 account balances have been reclassified to con form to the current year reporting format. These reclassifications had no effect on net position. (2) Net Patient Service Revenue and Patient Accounts Re ceivable: Net patient service revenue is derived principally from professional fees generated by the faculty of the FIU Academic Health Center for treating patients. N et patient service revenue represents direct revenu e from patient care. This revenue is derived from pro fessional fees charged to individual patients and funded through third party payors and private patie nt payments based on established reimbursement rate s. The net patient service revenue in fiscal year 2016 relates to charges for dates of service prior to J uly 1, 2015. Any revenue for subsequent service dates is r ecorded by HWCOM and HCN is paid a management fee. A reconciliation of the net patient service re venue and amounts of services provided to patients at established rates to direct revenue from patient ca re, as presented in the statement of revenue, expen ses and changes in net position is as follows: Year Ending June 30, 2016 2015 Gross direct charges from patient care $ 89,408 $ 6 ,058,372 Less: Contractual adjustments - (2,427,290) Less: Bad debt expense (32,745) (491,444) Total net patient service revenue $ 56,663 $ 3,139,638 There were no contractual adjustments in fiscal yea r 2016 due to the change in business model as noted above. Contractual adjustments for 2015 included ap proximately $131,000 related to adjustments provided to self-insured patient accounts. The majo rity of these adjustments were for hospital service s provided to unfunded patients, which represents ind ividuals who are not enrolled in a health plan and must meet their financial obligations by using pers onal resources. These adjustments do not include allowances offered under a discount program accordi ng to the FIU HCN's self-pay discount policy, which were immaterial. 136/310 THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC HEALT H CENTER HEALTH CARE NETWORK FACULTY GROUP PRACTICE, INC.

(the FIU HCN) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016 , and the related notes to the financial statements , and have issued our report thereon dated September 21, 2016. Internal Control over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financi al statements, we considered the FIU HCN's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropr iate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for t he purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectivene ss of the FIU HCN's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of t he FIU HCN's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control do es not allow management or employees, in the normal course of pe rforming their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis . A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that the re is a reasonable possibility that a material miss tatement of the entity's financial statements will not be pr evented or detected and corrected on a timely basis . A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enou gh to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over financia l reporting was for the limited purpose described i n the first paragraph of this section and was not designe d to identify all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weakness es or significant deficiencies. Given these limitat ions, during our audit we did not identify any deficienci es in internal control over financial reporting tha t we consider to be material weaknesses. However, materi al weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 142/310 - 21 - Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whe ther the FIU HCN's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of it s compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncomp liance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amount s. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our a udit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no insta nces of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe th e scope of our testing of internal control and comp liance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's int ernal control or on compliance. This report is an integra l part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and co mpliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose . Gainesville, Florida September 21, 2016 143/3105.3 FA2.

New Program Proposal: Limited Access Bachelor of Science in Digital Communication and Media Consent Agenda AP2 THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES December 1, 2016 Subject: New Program Proposal: Limited Access Bachelor of Science in Digital Communication and Media Proposed Board Action: Approve the Limited Access Bachelor of Scie nce in Digital Communication and Media (CIP 09.0702) new program proposal. Background Information: The School of Communication and Journalism in the College of Communication, Architecture + The Arts at Florida International University propos es to offer a new Limited Access Bachelor of Science degree in Digital Communication and Media. This proposal originates from a current major within the BS in Communication. As the cu rrent degree program requires a 2.85 GPA for admission, the proposed Limited Access degree will require the same GPA standard. The proposed program would award degrees in an area of strategic emphasis, as identified by the State University System's Board of Governors. The proposed degree will place the School of Commu nication and Journalism at the forefront of pedagogical efforts to create new and diverse oppor tunities for students entering a changing and highly competitive field. The courses being offere d in this degree will represent the very latest in research, critical thinking, and professional stan dards emerging from both academia and industry. While building a skillset attractive to potential empl oyers will be one goal of the curriculum, there will also be strong emphasis on academic rigor and cr itical, theoretical foundations that will be even more essential for ensuring students are well prepared as the field continues to evolve and change. Each university board of trustees shall approve for implementation new degree programs at the bachelor's, master's, advanced master's, and specia list levels in accordance with sections (3) and (5) of Florida Board of Governors Regulation 8.011 - Authorization of New Academic Degree Programs and Other Curricular Offerings. Additionally, section (3) of Regulation 8.011 states that in a proposal for a baccalaureate program, if limited access status is sought in accordance with Board Regulation 8.013, adequate justification shall exist for such a designati on, and evidence shall be provided that diversity, articulation, and workforce issue s are appropriately addressed. Section (1) of Florida Board of Governors Regulation 8.013 - Limited Access states in relevant part that the Board of Governors may declare certain de gree programs as limited access programs, upon request by university board of trustees.

This new degree in Digital Communication and Medi a, currently a major within the BS in Communication, is being proposed in recognition of the rapidly changing communication and media environment conf ronting communication professionals, academics, and entrepreneurs. Students enro lled in this concentration will be given the critical thinking and technical skills need ed for producing digital media content and distributing that content across multiple pl atforms, engaging diverse audiences through a strong foundation in social media and networking, as well as learning methods and strategies for ensuring their communication attains maximum impact. The School is requesting that the proposed degree model itself after the current degree's 2.85 GPA admission standard, thus it will be consider ed a limited access program. (See Appendix with rationale and enrollment impact data.) A degree in Digital Communication and Media is also envisioned as providing core foundational classes for all students pursuing degrees in Communication and Journalism, as the rapid expansion of th e Internet and digital media has been transformational for all forms and types of communication. The new degree in Digital Communication and Media is being designed with just a single concentration, which will in turn offer students the flexibility to ch oose from a number of classes that best fit their interests in the field. This decision is also being made in recognition of the diversity of the field and potential career pa ths that exist in this varied and expanding discipline. The BS in Digital Communication and Media w ill be a critical addition to the degrees being offered by the School of Communication and Journalism and bring the curriculum of the School fully in line with the challenges, opportunities, and demands presented by a rapidly changing industry. Cr eating a core curriculum in the theories and critical thinking needed to unde rstand the field of digital media and communication will be an essential component for creating a strong intellectual foundation for students enrolled in this degree as well as all degree-seekers in the School.

Explain how the uni versity will ensure that Florida College System transfer students are not disadvantage d by the Limited Access status. NOTE: The policy and criteria for Limited Access are identified in Board of Governors Regulation 6C-8.013. The University does intend to seek formal Li mited Access status for the B.S. in Digital Communication and Media. The proposed ad mission requirements include a 2.85 GPA and successful completion of three upper division courses. The degree will be a professionally oriented program and like mo st other professional programs- Business, Architecture, Arts - we often need to limit access to engage only those students serious about skills-building in those professions. The nature of much of the instructional material means that classes must be of a size that allows regular feedback opportunities and strong mentor relationsh ips between faculty and students. Such mentoring cannot take place in large, traditional classroom st ructures. Because much of the work of our students has both audio and visual compon ents, students must also have adequate space and time in which to pursue their work and classes must be limited to the number that the faculty can reasonably support. As such, we teach a number of very specific, skill-focused classes that require low enrollmen t. Additionally, the official accrediting body for the School of Communication an d Journalism, the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Co mmunication (ACEJMC), recommends 15 students in skills classes and prohibits more than 20. The above admission requirements were alre ady in place for the existing BS in Communications degree in which this propos ed new degree program was originally a major of Digital Media Studies. The enrollm ent numbers of the current major indicate that Transfer Students from the Florida Coll ege System (FCS) is 50 and this is almost double in number compared to FTIC studen ts - 30 - who are enrolled in the upper division. Given that the School is maintain ing their current requirements for the BS in Communication for the newly proposed BS in Digital Communication and Media, the impact on FCS students will not limit thei r acceptance in the program compared to other students seeking admission. The current major, which will become the degree, has a very diverse student population. The race/ethnicity breakdown fo r the 86 upper division digital media studies' students (fall 2016) includes the following: 75.58% Hispanic (65), 3.39% White Non-Hispanic (3), and 12.79% Black or African American (11). Given FIU's status as an Hispanic Serving Institution, and the curre nt major from which this new degree will draw has been very diverse, we do not be lieve the continuation of these admission policies will adversely affect the new degree's diversity.

Public Relations, Advertising & Applied Communication Consent Agenda AP3 THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES December 1, 2016 Subject: New Program Proposal: Limite d Access Bachelor of Science Public Relations, Advertising, and Applied Communication Proposed Board Action: Approve the Limited Access Bachelor of Scien ce Public Relations, Advertising, and Applied Communication (CIP 09.0900) new program proposal. Background Information: The College of Communication, Architecture + Arts proposes to offer a Limited Access Bachelor of Science in Public Relations, Advertising, and Applied Communication. This proposal originates from a current major within the BS in Communication. As the current degree program requires a 2.85 GPA for admi ssion, the proposed Limited Access degree will require the same GPA standard. The proposed pr ogram would award degrees in an area of strategic emphasis, as identified by the St ate University System's Board of Governors. The proposed program will produce more well-tr ained professionals with global orientation who will drive this economic growth and th e ever-increasing business cooperation. In addition, equipping students with the knowle dge and skills to communicate effectively with culturally diverse audiences addresses the increa sing cultural diversity of the U.S. population. More than ever before, advertising and public re lations agencies need to develop expertise in identifying the unique needs of each cultural segment and address them in their strategic communication. Each university board of trustees shall approv e for implementation new degree programs at the bachelor's, master's, advanced master's, and specialist levels in accordance with sections (3) and (5) of Florida Board of Governors Regulation 8.011 - Authorization of New Academic Degree Programs and Other Curricular Offerings. Additionally, section (3) of Regulation 8.011 states that in a proposal for a baccalaureate prog ram, if limited access status is sought in accordance with Board Regulation 8.013, ad equate justification shall exist for such a designation, and evidence shall be provided th at diversity, articulation, and workforce issues are appropriately addressed. Section (1) of Florida Board of Governors Regulation 8.013 - Limited Access states in relevant part that the Board of Governors may declare certa in degree programs as limited access programs, upon request by university board of trustees.

We currently offer majors both in Advertising and Public Relations under the school-wide B.S. in Communication. Currently there are almost 500 upper division majors in these very robust programs. Working with both industry and students, it was determined that the major was insufficient and that a separate degree is warranted. The new degree is also different from others offered in the SUS because FIU is located in a hub of Hispanic and multicultural marketing, and where major international advertising and public relations agencies have their Latin Am erican headquarters. This provides unique opportunities for students to access mentor s, guest speakers, an d internships. The School is requesting that the proposed de gree model itself after the current degree's 2.85 GPA admission standard, thus it will be considered a limited access program. (See Appendix with rationale and enrollment impact data.) Careers in strategic communication with a gl obal focus and the opportunity to take on areas of concentration in strategic disciplines are in line with the mission and strategic plan of FIU. This degree will prepare stud ents to work in marketing communication fields, including advertising and public relations, as well as media sales and management, areas identified as priorities in the county's Beacon Council's \"One Community One Goal\" targeted industry strateg ic plan. In the context of the thriving strategic communication industry in South Florida, the University will gain increased recognition as a leader in this industry, att racting top candidates looking specifically for this strategic degree rather than a generic professional degree in communication. The proposed program addresses one of the gap areas identified by the SUS, which means that there are more jobs in the state of Florida than students graduating with the corresponding degree. This is true part icularly in South Florida, where there are hundreds of advertising and public relati ons agencies serving a broad and diverse market, and where dozens of global firms have their Latin American headquarters. A search for jobs in public relations in Sout h Florida on job posting site indeed.com yielded 1,024 open positions in November 2015, and 893 in advertising. The new program will engage local employers and professionals to a greater degree as we build an advisory board and robust internship structure specifica lly for students in the new degree. This will increase recognitio n and engagement among businesses and community members, facilitating access of our graduates to the job market. 180/310 Implementatio n Timeframe Projected Enrollment (From Table 1) Projected Program Costs (From Table 2) HC FTE E&G Cost per FTE E&G Funds Contract & Grants Funds Auxiliary Funds Total Cost Year 1 364 273 $1,212 $330,997 $330,997 Year 2 410 308 Year 3 470 353 Year 4 566 425 Year 5 588 441 $1,502 $661,995 $661,995 181/310 Appendix: Board of Governor's Limited Access Request If the university intends to seek formal Limited Access status for the proposed program, provide a rationale that includes an analysis of diversity issues with respect to such a designation.

This program addresses a critical need facing the marketplace. Data Science has been recently hailed as one of the fastest growing fields in terms of the number of job openings . The proposed program will prepare the students for the global marketplace wher e major decisions in every discipline are becoming increasingly \"data-driven\". The MS - Data Science program will be a face -to-face program aimed at students with sound analytical skills holding a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Statistics, Healthcare Manage ment, Management Information Systems, or related disciplines. The interdisciplinary MS degree program in Data Science will have a common core involving four courses in Co mputing and Statistics plus a Capstone course. The elective courses are offered as separate specialization tracks to prepare students to become data scientists with spec ializations in areas such as Computational Data Analytics, Business Data Analytics, Hospitality Data Analytics, and Biostatistics Data Analytics. With the express goal of gi ving students professional experience and making them better prepared for the marketpl ace, the proposed program also includes a Capstone course where students will pu rsue a discipline-specific and industry- relevant project in data analytics. The program will directly support SUS goals in Teaching & Learning, specifically advancing the strategic priority of increasing the number of graduate STEM degrees in the critical area of data science. It will al so directly support SUS goals in Community & Business Engagement by increasing the comm unity workforce in this area, and it will indirectly support SUS goals in Scholars hip, Research, & Innovation though its innovative curriculum which will focus both faculty and graduate students on the key concepts and technologies needed to address the deep challenges of data analytics. The MS - Data Science program will be attrac tive to a large body of students from South Florida, including both new graduates in data-intensive disciplines and skilled professionals in many disciplines, especially those in the healthcare, finance, insurance, trade, shipping, urban planning, business analytics, and tourism industries. 184/310 Implementation Timeframe Projected Enrollment (From Table 1) Projected Program Costs (From Table 2) HC FTE E&G Cost per FTE E&G Funds Contract & Grants Funds Auxiliary Funds Total Cost Year 1 34 21.25 $7,516 $159,72 2 0 0 $159,722 Year 2 87 43.75 Year 3 120 58.44 Year 4 134 62.81 Year 5 134 62.81 $4,360 2 0 0 $273,892 185/3105.8 AP5. New Program Proposal: Doctor of Philosophy in Applied Mathematical Sciences Consent Agenda AP5 THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES December 1, 2016 Subject: New Program Proposal: Doctor of Philosophy in Applied Mathematical Sciences Proposed Board Action: Approve the Doctor of Philosophy in Mathem atical Sciences (CIP 27.0301) new program proposal. Background Information: The College of Arts, Sciences & Education proposes to offer a Doctor of Philosophy in Applied Mathematical Sciences. The proposed program would award degrees in an area of strategic emphasis, as identified by the St ate University System's Board of Governors. The main goal of the program is to train an d produce knowledgeable scholars with a higher level of problem solving skills than in tradit ional Ph.D. programs in mathematics. Besides working in academia at a university or commu nity college, a graduate with a doctorate degree in applied mathematical sciences has wide em ployment opportunities. There is an increasing demand by major companies and governmental agencies for highly skilled mathematical scientists. Each university board of trustees shall approv e for implementation new degree programs at the bachelor's, master's, advanced master's, and specialist levels in accordance with sections (3) and (5) of Florida Board of Governors Regulation 8.011 - Authorization of New Academic Degree Programs and Other Curricular Offerings. Supporting Documentation: Executive Summary: Doctor of Philosophy in Applied Mathematical Sciences (CIP 27.0301) New Program Proposal This page intentionally left blank 186/310 New Program Proposal: Ph .D. in Applied Mathematical Sciences Department of Mathematics and Statistics College of Arts, Sciences & Education Florida International University EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The College of Arts, Sciences & Education at Florida International University is proposing to offer a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematical Sciences . The program will be housed in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. This broad -scope degree program will have an emphasis on applications within mathematics and statistic s. It will prepare students for careers in academia, government agencies, high tech , and biomedical ind ustries . The Applied Experience Component (AEC) is unique to this program and is not found in any other doctoral program in mathematics in F lorida. In addition to acquiring skills in work outside academia, the AEC is an opportunity to introduce students to potential employers. A recent Wall Street Journal article found that Mathematician, Actuary, and Statistician were the top three professio ns. The following quote from the article summarizes the centrality and expectations of mathematical discoveries : \"The mathematical modeling of humanity promises to be one of the great undertakings of the 21st century.\" Besides the production of highly qual ified scholars that can educate the future generations of STEM students, the graduates of this program will also contribute to emergence of new businesses and industries in Florida. According to the most recent annual report of the American Mathematical So ciety for the new doctoral recipients awarded in the mathematical sciences at U. S. universities, 93.9% are employed. Employment distribution is as follows: Academia 47%; Business and Industry 34%; Research Labs 13%; Government 6%. A previous study of the AMS finds that the number of Ph.D. awarded has increased more than 53% over the last ten years and is expected to grow. According to the Florida Chamber of Commerce, the state currently has 55,000 unfilled STEM positions. The proposed Ph .D. program will he lp address this shortage. The demand for students graduating from the proposed program is clear at the local, state, and national levels. The proposed Ph. D. program is directly aligned with the goals contained in the BOG Strategic Plan for 2012 -2025. Th e program directly supports the three goals Excellence , Productivity , and Strategic Priorities in the categories Teaching & Learning and Scholarship, Research, & Innovation . The program directly supports the third goal (Strategic Priorities) and indirectly the first two (Excellence and Productivity) in the category Community & Business Engagement. According to the most recent annual report of the American Mathematical Societ y for the new doctoral recipients awarded in the mathematical sciences at U. S. universities, only 2.7% are African Americans and only 3.1% are Hispanics. The following quote taken from the report of Dr. Emile Straube, the external reviewer of this proposa l, 187/310 draws attention to the unique opportunity at hand \"The American Mathematical Society reports that of the 863 new Ph.D. graduates in Mathematics from July 2011 to July 2012 who were US citizens, only 33 were Hispanics, and only 28 were African American \". Given the demographics of FIU's student body and of the greater Miami area, the department is poised to become the leading producer of Hispanic Ph. D.s in Mathematical Sciences, with the attendant national recognition Among the 115 universities in the Carn egie ratings as \"R1: Doctoral Universities -Highest Research Activity\" only three universities (including FIU) do not offer a Ph.D. program in Mathematical Sciences. In Florida, FIU is the only large university without a Math Ph.D., and at FIU Math is the o nly major STEM field with no Ph.D. A Ph.D. program in Mathematical Sciences will enhance the research environment both in the department and in other departments. Graduate students will often assist in the research programs of the faculty both in math and in other departments A Ph.D. program in Mathematical Sciences at FIU will provide the Department with a unique opportunity to significantly contribute to the wide -ranging University \"Student Success\" initiative. The Ph.D. program will train young mathematicians for careers as professional researchers and educators of the 21st century. Tomorrow's STEM workforce, particularly in mathematical sciences, must be diverse to cover the wide spectrum of societal needs. FIU's location puts it at the heart of the Hispanic community and can thus provide a hub of educators of Hispanic students.

Amendment to the Bylaws of the Florida International University Board of Trustees Agenda Item 6 G2 THE FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES December 1, 2016 Subject: Proposed Amendments to th e Bylaws of the Florida International University Board of Trustees Proposed Board Action: Approve the amendments to the Bylaws of the Florida International University Board of Trustees (the BOT). Background Information: The proposed amendments to the FIU BOT Bylaws result from the foregoing: The Florida Legislature enacted House Bill No . 7029, which amended Section 1001.71 of the Florida Statutes to include added requirements of university board membership and the conduct of board meetings. The Board of Gove rnors thereafter adopted a revised Board of Governors (BOG) Regulation 1.001 to make the regulation compliant with revised statute Section 1001.71, Florida Statutes. The proposed amendments to the FIU BOT Bylaws is to bring them current and in compliance with F.S. \u00a71001.71, and BOG Regulation 1.001. The proposed amendment to FIU BOT Bylaw Sect ion 4.6, Duties of Corporate Secretary, requires the BOT to keep and within two week s after a board meeting, to \"post prominently on the university's website detailed meeting mi nutes for all meetings, including the vote history and attendance of each trustee . . .\", in compliance with new BOG Regulation 1.001(2)(j). The proposed amendments to FIU BOT Bylaws Section 3.2, Attendance, and 4.4, Duties of Chair, are meant to conform with new BO G Regulation 1.001(2)(c), regarding BOT attendance. The proposed amendments also include minor revisions to FIU BOT Bylaw Section 6.3, Special Meetings, correcting scrivener's errors. In addition, the BOG, in a July 20, 2016 memorandum, discussed best practices for the composition and placement of the Audit an d Compliance Committees of University Boards of Trustees. (A copy of the memorandum is included in the materials relating to this action item.) The BOG recommended that the governing boards of universities and colleges, consider the importance of independence and autonomy, key factors to providing accountability and oversight, when evaluating their respective audit and compliance committee's practices, compositions, and pla cement. The BOG highlighted that the independence of the audit committee, and its function, is important for a variety of reasons, including that audit committee functions do not ta ke a back seat to other pressing university operations issues. During the BOT Gove rnance Committee and Full Board meetings of 297/310 The Florida International University Board of Trustees Full Board Meeting December 1, 2016 Agenda Item 6 - G2 Page | 2 September 1, 2016, FIU staff advised the FI U BOT of the referenced memorandum, and BOT Chair Claudia Puig requested that FIU sta ff work with Trustee Gerald C. Grant, Jr. to address the memorandum and propose recommend ed changes. The proposed amendments create two new and separate committees, namely : (1) the Finance and Facilities Committee; and (2) the Audit and Compliance Committee. The new charters for each of these committees are covered by separate agenda items. The Bylaws of the BOT establish a governance structure for the conduct of Board business and are intended to encourage efficiencies and to facilitate Board business. BOG Regulation 1.001(3)(b) states that each board of trustees may establish committees of the board to address matters including, but not limited to, academic and student affairs, strategic planning, finance, audit, proper ty acquisition and construction, personnel, and budgets. Section 8.1 of the BOT Bylaws states, \"[t]hese Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed at any regular meeting of the Board by a two-t hirds (2/3) vote of all members of the Board, when notice of the proposed amendment or repeal is provided in the meeting notice.
