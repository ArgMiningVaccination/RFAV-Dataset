Do you know what's hiding in your brand-name perfume? Even the most conscientious shoppers feel shocked when they learn what's in their perfume collection. Brand-name fragrance companies rely on technically safe chemical ingredients to increase their profits, but you can outsmart them by learning about the most popular, all-natural perfume lines. When you're ready to invest in a new sustainable perfume brand, check out these leading companies. They have rigorous production methods and eco-friendly values, resulting in sustainable ingredients you can feel confident wearing. What toxic ingredients are hiding in most perfumes? Perfumes contain more than rose water and sandalwood. They can also have long lists of chemicals that trigger health conditions and pollute the planet. Some of the most common [are carcinogens and toxic chemicals](https://www.safecosmetics.org/resources/health-science/fragrance-disclosure/) such as: - Phthalates - - Benzyl acetate - Musk ketone - Methylene chloride Spraying traditional perfume exposes you to these chemicals and may also affect those around you. The particles could irritate lung tissue for people with breathing conditions, even if you sprayed it on in a different room. Chemical compounds in perfumes contain strong scents that remain potent long after application. Since [over 300 million people have asthma](https://www.thorasys.com/resources/effect-of-extrafine-formulation-of-bdp-ff-inhaler-on-asthma-control-small-airway-function-and-airway-inflammation) and even more have other lung-related conditions, avoiding harmful ingredients that trigger breathing problems is sustainable and compassionate. All you need to know is how to read the ingredient list with each new potential perfume brand. What is the best natural alternative to perfume? If you want to skip the perfume aisle altogether, there's another alternative you can try. Many people make homemade essential oil blends. Essential oils are derived directly from natural sources like flowers, fruits, and more. They're nontoxic and all-natural, but they're also potent. You'll need to dilute them with various ingredients so they don't irritate your skin. You can find various recipes for sprays and lotions that don't utilize any chemicals. Just use caution when creating new fragrances. Trusted and certified aromatherapists will show you how to use essential oils safely since many can be too potent when misused. Pick your favorite scent with expert guidance and you'll be minutes away from an eco-friendly, homemade product. You can make a scent that's unique to you and also make memorable gifts for your friends and family. How can I tell if a perfume is safe to wear? It's a good idea to avoid perfume products described as a fragrance. The bottle or other packaging should list the individual ingredients. If it doesn't, the company likely cut costs by using unsustainable and toxic chemicals. You can also tell if a perfume is safe to wear by learning about the individual brands. Although any product on a store shelf passed the testing phase, companies have unique mission statements that advertise their beliefs. Green or sustainable efforts mean the ingredients are more likely to align with eco-friendly values. This post is about non toxic & natural perfume brands. Best Non Toxic Perfume Brands [1.
