The brain is neuroplastic, we help you to rewire your brain, process and complete your past traumas and regain your organic and true power. We use a 'Bottum Up\" approach and work with both your Neurophysiology and your Psychology to heal repetitive negative behaviours and symptoms that are based in past traumas. Helping to heal emotional pain and traumatic stress, by using many integrated techniques/modalities to treat the impact of trauma, whether it is recent, past or intergenerational. Our Modalities [SOMATIC EXPERIENCING (SE)](/somatic-experiencing) Is a form of therapy aimed at treating trauma and stressor-related disorders like PTSD. The primary goal of SE is to modify the trauma-related stress response. To achieve this, its major interventional strategy builds on bottom-up processing. The client's attention is directed to internal sensations, (interoception, proprioception and kinesthesis), rather than to primarily cognitive or emotional experiences. It was developed by trauma therapist [Peter A. Levine](https://www.somaticexperiencing.com/about-peter)). Brainspotting Therapy is a Powerful Modality for Healing Trauma and Emotional Stress. This therapy can access the root cause of trauma, emotional issues and addiction. Brainspotting is defined as an advanced brain-body therapy that focuses on identifying, processing, and releasing trauma, mental health imbalances and residual emotional stress. Brainspotting therapy has roots in Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) and similarly supports the reprocessing of negative experiences and retrains emotional reactions. Both approaches include bilateral stimulation, compassionate attunement and brain-body processing. We can use Brainspotting in conjunction with other modalities or solely on its own. SAFE & SOUND PROTOCOL (STEPHEN PORGES) The Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP), a non-invasive application of Polyvagal Theory, is an auditory intervention designed to reduce stress and auditory sensitivity while enhancing social engagement and resilience. By calming the physiological and emotional state, SSP can open the door for improved communication and more successful therapy. This non-invasive intervention involves listening to music that has been processed specifically to retune the nervous system (regulating state) to introduce a sense of safety and the ability to socially engage. This allows the client to better interpret not only human speech but, importantly, the emotional meaning of language. Once interpersonal interactions improve, spontaneous social behaviours and an enhanced ability to learn, self-regulate and engage are often seen. identity oriented psychotrauma therapy (IoPT) IoPT or Identity Orientated Psychotrauma Therapy is the work developed by [Dr. Franz Ruppert ](https://www.franz-ruppert.de/england)over the past 30 years. This method explores how early pre-verbal and non-verbal trauma, developmental trauma, and trans-generational trauma has been split off, and how it can impact on our core unique being. Our psyche is affected by unconscious splits which, through this process, can be seen, acknowledged and integrated. There are aspects of us which are hidden away, and present as the traumatised split parts, which are compensated for by coping and survival strategies. IoPT is a methodology which brings us into contact with these traumatised and survival parts . Where we aim to experience the unfolding from our 'healthy self', our resourced parts. Re- Integrating with out true identity makes us stronger and embodied, with a new clarity on being our authentic selves. IoPT method gives us insights to our many parts though the representation of others in the classical sense of systemic constellation work. comprehensive resource model (CRM)\u00ae Is a neuro-biologically based, affect-focused trauma treatment model which facilitates targeting of traumatic experiences by bridging the most primitive aspects of the person and their brain (midbrain/brainstem), to their purest, healthiest parts of the self. This bridge catalyzes the mind and body to access all forms of emotional trauma and stress by utilizing layers of internal resources such as attachment neurobiology, breathwork skills, somatic resources, our connection to the natural world, toning and sacred geometry, and one's relationship with self, our intuition, and higher consciousness. The sequencing and combination of these resources, and the eye positions that anchor them, provide the opportunity for unbearable emotions and pain to be stepped into and felt fully while the client is fully present and aware moment to moment which changes how the memories affect the person. OUR INTEGRATED approach By integrating the above modalities into our practice, we use a 'bottom up' body-orientated approach to healing trauma, integrating the aspects - body, mind, emotion, spirit and nervous system. The body Working with mindfulness, health, wellbeing, and looking at the bioenergetic system according to Chinese Medicine (five elements and meridians). The mind Accessing subconscious beliefs and thinking patterns that have created repetitive behaviours and patterns you want to change, pattern recognition and neural reprogramming coaching. The emotions Working with suppressed unexpressed emotions from childhood and preverbal traumas and learning to be safe about feeling states. We hold a space for healthy expression and integration of emotions. The Spirit Understanding what happens to your spirit (life force/soul/qi / prana) in our journey of life is vital to integrating your life force back into the body for full establishment of your personal power. There is a system of loss that occurs when we experience shocks and traumas and there are methods to get your spirit back. This takes understanding of how it was lost and what challenges are required to re-establish this connection with self and oneness so you can participate in the full evolution of who you are. We can guide you to these challenges and walk you through them if you choose to evolve in this way. The Nervous System Casey and Carly work with the physiological resolution of trauma in the brain and nervous system completion of shut down defensive responses, release of emotions associated with trauma and re-establishing regulation in the nervous system. The outcome is to regain a cohesive sense of self and feel powerful again. Generally each session falls into the realm of body centred psychotherapy Somatic Experiencing (body centered trauma resolution work), but also combines techniques like inner child work or identity oriented constellation [(IoPT)](https://www.iopt.no/en/what-is-iopt/) depending on what is needed in order to reconnect you with your personal power, free up your mind and live in a sense of emotional wellbeing and presence.
