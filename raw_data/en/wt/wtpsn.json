Introduction Patenting activity represents a significant investment of resource by the patent applicant (research and development, legal fees, patent costs etc) and analysis of patenting activity provides a window into innovation investments by company / country / category etc. Patent activity information can be a valuable resource for manufacturers looking to enter into new markets, revealing innovation trends for the market, potential competitors or partners and new technology opportunities. This report contains an analysis of China's patent data and focusses on innovation in the premium dairy space. The work was conducted as part of an ARC (Australian Research Council) funded collaborative research project with Mondelez Australia, The University of Melbourne and Swinburne University of Technology. This report was prepared to demonstrate new intellectual property searching capabilities developed within the project for the Australian food industry. The analysis contained within this report was conducted using a combination of consumer identified 'premium' attribute keywords, premium enabling technologies and materials. Premium attributes were the focus of this research as premium products represent the best export value opportunity for the Australian food manufacturer. The Consumer 'premium' attributes were derived from a series of product assessment sessions conducted with Chinese and Malaysian consumers in market. This novel searching strategy developed by the project team is summarised below: This searching methodology varies considerably from more traditional IP search methods in that search terms are defined through consumer research rather than traditional food category or technology led searching strategies. This novel method enables the capture of innovation trends that may not be apparent when using more traditional searching regimes. Whilst the consumer-identified premium attributes were being built into a keyword set for patent searching purposes, The University of Melbourne and Swinburne University teams collected top line patent data from Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Japan, Korea and the Philippines. This data was subsequently incorporated into a single searchable database. This database captures much of the intellectual property assets of Asia Pacific and will be further enriched as the collaborative research project continues over the next 2 years. The combination of consumer identified premium searching criteria and an Asian intellectual property database has been used to generate the 'premium' dairy innovation opportunity landscape for China reported herein. Opportunity areas are identified and discussed for the Australian manufacturers' consideration. 2. Method 2.1 Premium Search criteria development During 2013 several in-market consumer research sessions were conducted in Malaysia and China using methodology based on Qualitative Multivariate Analysis1. (QMA). In brief, groups of consumers were presented with a range of commercially available food products and asked to place the items onto a desktop XY plot, x ranging from everyday to premium and y ranging from healthy to indulgent. Respondents evaluated the products in a holistic way, based on the whole experience - brand, packaging and product tasting. Consumers were then interviewed regarding their positioning of the samples. Interview questions were designed to determine the product attributes that created the perception of premium. The consumer responses were collated and analysed to capture and distil the 'premium' product attributes. An example dairy QMA plot is detailed below: Results of the premium attribute interviews are summarised below: The search terms eventually incorporated into the Asian intellectual property database were created through an iterative process, building on the original outputs of the consumer research conducted in 2013. The search term development process is outlined below: Using the initial set of consumer-identified premium attributes, a set of key word search criteria was generated and subsequently used to search commercially available patent data systems (Thomson Innovation) for premium enabling patents. A manual interrogation of the resulting patents records for relevance was conducted with additional keywords identified and added to the keyword set to improve the capture of relevant patents. This attribute based keyword set was then combined with a broad-based understanding of relevant premium enabling technology from both within and outside of the food industry. These technologies were identified through a review of the complete IPC code set. Relevant technologies were incorporated into search criteria as keywords and IPC codes/ subclasses* *IPC code = the international patent classification system administered by the WIPO. More information can be found at http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ This enriched keyword and IPC code set was then used to search Asian patent data (ie English translations of abstracts for China, Korea, and Japan), and again search results were interrogated manually and the key word filters enriched in order to capture the descriptors used in Asian patent data and reduce any bias in the search criteria. For example; encapsulation technology was found to have universally applicable key words, - searches on Asian or European patent data had good hit rates for relevant patents. Searching on key words relating to mouth coating and mouth clearing did not generate high hit rates for Asian patent data and a number of different descriptor terms were identified through manual interrogation of Asian patents. These were then used to enrich the final search terms sets. Upon completion of the premium search criteria development, the enriched search criteria were built into a series of SQL queries that form part of The University of Melbourne and Swinburne University IP database. 2.2 Asian Intellectual Property Database development As described previously the University of Melbourne research team visited Asian patent offices during 2013 and were able to establish relationships with a number of Asian patent offices, then once relationships were established they were able to arrange access and permission to duplicate patent records. The team incorporated Asian Patstat (the EPO worldwide patent statistical database) data, with the data obtained directly from countries not contributing to Patstat (Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia). The team also incorporated translation capabilities into the database for Indonesian Bahasa. The current database statistics are summarised below; this data set will continue to be expanded as the ARC project continues, and currently the project team is working on incorporating India's patent data. The data will also be updated on an annual basis for the duration of the project. Asian Intellectual property database: summary of record data 2.3 China dairy innovation landscape It should also be noted the search criteria developed for the project is not based on a single food category. Rather it covers food in general and incorporates a number of technologies originating outside of the food industry. In order to generate this report focussed on 'premium' dairy innovation in China, the Chinese patent data set was interrogated using the enriched search terms with the results subsequently refined further using material keywords to capture patents relevant to the dairy industry in China. The search scope for this report included abstracts for patent applications from 1999 to 2014 with CN (China) authority - irrespective of granting. The search criteria categories used for the Premium Dairy search are summarised below: Attributes Technologies Materials Naturalness Multi-texture Mouth clearing Mouth coating Health Beauty Edible Comestible Food Encapsulation Flavour extraction Extraction Pressing Natural preservation Antioxidant Sweetening Concentrating Effervescence Aeration Carbonation Foam stabilisation Therapeutic preparations Mixing Dissolving Applying fluent material to a surface Moulding Fatty acid production Vinegar production Fermentation (for specific chemicals) Enzyme processes Probiotics Drying Traditional Chinese medicines Yoghurt Cheese Milk Milk powder Ice cream 3. Results As a significant number of patent records were generated using the search method described, results were reviewed manually and a representative sample set of premium enabling patents were collated into the table found in Appendix 1. Analysis conducted for the premium dairy innovation landscape reported herein include consumer benefit, innovation themes and Top 15 companies filing in the premium dairy space. 3.1 Consumer benefit analysis Patents claiming consumer benefits were identified from manual review of abstract text and have been summarised in the table below: Benefit Investment in Dairy (China) TCM = Traditional Chinese medicine Consumer benefit Analysis - Opportunities for the Australian dairy manufacturer looking to export : A number of consumer benefit areas were identified that differ from current Australian dairy market trends. Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM ) are found in a large number of dairy formulations alongside a range of health and wellbeing claims. These ingredients have a long history and credibility with the Chinese consumer and are a potential source of new functional ingredients for flavouring and product preservation as well as a route to accessing perceived additional health benefits for dairy products. The addition of TCMs to dairy products for the Australian market may not make commercial sense, but for producers designing products for export there may be significant opportunities. Health Claims -Some patents made diabetes and cardiovascular health claims for a number of ingredients and whilst it is outside of the scope of this report to investigate the validity of these claims, based on clinical data or Chinese regulatory compliance, ingredients with claims supported by clinical data generated by Chinese authorities may have potential for export products destined for China. It should also be noted patenting of ingredient formulations can often pre-date regulatory approvals. Fortification was also a common theme with examples of ice confectionary product fortified with vitamins and protein. Fortification may be an opportunity area, however confirmation of the Chinese regulatory requirements for fortification of dairy products would be recommended. Potential Novel Ingredients - Some examples of the functional ingredients referenced in Chinese dairy formulations are tabulated below alongside the claims made within the patent abstracts for manufacturer consideration. It should be noted TCM ingredients are numerous and a full review of potential TCM ingredients was outside the scope of this report: Ingredients Claim Chromium Hypoglycaemia Discorea opposite Improved nutrition and health Eicosapentaenoic acid Cardiovascular health Fish collagen and acetamido glucose For skin benefits Lactobacillius and lycine For prevention of fatty liver Lactobacillus delbrueckii Streptococcus thermophilus OLS3059 improvement heart health - degrades cholesterol Momordica grosvenori For health and longevity Pericarpium citri reticulatae Invigorating spleen and promoting digestion Red date - Jujube Familiar flavor and improved nutrition Ingredients Claim Soybean and peanut balanced beverage Yizhijiannao effect-improved cognitive function for aged Vitamin A & D and Calcium for bone health bone health for children Flavours were also a significant opportunity space that will be discussed in more detail in 3.2. 3.2 Dairy innovation themes in China Relevant premium patents were classified by category (cheese, milk, yoghurt and ice cream) and the major innovation themes below moving from incremental innovation through to potentially disruptive innovation. The innovation landscape was prepared to facilitate comparison with Australian dairy market innovation and is presented below: Premium Dairy innovation China Upon reviewing the landscape it was found there were significant differences in the innovation spaces being secured for the Chinese consumer (by Chinese Dairy producers) versus the Australian premium dairy market. In order to set context for the detailed patent innovation landscape analysis an overview of the Chinese dairy market today is provided overleaf. The summary data on the current Chinese dairy market was collated from a variety of sources including Consumer research conducted with The University of Melbourne, Mondelez Food Innovation centre, (unpublished) Mintel and Leatherhead food research patent perspectives 2 and Euromonitor 3. For Australian dairy suppliers looking to export value added product to the Chinese market, a review of the current Chinese dairy market and potential future innovation trends revealed through patenting activity, can inform export product development choices. The current market review also reveals some challenges for entry into China's dairy market. The application of combined opportunity area identification and areas of potential challenge can significantly de-risk innovation activity for businesses looking to move into new markets. The Chinese Dairy market today Cultural unfamiliarity can be a significant barrier for market entry. Cheese has little dietary history for the Chinese market and needs to overcome a number of issues with flavour and fat content. For those considering market entry with unfamiliar products there may need to be work on an introduction strategy to make the unfamiliar - familiar. Plain/ Flavoured Milks UHT is dominate. Fresh and ESL are interchangeable. Providence, Green, Safe are important. Traditional Milks are very white, creamy and sweet. Healthier Milks are more watery, more mouth clearing. Fresh and Lactose Free are big benefits. Flavoured Milks are Sweetness and creaminess are expected in flavoured milks. Flavourings are provided by small amount of juice. Being an Australian product carries strong 'organic' credentials (even if not so according to AU standards).Yogurt Drinking Yogurt is more common than spoon able. Gut health is a key benefit. Calcium, Vitamins and source of protein are newer benefits. Everyday appears to be driven by green packaging, more processed, thinner textures. Indulgent yogurts are flavoured and sweeter Greek yogurts are just entering the market. Silky smooth textures, lower fat, sweeter and more fruit versions are key drivers of interest. Cheese Cheese is such an unfamiliar category that potential key entry options could be focused around food service Consumers quickly focused on the aroma of cheese. Strong cheese aroma is unappealing and so a barrier for them. Goat cheese makes sense to them, fits with more strongly flavoured meals (i.e. Western China flavourful, spicy meals). Processed cheese or 'nailao' (milk jelly) is \"new world\" cheese. Fresh, flavourful cheese is \"old world\" or European. Fat is a major issue, cheese does not have the health halo of milk.Dairy product familiarity The Future - Chinese premium dairy market trends (patent landscape analysis) An Overview of the dairy innovation trends of Australian vs. China is provided below - moving from left to right in terms of simple incremental innovation to more disruptive innovation looking at new products for new consumers and purposes. Innovation opportunities (incremental - disruptive ) Detailed analysis of innovation trends from premium Chinese dairy patents; Dairy Beverages Chinese consumers show increasing concern about the quality of milk they consume This has contributed to a shift towards premium products - brands can benefit from the perception that \"the higher the price, the higher the quality\". Increasing awareness of the benefits of freshness, natural or organic products Yoghurt Functional yoghurts, are growing in popularity, with the rising incidence of lifestyle- related health concerns. As consumers become more savvy, manufacturers claims are supported by certified scientific studies rather than being based purely on product positioning or advertising Cheese Cheese is a niche category in China; not traditional and seen to have a pungent smell and taste However, cheese is gaining popularity among children, reflecting a rising consumer awareness of its nutritious value Widespread urbanisation means exposure to Western-style fast food, which will function as a bridge between Chinese people and the culture of cheese consumption Source: Euromonitor International, Oct 2014 Level of Familiarity Flavour formulations for milk-based beverages differed widely from the traditional strawberry, chocolate, and banana varieties found on the Australian supermarket shelf. Fruit juice and milk combinations were coupled with carbonation or processes to make milk more translucent / thinner common (image to the left is a carbonated milk based beverage with melon juice). Non- western flavourings for ice-cream included carrot, sesame, black tea and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), with the TCMs adding flavouring coupled with perceived health benefits. Fermented flavour was also being extracted from fermented products to be added to other products for improving product taste. It was also noted there was significant activity in the cheese area around making cheese taste \"better.\" Cheese is not a traditional dietary ingredient for Chinese consumers and language within the Chinese patent data included references to unpleasant pungent foreign cheese and creating a more delicate flavour through the addition of rice, rice wine and soybean. Functional products included a wide range of innovations with a number of patents related to the addition of vegetable proteins into milk bases (image to the right is a milk powder with added peanut protein). Complex combinations of TCMs were incorporated into a number of wellbeing type products for balancing \"Qi\" and tonifying Yang . There were also additives with specific health claims on ingredients for cardiovascular health and diabetes and additionally a significant list of digestion/probiotic claims for a variety of lactobacillus strains. Fermented whey based beverages were also a new area for the Australian market, and manufacture of these beverages may be an opportunity to value add to Australian dairy whey waste streams. Beauty Design of Dairy products for beauty was another new area for Australian dairy innovation that may be worth exploring furthers .A number of products already exist in the Chinese market. The image to the left is a daily milk beverage enriched with 5500mg hydrolysed marine collagen and L-Arginine, Polysaccharide of Silver Ear mushroom (Tremella fuciformis), essential vitamins, C, A, E, B complex and D3. Other formulation includes a milk base enriched with collagen and ceramide and other patents/products include claims made on specific bacterial strains e.g. Streptococcus thermophiles. Chinese beauty product formats included beverages and tablets. 3.3 Analysis of companies filing patents in the premium space Analysis of Chinese applicant data can be challenging due to multiple inventors holding the same name. Although there are thousands of Chinese family names, the 100 most common, which together make up less than 5% of those in existence, are shared by 85% of the population. For ease of analysis only company applicants have been included in this analysis. Tabulated overleaf are the top 15 applicants for premium patents in order of decreasing patent activity. Interestingly it was observed the majority of patent activity was filed with Chinese owned companies. Large international players (Coca Cola, Danone, Nestl\u00e9 etc.) are patenting in China but the record hits relating to premium dairy products were few. Top 15 applicants 1.

It is speculated the lack of international companies appearing in the premium searches may be indication of their innovations strategies differing from Chinese commonages 4. Conclusion Preparation of this case study demonstrated the effectiveness of the consumer led premium attribute searching developed within the project with several opportunity areas identified within this report. The searching technique allowed the premium enabling patents to bubble to the surface whilst maintaining a broad view of the current dairy innovation patent landscape for China. A subsequent validation exercise conducted using traditional IPC classification searching filters coupled with technology key words had a reduced hit rate for premium enabling technologies along with less opportunity for discovery of unexpected opportunity spaces. There remains scope to continue to enrich the key words with unexpected innovation areas emerging during the search e.g. the patents concerning specific fermenting bacteria strains with very specific health claims. The consumer defined attributes could also be expanded to include other consumer experiences depending on the manufacturers' innovation strategy. There also remains significant scope to further investigate TCM ingredients as potential new ingredients for the Chinese market -a deeper understanding of in market consumer recognition of ingredients and benefits would facilitate selection of ingredients for incorporation into dairy products. The right ingredient selection could enhance dairy product appeal to the Chinese consumer and access to premium price points. References 1.
