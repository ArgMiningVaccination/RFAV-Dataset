What is Acupuncture Acupuncture is an eastern medicine used to treat [pain](https://www.rennwellness.com/acupuncture/acupuncture-for-pain.html), [stress](https://www.rennwellness.com/acupuncture/acupuncture-for-stress.html), [anxiety](https://www.rennwellness.com/acupuncture-for-depression-and-anxiety.html), [depression](https://www.rennwellness.com/acupuncture-for-depression-and-anxiety.html), [insomnia](https://www.rennwellness.com/acupuncture-for-insomnia.html), and many other conditions. The theory behind acupuncture is based on the belief that there are channels of energy throughout the human body that connect all body parts. These channels are known as [meridians](https://www.rennwellness.com/blog/what-is-qi.html). When the energy flows along these meridians, it helps maintain good health. Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese practice that involves inserting fine, sterile, single-use needles into specific points on the body to stimulate energy flow through those areas. Find Out Why We Stand Out From The Rest: \"He's outlined a course of treatment and the front desk staff was easy going and helpful in explaining insurance and payment options.\" (Yelp) Beth G. How Often Should I Get Acupuncture Treatments? The answer depends on how much qi energy is being blocked. After your [first acupuncture evaluation](https://www.rennwellness.com/what-to-expect-during-your-first-visit.html), our acupuncturist will let you know her recommendation, and you will learn how your body responds after your first treatment. In general, acupuncture takes about 30-60 minutes per treatment. However, some people may feel immediate relief, and their symptoms are resolved after just a few treatments. The theory behind acupuncture is that these meridians are believed to carry life force energy called qi, and illness or symptoms may occur when blocked. The flow of energy is restored by unblocking the flow of energy at specific points along the meridian's, and our patients feels better.

How Can You Benefit From an Acupuncture Treatment There are many reasons people choose to receive acupuncture treatment. Many find it helpful for relieving pain, improving sleep quality, and reducing stress levels. Others use it as part of a holistic approach to wellness, incorporating it into their diet and lifestyle choices. Regardless of the reason you choose acupuncture, the aim of acupuncture is to restore balance in your body holistically. Patients are often surprised at improved mood symptoms after acupuncture treatment. They may feel calm, happy or report enhanced mental clarity. Some Western research studies have found that acupuncture can lower stress hormone levels which explains this potential benefit of feeling improved mood. 5215 N.

Acupuncture Helps Your Body Heal Itself Our Acupuncturists are part of our team of providers at Ravenswood Chiropractic & Wellness Center, an evidence-based practice in Chicago, Illinois.

We are located in the heart of the Andersonville neighborhood in Chicago. We offer [traditional Acupuncture Work? Acupuncture is based on the theory that there are channels through which energy flows throughout the body. These channels are known as meridians. According to traditional Chinese medicine, these channels are connected to organs and glands, and when they become blocked, illness results. In addition to acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine includes herbal remedies, dietary changes, massage, meditation, and qi gong exercises that work together to unblock meridians so qi can move freely throughout your body and promote physical and emotional healing for your whole body.

What Does Acupuncture Feel Like? Does It Hurt? The word acupuncture comes from two Chinese characters meaning needle and channel. It refers to the insertion of fine, sterilized, single-use metal needles into specific points (acu-points) on the body. These points correspond to energy pathways known as meridians. The needles are about the thickness of a hair, which is much smaller than needles used for blood draws. Many patients report that they do not feel the needles when inserted, just the flow of energy, like a warmness, once the needles are in place. There are lots of [alternatives to needles](https://www.rennwellness.com/acupuncture/afraid-of-needles.html) allowing you to get the same great benefits of acupuncture without the needles.
