organs, cells and tissues that protect the body from infection with p athogenic microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and parasites. The immu ne response can be divided into two arms: innate immunity and adaptive immunit y. Innate immunity serves as a first line of defense and lacks the ability to disc riminate between pathogens, to generate memory against the pathogen and to provide protection during re- exposure. Adaptive immunity is based on selection o f individual clonal populations of lymphocytes bearing highly diverse antigen-bindi ng receptors that confers to the immune system the capacity to recognize a large var iety of foreign antigens. Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells are a uniqu e lineage of T lymphocytes. iNKT cells recognize glycolipids, rather than peptides, in the context of CD1d molecules. The TCR responsible for the antigen recognition is composed of an invariant V chain paired with a restricted set of V chains. Recognition of self antigens account for the peculiar functional charachteristics of iNK T cells, i.e. the prompt release of cytokines and the effector functions which are imme diately active upon antigen challenge. 1.2 The CD1 system In the last decade it has been demonstrated that T lymphocytes can recognize not only peptides in the context of MHC-Class I and -Cl ass II molecules, but also foreign and endogenous lipids in association with t he non-classical MHC class I- like CD1 molecules. This finding shed new light on the complexity of the immune 22 recognition and on its capacity to sense and respon d to a broader array of molecules. The human CD1 gene family is composed of five nonpo lymorphic genes (CD1A,- B,-C,-D, and -E) located in a cluster on chromosome 1 [1], while mice express only two CD1D orthologs located on chromosome 3. It has been proposed that CD1 genes evolved by duplication and neofunctionalizati on of an MHC I gene before the bird-mammalian divergence. From an evolutionary poi nt of view, the presence of an antigen presenting molecule capable of binding l ipids instead of peptides offered a new weapon against bacterial infections [ 2]. In fact, whereas MHC I molecules specialized to present peptides derived f rom cytosolic antigens, CD1 trafficking pathways have evolved to acquire antige n in the endocytic pathway, and intersect those pathways utilized by a diverse rang e of intracellular pathogens. Human CD1 molecules were originally classified on t he basis of sequence identities into two groups: group 1 composed by CD1 a, CD1b, and CD1c and group 2 composed by CD1d [1]. CD1e belongs to a thi rd group of CD1 molecules and it is not an antigen presenting molecule, but r ather a Lipid Transfer Protein (LTP). 1.2.1 Structure of CD1 molecules CD1 are glycosylated proteins structurally similar to MHC class I molecules and this might explain the capacity of the TCR to interact with both types of molecules. CD1 molecules form a stable, noncovalent ly associated heterodimer with beta 2-microglobulin ( 2m) of approximately 49 kDa. Like MHC class I, the ectodomains, or CD1 heavy chains, are organized int o three domains, 1, 2 and 3, and anchored in the cell membrane by a transmemb rane domain. The 3- domain is highly conserved among all isotypes, prob ably due to the necessity to 23 maintain the association with 2m. 1 and 2 domains form the central lipid binding groove of each CD1 isotype and differ from one anot her in primary amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure. CD1a, CD1 b and CD1d binding grooves are composed of two main pockets, named A' and F' [3]. CD1b has an additional C' pocket and T' tunnel that connects th e A' and F' pockets [4]. The central binding groove is surrounded by two anti-pa rallel -helices ( 1 and 2), which sit on top of a six-stranded -sheet platform. The binding groove is deeper and narrower than the cleft binding peptides in cla ssical MHC class I or II molecules [5]. The pockets and tunnels are formed b y hydrophobic amino acids that interact with the lipid backbone of all CD1 an tigens. The hydrophilic headgroups of lipid antigens, instead, are exposed to the cell surface and can interact with the TCR. Although the overall three-d imensional structures of individual members of the CD1 family are similar, a mino acid substitutions are responsible for shaping the individual grooves and for the formation of isotype- specific pockets ( Figure 1 , left panel). The size and depth of pockets and tunnels of the va rious CD1 molecules allow the binding of different lipids. For example, CD1a has the smallest binding groove among all CD1 and the A' pocket has a particular bl unt-ended conformation [6]. On the contrary, human CD1b has the largest binding gr oove among the CD1 proteins. Thus, long chain fatty acids up to approximately C 80 can be accommodated into CD1b molecules [7]. Recent observations suggested that endogenous short -chain fatty acid can behave prior to higher-aff inity ligand bindig. As predicted, a recent crystal structure revealed a CD1b binging groove stabilized by a C32-C36 endogenous phosphatidylcholine (PC) in combination with a C41-44 spacer lipid to fill the empty binding space inside the molecule [8 ]. 24 The first crystal structure of mouse CD1d was obtai ned in 1997 and described only the two A' and F' pockets [3]. Since natively folde d CD1d never appear with empty binding grooves, it seems plausible that a pocket-s tabilizing factor is bound until it is replaced with another antigen during its traffic king through various intracellular compartments. More recent structures of human and m ouse CD1d revealed a complex hydrogen-bonding network responsible for th e orientation and the high affinity binding of lipid antigens inside the groov e [9-14]( Figure 1 , right panel). As shown for CD1b, CD1d molecules produced in insect c ells contain phosphatidylcholin (PC) as stabilizer lipid [12]; a lso in the CD1d crystal structures of Zajonc [15] and Wu [11] was identified a lipid i n the A' pocket consisting of an endogenously acquired palmitic acid. This finding d emonstrated that, also for CD1d, relatively short ligands can be accommodated in the A' pocket toghether with stabilizing lipids. It is interesting to specu late that these spacers could have the function of stabilizing the whole structure dur ing protein maturation and trafficking through the different cellular compartm ents. The crystal structure of CD1e is not available yet. Like other CD1 molecules, CD1e is noncovalently associated with 2m. Its -chain is cleaved between the 3 and the transmembrane domains in late endosomal compart ments, generating soluble CD1e, which is the CD1e active form [16, 17]. A rec ent model suggests that CD1e binds glycolipids in a central cavity, similar to t he binding of other CD1 members [16]. 25 Figure 1 . Schematic representation of CD1 structures (left panel). Structure of CD1d bound to GalCer (right panel). 1.2.2 Tissue distribution of CD1 molecules MHC Class I and MHC Class II molecules distribution among cells reflects the different effector functions of the T cells that re cognize them. MHC Class I molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells, thu s allowing the recognition of infected cells by cytotoxic CD8 T cells. MHC class II molecules are expressed only 26 by professional antigen presenting cells (APC) and by thymic stromal cells. Recognition of MHC II:peptide complexes by CD4 T ce lls induces the full functional activation of the APC. CD1 molecules, although structurally similar to MHC Class I molecules, are expressed only on cells of the hematopoietic compar tment, thus resembling MHC Class II molecules expression. Group 1 CD1a-, -b and -c molecules are expressed on on DP CD4 +CD8 + cortical 19]. cells express CD1a, [ 20]. While CD1a and CD1b peripheral expression is restricted to DCs, CD1c is also expressed by B cells (50% of peripheral blood B and marginal zone B cells)[21 ]. During differentiation of monocytes with GM-CSF, expression of CD1a, CD1b, an d CD1c is induced and either upregulated (CD1b and c) or downregulated (C D1a) following DC maturation [22, 23]. Interestingly, group 1 CD1 molecules are not expressed on the surface of macrophages, thus rendering cross-priming and subse quent presentation by DCs essential in the case of infection by intracellular pathogens like M. tuberculosis . Human and mouse CD1d molecules are expressed by mos t cells of hematopoietic lineage, although the highest levels of expression are found on APC, like B cells and monocytes. hCD1d is thimo cytes, na\u00efve periphe ral T cells; hCD1d is re- expressed upon activation of peripheral T cells [24 ]. In mice, thymocytes, thymic s [25, 27-29]. In the lymph node, hCD1d is expressed on DCs in the paraco rtical T cell zones and on mantle zone B cells, but not on cells of the germin al center [24]. High mCD1d expression is also detected on splenic marginal zon e B cells [25]. hCD1d and 27 mCD1d have also been detected in different cells, l ike epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and keratinocytes [19]. hCD1d is also expressed on several tumors[30-32]. Expression of CD1d molecules can be enhanced by cyt okines, such as IFN , IFN and TNF- triggering retinoic acid synthesis in human DC [ 34]. Several pathogens can modulate CD1d expression levels. In infections to the Golgi of immature DCs, then i n the lysosomes upon maturation, where it is cleaved into a soluble form [38]. CD1e never reaches the plasma membrane. Its strict intracellular localizat ion excludes any direct interaction with T cells, thus precluding any role as antigen p resenting molecule. CD1e, instead, is required for lysosomal degradation of p hosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM) 6 and subsequent activation of CD1b-restricted T cel ls [16]. 2. Assembly, trafficking and loading of CD1 molecul es 2.1 ER assembly CD1 assembly and N-glycosylation takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Newly synthesized CD1 molecules are associated to t he calnexin and calreticulin chaperones [39] which bind -2m-free CD1d heavy chains, but not -2m-bound. The opposite occurs with MHC class I molecules. CD1 d, unlike CD1b, may also traffic to the plasma membrane in the absence of -2m [40]. Association with the thiol reductase ERp57 is important for the formatio n of disulfide bonds within the 28 CD1 heavy chain prior to assembly with -2m [41]. The fully oxidized CD1d heavy chains dissociate from the chaperones, and the majo rity of CD1d heavy chains bind -2m before exiting the ER [42]. Assembly of CD1 mol ecules is independent of transporter associated with antigen processing ( TAP), as expression of CD1 is not affected by TAP deficiencies [43]. Before assembly, it is possible that CD1 molecules become loaded with self ER- resident lipid ligands. Human and mouse CD1d assemb le in the ER with cellular nascent CD1d ass ociates with phosphatidylcholine (PC)[12]. Two recent papers att empted to identify which lipids are bound to hCD1d molecules. One study described 1 77 lipid species and among these lipids, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipid s were identified [45]. Using a different approach, namely the analysis of a solubl e secreted hCD1d and of ER- retained or recycling hCD1d, a second study confirm ed that phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant lipid bound to CD1d, together wit h sphingomyelin and lysophospholipids [46]. Microsomal triglyceride tra nsfer protein (MTP) is an ER- resident LTP that is essential for lipidation of ap olipoprotein B (apoB) and thus for assembly of very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chilomicrons [47]. MTP is critical for proper assembly and antigen presentati on function of CD1d, probably by facilitating the loading of the first endogenous li pid onto CD1d in the ER [19, 48, 49]. MTP is also involved in the functioning of gro up 1 CD1 molecules, by regulating lipid antigen presentation [50]. 2.2 Trafficking After exiting the ER, CD1 molecules traffic to the cell surface following the secretory pathway before being re-internalized into the endosomal compartments. The presence in CD1 -b, and -d of a cyt oplasmic sorting tyrosine 29 domain (YXXZ, where Y is a Tyr, X, any amino acid a nd Z a bulky hydrophobic residue) allows the binding to the specific adaptor protein (AP) complex AP-2. AP-2 is a component of clathrin-coated pits and induces endocytosis of CD1 molecules and other transmembrane cargo proteins [51]. Trafficking of the different CD1 molecules trough t he endocytic compartments mirrors their capacity to sample lipid antigens whi ch, according to their chemical properties, penetrate different endosomal compartme nts. CD1a does not contain any apparent sorting motifs i n its cytoplasmic tail. CD1a molecules undergo a cycle of internalization into e arly/sorting endosomes followed by early/recycling endosomes, where they sample dis tinct sets of antigens before returning to the cell surface[52, 53]. Recently it has been shown that CD1a associates with the invariant chain. This interacti on facilitates CD1a recycling and seems to regulate CD1a antigen presentation [54, 55 ]. Also CD1c molecules have been shown to traffic to early recycling endosomes and co-localize with early recycling compartment markers [52, 56] where CD1b i s almost absent [52]. Instead, CD1b is found in late endosomal/lysosomal vesicles, including the MHC class II compartments (MIIC), and with the Lysosome-Associated Membrane Protein-1 (LAMP-1)[52]. CD1b and CD1d molecules both recycle in late endoso mal/lysosomal compartments. They can both recycle via association with the MHC class II-Ii complex [57] and it has been proposed a role for th e adaptor protein complex-3 (AP-3) in their recycling [58-61]. CD1c is also pre sent in the lysosomes [62], but does not bind to AP-3 [58]. mCD1d is stable through all endocytic compartments, differently by other CD1 molecules. Probably this r eflects the fact that CD1d is the only CD1 molecule present in the mouse and therefor e it has evolved and acquired the capacity to sample lipids in different compartm ents [63](Brenner 2009, 5 th NKT and CD1 meeting, Kamakura, Japan). 30 CD1e trafficking is different from other CD1 molecu les, as it does not reach the plasma membrane, and maturation of DC modifies its localization [38]. In immature DC, membrane-bound CD1e is localized in the Golgi s talk, and upon maturation traffics to late endosomal compartments where it be comes soluble [16, 17]. The cytoplasmic domain of CD1e consists of 53 to 61 ami no acids, and does not contain any specific targeting motif, but is essent ial to its intracellular retention and Golgi accumulation [64]. CD1e traffic to LE/lysosom es seems to be facilitated by ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic domain, a phenome non increased upon DCs maturation [64]. 2.3 Antigen processing and loading Several events have to take place and coordinate to allow the loading of CD1 molecules with the correct lipids. These events occ ur mainly in intracellular compartments, where lipid metabolism and endocytic pathways intersect. Catabolic enzymes and endosomal proteins are key players in t he successful loading of CD1 molecules: deficiency in one of these proteins impa irs deeply CD1-mediated antigen presentation. To be efficiently loaded onto CD1 molecules, exogen ous lipid antigens must be first internalized. Lipids are insoluble in aqueous phase, therefore many lipids bind specifically to cell surface receptors. Since the m ajority of circulating lipids are transported as soluble complexes bound to lipoprote ins, receptors that bind lipid particles such as the low-density lipoprotein recep tor (LDL-R), the LDL-R-like protein (LRP) and scavenger receptors might also pl ay an important role in the lipid uptake [65]. Cell surface receptors that bind glyca ns such as C-type Lectins are also involved, for example, in the uptake of LAM [6 6]. 31 Another way how lipid antigens may be internalized is via incorporation into the plasma membrane, to be taken up as part of general endocytic processes. These mechanisms of internalization vesicles, while membrane-associated lipids a re internalized through different routes. The membrane associated sphingomy elin and sulfatide are internalized through clathrin-coated vesicles and r each lysosomes where they are degraded. Instead other glycolipids, including lact osylceramide, globosides and the ganglioside GM1 and GM2 are internalized through a clathrin-independent mechanism, which involves also caveolae. These glyc olipids rapidly merge in early sorting endosomal compartments [68], while caveolae -derived lipid domains do not mix with domains derived from clathrin-coated pits [68-70]. Lipids can be also traslocated from one leaflet of the membrane belayer to the other: enzymes like flippases, scramblases and memb ers of the ABC transport system are involved in these processes [71]. Finall y, cells can take up lipids from apoptotic bodies from infected cells. This mechanis m is particularly important when infected cells do not express CD1 molecules or die as a consequence of infection: lipid antigens can be taken up by different APCs an d can be efficiently and simultaneously presented with peptides [72]. Once internalized, lipid antigens sort on the basis of their physical properties. The lipid distribution across membranes results from a continuous movement of lipids between the two monolayers. For example, neutral an d acidic lipids that have their charge neutralized by protonation move quickly betw een leaflets. By contrast, the spontaneous transbilayer movement of lipids with ch arged head groups is slow [71]. In some cases, localization in cholesterol or sphingolipid-rich microdomains contributes to the immunogenicity of the lipid anti gens [73]. Lipids have the capacity to selectively traffic through the membran es of different cellular 32 compartments and to reach the same organelles where CD1 molecules are present. The length of the alkyl chain contributes to the efficient sorting of the lipids through lysosomal membranes: GlucosylMonomic late endosomes where efficiently loads on CD1b, while a less immunogenic variant with a short alkyl chain loads on CD1b on the cell surface [74]. Similar to proteins, lipids undergo partial degrada tion in late endosomal compartments, where they are processed to smaller m olecules compatible with CD1 binding and TCR interaction. However, not much is known about the enzymes involved in the generation of immunogenic lipids. T o date, three glycosidases have been CD1 lipid processing: -galactosidase, -hexosaminidase acidic -mannosidase. The presence of -galactosidase in the lysosome is important for the removal of galactose from the syn thetic disaccharide galactose (1-2)GalCer to generate GalCer, which substrates. However, not all antigenic lipids requi re processing to become antigenic. Large glycolipid antigens containing up to eight carbohydrate GQ1b, can be immunogenic witho ut processing [78]. Lipid degradation occurs in specific localizations inside the organelles. Glycolipids can be degraded when inserted in the multivesicular membranes which have a lipid composition different from the limiting membrane. G lycolipids inserted inside the lysosomal limiting membrane are protected from dige stion by a thick glycocalix. Multivesicular phosphatidylinosit ol-3-phosphate [79]. The chemical properties of these lipids can favour the access of LTPs to antigenic lipids inside the membranes. Moreover, most hydrolases bin d to membranes containing 33 negatively charged lipids and are active at a pH<5. 0. In addition, the enzymes are efficient when the substrates are not membrane-asso ciated but \"lifted out\" of the membranes by LTPs, thus assigning a pivotal role of LTPs in assisting lipid antigen presentation. Lysosomes (but also other organelles) are therefore the perfect environment for the functional interaction between processing enzymes and LTPs. Here the CD1 proteins and the lipids encounter and generate, at the optimal pH, functional antigenic complexes. 34 Figure 2 . Schematic representation of CD1 assembly, traffic king and loading. Assembly of CD1 molecules takes place in the ER with the help o f chaperones named calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57. In the ER CD1d is loaded w ith self antigens with the help of MTP. CD1 associate noncovalently with 2m, then traffic to the Golgi and to the plasma membrane. CD1b-d molecules are internalized from su rface in clathrin-coated pits, associate with AP-2, and move to sorting endosomes. There, they move to late endosomes/lysosomes upon AP-3 binding. CD1a recycle s only in early endosomes. In the lysosome CD1 molecules are loaded with lipids of se lf or microbial origin with the assistence of several LTPs such as Saposin, NPC2 an d CD1e and are then exported to plasma membrane for antigen presentation. 35 2.3.1 Lipid Transfer Proteins Lipids can be transported inside (and taken up from outside) the cell using different mechanisms, which can be broadly defined as vesicul ar and non vesicular- mechanisms. The non vesicular mechanism involves LT P. LTPs have the unique feature of being able to extract and bind a single lipid molecule from a membrane interface, thus allowing lipids to distribute among the different compartments in a fast and regulated manner. Not all LTPs described so far showed a clear role i n CD1 antigen presentation, but their function is important to maintain a proper li pid distribution inside the different compartments. In lipid antigen presentation LTPs exert two differ ent functions. First, they participate in CD1-lipid loading and unloading. Sec ond, they might also facilitate extraction of exogenous lipids (generated during th e degradation of microbial membranes or acquired from other cells) from the me mbranes and offer them to hydrolases for degradation [72, 79]. According to their cellular localization, several L TPs have been described which differently participate in transfer of the lipids t hrough the different compartments, in assistance of processing of complex lipid antigens and in loading onto CD1 molecules. Most of the LTPs involved in CD1 present ation are localized inside lysosomes, where they colocalise molecules. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is E R-resident and is involved in presentation of endogenous and exogenous iNKT cells ligands [49, 80, 81]. MTP function has been associated with transfer of trigl yceride, cholesterol and some phospholipids such as PC and PI onto apoB during li pogenesis [82]. MTP 36 regulates the biosynthetic pathway of CD1d; in the absence [49] or silencing [80] of MTP, presentation of Galcer is severely impaired due to a reduced CD1d s urface expression. Moreover, purified MTP can transfer lip ids to recombinant CD1d in vitro [80]. Finally, inhibition of MTP in fetal thymic or gan cultures results in impaired positive selection due to the absence of properly f olded self-CD1d complexes [19]. Lysosomal GM2- A and NPC-2. Each LTP apparently shows a preferential binding fo r glycosphingolipids, although each LTP is promiscuou s [83]. Saposins and Saposins (SAPs) become enzymatically active by endosomal proteolytic cleavage of the precursor prosaposin th at is secreted and internalized in late endosomes and lysosomes. The four polypeptide chains share a large degree of structural homology and have overlapping and mul tiple functions. All the four saposins are capable of transferring phosphatidylse rine (PS) and SAP A, B and C transfer sulfatide to CD1d [84]. SAP B interacts wi th a variety of sphingolipids and facilitates their digestion by specific lysosomal e nzymes [85]. SAP B is involved in loading of lipids onto CD1d [86]. In addition, pros aposin-deficient mice lack iNKT cells and show a defect in lipid antigen presentati on [83, 87]. SAP C interacts degradation compartm ents and is directly routed to lysosomes after synthesis. It associates with -hexosaminidase A and assists GM2 37 degradation. GM2-A can also remove GT1b bound to CD 1d [84]. Interestingly, GM2-A is encoded by a gene unrelated to saposins, i t does not share any structural homology and its role cannot be substitu ted by any other SAPs. NPC1 and endosomal/ly sosomal protein involved in the cellular transport of glyco sphingolipids and cholesterol that is mutated in a majority of patients with Niemann-P ick Type C neurodegenerative disease. NPC1-deficient mice show impaired antigen presentation and iNKT cells selection [91]. The Niemann-Pick Type C-2 (NPC2) protein is a small , soluble, protein [92, only been identified in the lysosomal proteome together with saposins [94]. NPC 2 binds and transfers cholesterol and sphingolipids in the lysosome, but its precise function is still undefined [95]. Similar to saposins, recombinant NP C2 is able to unload lipids from and onto CD1d [96]. Deficiency of either NPC1 or NPC2 results in a small (-5%) complementation group of Niemann-Pick d isease, which is NPC1 deficiency [98]. Defici encies in NPC1 or NPC2 lead to identical phenotypes in patients, even though there are no physical relationships between the two molecules [97, 99]. However, immuno logical phenotypes appear to be sufficiently subtle to attribute specific fun ctions to both NPC1 and NPC2 and separate the two complementation groups. A detailed study on the role of NPC2 in iNKT select ion and on the consequences of its absence on lipid antigens presentation is the s ubject of Part 1 of this thesis. 38 CD1e CD1e, the fifth member of the CD1 family, has a fun ction of LTP. CD1e, like all the other CD1 molecules, is composed of a transmembrane -chain that noncovalently associates with 2m. The -chain folds in three structural domains ( 1-3), with the 1 and 2 domains delimiting a hydrophobic pocket- containing groove in which lipid ligands bind. The -chain is cleaved in late endosomal compartments between the 3 and the transmembrane domains, and a soluble CD1e is generated, which represents the act ive form of this molecule [16]. So far, CD1e has been detected only in DC and CD4-C D8 DP thimocytes. Unlike the other CD1 molecules, CD1e reaches late e ndosomes through sorting endosomes, without passing through the plasma membr ane in either immature or maturing DC. After induction of DC maturation, CD1e disappears rapidly from the transiently localizes in +/CD1b + vesicles [38]. Moreover, during DC maturation CD1e synthesis progressively declines and becomes undetectable after 20h post LPS maturation, while its endosomal cleavage still occurs. Complete disappearance of CD1e from Golgi compartments and r elocalization in lysosomes occurs as soon as 1 hr after LPS treatment [38]. CD1e accumulates in lysosomes and persists in these compartments due to its great er stability, which has been associated with a progressive shortening of the car bohydrate side chains [38]. Although the human CD1 genes are poorly polymorphic , six different alleles have been reported for CD1E gene [100-102]. Among individuals from diverse ethn ic backgrounds, alleles 1 and 2 display a frequency of 49 and 51%, respectively [100], whereas the four other alleles have been des cribed once [102, 103]. The polymorphic nucleotides are located in exons 2 or 3 of the CD1E gene, encoding the 1 and 2 domains, respectively [100-102]. Immature CD1e di splays an N- terminal propeptide ten amino acids long which is c leaved in acidic compartments 39 and is absent in the mature, active CD1e molecule. The role of the propeptide is to assist the association inside ER of newly synthesiz ed CD1e with -2 microglobulin, since its absence leads to a slower assembly of the complex [104] The function of endosomal soluble CD1e is poorly de fined. CD1e may facilitate the processing of complex glycolipids by offering them for partial degradation. This has been demonstrated by investigating the CD1b-restric ted is recognized by CD1b-restric ted T cells, when the six -D- Man p units, are processed in the endocytic pathway into PIM 2 containing only two -D-Man p units. PIM 6 degradation is exerted by lysosomal mannosidase and requires the presence of soluble CD1e to assist in the process [16]. Part 2 of this thesis describes novel and important functions of CD1e in lipid antigen presentation. Serum LTPs ApoE Apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) is present as a free LTP in serum. Nevertheless, some studies implicated ApoE (and the LDL receptor) in t he CD1d-dependent presentation of exogenous lipid antigens [105]. In the experimental model of ( 1- 2)digalactosylceramide, ApoE is necessary for its e fficient delivery into lysosomal compartments where it is processed into the iNKT ce ll agonist GalCer and loaded onto CD1d [105]. Uptake of ApoE-bound glycolipids i s mediated by LDL receptor (LDLr), since LDLr KO mice have an impaired respons e to ( 1- 2)digalactosylceramide [105]. Further analysis reve aled that ApoE renders the that drives iNKT cells activation more effi cient [105]. Finally, ApoE- deficient mice show iNKT cells [105]. 40 Cytoplasmic LTPs Lipids are not uniformly distributed inside cells, and their preferential localization is essential to many cellular functions, including mem brane trafficking, cell signaling, apoptosis and mitosis. litate and of lipids among different organelles and concentrate ( or exclude) them from specific subcellular compartments. Glycolipid transfer proteins Glycolipid transfer proteins (GLTPs) are small, sol uble, ubiquitous proteins characterized by their ability to accelerate interm embrane transfer of glycolipids. GLTPs show specificity for both sphingoid- and glyc erol-based glycolipids, but with higher specificity for lipids where the initial sug ar residue is -linked to the hydrophobic lipid backbone. GlcCer and GalCer, whic h are synthesized on the cytosolic side of Golgi and ER, respectively [106] are accessible to GLTPs. Moreover, GLTPs can also localize to nuclei and mit ochondrial membranes, other than the lumen of the Golgi and the external face o f the plasma membrane [107- 109]. Crystal structures are available for human GL TPs [110], free or bound to LacCer [110, 111], which show a two layer, -helical topology with a single GSL binding site, composed by a surface recognition cen ter for the sugar headgroup and an hydrophobic tunnel in which the lipid moiety is accommodated. Phospholipids transfer proteins Different classes of mammalian phospholipids-transf er proteins (PL-TPs) are known such as phosphatidilcoline transfer proteins (PC-TP) and phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PI-TP). The three dimensional structure of these proteins has been elucidated, showing a hydro phobic cavity suited to accommodate lipid ligands [112, 113]. 41 PC-PT belongs to the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein related transfer (START) domain superfamily of hydrophobic lipid bin ding proteins. Other LTPs are involved in the transport of cholesterol and cerami de such as MLN64 and StAR [114]. PC-TP is involved in the transport of PC fro m ER, the site of biosynthesis, to other subcellular organelles deficient in PC [115]. Moreover, PC-PT co-operate with plasma LTPs to remove excess of phospholipids from the plasma membrane [116] Mammals express two PI-TP proteins, and , which are highly homologous. They can both transfer PI and PC across membranes, and P I-TP can also transfer sphingomyelin (SM). PI-TP proteins are involved in regulation of the signaling pathways in which PI is involved, transferring PI f rom intracellular stores to the plasma membrane as part of the receptor-controlled phosphoinositide signaling pathway [117]; PI-TPs are also involved in the acti vation of a PI-specific phospholipase A which is important in the generatio n of an eicosainod-like factor important for cell growth and survival [118]. Golgi transfer proteins The Golgi Complex (GC) represents the central node in the biosynthesis, transport and sorting of proteins and lipids. There are sever al LTPs that reside in the GC, including Ceramide Transfer Protein (CERT), oxyster 4-phosphate adaptor protein-2 ( FAPP2), which all share a common domain organization. These LTPs bind lipids, such as ceramide, cholesterol and glycolipids, that have crucial stru ctural and signaling roles at the interface between the late-Golgi compartments, the plasma membranes and endosomes. CERT, OSBP and FAPP2 all share a common homology domain at the N-terminus, and an additional lipid transfer do main at the C-terminus [119]. 42 Ceramides are amides of fatty acids with long-chain (usually between 14 and 24 carbons) bases. Sphingosine is the most common base among mammals. The acyl group of ceramides is variable and is generall y saturated or monounsaturated long-chain fatty acid [71]. Sphingo myelin is found in all cell membranes, and is composed of a ceramide with addit ional phosphate and choline. Addition of glucose galactose to a cera mide leads to glycosylceramides. CERT transfer activity varies according to the chai n length of the ceramide fatty acid [120], ceramides. CERT mechanism of action is to extract ceramide from the cytoplasmic side of ER membranes (where it is synthesized) and deliver it to the cytoplasmic side of Golgi membranes, where it is converted into SM. OSBP1 has a function similar to CERT. It binds with high affinity to oxysterols and cholesterol and acts at the interface between the E R and Golgi, traslocating lipids from a cytosolic compartment to the GC membranes wh en high levels of cholesterol and oxysterols are present [121] FAPP2 shares an homology domain with GLTP and accum ulates at the TGN-exit sites, where transport carriers destined for the pl asma membrane emerge as tubular protrusions [122]. Human FAPP2 is important in the synthesis of comple x glycosphingolipids and couples it with their export to the cell surface, thus determining the lipid identity and composition of t he plasma membrane [122]. All these cytoplasmic LTPs bind and transfer lipids that can possibly interact with CD1 molecules. Nevertheless, none of these proteins showed an immunological function so far or a direct involvement in assistan ce to lipid antigen presentation. 43 SCP2 Sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) is a ubiquitous 58 kDa protein known for more than three decades as \"non specific lipid transfer prote in\" for its broad lipid binding capacity. SCP-2 shows a very complex gene structure , undergoes post- translational processing and organelles [123, 124]. The SCP-2 gene has two initiation sites coding for prot eins that share a common 13 kDa C-terminus: one site encodes the kDa SCP-2 and a 45 kDa protein; a second site for 15 kDa is post-translatio nally cleaved to 13 kDa SCP-2 that is identical to that derived from cleavage of SCP-x. Very little is known regarding how the relative proportions of the two t ranscripts are regulated [124]. Although all three proteins contain a C-terminal SK L peroxisomal targeting sequence, as much as half of total SCP-2 is localiz ed outside the peroxisome, namely in mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum c ytoplasm and Golgi [125-127]. Recently, a 12.9 kDa SCP-2 form has been detected in nuclear extracts of transfected cells a nd shown to posses DNA binding activity [128]. Increasing evidence suggests that t he 58 kDa SCP-x and 45 kDa proteins are peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA-thiolases i nvolved in the -oxidation of branched chain fatty acids. The secondary and terti ary structure of the 13 kDa SCP-2 has been resolved [129]. The N-terminal 32 am ino acids form an amphipatic -helical region, one face of which represents a mem brane-binding domain. Positively charged amino acid residues in o ne face of the amphipatic helices allow SCP-2 to bind to membrane surfaces co ntaining anionic phospholipids. The hydrophobic faces of the N-termi nal amphipatic helices along with strands 4, 5 and helix D form a ligand binding cav ity able to accomodate multiple types of lipids [130]. The 13 kDa SCP-2 is the interactin g with anionic phospholipid- containing membranes through positively charged ami no acid residues in its N- terminal amphipatic helical domain. The hydrophobic faces of the N-terminal domain form a lipid-binding cavity, which can accom 4]. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that recombinant SCP-2 enhances intermembran e transfer of cholesterol, phospholipids, and glycolipids generated which completely lack Scpx/proScp2 gene products [131]. These mice develop normally but have several marked alteration s including peroxisome proliferation, hypolipidemia, decreased biliary lip id secretion, impaired hepatic lipid metabolism, and high serum levels of methyl-branche d fatty acids like phytanic and pristanic acid [131]. These defects are possibly as cribed to inefficient lipid transfer and import into peroxisomes, and to defective catab olism of methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA. Part 3 of this thesis describes a novel immunologic al function of SCP-2. We show that this cytoplasmic LTP can directly influence li pid antigen presentation and iNKT cells selection by altering the correct transport o f lipid antigens precursors. 2.4 Lipid Antigens Several lipid antigens have been characterized ( Table 1 ). The structures of these antigens are greatly variable, thus making very dif ficult to classify them. According to their origin they can be divided into two groups , namely endogenous (or eukaryotic) stimulating CD1 restricted T cell s belong mostly to two prominent families: sphingolipids and phospholipids . Human T cell clones have been found reactive the sphingolipids gangliosid es, to phosphatidylgly cerol the mouse, T cells specific to the ganglioside GD3 are present after immunization with GD3-secreting melanoma cells [134]. Also mouse iNKT cells react to PI, PE and PG [135]. iNKT cells from human and mouse react to the self molecule iGb3 [76], which however has not been isolated from human tis sues. Glycolipids are mostly composed of a hydrophobic ce ramide and a hydrophilic oligosaccharide chain. The structure of the hydroph obic lipid moiety of glycosphingolipids contributes greatly to immunogen icity: as it is shown in the model of GM1 recognition, the acyl tail buried into CD1b makes stable interactions with the CD1 molecule [78]; the length of the acyl chains, as well as their degree of saturation and rigidity, also play a role [133, 136 ].The polar head of lipid antigens has two important functions: it makes direct intera ctions with the -helices of the CD1 molecule, thus contributing to the formation of stable CD1-lipid complexes, and directly interacts with the TCR. Thus, the spec ificity of recognition depends on the presence of antigen structures that make both t ypes of interactions. Sulfatide, a lipid abundant in the brain, binds to all human CD1 molecules [137] and also to mouse CD1d [138], thus suggesting that different CD1 molecules can bind to an overlapping lipid repertoire [137]. Different cell types and tissues synthesize and acc umulate glycosphingolipids with modified ceramide structures [139], suggesting that only some tissues express an immunogenic variant of self lipid antigens. In addi tion, modifications of lipid structures and the type of fatty acids used (and th erefore the possibility to be or not 46 immunogenic) may occur during changes in lipid meta bolism, for instance during ontogenesis, cell growth, viral transformation and oncogenesis [140]. It is possible therefore that, in these particular metabolic condi tions, the immune system is confronted with unusual accumulated GSLs to which i t is not tolerant. This mechanism could be evolved to alert the immune syst em and to initiate an immune response [141]. 47 Table 1 . Summary of identified CD1 lipid antigens Antigens Origin Restriction - antigens In 1994 it was described for the first time that a microbial lipid antigen, namely mycolic acid, could stimulate specific T cells [142 ]. Several lipid antigens of microbial origin, presented by all CD1 molecules, h ave been identified so far. Interestingly, most of the T cell lipid antigens de scribed until now, derive from mycobacteria , even if lipids with the potential to bind to CD1 mo lecules are produced by many different pathogens [143]. It is n ot clear which are the characteristics that render a lipid immunogenic, wh ether lipids have to be shed by living bacteria or instead lipids included in the b acterial cell wall are more stimulatory. Moreover, it is still debated whether the response to lipids that are mostly present in virulent bacterial strains is imp ortant for the induction of protective immunity [71]. Here, lipid antigens are described according to the ir capacity to form stimulatory complexes with individual CD1 molecules. The only characterized exogenous CD1a-restricted li pid antigen is Didehydroxymycobactin (DDM)[144], a mycobacterial l ipopeptide. DDM is a precursor of mycobactins which are mycobacterial pr oducts involved in iron scavenge and supply to bacterial cell. All CD1b-restricted microbial lipid antigens descri bed so far derive from the mycobacterial cell envelope and have no close struc tural homologues in mammalian cells. core [77]. One group, named PIMs, contain varying numbers of mannose residues, are produced only by a ctinomycetes [148, 149] and are major components of the outer leaflet of the my cobacterial plasma membrane. 49 LM and LAM are multi-glycosylated extensions of the PIMs. As already mentioned, CD1e contributes to immunogenicity of PIMs by trimm ing the into the antigenic form PIM 2[16]. SGLs have recently been identified as CD1b-restrict ed antigens recognized by M. tuberculosis -specific T cells [147]. They are mycobacterial cel l envelope molecules that possess a trehalose 2' sulfate core acylated b y two to four fatty acids. These fatty acids can be palmitic (C 16 ), stearic (C 18 ), hydroxyphtioceranoic (C 32 ), or phtioceranoic (C 32 ). The extent of their expression in M. tuberculosis correlates with strain virulence in guinea pig models [150]. T he active antigenic species have been shown to be diacylated sulfoglycolipids (Ac 2SGLs) containing hydroxyhtioceranoic and either palmitic or stearic acid chains. Presentation of Ac 2SGLs is efficient during infection, and induces pro duction of IFN by specific human T cells and subsequent killing of intracellul ar bacteria in vitro [147, 151] CD1c-restricted antigens described so far are also derived from mycobacteria. The first identified was shown to be closely related to mannosyl -1- phosphomycoketides (MPMs). They are also referred to as mannosyl phosphoisoprenoids (MPIs), because of their structu re containing a single fully saturated alkyl chain similar to isoprenoid lipids, with methyl branches at every four carbons. Their structure is close to mammalian mann osyl phosphodolichols (MPDs)[152]. -galactosylceramide ( GalCer) sponges that stimulates iNKT cells in a CD1d depend ent manner [153]( Figure 3 ). GalCer is not present in mammals because the anomer ic carbon of the sugar galactose bound to the sphingosine base has -linkage, whereas mammalian glucosylceramides possess only a -linkage. The broad reactivity of iNKT cells to GalCer allowed the development of the cytofluorimetric sta ining procedure using dimerized (or tetramerized) CD1d molecules loaded w ith GalCer [154]. Several 50 synthetic analogs of GalCer with different stimulatory capacity have bee n described [10, 155]. Modifications of the length an d degree of insaturation of the acyl chain [155] and of the sphingosine chain [156] result in a skewing of the iNKT response towards preferential Th1 or Th2 cyto kine secretion. Recently, two structurally related bacterial antigens presented b y CD1d molecules have been described, -Glucuronosylceramide (GSL-1) and -Galacturonosylceramide (GSL- 1')[157-159], Both are sphingolipids t he cell wall of Sphingomonas spp . Bacterial lipid antigens were also identified from Borrelia burgdoferi [160], a pathogenic bacterium causing Lyme disease . B. burgdoferi expresses two abundant glycolipids, that are galactosyl diacylgly cerols and were named BbGL-I and II, respectively [160]. 51 Figure 3 . Structures of selected lipid antigens of self or microbial origin. 52 3. Lipid-specific T cells T cells recognizing lipids in association with CD1 molecules can be divided in two groups: those restricted by group 1 CD1 molecules a nd those restricted by CD1d. T cells restricted by CD1d can be further subdivide d in two groups: type 1 iNKT cells, which express a semi-invariant TCR, and type 2 NKT which express a diverse TCR. It is a matter of debate whether lipid- and peptide -specific T cells are distinct lymphocyte populations that differ in selection, pr iming, activation requirements and memory formation, or whether they all belong to the same lineage but differ in antigen specificity. What is known about maturation and selection of lipid-specific T cells has been almost exclusively done in mice, whi ch express only CD1d. Therefore a detailed picture (though still incomple te) of maturation and selection is available only for Type 1 iNKT cells. 3.1 CD1-restricted (Group 1) T cells T cells restricted by CD1a, b and c molecules play an important role in bacterial infections and autoimmune responses. TCRs of Group 1 T cells show an apparently unbiased repertoire of V , V , J and J genes, which are the same used by peptide-specific T cells. Very few TCRs hav e been sequenced, and it seems there is no particular correlation between th e V and V chains used and the type of CD1 restriction or the expression of CD 4 and CD8. Analyses of the CDR3 sequences of lipid-specific clones contain tem plate-independent N nucleotides that encode diverse sequences important for the formation of specific interactions with the lipid-CD1 complex [161, 162]. In addition, the CDR3 loops contain charged residues that can interact with aci dic residues on the glycolipid antigens. 53 Few CD1c-restricted clones express a 164]. Interestingly, many intraepithelial TCR- recognize CD1 molecules, and the clones expressing the TCR-V1 chain recognized self and exogenous lipids presen ted by CD1a,-c and -d transfected APC 1 T cells may express CD4 or CD8 co-receptors and in some cases are CD4 - CD8 - DN; since these coreceptors do not bind efficientl y to CD1 molecules, there is not a preferential expression of CD4 or CD 8. Similarly to peptide-specific T cells, priming of l ipid-specific T cells probably occurs in peripheral lymphoid organs. Dendritic cells, whi ch express all CD1 molecules, are likely to be the best candidates for priming. A fter priming T cells expand, as shown in human [147, 166, 167] and guinea pigs [168 , 169] mycobacterial-specific Human T cells which react to endogenous glycosphing olipids are present in the circulating blood both of healthy and MS patients [ 132]. Functional analyses of group 1 CD1-restricted T cel l clones revealed the presence of different populations with Th1 [147, 167, 170] o r using an ELISPOT assay, it was determin ed that in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis the number of IFN- secreting lipid-specific T cells was higher than in control donors, consistent with a po ssible pro-inflammatory role [132]; in patients with leprosy or tuberculosis a l arge fraction of CD1-restricted T cells release IFN- , supporting an anti-bacterial role for these cells [147, 167, 170]. Lipid-specific T cells recognizing Group 1 CD1 mole cules are important in bacterial infections, autoimmune responses and probably tumor immune surveillance. Lipid-specific T cells recognize DC infected with M. tuberculosis and have a direct killing activity against intracellular pathogens [1 75]; CD1 molecules are expressed in various chronic and acute autoimmune disease. Th is may favor the expansion of T cells specific for self glycosphingolipids as obs erved in the blood of patients with 54 multiple sclerosis [138]. Tumors also express CD1 m olecules, thus making them potential targets of tumor-specific T cells, but un til now very little is known about T cells recognizing lipids expressed by tumor cells. 3.2 CD1d-restricted (Group 2) T cells T cells restricted by CD1d can be further subdivide d in two groups: Type 1 iNKT cells, which express a semi-invariant TCR, and Type 2 NKT which express a diverse TCR. 3.2.1 Type 1 iNKT cells 3.2.1.1 Phenotype and tissue distribution Type 1 iNKT cells (also known as iNKT cells) are CD 1d restricted T cells which react to the agonist GalCer bound to CD1d and can be stained by CD1d dim ers loaded with GalCer. Mouse iNKT cells express a semi-invariant T CR, composed of the V 14-J18 segments paired preferentially with V 8.2, V 7 or V 2 chains [176](some rare TCRs express the V 3.2-J9/V 8 or V 8/V 8 rearrangement [177]), while human iNKT cells express invariant V 24-J18 rearranged chains paired with variant V 11 chains. Both in mouse and human, the invariant T CR-V rearrangement can be formed with different patterns of nucleotide deletion as well as N region additions [178]. This confirms that the iNKT-TCR selection is mediated by antigen recognition and selection. iNKT cells in mice express the CD4 coreceptor or ar e CD4-CD8 DN, but never express CD8, while human iNKT cells can also expres s the CD8 coreceptor [177]. There are evidences that these subsets are function ally distinct [172, 179, 180], although it is not understood the role of both core ceptors, since neither CD4 nor 55 CD8 bind the CD1d molecule. In mouse iNKT cells, CD 4 expression is probably redundant, since iNKT cells develop normally in CD4 deficient mice [181]; nevertheless, two recent studies suggested that CD4 may influence iNKT cells function [182, inhibitory and activatory receptors typically associated with NK c ell, such as NK1.1, CD122, NKG2D and members of the Ly49 family [177]. Periphe ral iNKT cells display homeostatic maintenance requirements resembling tho se of other antigen- experienced T cells since IL-15 and IL-7, but not C D1d, are strictly required for their survival [184]. iNKT cells contribute only with a small proportion to the total lymphocyte compartment, with frequencies ranging from 0.5% to 1% in most immune organs (thymus, spleen, bone marrow, blood) and even less in lymph nodes [185], with small variations dependent on the mouse strain. Int erestingly, in the mouse liver, iNKT cells can reach the 30% of the total T lymphoc ytes [177]. In humans iNKT cells proportions are generally lower than those of mice and can greatly vary between individuals, with percentages from less tha n 0.001% to over 1%, with liver and thymus the organs where NKT are more abundant [ 177]. This great individual variation creates difficulties in attributing a rol e to iNKT cells in human diseases. 3.2.1.2 Thymic development iNKT cells development occurs in the thymus from bo ne marrow derived precursors. iNKT cells segregate from conventional T development at the DP thymocyte stage in the thymic cortex [186, 187]. In terestingly, expression of 56 particular V chains appears to be important for subsequent sele ction of iNKT cells [188-190]. Correct rearrangement of the V chain allows the formation of the invariant V 14-J18 iNKT cells TCR. Taken together these observation s point out for a selective, rather than instructive, model for iNKT cells thymic development. Clear evidences suggest that also iNKT cells are su bjected to positive and negative selection in the thymus. Positive selection Positive selection of conventional T cells require TCR recognition of peptide antigens presented in the context of MHC-I or -II m olecules expressed by thymic cortical epithelial cells. In contrast, iNKT cells are selected by unknown self glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d on DP cortica l thymocytes, as demonstrated by experiments where iNKT cell selecti on occurred when CD1d was expressed, under the control of the lck promoter, o n DP thymocythes [191-194]. Expression of CD1d under the MHC II promoter did no t rescue iNKT cells development [195], while expression of CD1d under t he MHC-I promoter, although restoring the expression of CD1d on DP thymocytes, could only partially restore iNKT cells selection, suggesting that also CD1d lev els play a role in selection [196]. Interestingly, epithelial cells, which mediate posi tive selection of conventional T cells, also express CD1d, but cannot select iNKT ce lls. It is possible that DP cells provide signals (and epithelial cells do not), whic h are uniquely required for iNKT cell development. A second non-alternative possibil ity is that only DP thymocytes express the correct self lipids selecting iNKT cell s. Selection on DP thymocytes possibly promote some of the key features of iNKT c ells; indeed, CD4 + T cells selected via interaction with MHC-II on DP thymocyt es rather than epithelial cells show very similar characteristics to those of iNKT cells (intermediate TCR expression, expression of CD44, NK1.1 and CD69)[197 ]. 57 Furthermore, correct CD1d recycling through endocyt ic compartment is necessary for iNKT cell selection. CD1d has to be loaded with endogenous endosome- or lysosome- derived lipid antigen/s, and in case of a ltered CD1d trafficking iNKT cell selection is greatly impaired [177]. Selecting ligands The nature of the endogenous selecting lipids remai ns unknown. High affinity interactions between TCR and peptide/ MHC result in deletion of developing T cells, and it has been recently determ ined the affinity value that defines the threshold for negative selection of cyt otoxic T cells [198, 199]. Interestingly, there are some evidences that T cell s subsets with regulatory capacity can be selected by high(er) affinity ligan ds [200]. TCR transgenic mice specific for MHC-II generate high numbers of CD4 +CD25 +FoxP3 + T-regs when exposed to agonist peptides [201, 202], although th is phenomenon could be due to an increased resistance to deletion by T-regs when compared to conventional CD4 + cells [203]. CD8 IELs are also generated in the presence of agonist peptide, as shown in a system of RTOC (reaggregated thymic organ culture) and TCR transgenic DP thymocytes [204]. It is not clear whether also iNKT cells can be selected by agonist ligands, and the evidence is of ten based on the observed memory/activated phenotype and their broad self-rea ctivity [177]. GalCer, the most potent agonist for iNKT cells, was never considered a possible selecting ligand, not being present in mammalian ce lls; nevertheless, many possible glycosphingolipids with structural similar ities with GalCer are present in mammalian cells and were therefore carefully analyz ed for their possible role in iNKT cells thymic selection. One candidate, iGb3 is oglobotrihexosylceramide, has been proposed to be the selecting ligand for iNKT c ells [76], although its role is controversial. 58 iGb3 was identified as possible candidate in a scre ening of KO mice with deficiencies in enzymes responsible of the synthesi s or degradation of glycosphingolipids [76]. Hexb -/- mice, which lack the -hexosaminidase A and B enzymes, showed a clear block in iNKT cells develop ment. These enzymes are responsible for the degradation of globo- and isogl obo-series of glycosphingolipids, as well as some gangliosides, in the lysosomes. The capacity to stimulate mouse and human iNKT cells and of being a relatively weak antigen when compared to GalCer, supported the role of iGb3 as a true select ing ligand in vivo [76]. Several in vivo and in vitro studies supported this hypothesis [205, 206], and iGb3 also appeared to have a role in selecting the V repertoire [188, 207]. Additional experiments, although not denying a role of iGb3 as iNKT cells agonist, did not support a major role of iGb3 in iNKT cells thymic selection. We (as described in detail in Part 1 of this thesis) and o thers [208] showed that also in other mouse models where glycosphingolipid metaboli sm is disrupted, iNKT cell development is impaired, even though the enzymes -hexosaminidase have not been deliberately knocked-out and thus iGb3 metabol ism is not affected. In addition, iGb3 has been very difficult if not impos sible to be detected in human or mouse thymi and DC by using HPLC methods [209] or i on trap mass-spectrometry [210, 211]. Moreover, mice lacking the iGb3 synthet ase gene (A3GALT2 gene) have no iNKT cell deficiency [212]. Finally, in hum ans iGb3 synthetase is a pseudo-gene, thus excluding that this molecule is s ynthesized by human cells [213]. The debate on the role of iGb3 has somehow i ncreased the interest in other possible candidate selecting antigens, which includ e the weakly agonist - glycosylceramides [214] as well as their more compl ex derivatives. 59 Negative selection During positive selection a developing T cell recog nizes a self-peptide/MHC complex with low affinity [215, 216]. Negative sele ction occurs when the affinity of the TCR of a developing thymocyte for a self/MHC co mplex is above a \"safe\" threshold and is therefore considered self-reactive [217, 218]. Such a high affinity interaction between TCR and self-peptide/MHC leads to distinct signals in the developing cell that trigger apoptosis and not prol iferation and survival [219], thus pointing that negative selection is an active proce ss, as opposed as the mechanism of death by neglect [217]. Although the iNKT cell TCR -chain is invariant, there is sufficient variabilit y in the V chains to support the possibility that self-reacti ve cells with very high affinity for CD1d/lipid complexes arise during development [220- 224]. Given the possibility that iNKT cells can be selected by agonist ligands, the question raises whether iNKT cells undergo negative selection during their development. Two studies show that the presence in vitro and in vivo of the strong agonist GalCer during iNKT cell development completely abrogates iNKT cells develop ment [26, 225]. These findings suggest that iNKT cells undergo negative s election (though it is possible that the strong agonist GalCer displaced the weak selecting ligands from th e complexes and therefore these models represent more a lack of positive selection than a true negative selection). Additional evidenc es of negative selection came from mice where CD1d was overexpressed in thymic DC in the absence of exogenously added ligands, which led to the abrogat ion of iNKT cells development [26]. These data suggested that the overall avidity for a natural ligand presented in the context of higher CD1d levels was so increased to induce negative selection in developing iNKT cells. Moreover, in these experimen ts it was also shown that DC do not mediate positive selection [191-194], and ma y induce negative selection, as 60 described for conventional T cells [226]. Interesti ngly, DP thymocytes can mediate both positive and negative selection [227]. It is not clear whether there is a developmental wi ndow following TCR expression during which iNKT cells can be negatively selected, as it happens for conventional T cells [228]. Recently, a transcription factor ass ociated with negative selection of conventional T cells, Nur77 [229], has been identif ied on CD24 + developing iNKT cells pointing out the existence of a window of sus ceptibility to negative selection also for iNKT cells. Maturation of iNKT cells after positive and negativ e selection appears to be quite distinct from the process of conventional T cells, with iNKT cells undergoing major maturational events post-selection [230]. Thymic maturation of iNKT cells The maturation pathway of iNKT cells can be subdivi ded into four different developmental stages defined by the expression of d ifferent phenotypic markers (Figure 4 ). The earliest post-DP V 14 iNKT expresses high levels of CD24 (HSA, Heat Stable Antigen) and this maturation step is ca lled \"Stage 0\". CD24+ cells have a CD44 and some still express the CD8 corecepto r, which stops to be expressed soon after and never re-expre ssed. Most of these cells express CD69, suggesting that they may represent ce lls that have recently undergone positive selection [185]. This phenotype resembles the transitional CD4 + stage of positively selected conventional CD4 + and CD8 + [219]. Downregulation of CD24 and CD8 allows NKT to procee d along the differentiation pathway towards the Stage 1, characterized by a CD4 4 -/dull NK1.1 - DX5 - surface phenotype. Stage 1 iNKT cells undergo several round s of cell division, as determined by their large size and ability to incor porate BrdU [185], and express low levels of IL-4. This expansion is followed by t he expression of CD44, a marker 61 of T cells that have encountered the antigen, and o f the T-bet mediated-expression of the chain of the IL-15 receptor. CD44 + NK1.1 - DX5 low/int iNKT cells at Stage 2 produce both IL-4 and IFN- . Stage 3 iNKT express mainly IFN- . Upregulation of NK1.1 expression is the hallmark of Stage 3 that correlates with a drop in proliferation. Inter estingly, this upregulation can occur in the thymus or the periphery. These cells stop to divide, consistent with their entering a terminal stage of differentiation. The precursor-progeny relationship between the diff erent stages has not been formally demonstrated, but this developmental model fits with ontogeny data from different groups [231-233]. It has been recently proposed that, to proceed alon g the developmental pathway, iNKT cells have to cross two different checkpoints [230]. Checkpoint 1 corresponds to positive selection, while checkpoint 2 occurs be tween the Stages 2 and 3 and the successful accomplishment of this second contro l point is characterized by the upregulation of NK1.1. It is possible to speculate that in both these moments the TCR of the developing cells must interact with the appropriate CD1d:lipid complex, because after these checkpoints iNKT cells upregula te CD69. During the maturation steps, after the downregulaat ion of the CD8 coreceptor at Stage 0, all the maturing iNKT cells express the CD 4 coreceptor. In periphery, nevertheless, fully mature iNKT cells can be either CD4 + or CD4 -CD8 - double negative (DN). It has been demonstrated that downre gulation of CD4, at least for 30-40% of maturing iNKT cells happen at the Stage 2 to 3 transition, but the meaning of this downregulation is unknown [231, 232 , 234]. 62 Figure 4 . Schematic representation of thymic maturation of iN KT cells Factors influencing iNKT cell development T cell development is regulated by TCR signaling, c ytokines and co-receptor signaling [219]. iNKT cell development is also regu lated by these mechanisms, but also by many unique factors and in those cases wher e there is overlap between factors regulating T and iNKT cell development, iNK T cells often use these factors in a manner different from that of MHC-restricted T cells [185, 230]. 63 Cytokines play a crucial role in iNKT cell developm ent. iNKT cells upregulate the expression of the IL-2/ IL-15 receptor -chain (CD122) during their progression from Stage 2 to Stage 3 in the thymus, indicating a n important role, particularly for IL-15, in iNKT-cell maturation. Indeed, mice lackin g IL-15 or CD122 are deficient in iNKT cells, conventional T cells are unaffe cted [235, 236]. IL-15 is also important, normal iNKT-cell turnover and homeostasis [184, 237]. The transcription factor the u pregulation of CD122 during iNKT thymic maturation, and is in regulation of iNKT development: T-bet -/- a significant decrease in iNKT cell propo rtion and numbers, and the residual iNKT population is NK1.1 -, suggesting a block in NK1.1 - to NK1.1 + transition [238]. Among transcription factors, recent studies have di sclosed the role of specific ones that regulate iNKT cells thymic differentiation pro gram. PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger, Zbtb16) iNKT cells [239, 240]. PLZF, a BTB-zinc finger family member, is induced a fter positive selection of iNKT cell precursors. Mice that are deficient in PZLF do not proceed through intrathymic expansion and effector differentiation, in peripher y accumulate preferentially in lymph nodes and show marked defects in cytokine rel ease. Also the transcription factor Erg2 (Early growth response 2), a target of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway, is required for normal iNKT cells developm ent and maturation [241]. Mice lacking Erg2 are nonviable, but Erg2 -/- liver fetal chimeras show a strong decrease in iNKT cells. Moreover the small fraction of iNKT cells positively selected in Erg2 -/- mice show inefficient maturation, hyper proliferate and are apoptotic either in steady state conditions or after antigen stimulatio n [241]. TCR signaling is also essential for iNKT cells thym ic development. Successful TCR signaling requires the engagement of the Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule (SLAM) family receptors and signaling thro ugh the adaptor SLAM 64 Associated Protein (SAP), SLAM molecules, the Src k inase Fyn , and downstream NF-B [242-244]. Deficiencies in proteins involved in the TCR signal ing completely abrogate iNKT cell development. Alteration of the Fyn -SLAM-SAP signaling pathway by deletion of one of the components selectively impairs select ion of iNKT cells, but not of conventional T or NK cells. The role of SAP, which is constitutively bound to SLAM, is to recruit Fyn upon SLAM engagement at the cell surface, leading to at least two downstream signaling cascades: one involving NF-kB and the other involving proteins inhibiting MAPK signaling [245, 246]. Homo typic SLAM interaction, particularly SLAM1 and SLAM6, on selecting DP on on e side and developing iNKT cell on the other provide unique signals that stimu late iNKT precursors[247]. Interestingly, DP thymocytes and DC from NOD mice h ave reduced SLAM expression, which leads to inefficient thymic selec tion and peripheral activation of iNKT cells [248, 249]. Alterations in proteins belonging to the NF- B signaling pathway, both classic and alternative, also impair thymic selection of iNKT c ells. The extent of iNKT cells reduction varies according to which component of th e pathway is affected. T cell- targeted deletion of IKK2 (inhibitor of NF- B Kinase transgenic of NF- B)[251] and RelB deficiency in stromal cells all induce a severe reduction of i NKT cells [252, 253]. On the contrary, aly mice which are mutated in the Nik kinase [252], NF-KB1 -/-, NF-KB2 -/- mice show reduction in iNKT cells [2 51, 253], thus suggesting that the components of the signaling pathway contribute differently to iNKT cells selection. 65 3.2.1.3 Effector functions of iNKT cells iNKT cells are functionally extremely versatile cel ls, having been implicated in controlling a broad array of disease conditions, su ch as transplants rejection, tumors, autoimmunity, atherosclerosis, allergy and infections. iNKT cells play an important role in recruiting, activating and polari zing cells of both the innate and the adaptive system by the rapid production of large am ounts of cytokines together with cell-cell interactions. Cytokine production Due to their closeness to NK cell, iNKT cells produ ce molecules [172] and granzymes [254] and lyse target cells in in vitro assays [255]. Nevertheless, their main functional h allmark is indeed the rapid production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, particularly I preformed mRNA for IL-4 and IFN- in their cytoplasm in steady state conditions, allowing therefore to produce and to se crete these cytokines within minutes of stimulation [257]. In addition to IL-4 a nd IFN-, iNKT cells IL-3 GM-CSF [263]. Although it is clear that the cytokines prod uced by iNKT cells do influence the outcome of a diverse range of diseases, it is s till unclear how iNKT cells, which simultaneously produce Th1 and Th2 cytokines, can m odulate their cytokine profile to mediate the appropriate immune response [177, 26 4]. Current theories suggest that a combination of factors, including microenvir onment, interaction with the APC, antigen structure, co-receptor signaling and differ ential function by iNKT cells all play a role in determining the type of secreted cyt okines and the overall iNKT cell response [177]. 66 Effect of iNKT cells on recruitment, activation and differentiation of myeloid lineage cells and activation of NK and MHC-restricted T cel ls Secretion of IL-3 and GM-CSF by activated iNKT cell s causes the mobilization of myeloid progenitor cells and recruitment of neutrop hils to the periphery [265]. Furthermore, injection of GalCer causes an efflux of granulocytes (mostly neutrophils) in the circulation and transiently in the liver [263] and intranasal (i.n.) administration of GalCer leads to accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs [266]. Therefore, iNKT cell mediated recruitment of neutro phils in early innate phases of antimicrobial immune response appears to be a cruci al process. Through cognate interaction and cytokine secretion iNKT cells can promote differentiation and activation of APC. For instance , human iNKT cells can drive the differentiation of autologous PBMCs into immature D Cs by secreting IL-13 and GM-CSF (following recognition of self-lipid cells induce upregulation of MHC-II, costimulatory molecu les and sustain the production of IL-12 in mouse and human DC [268-270]. For these effects on APC GalCer has been proposed as adjuvant to enhance the immune response to co- administered protein antigens [271, 272]. Transactivation of NK cells by iNKT cells is rapid and potent. Ninety minutes post intra venous (i.v.) GalCer injection in WT splenic NK cells upregulate CD69 produce large quantiti es of IFN- [273]. After 24 hours liver NK undergo extensive maximal cytotoxic activity [274]. IFN- , IL-2 and NK and iNKT cells [273, 274]. iNKT cells contribute to expansion and activation o f MHC-restricted conventional T cells via secretion of CD4 + or CD8 + memory T cells in the liver and in the spleen unde rgo extensive bystander proliferation [274]. 67 B cell help Like CD4 + MHC-restricted T cells, activated iNKT cells can p rovide both non- cognate and cognate help to B cells presenting lipi d antigens onto CD1d. Within hours following i.v. cells strongly upregula te CD69, CD86 and MHC-Class II molecules in not in iN KT cells-deficient mice [273, 275]. iNKT cells- derived Th2 cytokines contribute cell activation [275, 276]. M oreover, iNKT cells activity may help to sustain serological memory following primar y immunization with protein antigens [277]. Role of iNKT on immune suppression and autoimmune d iseases iNKT cells have been implicated in a range of disea se states in experimental models and in clinical settings. At present many re ports don't provide mechanistic understanding and are therefore based merely on the analysis of iNKT cells- deficient mice. Indeed, several controversial outco mes arise by the use of CD1d -/- or J 18 -/- mice, possibly due to how gene-deficient mice are matched with the littermate controls with respect to genetic backgro und and environmental factors. This is particular important in studies of complex multigenetic diseases such as diabetes, lupus, cancer or asthma. In addition, the administration of GalCer in gain-of-function experiments must be carefully inte rpreted due to the massive release of cytokines which hardly resemble chronic diseases. Said so, several lines of evidence suggest a direct association between iN KT cell deficiencies and Type 1 Diabetes susceptibility [278, 279]; restoration o f iNKT cells in NOD mice via adoptive transfer or introduction of a V 14 TCR transgene protects from diabetes [280-282] as well as activation of iNKT cells throu gh administration of GalCer or upregulation in the pancreatic beta islets [283-285]. Inefficient iNKT cell 68 function in NOD mice can be due to problems with si gnaling through SLAM molecules during development [248] and activation [ 249]. Recently, it has been described a congenic NOD mouse strain (NOD. Nkrp1 b.Nkt2 b) with increased thymic and peripheral iNKT cells and decreased Type 1 diabetes incidence. These mice showed differential expression in several gene s on chromosomes 1 and 2, including the gene encoding for the peroxisomal pro tein Pxmp4 [286]. iNKT cells are also capable of protecting during EA E (a mouse model of brain inflammation), although iNKT cells role is controve rsial. Some models show that increasing cantly suppresses EAE [287] and CD1d -/- mice show worse EAE as compared to WT mice [288]. However, others have reported no difference in disease sever ity [289, 290]. iNKT cells involvement in other autoimmune diseases comparing iNKT cells- deficient mice with WT or lupus[291], scleroderma [292], Graft-versus-host- disease [295, 296] and promotion of graft su rvival [297-299]. of iNKT cells in immune potentiation and prote ction from pathogens Several studies have been carried out to define the role of iNKT cells in immunity to microbial infections. These studies often rely o n the outcome of the infection in CD1d -/- or J 14 -/- mice, or on the impact of iNKT cell activation on infection after administration of GalCer. By all these methods it was shown that iNKT cells participate in the response to various microbial pa thogens including bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses [300, 301]. Interestingly, th e effect of iNKT cells was not always protective for the host, like in the case of Chlamydia trachomatis infection [302]. There are several ways how iNKT cells are activated during bacterial infections, which can be broadly divided in \"direct\" and \"indir ect\" activation pathways. 69 The direct activation pathway postulates that iNKT cells recognize a bacterial l ipid antigen presented by CD1d on the infected APC. TLR- mediated DC activation, inflammatory cytokines like IL-12 or recognition of endogenous antigens are not involved in this response. In 2005 for the first ti me were identified lipid antigens from Sphingomonas spp. that were able to activate iNKT [157-159]. Sphingomonas are Gram-negative -proteobacteria lacking LPS, are ubiquitously present in the environment and are not considered p athogenic. The antigens identified in the cell walls of these bacteria, -Galacturonosylceramide and - Glucuronosylceramide, structurally resemble GalCer, with whom they share the -anomeric linkage attaching the glycan headgroup to the sphingosine base. During Sphingomonas infection, recognition of self lipids or stimulati on of TLR receptors is not required to activate iNKT cells, s ince these bacteria produce the stimulatory GSL [157, 158]. iNKT cell-deficient mic e show a reduced clearance of Sphingomonas bacteria shortly (1-3 days) after infection in the liver and in the lungs [157, 158], thus suggesting that these cells exert a protective effect. Bacterial lipid antigens were also identified from Borrelia burgdoferi [160] pathogenic bacteria, which are the causing agents o f Lyme disease. B. burgdoferi expresses galactosyl diacylglycerols containing C16:0 and C18:1 th e most abundant. The synthetic lipid antigen containing an oleic acid (C 16) in sn1 and a palmitic acid (C18:1) in sn2 was the most potent in activating iNKT cells [160] . By using MyD88 -/- mice it was shown that activation of iNKT cells was TLR-independent and it was also possible to load these antigens on CD1d-tetram ers and stain hepatic iNKT cells [160]. In a recent congress it was shown that also pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae contain lipid antigens recognized by iNKT cells [63](Kinjo 2009, 5 th NKT and CD1 meeting, Kamakura, Japan). 70 The indirect activation pathway does not depend on recognition by the iNKT-TCR of a microbial antigen, but depends on cytokines re leased by activated DC and/or recognition of endogenous lipids. During Salmonella typhimurium infection [303], LPS DC and induces IL-12 release . iNKT cells are activated by the combination of IL-12 produced by LPS-stimulated DC and by recognition of endogenous lipids presented on CD1d. iNKT cells fai l to activate during infection with Salmonella typhimurium when anti-IL-12 (or anti CD1d) mAbs are co- administered [157, 303]. Moreover, iNKT cells are n ot activated in MyD88 -/- mice infected with Salmonella typhimurium [303]. It is not clear whether LPS can directly induce the upregulation of the endogenous and production iNKT cells [304]. In this response, TLR-mediated ac tivation of DC or IL-12 is not involved. However, recognition of endogenous antige n is required, which could eventually be iGb3 since Hexb -/- DC do not stimulate iNKT cells after infection, even though the disruption of lysosomal vesicles co uld account for this failure [305]. It is not clear whether S. mansoni eggs can directly induce the upregulation of the endogenous lipids recognized by iNKT cells. DC secrete and IL-18 and both cytokines are sufficient for IFN- production by iNKT cells, and recognition of endog enous antigens presented by CD1d is not necessary for iNKT cells a ctivation [306]. The mechanism involved seems to be the achievement of a critical cytokine concentration, produced by LPS-stimulated APC, whic h is sufficient for induction of iNKT cells activation. 71 Figure 5 . Schematic representation of iNKT cells activation during microbial infection 3.2.2 Type 2 NKT cells Type 2 NKT are CD1d-restricted T cells that express a diverse TCR [307]. Very little is known about these cells that are present both in human and mouse [138, 308-310], Since Type 2 NKT do not react to GalCer and therefore cannot be stained with Galcer:CD1d dimers, it has not been possible to pre cisely enumerate these cells in mixed populations of human and mouse . They have been identified among clones self-reactive to the CD1d-transfected T cell lymphoma RMAS [310]. In addition, Type 2 NKT cells, unlike type 1 iNKT, are not dependent on the ability of CD1d to traffic to endosomes for their autoreact ivity [311]. 72 Type 2 NKT probably recognize diverse antigens. A p opulation of non-V 14 T cells is specific for CD1d:sulfatide complexes [308, 312] and can be stained with CD1d:sulfatide tetramers [13, 138]. Recently, it has been described that a population o f murine Type 2 NKT cells recognize the self lipid Lyso-sulfatide and which e xpress preferentially the V 3 and V8 TCR rearrangements together with the V 14 chain [313]. Moreover, functional studies comparing the response to Hepatitis Virus (HV) [314] and suppression of tumor rejection [315] in CD1d -/- mice (that lack Type 1 and Type 2 NKT) and in J 18 -/- mice (that lack only Type 2) have shown that type 2 NKT are functionally distinct from type 1 iNKT cell s. 73 SUMMARY AND AIMS The previous introductory part has reviewed the cur rent knowledge on CD1 and lipid immunology. Although the last 20 years witnes sed a dramatic expansion of the field, many aspects remain elusive and require additional studies. Little is known about the mechanisms by which stimu latory CD1:lipid antigen complexes are generated and how is the influence of CD1d lipid antigen presentation on thymic selection and peripheral act ivation of iNKT cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechani sms contributing to generation of lipid-specific complexes. In particular, I aim to i nvestigate the impact of LTP residing in different cellular compartments on lipi d antigen generation, loading on CD1 molecules, presentation to T cells, positive se lection in the thymus as well as stimulation of peripheral CD1-restricted T cells. These studies are divided in three parts: 1. Impact of the absence of the lysosomal LTP NPC2 or of the enzyme - Galactosidase on lipid antigen presentation and on thymic selection of iNKT cells. Recent studies demonstrate that different lysosomal lipid transfer proteins, like saposins and GM2-A, are implicated in loading of en dogenous and exogenous lipid antigens onto CD1d and thus selection [84, 87]. Development of iNKT cells is also completely abolis hed in mice deficient in saposins [84]. Deficiencies in the lysosomal enzyme Hexb, which is involved in the lipid degradation pathway, or in saposins cause sev ere imbalances in lipid 74 metabolism. It has never been addressed whether lip id metabolism alteration, and thus accumulation of storage lipids, could contribu te to the impairment of lipid antigen presentation and iNKT cell thymic selection . This study has directly assessed the contribution o f imbalance in lipid metabolism, consequence of ablation of the LTP NPC2 and of the enzyme -Galactosidase, on generation of stimulatory CD1d:lipid antigen comple xes, on their presentation to iNKT cells, and thus on thymic selection of iNKT ce lls. 2. Investigation of the functional interaction of C D1e with the other CD1 molecules CD1e is the fifth member of the CD1 family. It is t he only member of the CD1 family that does not reach the plasma membrane and is solu ble in lysosomes, therefore it might have functions going beyond presentation of l ipid antigen to T cells. CD1e binds lipid molecules in the lysosomal compartment and facilitates processing of complex glycolipid antigens, thus participating in lipid editing of CD1b-presented antigens [16]. Nothing is known about the role of CD1e in editing CD1 restricted lipids, either of self or of microbial origin. This study has demonstrated the capacity of CD1e to interact with all lysosomal CD1 molecules and to influence the response of lipi d specific-T cells, including that of iNKT cells. Generation of transgenic mice expres sing CD1e in professional APC allowed us to study the contribution of CD1e in the formation of antigenic CD1d:lipid complexes and their capacity to activate iNKT cells. 75 3. Impact of the absence of the peroxisomal and cytopl asmic LTP SCP-2 on lipid antigen presentation and on thymic selecti on of iNKT cells. All the LTP influencing lipid antigenicity and thus iNKT cell thymic selection that have been investigated so far are localised within the lysosome. The role of LTP residing in other subcellular compartments, like th e cytoplasm and the peroxisomes, on presentation of lipid antigens has never been investigated. Furthermore, whether cytoplasmic LTP are involved i n generation and intracellular trafficking of endogenous-lipid antigens remains un known. This study has directly investigated the role of a cytoplasmic/peroxisomal LTP in the generation of the repertoire of selecting lipid s, and its impact on thymic selection of iNKT cells. 76 77 MATHERIAL AND METHODS Bacteria Sphingomonas paucimobilis (P1 strain) bacteria were used in infection experiments. Bacterial cultures in the logarithmic phase were obtained by growing S. paucimobilis in Mueller-Hinton broth (Difco) at 37\u00b0 C. Series of 1/10 dilution were prepared and bacteria cell number was determined by CFU count after overnight cultures on Blood-agar plates (Blutspendezentrum Ba sel). Cell culture reagents RPMI supplemented with 50 \u00b5M non-essential amino acid (Gibco), 2 mM mine II solution (Gibco) and 100 \u00b5g/ml Kanamycin (Gibco) and used as general cell cul ture medium. RPMI medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, LuBio, Europe) for tumor cell line cultures or with 5% hum an serum (HS, from healthy, blood group AB+ donors, Blutspendezentrum Basel) an d 100 U/ml human recombinant IL-2 for T cell cultures. D-MEM medium (Gibco) was used to culture mouse cells and supplemented with 100 \u00b5M -Mercaptoethanol. All the cell culture media were filtered through St ericup GP Express PLUS 0.22 \u00b5M membrane filters (Millipore). 78 Cells The following cell lines were used: THP-1, a monocy tic leukemia; C1R, an EBV transformed human B cell line, J558, a mouse my eloma cell line, all obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). THP-1 cells transfected with CD1B gene were generated as described below [147]. The following human iNKT FF13 V 14 iNKT hybridoma was obtained as described below. The following human self- and microbial-reactive CD 1b-restricted (Sulfatide), DL15A31 (unknown M. tuberculosis lipid fraction) obtained as described below. Freezing and thawing of primary cells and cell line s Cells were washed once with PBS (LuBio), then resus pended in freezing medium containing 90% FCS and 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen containing t anks. In order to thaw cells, frozen vials were incubated at 37 \u00b0C until they were thawed, first diluted with 500 \u00b5l of PBS and then transferred to 15 ml tubes containi ng PBS and washed twice. 79 Generation of human T cell clones CD1d-restricted human V 24 Type 1 iNKT clones were established from PBMC of healthy donors. PBMCs were expanded in vitro by stimulation with 100 ng/ml -GalCer. After 14 days, GalCer expanded lines were cloned by limiting dilution in Terasaki plates. The cells were incuba ted in the presence of 5 x 10 5/ml irradiated PBMC (1500 RAD), in 20 \u00b5l of RPMI medium supplemented were transferred to 96 well-p lates, expanded and tested for antigen specificity. CD1b- and CD1c-restricted human T cell clones were established from PBMC of healthy donors and cloned by limiting dilut ions in Terasaki plates. The cells were incubated in the presence of 5 x 10 5/ml irradiated PBMC (1500 RAD), in 20 \u00b5l of base medium supplied with 5% HS, 1000 U/ml IL- 2 and 1 \u00b5g/ml PHA (Murex, Dartford). After 10-15 days growing culture s were transferred to 96 well- plates, expanded and tested for CD1 restriction and , where possible, for antigen specificity. Maintenance of human T cell clones Human T cell clones were cultured in RPMI cell cult ure medium containing 5% HS and IL-2 at 100 U/ml and expanded by restimul ation every 25-35 days. Restimulation was performed in the presence of irra diated (1500 RAD) PBMC (1:1 ratio) in the same cell culture medium supplied wit h 1 \u00b5g/ml PHA. For antigen dependent activation experiments, T cell clones wer e used 12-18 days after restimulation. 80 Generation of murine V 14 hybridomas C57BL/6 mice were injected i.p. with 5 \u00b5g GalCer. 3 days after injection mice were suppressed and splenocytes, thymocytes an d liver cells were isolated. Cells were kept overnight in culture with medium su pplemented with 10% FCS and 100 \u00b5M -mercaptoethanol . Cells were then sorted according to binding to hCD1d: GalCer dimer and mouse anti-TCRC . Sorted cells were rested overnight and then fused w ith mouse BW-5147 thymoma cells using standard procedures. Briefly, sorted ce lls and thymoma cells were mixed 1:5 in serum free RPMI medium containing 1% H epes (Gibco). Cells were washed once, supernatant removed until pellet was d ry. Meanwhile a PEG solution (2g PEG 4000 (Merck), 2.2 ml GKN 3M, 0.8 ml distill ed water and 0.04 ml NaOH 0.1N) was prepared in a sterile glass tube. This so lution was dissolved under shaking in boiling water and kept it at 37\u00b0 C. 1 ml of PEG solution was added slowly in 1-2 minute s to the cells in a 37\u00b0 C water bath with gentle shaking. Cells were left 1 minute before diluting in RPMI-Hepes over 10 minutes. The cells were kept at 37\u00b0 C for2 m inutes and then centrifuged 10 minutes at 1000 rpm. Cells were resuspended in RPMI-15% FCS containing 1 00 \u00b5M -Mercaptoethanol before seeding in flat bottom 96 wells plates at 1x 10 5 cells/ 100 \u00b5l/well. After overnight incubation 100 \u00b5l of RPMI-15% FCS containing 2% HAT- supplement and 0.01 mM -Mercaptoethanol were added to each well. After 7 days growing wells were supplemented with HT medium and then screened for specificity by hCD1d: GalCer dimer staining as described below. 81 Generation Human promyelocytic THP-1 cells were transfected CD1C, genes only using BCMGS-Neo v ectors by electroporation as described. Stable transfectant w ere subsequently transfected with the CD1E gene, using a BCMGS-Hygro vector by e lectroporation as described. Full-length cDNA was amplified by RT-PC R from total RNA of DC using Superscript-Rnase H-RT (Life technologies) and Pfu DNA sequenced after cloning in to the pBluescriptII KS+ (Stratagene). For expression, the genes were subcloned into BCMGS. Stable transfectants were generated by using Effect ene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) with 0.2 \u00b5g DNA in \u00b5l or Hygromycin B (0.15 mg/ml, Sig ma) were added for 82 selection and maintained for a minimum of 3 weeks. Expression of the proteins was assessed by Flow cytometry. Cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM UltraGlutamine II, MEM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM Na-pyruvate and 100 \u00b5g/mL kanamycin (all from Invitrogen, Basel, Switze rland). The same protocol was used to generate stable C1R C D1D single and CD1D/ CD1E double transfectants. Fixation of APCs Human cell lines and mouse thymocytes or mDC were w ashed and resuspended in PBS (3 x 10 6/ml) containing 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 20 s. Additional fixation was blocked with 0.2 M Lysine/P BS. Cells were washed twice with RPMI-medium containing 10% FCS. T cell stimulation assays Experiments with endogenous antigens Human THP1 and C1R transfected with 1B or or genes reactiv e, CD1-restricted T cells clones(10 5/well). After 24 hr T cell activation was estimated by measuring cytokine release using ELISA assays. mDC (5x10 4 cells/well) FF13 (1x10 5 cells/well). After 24 hr T cell activation was est imated by measuring cytokine release using ELISA assays. Experiments with exogenous antigens APC were pulsed 2 4 cells/well) and subsequent addition of the specifi c T cell clones (1x10 5 cells/well). After 24-48 hr T cell activation was estimated by measuring cytokine release using ELISA assays. To study the kinetics of activation induced by CD1e presence, THP-1 D, THP1-D+E, 10 ng/ml GalCer for selected periods (1-24 hr). The cells were then washed and s uspended in PBS (2x10 6/ml) containing glutarhaldeide 0.05% for 20 s for fixati on. Additional fixation was blocked with 0.2 M Lysine/PBS. APC were plated 10 5/well in 1:1 ratio with murine iNKT hybr idoma FF13 for 24 hr. T cell activation was estimated by measuring cytokine release using ELISA assays. In some experiments mDC were pulsed for different t imes with heat- inactivated S. paucimobilis at a were pulsed with 1ng/ml of GalCer for 2 hr and chased for different periods of time before addition of FF13 iNKT hybridoma cells o r the human VMD5 NKT clone. 84 The amounts of realeased cytokines decreased with l onger chases. This allowed identification of persistence of stimulatory CD1d:a ntigen complexes. CD1d-plate bound experiments MaxiSorp Plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at om 10 Bir1.4 8] , was coated overnight at room temperature at 5 \u00b5g/ml on 96 well plate. For experiments of GalCer loading onto CD1d, sonicated GalCer (2 \u00b5g/ml) was added in the presence or absence of different solub le recombinant LTP (SAP-A,- B,-C and BSA) (4 \u00b5g/ml) or of soluble recombinant CD1e (10 \u00b5g/ml).

As described before, unlike conventional MH C-dependent T cells, iNKT cells are positively selected by CD1d expressing DP cortical thimocytes [194]. The key event deciding for selection of iNKT cells is t he appropriate presentation of endogenous thymic lipid antigen(s) by CD1d. Many st eps are involved in this process, including proper conformation of the CD1d molecule, correct intracellular trafficking of lipids and CD1d, generation of lipid antigen(s), and loading of the lipid antigen(s) onto CD1d in late endosomes/lysosomes [3 23-326]. Different lysosomal lipid transfer proteins, like s aposins and GM2-A, have been implicated in loading of endogenous and exogenous l ipid antigens onto CD1d lipid to iNKT cells [84, 87]. Indeed, development of iNKT cells is completely abo lished in mice deficient in saposins [84]. However, deficiency in Hexb or saposins causes severe imbalances in lipid metabolism, and in more recent studies it has been discussed that lipids accumulating in lysosomes might impair presentation of lipid antigens by CD1d, and thus thymic selection of iNKT cells. entation of lipid antigens to iNKT and their thymic development are also deficien t in mouse models of different other types of lysosomal lipid storage diseases, i. e., in mice deficient in - Hexosaminidases A protein [91, 208]. In this part of my thesis I describe the impact of accumulating lipids in lysosomes on generation of lipid antigens and their presentat ion to iNKT cells, and the mechanism by which lipid antigen presentation is di sturbed in this context. 110 To gain a better understanding of the influence of disturbed lipid metabolism and lysosomal lipid storage on the presentation of lipi d antigens and the development of iNKT cells, we analyzed two mouse models of imba lanced lipid metabolism: mice deficient in the lysosomal enzyme -Galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23), which is involved in the glycosphingolipid degradation pathw ay ( Figure 6 ), and mice deficient in the lysosomal lipid transfer protein N PC2, whose precise functions are still largely unknown. Figure 6. Schematic representation of glycosphingolipids deg radation pathway. In red circles are defined the lipids which are accumulate d in absence of the -Galactosidase enzyme. 111 RESULTS Thymic selection of iNKT cells is impaired in -Galactosidase -/- mice To test the effect of the absence of the enzyme -Galactosidase ( -Gal) on thymic development of iNKT analysis of thymocytes isolated from -Gal -/- and WT mice was performed. The analysis of the comp lete thymus ( Figure 7A ) showed a strong reduction in the number of iNKT c ells in KO mice as compared to WT. This reduction was better v isualized when the thymocytes were depleted from CD24 + (HSA +) and CD8 + cells, a procedure that allows an enrichment in iNKT cells [188] ( Figure 7B ). The residual population of iNKT cells that was sele cted in GalCer) dimers with (Mean Fluorescence Int ensity) of dimer staining. Thymocytes frequencies of conventional TCR- (defined by the percentage of TCR-C+ in Figure 7A ) as well as DN, DP, +, ( Figure 8C ) normal. CD1d levels on the surface of DP thymocytes (the ce ll type driving positive selection of iNKT cells) remained unchanged between WT and KO thymocytes, thus excluding that the reduction in iNKT cells in the thymus was due to a lower CD1d expression ( Figure 8B ). 112 Figure in thymi of -Gal -/- mice.

The frequencies of iNKT cells were reduced in liver s and spleens of Gal -/- mice to a similar extent as in the thymus ( Figure 9 ). The numbers of mononuclear cells and the frequencie s of conventional TCR- T cells were normal in livers and spleens of -Gal -/- mice, as defined by the percentage of TCR + cells in Figures 9A and 9B. As in the thymus, the residual population of iNKT cells bound CD1d: GalCer dimers with high avidity. Figure 9. iNKT are reduced in liver and spleen of -Gal -/- mice.

We therefore analyz ed the expression of the two major V chains, V 8.2 and V 7, which mostly pair with the invariant TCR- chain of iNKT cells, in the residual iNKT cell population s. In addition, since mouse iNKT cells are either CD4 + or DN, we analyzed the expression of the CD4 co-re ceptor in the residual NKT population. Interestingly, the iNK T cell population that was selected in the absence of -Galactosidase showed a remarkable shift in the V8.2/V 7 ratio towards V 7 expression ( Figure 10A and B), whereas CD4 was expressed at normal frequency and intensity ( Figure 10C ). Frequencies of V 8.2 +, V7+ and CD4 + cells were not changed among conventional TCR- T cells in - Galactosidase-deficient mice ( Figure 10A, B, C lower panels). 115 Figure 10.

We utilized an in vitro system in which a human V 24 iNKT clone is stimulated by mouse thymocytes or DC in the absence of additional lipid antigens. Under these conditions, APC from WT mice caused the release of human IL-4 by the V 24 iNKT clone ( Figure 11 ). This stimulation was completely when -Gal -/- thymocytes were used as APC ( Figure 11 upper panel). DC were also able to induce the secretion of human IL-4 by the iNKT clone ( Figure 11 lower panel), but deficiency of -Galactosidase in DC did not impair the cytokine release. Figure 11. Presentation of endogenous lipid antigens is impair ed in -Gal -/- mice. Thymocytes, TC, upper panel, and DC, lower panel, f rom WT or -Gal -/- mice were used to stimulate a human iNKT clone in the absence of exog enously added lipid antigens. Release of human IL- 4 was determined in the cell c ulture supernatants after 24 hr. 117 This finding allowed us to speculate that a certain degree of cell type-specific difference is possible and indicates that -Galactosidase per se is not involved in the stimulation of the human iNKT clone in the desc ribed in vitro system. To check whether presentation of exogenously given lipid antigens is also disturbed in the absence of -Galactosidase, a mouse iNKT hybridoma was stimulated with -Gal -/- or WT presence GalCer or of iGb3. Both were less efficiently presented by -Gal -/- as compared to WT thymocytes ( Figure 12 . used to stimulate a mouse iNKT hybridoma in the presence of different concent rations of GalCer ( A) or iGb3 ( B). Release of mouse IL-2 was determined in the cell cu lture supernatants after 24 hr. comparing WT and -Gal -/-. 118 In contrast, DC from -Gal -/- mice were not impaired in presenting GalCer (A), iGb3 (B) and LacCer (C)( Figure 13 ). Figure 13 .

Figure 14 . -Galactosidase deficient splenocytes () mice were incubated with different concentrations of purified protein derivative (PPD) and a PPD-specific murine T cell line for 4 days. [3H] thymidine was added for 8 h, and [3H] thymidine incorporation was determined. These results show that presentation of lipid antig ens, and not of peptides, is disturbed in -Gal -/- thymocytes, and this might explain the impairment o f thymic selection of iNKT cells in -Gal -/- mice. Pharmacological reduction of lipid accumulation in -Gal thymocytes improves lipid antigen presentation The enzyme the terminal -galactosidic residues of 6 ), gangliosides GM1 and and 120 lactosylceramide [329]. A deficiency in this enzyme could therefore cause the lack of a lipid antigen involved in thymic selection of iNKT cells. However, our findings that -Gal -/- DC were able to stimulate human iNKT cells in the absence of additional lipid antigen and that pr esentation of exogenously given lipid antigens was impaired in -Gal -/- thymocytes suggest that an indirect rather than a direct mechanism is responsible for impaired selection of iNKT cells in - Gal -/- mice. To test for the hypothesis that the accumulat ion of lipids negatively influences lipid antigen presentation in -Gal -/- mice, we took advantage of an biosynthesis, N-buty ldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), which in vivo [330]. Incubation of - Gal -/- thymocytes with NB-DNJ improved their capacity to present GalCer to iNKT hybridoma cells, thus indicating that storage lipids disturb lipid antigen presentation in -Gal -/- thymocytes ( Figure 15 ). This mechanism might also explain why thymic selection of iNKT cells is impaired in -Gal -/- mice. 121 Figure 15. Accumulation of lysosomal storage lipids causes th e impairment in presentation of -/- murine iNKT hybridoma cells were added. IL-2 release to cell culture supe rnatant was determined. The bar chart shows the mean release of IL-2 (\u00b1SD; n=3). ** p<0.0 1; ns, not significant. Intracellular defects account for impairment of lip id antigen presentation in -Gal -/- cells Accumulating lipids might disturb lipid antigen pre sentation in several ways. Storage lipids could directly block or modify CD1d molecules, could change membrane structures, and/or could disturb proteins involved in the transport of lipid antigens, in the unloading of non-antigenic lipids from CD1d, and/or in the loading of lipid antigens onto CD1d. To investigate whether the formation of functional CD1d:lipid antigen complexes on the cell surface is impaired in -Gal -/- thymocytes, these cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and test ed for their capacity to present GalCer to iNKT hybridoma cells cells ( Figure 16 ), showing that the formation of functional CD1d: GalCer complexes directly on the cell surface is not disturbed in -Galactosidase-deficient thymocytes. 122 Figure 16 . Intracellular defects with no disturbance of the CD1d molecule account for the impairment in presentation of lipids in -Gal -/- thymocytes. Living incubated with various concentrations of GalCer before the addition of mouse iNKT hybridoma cells. IL-2 release to cell culture supernatant was determined. Diagrams show the mean release of IL-2 iNKT cells is impaired in NPC2 -/- mice To test the effect of the absence of the LTP NPC2 o n thymic development of iNKT cells, the same series of experiments done for the -Gal -/- mice were performed. Thymocytes isolated from NPC2 -/- and WT mice were therefore first analysed by flowcytometry. 123 The absence of NPC2 inhibited thymic development of iNKT cells by 60-70%. This was determined by flowcytometric analysis thymoc ytes NPC2 -/- and as described for -Gal -/- mice.

CD1d surface expression was somewhat lower on DP th ymocytes in the absence of NPC2 ( Figure 18B ). However, this decreased surface expression is no t sufficient to explain the low numbers of iNKT cells selected in NPC2 -/- mice since 3 CD1d MFI, 22 \u00b1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 0 3 1 0 407 5 0 1 5 0 0 2 2 5 0 3 0 0 0 3 CD1d MFI, 22 \u00b1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 0 3 1 0 407 5 0 1 5 0 0 2 2 5 0 3 0 0 0 MFI, 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 0 3 1 0 407 5 0 1 5 0 0 2 2 5 0 3 0 0 0 of CD1d as compar ed to CD1d +/+ mice, have normal numbers of iNKT cells [188, 195]. Also in the periphery, in liver and spleen, frequen cies and numbers of iNKT cells were greatly reduced in NPC2 -/- mice ( Figure 19 ), although total mononuclear cell numbers were significantly increased, especially in the liver. Further analysis revealed that this increase is mainly due to elevat ed numbers of B cells. ( Figure 20 ) Figure 19 . iNKT are reduced in liver and spleen of NPC2 -/- mice.

Numbers in gate represent the percent of B cells \u00b1 s.d. or of conve ntional T cells \u00b1 s.d We analyzed the expression of V 8.2, V7 and CD4 in the residual iNKT cell populations in NPC2 -/- mice. The iNKT cell population that was selected in the absence of NPC2 did not show a preferential V usage ( Figure 21A and B), whereas CD4 was expressed at higher frequency in NP C2 -/- iNKT ( Figure 21C ). Frequencies of V 8.2 +, V 7+, and CD4 + cells were not changed among conventional TCR- T cells in NPC2-deficient mice. Despite the fact that both -Gal -/- and NPC2 -/- mice are deficient in iNKT cells, there are some differences regarding the residual populat ions of iNKT cells: (i) the small population of iNKT cells selected in the absence of NPC2 bound CD1d: GalCer dimers with similar avidity as from m ice, whereas in -Gal -/- mice only NKT cells binding these dimers with high avidi ty could be detected ( Figures 7, 9, 17 and 19 ). (ii) The ratio of CD4 -/CD4 + cells among iNKT (but not among conventional TCR- T) cells in NPC2 -/- mice was significantly increased by a factor of 3.5, whereas CD4 expression was normal am ong iNKT cells in -Gal -/- mice ( Figures 10C and 21C ).

These repertoire differences suggest that different mecha nisms account for NKT deficiency in the two models. Figure 21.

Thymocytes or DC from WT mice stimulated the human iNKT clone to release human IL-4, whereas this stimulation was st rongly impaired if cells were deficient in NPC2 ( Figure 22 ). Figure 22. Presentation of endogenous lipid antigens is impair ed in NPC2 -/- mice. Thymocytes, TC upper panel, and DC, lower panel, fr om WT or NPC2 -/- mice were used to stimulate a human iNKT clone in the absence of exog enously added lipid antigens. Release of human IL- 4 was determined in the cell c ulture supernatants after 24 hr. *** p<0.001 comparing WT and NPC2 -/-. An interesting point is that NPC2 DC, in contrast to thymocytes ( Figure 18B ), had normal expression levels of CD1d on the surface (da ta not shown) and nevertheless were weak APC. 129 When thymocytes ( Figure 23 ) or DC ( Figure 24 ) were deficient in NPC2, the stimulation of mouse iNKT hybridoma cells in the pr esence of GalCer (A), iGb3 (B) or LacCer (C) was also impaired. Figure 23 . Presentation of exogenous lipid antigens is used to stimulate mouse iNKT hybridoma cells in the presence of different c oncentrations of ( A) GalCer or ( B) iGb3.

Presentation of peptides via MHC class II was not i nfluenced by the lack of NPC2 since NPC2 -/- DC perfectly presented ovalbumin to specific T cell s derived from OT-II transgenic mice ( Figure 25 ) Figure 25 . NPC2 deficient DC have normal lysosomal WT (/circle7) or NPC2 () mice incubated with different concentrations of ovalbumin (OVA) and CD4 + T cells from OT-II transgenic (DO11.10) mice for 4 days. IFN- release to cell culture supernatant was determined. Diagrams show t he mean IFN- release (\u00b1 SD). 131 Since NPC2 is thought to be involved in lipid trans port [95, 97, 331], we wondered whether the lower efficacy of lipid antigens in NPC 2 -/- cells is due to a changed half life of functional CD1d:lipid antigen complexes. To test it, NPC2 -/- or WT DC were pulsed with GalCer for 2 hours and chased for different periods of time before addition of iNKT hybridoma cells. The kinetics by w hich the stimulatory capacity of DC decreased, and thus the half-life of functional CD1d: GalCer complexes, were identical between NPC2 -/- and WT cells (t1/2 14 hr). ( ) Therefore, the formation of stimulatory CD1d: GalCer complexes, rather than their maintenance, is affected in NPC2 -/- cells. Thus, the low numbers of iNKT cells selected in NPC2 -/- mice can be explained with the deficiency in lipid antigen presentation. Figure 26. Formation of stimulatory CD1d :GalCer complexes is altered in with GalCer (100 ng/mL) for 2 hr and chased for different periods of time before additio n of murine iNKT hybridoma cells. 132 Pharmacological reduction of lipid accumulation in NPC2 -/- thymocytes improves lipid antigen presentation To better understand the mechanism of impaired lipi d antigen presentation in NPC2 -/- APC, we tested whether accumulation of lipids might play a role. Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis was pharmacologicall y inhibited in thymocytes with NB-DNJ, as described above. Analogous experiments w ith DC could not be performed because of toxicity of NB-DNJ at pharmaco logical concentrations, similar to observations described for the analogous drug N- butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin [91]. Incubation of NPC2 -/- thymocytes with capacity to present GalCer to iNKT hybridoma cells (Figure 27 ), indicating that accumulating lipids contribute t o the impairment of lipid antigen presentation in NPC2 -/- thymocytes. This mechanism might also explain why thymic selection of iNKT cells is impaired in NPC2 -/- mice. Figure 27. Accumulation of lysosomal storage lipids accounts f or the impairment of lipid antigen presentation in NPC2 -/- cells. Thymocytes from NPC2 -/- or GalCer (1 ng/mL) and murine iNKT hybridoma cells we re added. IL-2 release to cell culture supernatant was determined. The bar chart shows the mean release of IL-2 (\u00b1SD; n=3). * p<0.05; ns, not significant. 133 The formation of stimulatory CD1d:lipid antigen com plexes is impaired in NPC2 -/- APC To investigate whether the formation of functional CD1d:lipid antigen complexes on the cell surface is impaired in NPC2 -/- APC, DC from NPC2 -/- and WT fixed with glutaraldehyde and then incubated with GalCer to test their presentation capacity to iNKT hybridoma cells. For this experiment we chose DC rather than thymocytes because surface CD1d levels were not reduced in the case of NPC2 -/- DC, as mentioned above. Fixation did not improve th e efficacy of GalCer stimulation by NPC2-deficient APC ( Figure 28A , right panel). Increasing concentrations of GalCer could not overcome this defect, suggesting t hat the CD1d: GalCer complexes formed on NPC2 -/- DC might have intrinsic differences limiting the stimulation of iNKT cells. These diffe rences could depend on the presence of spacer molecules disturbing proper bind ing of stimulatory lipid antigens or, alternatively, could be ascribed to a reduced number of CD1d molecules freely available for binding GalCer. To test for the first possibility, lipid antigens w ith short alkyl chains were used together with NPC2 -/- DC 28B ). C8 alkyl chain binds to CD1d also in the presence of spacer molecules inserted in the A' pocket [15]. We compared therefore the stimulatory capacity of t wo GalCer molecules containing a C8 and a C26 alkyl chain, re spectively ( Figure 28 ). 134 Figure 28. Disturbance of CD1d in forming functional complexe s with lipid antigen accounts for the impairment of lipid antigen presen tation in NPC2 -/- cells. Living (left panel) or fixed (right panel) DC from WT ( /circle7) or NPC2 -/- () GalCer ( A) or a C8 before the addition of iNKT hybridoma cells. IL-2 release to c ell culture supernatant was determined. Diagrams show the mean release of IL-2 *** p<0.001 comparing -/- These experiments revealed three main findings: (i) the reduction of the alkyl chain length from C26 to C8 did not improve the efficacy of GalCer stimulation by living or fixed NPC2 -/- DC. This suggests that a smaller number of stimulat ory CD1d: GalCer complexes is formed on NPC2 -/- cells regardless of the alkyl chain 135 length. (ii) When fixed DC were used, about 100 tim es more C8 GalCer was required for maximal T cell stimulation as compared to living DC. Instead, C26 GalCer was equally potent with both fixed and livin g DC. This indicates that the presence of short alkyl chains affects the formatio n of stable complexes with CD1d molecules modified by fixation. (iii) The maximal c ytokine release induced by C8 GalCer was similar when living or fixed DC were use d, thus indicating that the CD1d: GalCer complexes formed with this analogue stimulat e iNKT cells very efficiently. DISCUSSION Deficiencies in enzymes of the lysosomal glycosphin golipid degradation pathway or in lysosomal lipid transfer proteins cause imbal ances in lipid metabolism. Recently, mouse models of lipid storage diseases ha ve been studied with respect to the relevance of lysosomal enzymes and lipid tra nsfer proteins for stimulation and selection of iNKT cells, which recognize glycol ipid antigens in the context of CD1d have reduced numbers of iNKT cells and, in the cases saposin -/-, in lipid antigen presentation. iNKT c ell deficiency has originally been explained as a resul t of lacking iGb3 in the case of Hexb -/-, and of impaired saposin-mediated lipid transfer o nto CD1d molecules in the case of saposin -/- mice. Recently it has been instead hypothesized th at lysosomal lipid storage might have an independent, nonspecific negative effect on lipid antigen presentation and thymic selection of iNKT cells [91, 208]. However, 136 the contribution of lysosomal storage lipids to an impairment of lipid antigen presentation has not been carefully investigated, s o far. Here we investigated two mouse models of imbalanced lipid metabolism, -Gal -/-mice (a model for GM1 gangliosidosis) NPC2 -/- mice (a model for Niemann Pick C2 disease). In bot h models, development of iNKT but not of other T cell s was impaired by 70%. The simplest explanation for iNKT cell deficiency in th ese mice would be a specific involvement of -Gal in the generation of iNKT cell-selecting lipid antigen(s) in the thymus and a specific role of NPC2 as a lipid trans fer protein for iNKT cell- selecting lipid antigen(s) or their precursors. How ever, our data suggest that it is rather indirect mechanisms, particularly the accumu lation of different types of lipids, which are responsible for impaired selectio n of iNKT cells in the two mouse models. The enzyme -Gal is involved in the hydrolyzation of terminal - galactosidic residues of glycoconjugates, including the lactosylceramide [329]( Figure 6 ). can no longer be degraded to GM2/GA2 and GM3/GA3 and represent the most prominen t glycolipids accumulating in patients and mice deficient in -Gal [332-334]. However, the lack of gangliosides such as GM2/GA2 or GM3/GA3 probably does not explain deficient development of iNKT cells in -Gal -/- mice since mice lacking ganglio-series glycolipids as a result of genetic deficiency of GM 2 or GM3 synthases, the key enzymes for their synthesis, displayed no apparent defect in development of NKT cells [76]. Lactosylceramide does not accumulate in -Gal -/- mice because its degradation, involving the removal of terminal -galactose residues, can be exerted by an alternative enzyme, Galactosylceramid ase (EC 3.2.1.46)[335, 336]. Hence, assuming that accumulating lipids in lysosom es would not interfere with the glycosphingolipid degradation pathways, the degrada tion products of lactosylceramide would be generated normally in the se mice. iGb3, which for some time was considered a selecting lipid antigen, is a lso generated normally because 137 -Gal is not involved in the globoside degradation p athway. Overall, we therefore considered the possibility that deficiency of -Gal indirectly, rather than directly, causes the impairment of iNKT cell development. Thi s consideration was supported by our observations that -Gal -/- DC, in contrast to -Gal -/- thymocytes, were able to stimulate human V 24 iNKT cells in the absence of additional lipid antigens and that presentation of exogenous lipid a ntigens ( GalCer or iGb3) by - -/- thymocytes was impaired. Similarly, Gadola et al. [208] showed impaired presentation of GalCer by -Gal -/- splenocytes. Furthermore, we found that presentation of exogenous lipid antigen is improved by pre-treatment of known to reduce pathological lipid storage in vitro and in v ivo [330]. This indicates that accumulating lipids disturb lipid antigen presentat ion in -Gal -/- thymocytes. GM1, the major glycolipid accumulating in -Galactosidase-deficient patients and mice, competes with other glycolipids for binding to CD1d [337]. This mechanism would affect the formation of stimulatory CD1d:lipid anti gen complexes on the cell surface. However, since upon fixation -Gal -/- and WT thymocytes presented lipid antigen equally, it is intracellular defects that a ccount for the impairment of lipid antigen presentation in -Gal -/- cells. Disturbance of proteins involved in the transport of lipid antigens, in the unloading of no n-antigenic lipids from CD1d, in the loading of lipid antigens onto CD1d, and/or in the maintenance of functional CD1d:lipid antigen complexes might occur. The effec t of -Gal actosidase deficiency on lipid antigen presentation could be o bserved with thymocytes and splenocytes, but not with DC. Different quantities or types of accumulating lipids might explain why lipid antigen presentation is imp aired in fixation -Gal -/- thymocytes but not DC. Therefore, this demands caut ion with the cell type used for lipid antigen-presentation experiments to avoid mis interpretations, for example regarding thymic selection. 138 The proteins NPC1 and NPC2 are thought to be involv ed in the transport of different lipids [97, 331]. Deficiency of either NP C1 or NPC2 and other lipids 97]. The precise mechanisms of action or the substrates of these putative transpor ters have not been fully defined, yet. However, it is inferred that NPC1 and NPC2 hav e nonredundant functions in a common pathway of lipid transport [97] with a parti cular role for NPC2 as a lysosomal cholesterol transfer protein [95]. Recent ly, impaired glycosphingolipid trafficking, lipid antigen presentation, and develo pment of iNKT cells in NPC1 -/- mice have been described [91, 208]. Glycosphingolip id trafficking was partly restored by pre-treatment of NPC1-deficient cells w ith N- butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin in vitro [91]. The impact of this partial restoration on lipid antigen presentation to iNKT cells has not be en studied. However, since accumulating lipids disturb glycosphingolipid traff icking in NPC1 -/- cells they might also contribute to impaired lipid antige n presentation if NPC1 is absent. In the present study, we demonstrated that lipid an tigen presentation is impaired in NPC2 -/- APC, including thymocytes, and that thymic iNKT cells is disturbed in NPC2 -/- mice. Impaired presentation of lipid antigens was n ot due to a change in the half-life of CD1d:lipid antigen compl exes thus excluding faster degradation of CDd:lipid antigen complexes. Importa ntly, lipid antigen presentation could be improved by pre-treatment of NPC2 -/- APC with NB-DNJ, directly demonstrating glycosphingolipids disturb lipid presentation in NPC2 -/- APC. Two mechanisms describing how the accumulating lipids might inhibit CD1d antigen presentation can be envisaged. First, they could hinder unloading of the spacer molecules that are associat ed with CD1d [15]. However, this possibility is not supported by the results ob tained with the C8 GalCer analogue. This lipid antigen can effectively bind t o CD1d in the presence of 139 spacers [15]. Nevertheless, it does not restore the presentation capacity of NPC2 -/- APC. A second mechanism is that accumulating glycos phingolipids could form very stable complexes with CD1d and prevent the formatio n of complexes containing the stimulatory lipid antigens. Indeed, a number of lipids are able to bind to CD1d without being antigenic for iNKT cells, including p [328] which accumulate in NPC2 -/- cells. Although this mechanism is difficult to prove experimentally, it is in agreement with our findings showing that pre-treatment of NPC2 -/- DC with NB-DNJ partially restores lipid antigen presentation and that even high concentrati ons of GalCer could not overcome the presentation defect. Although the accu mulation of lipids impairs lipid antigen presentation in both -Gal -/- and NPC2 -/- cells, the underlying mechanisms are different. We cannot exclude that also the mous e strain background (C57BL/6 in the case of -Gal -/- and BALB/c in the case of NPC2 -/- mice) may influence the effect of accumulating lipids on the phenotype of i NKT cells. However, because of the characteristic types of lipids accumulating in -Gal -/- vs . NPC2 -/- mice, we favour the hypothesis that it is mainly a change in the quantity and type(s) of presented lipid antigens that influences the phenot ype and TCR repertoire among the residual iNKT cell populations in -Gal -/- vs . NPC2 -/- mice. This includes a remarkable decrease of the V 8.2/V 7 ratio in -Gal -/- but not NPC2 -/- and an increase CD4 -/CD4 in NPC2 -/- mice. In -Gal -/- mice, limiting quantities of available lipids responsible for positive selection might favour development of iNKT cells expressing V 7, which confers high avidity binding to CD1d in the context of endogenous selecting lipid a ntigen(s)[188, 207]. In NPC2 -/- mice, changes in the types of selecting lipid antig ens might affect the strength of TCR signalling and cause more frequent downregulati on of CD4, resembling down- regulation of CD4 and CD8 on DP thymocytes caused b y stimulation of the TCR [338]. 140 In summary, disregulation of lipid metabolism and a ccumulation of lipids cause defective presentation of lipid antigens and impair ed thymic selection of iNKT cells. The exact underlying mechanisms are diverse, depend ing on the cause of imbalance, and, as a consequence, different subsets of iNKT cells are selected in thymi of mice suffering from different lipid storag e diseases. 141 CHAPTER 2 CD1e participates in shaping the lipid antigen repert oire 142 143 SUMMARY CD1 proteins are expressed by a limited number of c ell types, including dendritic cells. Only some mammals express CD1e, a CD1 family member with important differences as compared to the other CD1 proteins. CD1e has functions going beyond the presentation of lipid antigen to T cells . It binds lipid molecules in the lysosomal compartment and facilitates processing of complex glycolipid antigens, thus participating in lipid editing of CD1b-present ed antigens. Nothing is known about the role of CD1e in editing CD1d or CD1c restricted lipids, either of self or of microbial origin. Here we describe that the presence of CD1e on APC e xpressing other CD1 molecules influences the response of T cells, inclu ding that of iNKT cells. APC from human CD1E-transgenic mice are more efficient than wild-type APC in the stimulation of T cells with microbial antigens as w ell as of autoreactive iNKT cells. The function of CD1e is therefore broad and the mec hanism how it modulates lipid- specific T cell responses involves the generation o f lipid antigens both of endogenous and exogenous origin, possibly by endoso mal editing of lipid molecules and by facilitating their loading and unl oading on other CD1 molecules. 144 145 RESULTS CD1e participates in the stimulation of CD1b- and C D1c-restricted T cells. To study in detail the role of CD1e in tuning the l ipid-specific T cell response to CD1c- and CD1b-dependent antigens, we took advantag e of our collection of lipid- specific T cell clones with various CD1 restriction and specific for self and non-self antigen. THP-1 cells expressing CD1b or CD1c, alone or in combination with CD1e, were generated by transfection and were used as APC in T cell activation assays. Expression levels of CD1b and CD1c, CD1e an d MHC Class I molecules of THP1-CD1c and THP1-CD1b single or double transfe ctants are illustrated in Figure 29 . CD1b- or CD1c-dependent T cell clones reactive to s elf antigens were variously affected in their response by the presence of CD1e in APC ( Figure 30A-C ). unaffected response to exogenously added antigens presented by CD1b was also differently influenced b y CD1e. The CD1b-restricted response of the GG33a clone to ganglioside GM1 was in the presence of CD1e ( 30D ). The response of the CD1b-restricted to synthetic diacyl s ulfoglycolipid [147, ). The response of the Z5B71 clone to GroMM was instead increased in CD1e -expressing APC ( Figure 30F ) as well of -restricted clone DS1C9b in APC co-expressing CD1c gave similar results also in the case of exogenously added antigens. The response of the clone DL15A31 to a 146 semi-purified preparation of M. tuberculosis lipid antigens was not affected ( Figure 30I ), while the clone DS1B9c responded slightly better to sulfatide when APC expressed CD1e. The effect was visible at low but n ot at high antigen doses (Figure 30H ). Figure 29: CD1 levels are identical in THP1 single and double transfectants. THP1-CD1c (left side) and THP1-CD1b (right side) single (gray line) and double transfected (black line) where analysed for expression levels of CD1 molecul es (upper panel), CD1e (middle panel) and MHC-Class I (lower panel). 147 Figure 30. CD1e participates in the presentation of CD1b- and Human GM-CSF release was determined by ELISA and expressed as me an ng/ml \u00b1 s.d. of duplicate wells. 148 Taken together these findings suggest that CD1e dif ferently influences the presentation of endogenous and exogenous lipid anti gens, by favoring or limiting presentation by CD1b and CD1c molecules. In some ca ses, though, CD1e is irrelevant. We did not observe any apparent correla tion with CD1-restriction, and probably the nature of the lipid antigen is importa nt. Type 1 iNKT and type 2 NKT clones respond different ly to self lipids in the presence of CD1e To investigate whether the presence of CD1e in APC influences also the response of CD1d self-reactive clones, THP-1 were transfecte d with both CD1D and CD1E cDNAs and were used as APC in th e absence of additional lipid antigens. Several type 1 iNKT and type 2 NKT clones were selected according to their autoreactivity and to different TCR CDR3 sequences (data not shown). The presence of CD1e influenced differently the res ponse of distinct self-reactive clones evaluated as cytokine release. For all the t ype 1 iNKT clones that we tested, the presence of CD1e in THP1 cells resulted in an i ncreased GM-CSF production (Figure 31, left panel). Type 2 NKT clones, instead, showed a more variable responsiveness in the presence of CD1e ( Figure 31, right panel ). Similar results were obtained using C1R cells (a human B cell line) transfected with CD1D or both CD1D and CD1E cDNAs, thus excluding any effect rela ted to the cell type used as APC ( Figure 31B ). 149 When we analysed the effect of CD1e by titrating th e APC, some clones were positively influenced (A), some others were negativ ely influenced (B) and only few clones were unaffected by CD1e expression (C) ( Figure 32 ). Figure 31 . CD1d dependent clones (type 1 and type 2) respond differently to self lipids in the presence of CD1e. A panel of type 1 iNKT cells (left panel) and type 2 (right panel) NKT cells was incubated with single and double tran sfected THP-1 ( A) and C1R ( B) and the difference in activation is measured as % of ch ange of hGM-CSF released after stimulation with hCD1D+E transfectants compared to hGM-CSF released to hCD1d transfectants only (100%). 150 Figure 32. (A) Human Type 1 iNKT cells or ( B,C ) Type 2 NKT incubated THP-1 cells either (ng/ml \u00b1 s.d.) to cell culture supernatant was determined by ELISA. We also excluded any aspecific effect due to differ ences in CD1d expression levels among single and double transfectants since CD1d (l eft panel), as well as MHC-I (right panel), was equally expressed on both types of transfectants. CD1e expression was detected only in double transfected cells (middle panel) ( Figure 33 ). Similar CD1d expression levels among single and double transfectants were also observed on C1R cells (data not shown). 151 Figure 33. CD1d levels are identical in THP1 CD1D single (gre y line) and CD1D, CD1E double transfectants (black line). CD1d (left panel ), CD1e (middle panel) and MHC-I expression levels (right panel) detected on both ty pes of transfectants. Dotted grey line, irrelevant mAb. These results suggest that CD1e expression in APC c an influence the response of CD1d self-reactive T cells to endogenous antigens. The function of CD1e probably depends on the nature of the lipid antigen, since d ifferent clones are influenced to different extent or are not at all influenced in th eir reactivity by the CD1e presence in APC. CD1e influences the types of cytokines secreted in response to the presentation of exogenous lipid We next studied whether the presentation of exogeno us lipid antigens known to be potent iNKT TCR agonists is also affected by CD1e p resence. A nonself-reactive Type 1 iNKT human clone stimulated APC tra nsfected with CD1D or CD1D and LacCer or the Sphingomonas -derived antigen GSL'. In this set of experiments t he antigens were 152 kept in the well during the entire period of stimul ation. It has been recently shown that the types of cytokines released after TCR trig gering varies hierarchically according to the strength of the signal [340]. We t herefore measured the release of GM-CSF, IL-4 and IFN- in response to lipid antigen presentation to the h uman iNKT cell clone. We observed a common hierarchy of cytokine secretion for the three antigen tested. GM-CSF secretion was infl uenced by CD1e presence (Figure 34 A,D,G ) which, instead, inhibited the secretion of IL-4 ( B,E,H ) and Figure 34 C,F,I ) for all the antigens tested. The threshold of act ivation required for secretion of GM-CSF is known to be low er than the threshold required for IL-4 and IFN- secretion. These findings suggest that, in the pre sence of CD1e, an equilibrium may exist between generation of new CD1d:lipid antigen complexes and unloading of re-internalized complexes. As a co nsequence, in the presence of CD1e fewer CD1d:antigen complexes may be available on the surface of APC. Secretion of cytokines which require a higher thres hold of activation and an higher number of CD1d:antigen complexes on the surface may be therefore decreased in the presence of CD1e. 153 Figure 34. CD1e influences the type of cytokines secreted in response to the presentation of exogenously added lipid antigen.. Human monocyte -derived THP-1 genes ( /circle7) were incubated for 2 hr with different concentrations of GalCer ( A, B, C ), or or of Sphingomonas- clone VM-D5.,hGM-CSF and hIL- 4 (ng/ml \u00b1 SD) release was determined by ELISA after 24 hr, w hile hIFN- release was determined after 48 hr by ELISA. 154 We then analysed the effect of CD1e on iNKT cell re sponse when the antigen is not constantly available, but is pulsed only for sh ort time. We chose GalCer as reference agonist. When GalCer was pulsed for short time, CD1e presence allowed a faster response detectable as early as 4 hr after pulsing by measuring IL-4 ( Figure 35A ) or GM-CSF release (data not shown). In the absenc e of CD1e the kinetic of the response was slower and at later time points the CD1e effect was reduced. These data suggest that, at early time poi nts after the antigen becomes available, CD1e may facilitate the formation of CD1 d:lipid complexes, thus allowing prompt iNKT cells activation. Next, antigen chasing experiments were performed. APC were pulsed with GalCer for 2 hr, then washed and chased at 37\u00b0 C for different times before fixation and addition of iNKT cells. APC expressing CD1e showed a faster reduction of iNKT cells stimulation, suggesting a f ast decay of the stimulatory CD1d: GalCer complexes ( Figure 35B ). These finding support the hypothesis that CD1e may orchestrate the formation of CD1d complexes, by facilitating the turnover of lip ids onto CD1d molecules. CD1e may facilitate loading of lipid antigens at early t ime points, while facilitating the unloading of CD1d:antigen complexes at later time p oints, thus participating in the fine tuning of the immunological response. 155 Figure 35. The presentation of GalCer is increased when the antigen is pulsed for short time. ( A) THP1 cells transfected incubated for different time with GalCer (10 ng/ml) and then fixed before the addition of the human V 24 iNKT clone VM-D5. ( B) CD1e facilitates cells transfected with hCD1 D hCD1E ( pulsed for 2 hr with GalCer (1 ng/ml) and chased for different periods of time before the addition of th e human iNKT clone VM-D5. Diagrams show the mean release of cytokines SD) (n=3). CD1e facilitates loading and unloading of -GalCer onto and from CD1d These findings suggested that CD1e might facilitate loading and unloading of antigens onto and from other CD1 family members, th us acting as a lipid transfer protein. To investigate whether CD1e facilitates lipid bindi ng to CD1d, Soluble was coated onto 96-well plates and GalCer was added in the presence or in the absence of recombinant CD1e (sCD1e) at pH 4.5 to mimic the acidic lysosomes where CD1d and CD1e co-loc alize. iNKT cells were 156 then added and their response was determined by mea suring GM-CSF release 18 hr later. Recombinant soluble saposins A, B, or C w ere used as controls due to their role in assisting CD1d loading [84, 341]. The addition of CD1e significantly enhanced the response of iNKT cells. Furthermore, C D1e was more efficient than saposins B and C in facilitating the formation of s timulatory complexes ( Figure 36A). Next we tested the possibility that CD1e may also u nload GalCer from CD1d. CD1e ( Figure 36B ). sCD1d was coated on the plastic and then loaded with GalCer. The excess of antigen was washed before the addition of sCD1e or of saposins A, B or C as control LTP. After 24 hr iNKT cells were added and their response was measured by cytokine release assay. CD1e significantly decreased the response of iNKT cells, indicating that it can also unload GalCer from sCD1d, while saposins were not effectiv e in this type of CD1d unloading experiments. Taken together these results show that CD1e behaves as a LTP and facilitates transfer of lipids to and from CD1d. 157 Figure 36 . CD1e facilitates loading and unloading of plate b ound CD1d with GalCer ( A). Plate bound CD1d was pulsed with 1 \u00b5g/ml of GalCer in the presence of different soluble recombinant lipid transfer proteins (SapA, B, C and BSA) or of soluble recombinant CD1e or with PBS only and then a human iNKT clone was ad ded to the plate. After 24 hr the release of hGM-CSF was measured by ELISA. ( B). Plate bound CD1d was pulsed overnight with 1 \u00b5g/ml of GalCer.

Generation and characterization of CD1e transgenic mice To investigate whether CD1e also participates in CD 1d-mediated antigen presentation in vivo , we generated transgenic mice expressing the human CD1e gene. The E-CD1e tg mouse model was established, in which the human CD1E cDNA was expressed under the H-2 E promoter directing the expression on APC including thymic epithelial cells [317]( Figure 37 ). Several lines of transgenic mice were obtained and in two of them the transgene was correctly expressed. 158 Figure 37. Schematic representation of the pDO1-5 hCD1E vecto r used for microinjection to generate E -CD1e transgenic mice. In E -CD1e transgenic mice, the expression of CD1e was f ound in B cells, peritoneal macrophages, BM-derived DC, at levels co mparable to what observed in human cells (data not shown), but not in T lymphocy tes ( Figure 38 ). Figure 38. CD1e is expressed by B cells, Macrophages and Bone Marrow-derived DC of E- CD1e transgenic mice but not by T cells. Splenocy tes from WT and E -CD1e tg mice were analyzed for expression of CD1e in B cells (B2 20 + cells) and T cells (CD3 +). Peritoneal macrophages were obtained by i.p. injection of tThioglycollate and Mac1 + cells were analyzed for CD1e expression. Bone marrows wer e differentiated for 8 days with mGM-CSF and CD11c + cells were analyzed for CD1e expression. 159 In human cells, CD1e is targeted to the lysosomes w here it is cleaved into an active soluble form. Therefore, we investigated whe ther in transgenic mouse cells CD1e protein is correctly processed. DC from WT or E -CD1e tg mice were metabolically labeled for 30 min utes with 35 S and chased for 2 or 4 hours. Membrane proteins we re immunoprecipitated with the 20.6 anti-CD1e mAb and the glycosylation of the immunoprecipitated proteins was examined by treatment with Endoglycosidase H or F. Both enzymes cleave between two N-acetylglucosamine residues linked to asparagines in oligomannose, but not complex oligosaccharides from glycoproteins . These enzymes are used to monitor post-translational modifications in the Gol gi apparatus. Between 2 and 4 hr after syntesis, CD1e molecules become Endo H resist ent, suggesting that cleavage occurs late in its biosynthesis. 4 hr afte r chasing, only a 28 kDa protein was immunoprecipitated, corresponds to the CD1e sol uble form. These findings confirm that also in mouse E -CD1e DC CD1e is processed in the soluble active form ( Figure 39 ). 160 Figure 39. CD1e in DC from transgenic mice is cleaved in endo somal compartments. DC were metabolically labeled with [ 35 S] methionine and cysteine for 30 min. Cells were lysed either directly or following chase at 37 \u00b0 C for 2 h in normal culture medium. CD1e was immunoprecipitated with the 20.6 mAb, deglycosylate d with EndoH (H) or EndoF (F) or left untreated(-), separated on denaturing electrophores is gels and analyzed by autofluorography. Letters of cleaved CD1e, m: membrane CD1e, s: localization of CD1e, DC from E -CD1e and non tg littermates were stained with the anti-CD1e mAb 20.6, with mAb specific for TGN-38, a marker Golgi, or for that CD1e partially co-localizes with TGN-38 ( Figure 40 upper panels) as well as with MHC-II associated compartments, ( Figure 40 lower panels), thus showing the same pattern of distribution as in human cells [17]. 161 Figure 40. CD1e protein in E -CD1e transgenic mice traffics to late endosomes an d becomes soluble. Confocal analysis of DC from E -CD1e transgenic mice confirms the colocalization of the protein with TGN associated p roteins (upper panels) and with MHC II in MHC II compartments (lower panels). Next, we investigated by flow cytometry whether tg CD1e expression influenced the development of iNKT cells, or of other cells of the hematopoietic compartment. iNKT cells were identified by staining with anti-TC R mAb and mouse CD1d: GalCer dimers. analysis in the ymus ( Figure 41A ), liver and spleen ( Figure 41B ) showed no significant difference in the total num bers (data not shown) and percentages between E -CD1e tg mice and non tg littermates. 162 Figure 41 E-CD1e tg mice show a normal phenotype. (A) Staining of complete (upper panel) or of CD24 + and CD8 + depleted (lower panel) thymi of WT and E -CD1e mice with mCD1d: GalCer dimer and TCR .

The cytograms in ( B) depict the gates defining iNKT and conventional T CR T cells, as in ( A). The V domain is known to influence the avidity of bindin g of iNKT cells to CD1d: GalCer complexes [188]. We analysed therefore the T CR V repertoire of iNKT cells (left panels) as well as of conventional T cells (right panel), focusing on the expression of the V 8.2 and V7 chains , which are the two major V chains pairing with the invariant TCR- chain of iNKT cells. In addition, since iNKT are either CD4 + or DN, we analysed the expression of the CD4 co-re ceptor on iNKT cells. We found that V usage as well as CD4 expression was unaltered in E - 163 CD1e tg mice as compared to non transgenic litterma tes, both in iNKT cells and in conventional T cells ( Figure 42 ). Figure 42 . iNKT cell population in E -CD1e mice expresses normal levels of CD4 and shows normal TCR-V repertoire.

Left panels show iNKT cells ( gated as CD1d: GalCer dimer + and TCR-C+); right show conventional cells (gated as CD1d: GalCer dimer - and TCR-C +). Numbers indicate percentage of positive cells in the indicated gates. 164 We next analysed numbers and percentages of conventional TCR cells, TCR cells as well as B cells and macrophages in thymus and spleen. Conventional TCR cell percentages were similar in WT and E -CD1e in thymus ( Figure 43 , upper panel) and spleen ( Figure 44 , upper panel), as well as thymic TCR (Figure 43 , lower panel). Splenic B cells, CD11b int and CD11b hi were also similar in percentage both in WT and tg mice ( Figure 44 , lower panel). Figure 43. Expression of CD4, CD8 and TCR- cells is normal in thymi from E -CD1e mice. Thymocytes from E -CD1e or WT mice were analyzed for expression of CD 4 and CD8 (upper panel) and TCR- (lower panels). Numbers represent the mean percent age of positive cells (\u00b1 s.d.) in the indicated gates. 165 Figure 44. Expression of CD4, CD8 , B220 and CD11b on mice is normal.

Num bers represent the mean percentage of positive cells (\u00b1 s.d.) in the i ndicated gates. CD1d levels on DP thymocytes ( Figure 45 , left panel) and on DC were also normal (Figure 45 , right panel) Figure 45. Histograms show the expression of CD1d on DP thymo cytes (left panel) and on BM-derived DC (right panel) of E -CD1e (black line) or WT mice (dotted gray line). 166 The genetic background does not have any influence on the expression of CD1e and iNKT cell generation, as demonstrated by the an alysis of F 1 mice derived from breeding the original E -CD1e tg mice (C57BL/6) to DBA/2 or BALB/c mice (Figure 46 ). E-CD1e transgenic mice have therefore a normal immun ological phenotype and represent a new animal model to study the role of C D1e in CD1d-restricted antigen presentation in vivo . Figure 46.

CD1e expressing DC were able to s timulate the human iNKT cells more efficiently then DC from non tg litterma tes ( Figure 47A ). Thymocytes from do not express CD1e, presented se lf lipids to the same extent as thymocytes ( Figure 47B ). Figure 47. by murine CD1e + APC. ( BM-derived After 24 hr, IL-4 (ng/ml \u00b1 SD) release was determined by ELISA. We then analyzed how tg CD1e influenced the present ation of exogenous lipids using a mouse iNKT hybridoma stimulated with GalCer by DC + APC presented GalCer with the same efficiency as wild type APC wh en the antigen was kept in the wells during the entire time of the experiment. Figure 48 . Exogenous lipids are normally presented when kep t in the well.

After 24 hr IL-2 release (ng/ml \u00b1 s.d.) was determined by ELISA. Instead, as previously observed with human APC, CD1 e facilitated the presentation of GalCer when the lipid was pulsed for short times an d then washed out ( Figure 49 ). Mouse iNKT hybridoma cells released more wh en DC were incubated 1-8 hr with GalCer before being washed, fixed and co-cultivated with T cells ( Figure 49 ). This effect might be the consequence of surface display by CD1e + DC of more stimulatory complexes than wild-type DC . These experiments 169 also showed that the CD1d- GalCer complexes appeared on the cell surface with the same kinetics in transgenic and wild-type DC, t hus suggesting that, in these experimental conditions, CD1e does not accelerate C D1d loading. Figure 49 . The presentation of GalCer is increased when the antigen is pulsed for short time.

In another series of experiments we investigated wh ether DC from Ea-CD1e tg mice were also capable presenting lipid antigens derived from heat-killed Spingomonas paucimobilis . When heat killed bacteria were added to the cell 170 cultures during the entire period of the experiment s, CD1e+ and wild-type DC showed identical presentation capacity ( Figure 50A ), confirming the data obtained with GalCer. However, when bacteria were added for a sho rt period and then washed before APC fixation, CD1e + DC were more stimulatory than wild-type DC (Figure 50B ). Also with this antigen the total release of IL-2 was higher without a change in the kinetics of surface appearance of CD1 d-GalCer complexes. Figure 50 . DC from E -CD1e tg mice induce a better response after stimul ation with hi S. paucimobilis.

After 24 hr IL-2 release (ng/ml \u00b1 s.d.) release was determined by ELISA. 171 In a next series of experiments, it was investigate d whether also in mouse DC CD1e participates in unloading CD1d from lipid anti gens as previously found with human APC. Mouse DC were pulsed with GalCer then washed and incubated at 37\u00b0 for different times before fixation and additio n of iNKT cells. These chase experiments showed that in CD1e + DC the half-life of the stimulatory complexes was shorter than in wild type DC. Indeed, in CD1e + DC iNKT cell response was reduced to 50% after 20 hr of chase, whereas in wil d type DC the same reduction was observed only after 32 hr (Figure 51) . Thise resulte confirm those obtained with CD1e-transfected human APC and support the hyp othesis that CD1e accelerates the exchange of CD1d bound lipids. Figure 51 . Half life of CD1d: GalCer complexes is reduced in BM derived DC from E - CD1e transgenic mice.

(n=3). 172 Since CD1e participates in the generation of CD1d:a GalCer complexes, we next compared the expression levels of antigenic complex es on the surface of DC from WT and E -CD1e mice using flow-cytometry. We took advantage of the L363 mAb, which specifically recognizes mouse CD1d molecules loaded with GalCer [343]. DC from WT and E -CD1e mice were incubated for 24 hr with GalCer and then analyzed by flow cytometry with the L363 mAb ( Figure 52A + staining than WT DC, which is indic ative of lower levels of CD1d: GalCer complexes expressed on the plasma membrane ( Figure 52A, B ). Similar lower staining was observed when the antige n was incubated for 96 h, indicating a constant lower expression of loaded co mplexes in CD1e-tg DC than in wild type DC. A titration of GalCer showed less staining in CD1e-tg DC at all tested doses ( Figure 52C ), confirming that CD1e reduces surface appearance of CD1d-GalCer complexes as detected by the L363 mAb. Taken together these findings show an important role of CD1e in limiting the number of complexes detected by the L363 mAb. 173 Figure 52 . CD1e facilitates unloading comple xes.

DISCUSSION Among the CD1 family, CD1e is the only soluble prot ein, thus supporting a chaperone-like rather than an antigen-presenting fu nction. Furthermore, CD1e is never present at the cell surface and therefore can not engage the TCR. The cellular localization [17] and the intracellular tr afficking [38] of CD1e have been extensively studied. The immunological function of CD1e reported until now is to assist processing of complex glycolipid antigens pr esented by other CD1 molecules [16]. Our findings indicate that CD1e may also exert other important functions in presentation of lipid antigens. 174 The model of the CD1e structure [16] predicts impor tant differences with other CD1 molecules. Other CD1 molecules have at least 2 hydr ophobic pockets, whereas CD1e appears to contain only one large pocket posit ioned between the 1- and 2-helices and above the six -strands. The calculated size of the CD1e binding groove is smaller than that of CD1b. The C'-F' chan nels of CD1e combine to form a large hydrophobic binding pocket, which might all ow the accommodation of a large variety of lipid compounds differing in lipid tail length, unsaturation and likely also in lateral substituted groups. Another importa nt difference is found in the global distribution of charged amino acids in the 1 helix, in the region that corresponds to the TCR-recognition face. Charged am ino acids, which are critical for the induction of T cell response, are almost ab sent in the 1 helix of CD1e, whereas they are always present in other antigen-pr esenting molecules. This important difference supports the conclusion that C D1e is not involved in direct interaction with the TCR. CD1e is cleaved in a soluble active form in lysosom es and co-localizes with LE and MIIC compartments. This localization suggests that CD1e is present in the same compartments as CD1b, CD1c and CD1d and thus might participate in the presentation of lipid antigens by these CD1 molecul es. Probably CD1e does not influence lipid antigen presentation by CD1a that r ecycles in early endosomes. To study the possible interaction of CD1e with the other CD1 family members, we initially studied whether CD1e could influence CD1b - and CD1c-restricted antigen presentation. We took advantage of our collection o f CD1b- and CD1c-restricted T cell clones, which recognize either self or microbi al lipid antigens. CD1e presence in APC influences the response to both endogenous a nd exogenous lipid antigens in several ways. CD1e can increase, decrease or lea ve unchanged the response to lipid antigens, presented by either CD1b or CD1c. 175 The different influence that CD1e has on presentati on of tested lipid antigens is independent from the presenting CD1 molecule. Proba bly it depends on whether lipids traffic to the same compartments where also CD1e is present and also whether they bind to CD1e. CD1e might influence pre sentation of exogenous and endogenous with several not mutually exclusi ve mechanisms: i) CD1e may increase the solubility of lipid antigens, by extra cting them from membranes or micelles thus making them more available for presen tation; ii) CD1e may participate in processing of lipids, thus facilitat ing the generation of smaller molecules with CD1-binding capacity and T cell stim ulatory activity. With the same mechanisms CD1e may accelerate the degradation of s timulatory lipid antigens; iii) CD1e may facilitate loading of bound lipid antigens on other CD1 molecules with a chaperone function, and iv) it may facilitate unloa ding of non-stimulatory lipids from other CD1 molecules, thus accelerating lipid exchan ge. The response to exogenously added GM1 is decreased in the presence of CD1e. GM1 could have higher affinity for CD1e than for CD 1b and thus it could become sequestered by CD1e and less available for presenta tion to T cells. In the case of PIM 6, CD1e is required to process this large antigen in to the smaller PIM 2 by the lysosomal -mannosidase. In a similar manner CD1e might facili tate processing of GM1 by lysosomal -Galactosidase, with the consequence of rendering i t not immunogenic [78]. When we tested the effects of CD1e on the presentat ion of another self- glycosphingolipid such as sulfatide, we found that CD1e facilitates sulfatide presentation by both CD1b and CD1c. Sulfatide is a component of all cellular membranes and is composed by a galactose, modified in position 3 by a sulfate, connected with a -glycosidic bond to ceramide. CD1e could increase t he solubility of sulfatide, facilitate its extraction from membra nes or assist its loading onto CD1b or CD1c. 176 We also found that in certain instances the presenc e of CD1e is irrelevant for T cell stimulation. This is the case of SGL12 presentation . This compound is a semi- synthetic analog of di-acylated-sulfoglycolipid (Ac 2SGL), a lipid antigen produced by virulent M. tuberculosis composed of a 2'-O-sulfate- -D-trehalose core acylated at position 2 by a palmitic (or stearic) acid and a t position 3 by a hydroxyphtioceranoic acid. The semi-synthetic SGL12 is acylated at position 2 by a palmitic acid, and at position 3 by a C26 carbon-lo ng fatty acid containing 4 branched methyl groups. Since CD1e does not affect the presentation of SGL12 at low as well as high doses, it is likely that it doe s not bind SGL12. Another important effect of CD1e is on the type of cytokines secreted by lipid- specific T cells. Upon stimulation T cells release different cytokines according to the strength of the antigenic stimulus [340]. GM-CS F secretion is already detected when the TCR signal is weak, while IFN- and IL-4 production occur only upon stronger TCR signaling. To study in vitro the possible interaction between CD1e and CD1d, we investigated the response of many autoreactive type 1 and type 2 CD1d-restricted NKT cell clones. Type 1 NKT cells (also defined iNKT according to th e expression of the invariant TCR chain) react to a series of lipids including GalCer, glycosphingolipids and glycodiacylglycerols of microbial origin and to unk nown self lipids, whereas type 2 NKT cells recognize diverse antigens that remain un known [138, 308-310, 313]. In the presence of CD1e all tested autoreactive typ e 1 iNKT cells showed increased reactivity to endogenous lipid antigens. On the contrary, type 2 NKT cells were differently influenced. CD1e presence wa s irrelevant for some type 2 NKT cells, it increased the autoreactivity of other clones and was detrimental for the response of a small number of clones. The natur ally produced endogenous lipid antigens stimulating iNKT and type 2 NKT cell s remain unknown and therefore 177 it is not possible to clearly ascribe these differe nt effects to the recognition of different lipid antigens by type 1 and type 2 NKT c ells. It is tempted to speculate that the tested iNKT cell clones, which are all pos itively influenced by the presence of CD1e, recognize endogenous lipids sharing common characteristics and which allow CD1e binding and transfer to CD1d. On the con trary, type 2 NKT cells recognize different types of lipids whose presentat ion is influenced by CD1e according to their nature, cellular localization an d capacity to interact with CD1e. An unexpected finding was that CD1e also influences the response to exogenous antigens by directly affecting individual cytokine release. We observed a hierarchy in the secretion of cytokines, being GM-CSF secreti on not influenced by CD1e, while secretion of IL-4 was poorly affected and tha t of IFN- was greatly diminished. Probably CD1e, by participating in the turnover of lipids binding to CD1d, decreases the number of antigenic complexes r emaining on the cell surface and thus it influences more effectively the release of cytokines requiring a higher threshold of TCR signalling. These findings suggest that CD1e has a direct effect on the quality of the response of iNKT cells. This effect may have important influences on the immunoregulatory role of these ce lls in vivo . CD1e also increased the stimulatory capacity of APC pulsed for short time and then fixed, thus implying that it facilitates the f ormation of more stimulatory complexes when the time of CD1d loading is limiting . Four hours were sufficient to generate stimulatory complexes with -GalCer on the surface of fixed APC. A careful analysis of the kinetics of the response sh owed that CD1e does not accelerate the formation of the complexes. Instead, it induces a stronger T cell response, probably ascribed to an increased number of antigen-loaded complexes. Alternatively, the total number of complexes is not affected and those that are 178 formed are more stimulatory. Recently, it has been described that complexes formed by CD1d and -GalCer within lysosomes are more efficient in indu cing IFN- release, whereas those formed on the cell surface induce less IFN- without reducing the amounts of IL-4 [344]. Since CD1e is p resent only intracellularly, it is likely that it only influences complexes formed wit hin lysosomes. An additional function that can be ascribed to CD1e is its capacity to unload CD1d molecules. This effect is more pronounced when the antigen is limiting and leads to a faster disappearance of the T cell-stimulatory ca pacity. In other words, CD1e facilitates the formation of more active complexes as soon as the antigen becomes available and, at later time points, also participa tes in the fast decay of APC stimulatory capacity. These temporal effects result in early activation of iNKT cells, but also in a \"switch off\" of the response at later times. Thus, CD1e may also contribute to a temporal focusing of the response, thus avoiding a possible detrimental prolonged activation of iNKT cells. The chaperone function of CD1e seems different from that of other LTPs that influence loading of lipid antigens on CD1 molecule s. Several LTPs, including NPC-2 91, 208], directly rticipate loading of CD1d molecules inside late endosomes and lysosomes. Our data show that CD1e can also directly participate in loading of lipids onto CD1d. Indeed, CD1e is more efficient than Saposins B and C to assist loading o f -GalCer onto CD1d in vitro . Moreover, CD1e facilitates unloading of -GalCer from CD1d, while saposins are inefficient in performing this task [86]. Whether t he unique structure of CD1e is important and how it influences lipid exchange from other CD1 molecules remains poorly defined. Site-directed mutagenesis studies m ay contribute to clarify this issue. 179 In conclusion, CD1e may assist loading and unloadin g of lipids, thus increasing the turnover of CD1d:lipid complexes. How this influenc es the in vivo response was a matter of initial studies performed in CD1e transge nic mice. We generated transgenic mice expressing CD1e in APC , thus mimicking the expression in human cells. The construct was made w ith the MHC Ea promoter driving the expression of CD1e cDNA. In these trans genic animals the total numbers of thymic and peripheral leukocytes were no rmal, as well as the size and apparent structure of lymphoid organs. Thus, the he matopoietic compartment was normal excluding the possibility that the transgene insertion site and expression might have influenced normal immune system developm ent. The expression of the protein was investigated using CD1e-specific mAbs t hat showed proper intracellular localization. Western blot analysis a lso showed that CD1e matures in the Golgi compartment and when it reaches lysosomes is cleaved into a smaller molecule. These post-translational modifications cl osely resemble those in human cells, thus showing the presence of a protein with the physiological characteristics of CD1e present in human cells. When iNKT cells were investigated, their numbers in the thymus and periphery were normal. In addition, their differentiation sta ges in the thymus and phenotype were normal. iNKT cells from Ea-CD1e mice also show ed normal response to relevant glycolipid antigens. Thus, expression of C D1e in antigen-presenting cells in vivo does not induce major detectable alterations in iN KT cells. In a series of experiments we investigated the func tions of CDe expressed in mouse APC. We first investigated the capacity of CD 1e to assist CD1d-mediated antigen presentation. In fully accordance with the human system, CD1e expressed in mouse DC facilitated presentation of endogenous lipids to autoreactive iNKT cells and assisted the generation of stimulatory co mplexes during early phases of 180 antigen encounter. Moreover, also in mouse DC, CD1e participated in unloading of CD1d:aGalCer complexes, as demonstrated by chasing experiments. CD1e facilitated stimulation of iNKT cells by Sphingomonas antigens, particularly when bacteria were pulsed only for short periods of time . This finding might be of relevance during bacterial infections since by faci litating formation of stimulatory complexes, CD1e might participate in ready activati on of cells. pleiotropic immunological functions of CD1e sug gest a co-ordinated evolution of different molecules involved in presentation of lipid antigens. The presence of an intracellular chaperone resembling other CD1 molecu les, might be instrumental to select, among a variety of lipids with different st ructures, those with the capacity to fit the CD1 binding grooves and thus with the highe st probability to be immunogenic. This property may focus the immune res ponse on defined classes of lipids by facilitating their processing, their load ing and unloading and by generating complexes with higher stimulatory capacity. CD1e th us may be considered an intracellular controller of lipid antigen presentat ion with increased importance whenever antigen availability is limiting. When presentation of lipid antigens is compared to that of protein antigens, it appears that the immune system has exploited the ch aperone/assisting function of intracellular molecules in both types of antigen re sponse. Indeed, in the case of peptide antigens HLA-DM, an intracellular molecule that does not reach the plasma membrane, participates in optimization of presentat ion. HLA-DM closely resembles the structure of other MHC class II molecules, whic h form peptide complexes recognized by T cells. It is also localized in the MIIC compartments where peptide antigens are loaded on MHC class II molecules, and forms transient complexes with loading MHC class II molecules. The main funct ions attributed to HLA-DM are the facilitation of binding and release of peptides . Importantly, while the on rate of binding is accelerated with all peptides tested, th e release of bound peptides is 181 different according to the affinity of interaction between the peptide and MHC class II, i.e. weak peptides are readily released, whereas the re lease of strong peptide binders is not affected. This discriminatory effect confers HLA-DM an editing function, which focuses the immune response on anti gens forming more stable stimulatory complexes with MHC class II molecules. CD1 e also facilitates loading and unloading of lip id antigens on other CD1 molecules. It is also colocalized within the same c ompartments where other CD1 molecules form stimulatory complexes with lipids an d it also never reaches the plasma membrane. It is unclear whether CD1e mostly affects the turnover of CD1 weakly binding antigens and thus promotes persisten ce of stable complexes within APC. This is difficult to investigate due to the in trinsic difficulties to evaluate the binding affinity of lipid that are water insoluble. Novel biophysical methods should be developed in order to investigate this important issue. In conclusion, CD1e optimizes lipid-specific T cell responses by participating in lipid antigen editing and by influencing presentati on by CD1b, CD1c and CD1d molecules in multiple ways. CD1e also facilitates t he response of iNKT cells to endogenous lipid antigens possibly by facilitating their loading onto CD1d and/or by promoting generation of more stimulatory CD1d-lipid complexes. All these pleiotropic functions of CD1e optimize presentation of lipid antigens and thus the lipid specific T cell response. 182 183 CHAPTER 3 Sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP-2) is required for the maturation of iNKT cells and their stimulation by endogenous lipids 184 185 SUMMARY Studies in genetically manipulated mice have demons trated the importance of several enzymatic machineries in generating antigen ic lipids and of LTP in their incorporation in CD1d-glycolipid complexes. All the LTP influencing lipid antigenicity and iNKT cell numbers that have been investigated so far are localised within the same c ompartments as the lipid-binding side of CD1 molecules. This topological concordance is the obvious necessity if a LTP has to transfer lipids to CD1. The role of LTP residing in the cytoplasm on presentation of lipid antigens has never been inves tigated. Furthermore, whether cytoplasmic LTP are involved in generation and intr acellular trafficking of self-lipid antigens remains unknown. In this study we have investigated SCP-2 which is a LTP with broad substrate specificity mainly present in the cytosol in pe roxisomes [124]. Scpx/proScp2 knockout ( mice generated which completely lack Scpx/proScp2 gene products [131]. These mice develop normally bu t have several marked alterations in lipid metabolism. Here we show that Scp2 -/- mice have a reduction of iNKT cells. While the resi dual iNKT population is functionally normal as well as C D1d-restricted lipid presentation of exogenous lipids by CD1d, the stimulation of aut oreactive T cells by endogenous lipid antigens is altered. Scp2 -/- mice show a different lipid repertoire in the thymus to wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, thy mic iNKT selection in Scp2 -/- mice is inefficient and results in a relative accum ulation of immature iNKT cells. 186 187 RESULTS SCP-2 influences iNKT cell numbers Deletion of the protein SCP-2 results in a significantly reduced number of iNKT cells ( Figure 53 ). When compared to WT, Scp2 -/- mice at 4-6 weeks of age showed a reduced percentage of iNKT cells in thymus (~50%) as well as in liver and spleen (both ~40%) ( Figure 54A ). Figure 53. iNKT cells Scp2 -/- mice. Flow cytometry thymocytes, perc entages \u00b1 s.d. of cells in the gated areas. 188 The absolute number of iNKT cells was also signific antly reduced in the thymus and the liver, in which normal cellularity was obse rved. On the contrary, in the spleen the total numbers of iNKT cells were compara ble to that of WT animals because young animals (3-5 weeks old) show a slight increase in organ size and total cellularity ( Figure 54B ). The splenomegaly disappears in older animals, wh ich show a reduction of iNKT cells also in the spleen. Figure 54. iNKT cells are reduced in Scp2 -/- mice.

The alterations seem to exclusively affect iNKT cel ls, because the phenotype, percentages, and total numbers of conventional T ce lls were normal in the thymus and liver ( Figure 55A and B ). In the spleen, while percentages were normal, total numbers were increased and this increase was signif icant for both CD4 and CD8 populations ( Figure 55D ). B cells and monocytes in liver and spleen were n ormal (Figure 55C and E ). 189 Figure 55. Phenotype, percentages and absolute numbers of con ventional T and B cell populations in Scp2 -/- mice.

The intensity of staining of iNKT cells with CD1d: GalCer dimers was similar in WT and Scp2 -/- mice, possibly excluding different capacity of the remaining iNKT cells to interact with this CD1 complex [327]. The expressio n of CD4 was reduced in iNKT cells in thymus and spleen of Scp2 -/- mice and was associated with a relative increase of CD4 -CD8 - DN iNKT cells as compared ( Figure 56B ). Figure 56.

By using a combina tion of mAb specific for CD44, a marker of antigen-experienced T cells, for the ho ming receptor CD62L, CD4, NK1.1, and for the activation marker CD69, most of iNKT cells in liver and spleen showed markers of effector cells (CD44 hi CD62L - CD69 +), both -/- and WT mice ( Figure 57 ).

APC -/- DP thymocytes, which mediate positive select ion of iNKT cells, and bone-marrow derived DC showed normal CD1d plasma me mbrane levels ( Figure 61), thus excluding that reduced CD1d level may accou nt for iNKT cells reduction in Scp2 -/- mice. 195 Figure 61.

Black line histograms correspond to s taining with irrelevant isotype-matched mAb. Data are representative of 2 independent exper iments. The decreased number of iNKT cells observed in Scp2 -/- mice could be ascribed to a defect in the presentation capacity of APC, as fo und in APC of mice lacking other lipid-binding proteins like saposins We t herefore tested whether Scp2 -/-- have a defect in the presentation of exogenous antigens. Mouse iNKT hybridomas were efficiently and equally stimulated by thymocytes (left panel) or DC (right panel) from either Scp2 -/- or WT mice ( Figure 62B ), thus excluding a defect in antigen presentation capacity of Scp2 -/--APC. 196 Figure 62.

DC from Scp2 -/- and WT mice induced similar upregulation of CD69 ( Figure 63 ) on responding iNKT cells, demonstrating that all the series of events which begin with infection and lead to the generation of CD1d- lipid stimulatory complexes are normal in Scp2 -/- mice. Importantly, cells incubated with DC without bacteria also upregulated CD69 and the extent of this upregulation by Scp2 -/--DC was smaller than the one induced by WT-DC. These findings suggest that Scp2 -/--APC might be defective in presentation of endogenou s lipid antigens. Figure 63. Exogenous lipid antigen presentation capacity in Scp2 -/- mice is normal. Upregulation of CD69 on spleen cells (gated on anti-TCR + and CD1d: GalCer dimer +) from WT mice after stimulation with Scp2 -/--DC (red lines) or WT-DC (blue lines) infected or not with S. paucimobilis (1:1).

Data illu strated are representative of one out of 4 independent experiments. 198 Presentation of endogenous lipids by Scp2 -/- mice is altered The presentation of endogenous lipid antigens was t ested by using mouse autoreactive hybridoma cells and Scp2 -/- or mice as APC. FF13 cells released less IL-2 after stimulation wit h Scp2 -/--DC ( Figure 64) as compared to WT APC. When the number of APC per well was increased, a plateau was reached with both APC, but a large difference r emained in the total cytokine release, indicating a qualitative and not a quantit ative alteration of the self-lipid- CD1d stimulatory complexes. As expected, APC from C D1d mice were unable to stimulate the iNKT hybridoma ( Figure 64 triangle symbol ). Figure 64. Endogenous lipid antigen presentation capacity in Scp2 -/- mice is altered. Various amounts of DC (A) thymocytes (B) stimulate the mouse iNKT hybridom a FF13 in the absence of any exogenously added lipid antigen. Results are expres sed as mean release of IL-2 \u00b1 s.d. 199 The response of the iNKT hybridoma cells to DC was blocked by addition of anti- CD1d mAb ( Figure 65 ), confirming the CD1d restriction of autoreactive cells.

Re sults are expressed as mean release of IL-2 \u00b1 s.d. of duplicates, and are representativ e of 2 independent experiments. Taken together, these findings suggest that the red uced numbers of iNKT cells in Scp2 -/- mice are not the consequence of impaired CD1d expr ession or of altered generalised lipid antigen presentation. The finding that Scp2 -/--APC are less efficient in activating peripheral NKT cells with e ndogenous ligands suggests that these APC might have alterations in the synthesis a nd/or presentation of self-lipid antigens. 200 Scp2 -/- mice have an altered repertoire of self-lipids Since Scp2 is a lipid transfer protein with importa nt functions in lipid metabolism, we made the hypothesis that Scp2 -/- mice have an altered lipid repertoire that might result in inadequate stimulation and maturation of iNKT cells. Particular attention was put on isolation of thymocytes in order to mini mise their contamination with other cell populations possibly not involved in thy mic selection of iNKT cells. Lipids were extracted from spectrometry (ESI-MS) operated in multiple reactions monitoring mode. A total of 167 different lipid spe cies spanning 13 different lipid families were quantified ( Figure 66 ). Except for 6 lipid species that were enriched >140% and 11 lipid species that were diminished <60 % in Scp2 -/- mice as compared to WT mice ( Figure 66A ), most of the lipid species measured did not vary significantly. Overall, Scp2 -/- thymic extracts exhibited decreased amounts of glu were increased ( Figure 66B ). When individual lipid species were compared, almost all GlcCer and pPE we re diminished in Scp2 -/- thymocytes ( Figure 66C ). No preferential reduction was observed in GlcCer species regarding their incorporation of dehydrosph ingosine (d18:0) or sphingosine (d18:1) base and fatty acids. When the relative abu ndance of the individual GlcCer species was analysed again no difference was detect ed (data not shown), suggesting that in Scp2 -/- mice GlcCer are diminished independently from the availability of individual bases and fatty acids. L ikewise, most of the pPE species measured were diminished, probably as a consequence of defective SCP-2 function in lipid transport and export from peroxis omes, where the ether bonds of plasmalogen precursors are generated. pPE also show ed a relative increase of 201 lipid species containing long and unsaturated fatty acids ( Figure 66D ), fatty acid -oxidation in peroxisomes. PE species, which are not synthesised within peroxisomes, were only sligh tly decreased as compared to PE in WT thymocytes and their fatty acid compositio n was normal ( Figure 66D ), thus excluding a general defect in fatty acid usage . PC was the only increased lipid family. Most of the PC species were increased (Figure 66C ), while their relative abundance remained constant (data not shown), suggesting that in Scp2 -/- thymocytes a compensatory mechanism is operating t hat contributes to PC accumulation independently of use d fatty acids. Taken together these findings show that lack of SCP-2 induces a su btle yet preferential alteration of only a few lipid species, some of which require intact peroxisomal transport. 202 Figure 66.

Two ty pes of partial blocks in iNKT cell maturation were detected. The first one was ch aracterized by the accumulation of cells at Stage 0 (defined as CD24 +, CD1d: GalCer dimer +, CD44 - The difference between Scp2 -/- and WT mice is highlighted by the significant increase in the ratio of CD24 +:CD24 - cells observed in Scp2 -/- thymic 67B ). The phenotype of iNKT cells accumulating at Stage further by analysing co-expression of CD8, CD62L, CD44 and CD6 9 using 7 colour flow cytometric analysis. Within Stage 0 two populations were detected, indicated as M1 and M2. M1 iNKT cells express markers of more i mmature , ). M1 cells also express less CD69 than M2 cells, t hus indicating that they represent cells not yet positively selected. In Scp2 -/- mice M1 cells expressed higher levels of CD44 and M2 cells expressed lower levels of CD69 than in WT mice ( Figure 67C ). In addition, total Scp2 -/- M2 cells were less abundant than WT M2 cells ( Figure 67F ), suggesting a reduced capacity of Scp2 -/- iNKT cells to progress into more mature stages. The second thymic block was at Stage 2 (TCR C +, CD1d: GalCer dimer iNKT thymocytes at stage 1 and 2 were increased in percentage and were not significantly different in total numbers from WT cells. On the contrary, Stage 3 cells (TCR C +, CD1d: GalCer dimer +, CD24 -, CD44 +, 204 NK1.1 +) were decreased either in percentage or in total number as compared to WT cells ( Figure 67C, D and F). Importantly, in Scp2 -/- mice a marked reduction of the total number and percentage of cells expressing CD69 was also observed (Figure 67C, E, G ). Finally, the expression levels of CD49b (DX5), a nother marker defining more mature ones ( Figure 69 ).

Black histogram represents staining wi th isotype-matched irrelevant mAb. 207 We then investigated the expression of CD132 (commo n chain) and CD122 (IL- 2R and IL-15R chain) because the transition from Stage 2 to Stag e 3 is strictly IL-15 dependent [184]. Both receptors were expresse d at the same levels in iNKT thymocytes from the two mice ( Figure 70 ), excluding that a defect in these receptors leads to reduction of thymic iNKT cells. . Figure 70. Scp2 -/- iNKT from Scp2 -/- were CD1d: GalCer dimer- MACS-enriched and stained with anti-CD123 (left pan el) or anti-CD122 mAb (right panel). Histograms represent expression levels of Stage 2-g ated cells. To distinguish among increased cell death and reduc ed proliferation of Scp2 -/- thymocytes, both apoptotic cells enumeration and ce ll cycle analyses were performed. Apoptotic iNKT cells were not increased in Stages 0, 1 and 2 in Scp2 -/- as compared to WT mice, but rather decreased ( Figure 71 ). Instead, a slight increase of apoptotic cells was observed in Stage 3 . 208 Figure 71. Scp2 -/- iNKT thymocytes don't show CD1d: GalCer with and 7-AAD. Numbers represent the median of percenta ges of cells in the quadrants. 209 Cell cycle analyses revealed that Scp2 -/- iNKT cells in S phase were largely decreased in Stage 3, moderately decreased in Stage s 1-2 and slightly decreased in Stage 0 ( Figure 72 ). Figure 72. Scp2 -/- NKT thymocytes have reduced capacity to proliferat analysis of thymic iNKT from Scp2 -/- and WT CD1d: dimer-MACS-enrichment of cells, incorporatio n and 7-AAD were detected by intracellular flow cytometry. Numb ers represent the median of percentages of cells in the gated areas. 210 Collectively, these data show that the absence of S CP-2 causes a reduction of iNKT thymocyte numbers associated with delayed matu ration, low CD69 expression, reduced proliferation and altered cell death. The balance between these events results in a block of immature iNKT ce lls in Stage 0, and diminished capacity to expand and mature to Stage 3. Thus, SCP -2 deficiency prevents iNKT cells to remain activated and expand before exiting the thymus. DISCUSSION Lipid metabolism involves a complex network of enzy mes and transfer proteins, which are interconnected in different organelles an d membranes inside the cell. Synthesis and degradation of lipids take place in d efined subcellular compartments as a consequence of the physiological association o f enzymes with specific cellular membranes and the topological characteristics of in dividual lipids. The different localisation of synthetic and catabol ic enzymes has an important impact on lipid-specific immune response, since it influences the presence of lipid antigens in cellular compartments wherein CD1 molec ules traffic and become loaded. Some lipids require transport by LTP, which distrib ute lipid aqueous phases among [345]. LTP may tran sport precursors of complex lipids and thus optimise their synthesis, o r may extract lipids from membranes and offer them to catabolic enzymes. Here we find that the LTP SCP-2 may regulate the th ymic development and peripheral numbers of iNKT cells. SCP-2 is associat ed with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER, mitochondria and peroxisomes, and has be en ascribed the important 211 function of distributing lipids among these membran es [124]. Due to its cellular distribution, SCP-2 does not co-localise with the a ntigen-binding domains of CD1 molecules, and therefore cannot participate in CD1 antigen loading. Since SCP-2 contains a peroxisomal targeting motif, it is also imported into peroxisomes [126]. Moreover, it was detected in the nucleus where it m ay act as a transcription factor [128]. Important consequences of the SCP-2 deficien cy are reduced peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids, leading to accumulat ion of branched- and very long chain fatty acids, and alterations in membrane lipi d composition and lipid biliary secretion [346]. The alterations involved in the generation of norma l peripheral iNKT cell repertoire can be classified into five classes: i) alterations of transcription factors essential for iNKT cell development and maturation [239-241, 347- 349], ii) alterations of proteins involved in iNKT TCR signal transduction [ 242, 244, 350, 351], or iii) in interactions between developing iNKT thymocytes and selecting cells [307, 352, 353], iv) modifications of the lysosomal environmen t affecting correct lipid trafficking, disposal and loading on CD1d [76, 84, 91, 96, 208, 342], and v) alterations of the ER-located LTP MTP, which may af fect CD1d assembly and recycling [49, 80, 91]. The alterations induced by SCP-2 deficiency demonst rate a novel type of mechanism affecting normal development and expansio n of iNKT cells. In Scp2 -/- mice, iNKT cells are reduced both in percentage and in absolute numbers, whereas other cell populations including convention al T cells, B cells and monocytes are normal. The residual iNKT cells show normal numbers of V 8.2- and V 7-expressing cells, indicating no major alterations in the V repertoire. iNKT cells also show normal representation of memory/act ivated markers, reflecting normal peripheral stimulation. A reduction of CD4 + iNKT cells is instead observed in the thymus, spleen and liver, resembling a defec t previously described in iNKT 212 cells from NPC2-/- mice (Chapter 1 of this thesis, Figure 21 ). The role of CD4 co- receptor in iNKT thymic selection has not been repo rted, although a direct interaction between human CD1d and CD4 may occur [1 81, 183]. It remains unknown why these two LTP-deficient mice share this unique characteristic. In MHC-restricted T cells, strong and persisting selec tive signals during thymic development facilitate CD4 expression [354, 355]. I t is tempting to speculate that both Scp2 -/- and NPC2-/- mice are unable to generate CD1d-lipid complexes inducing prolonged signalling in maturing iNKT cell s and therefore, inefficiently maintain the CD4 co-receptor expression. In Scp2 -/- mice, the NK1.1 marker differently from CD4, is ex pressed by a large number of peripheral iNKT cells. This observation i s difficult to explain, since NK1.1 upregulation is considered as the final maturation step of iNKT cells [231, 232, 234]. Therefore, the residual iNKT cells belong to a fully mature CD4 - population. Despite alterations in the number and phenotype, re sidual iNKT cells appear functionally normal. They react to common iNKT cell stimulatory antigens including produce IFN- and IL-2 upon stimulation, thus revealing no rmal effector functions. The deficiency of several LTP located in lysosomes leads to important alterations in lipid antigen presentation, and consequently to reduced numbers of thymic and peripheral iNKT cells. Since SCP-2 is a LTP, which is clearly absent from lysosomes, we carefully investigated the antigen-pr esentation capacity of Scp-2-/-- Thymocytes GalCer, iGb3 and S. with the same efficiency as WT-APC. In terestingly, we noticed that they have instead a reduced capacity t o present endogenous lipids to autoreactive iNKT cells. This was confirmed by weak upregulation of CD69 on freshly isolated iNKT cells and reduced IL-2 releas e by autoreactive iNKT hybridoma cells. The known functions of SCP-2, toge ther with our observation that the stimulation with endogenous lipids is reduced, suggested that the lipid composition of Scp2-/--APC is modified. Comparative lipidomic analysis rev ealed quantitative and subtle qualitative differences bet ween Scp2-/-- and WT- thymocytes. Several phospholipids such as pPE, PE, PS and PA were diminished while PC levels were increased in Scp2 -/- cells ( Figure 66B ). PE, PS, PA and PC did not show any relative change in the used fatty acids, thus excluding general acylation defects. A relative increased use of long chain fatty acids was instead found in PE plasmalogens ( Figure 66D ). Two non-alternative mechanisms might explain these pPE changes, namely a reduced fatty a cid -oxidation within peroxisomes and a reduced availability of plasmanyl s, which are also generated within these organelles [356] and are the precursor s of plasmalogens. Since SCP- 2 contributes to trafficking of peroxisomal lipids, its deficiency might affect the repertoire of lipids generated within this organell e. A second finding was that the total amount of GlcCe r was diminished whereas its precursor Cer was unchanged. Therefore, GlcCer redu ction might be ascribed to inefficient synthesis, reduced transport of Cer to Golgi where GlcCer is synthesised, or to an increased utilisation of GlcC er as substrate for the synthesis of more complex glycosphingolipids. Further studies will clarify which mechanisms induce GlcCer reduction and whether SCP-2 is involv ed in the transport of Cer used for GlcCer synthesis. The observed alterations of the lipid repertoire in the thymus might have direct immunological relevance and affect the selection st eps of iNKT thymocytes. The nature of iNKT selecting ligands remains unclear an d several lipid classes probably participate in these events. In Scp2 -/- mice the reduction of iNKT cells in the thymus is associated with two maturation blocks. The first block occurs at Stage 0, which identifies iNKT cells 214 during and immediately after positive selection. We characterised two subpopulations within Stage 0 cells, which are also present in WT mice, and we defined them as M1 and M2. M1 cells are more immatu re than M2 cells according to the expression of CD24, CD44, CD62L, CD8 and CD6 9 markers. Whether M1 cells are the immediate precursors of M2 cells or i nstead the two populations represent independent maturation stages remains to be investigated. In Scp2 -/- mice, the total number and phenotype of M1 cells ar e normal, whereas M2 cells are diminished. In addition, M2 cells also show a s ignificant reduction of the CD69 activation marker, thus suggesting a reduced stimul ation by endogenous ligands. The second block occurs at Stage 2. Scp2 -/- thymocytes present an accumulation of Stage 1 and 2 cells and a significant reduction of the total number of Stage 3 cells. Stage 3 cells also show slightly increased a poptosis and decreased cycling capacity. Reduced expression of CD69 and CD49b (DX5 ) was observed in Stage 2 and 3 iNKT cells, possibly consequence of weak stim ulation. All together these phenomena may concur in poor expansion of iNKT thym ocytes leading to the observed reduced NKT cell numbers in the thymus and in the periphery. The two stages where iNKT thymocytes are blocked in Scp2 -/- mice have been associated with antigen stimulation necessary for c ontinuous activation of iNKT thymocytes preceding their final maturation and exi t to the periphery [230]. SCP-2 might affect these selection events with different mechanisms. It might be involved in the synthesis of selecting ligands. This possibi lity is difficult to investigate because the nature of the self-antigens inducing po sitive selection and thymic expansion is not known. A second mechanism is alter ation of lipid traffic within Scp2-/- cells, such as altered lipid import into peroxisom es and mitochondria, export from peroxisomes, or reduced traffic of Cer to Golg i. This latter mechanism would be relevant if SCP-2-transported Cer is converted t o GlcCer and to more complex glycosphingolipids, which have been indicated as po ssible selecting ligands [76, 215 357]. However, so far SCP-2 has not been identified as a Cer transporter and has not been found associated with Golgi membranes [124 , 358], where GlcCer is synthesised. In these studies have revealed that SCP -2, a cytoplasmic and peroxisomal LTP, is involved in the regulation of i NKT cell maturation and expansion. This adds a novel level of regulation th at involves lipid transport within cytoplasm and organelles, generation of complex lip ids, and accumulation of stimulatory selecting lipids. The unique localisation and shuttling functions of SCP-2 suggest that lipids, which are modified within peroxisomes and mitochondria mi ght be relevant in thymic selection of iNKT cells. Future studies will invest igate whether these organelles participate in immunity to lipid antigens. 216 217 CONCLUSIONS The work presented in this thesis aimed to characte rize the mechanisms by which stimulatory CD1d:lipid antigen complexes are genera ted and which are the contributions to this process of lipid transfer pro teins and of enzymes of the lipid degradation pathway. This work also aimed to study how thymic selection and peripheral activation of lipid specific T cells are affected when stimulatory CD1:antigen complexes generation is impaired. To study these mechanisms I took advantage of diffe rent knock-out and transgenic mouse models, in which particular LTPs (or enzymes of the lipid degradation pathway), localized in different cellular compartme nts, were either knocked-out or expressed as transgenes. Formation of the CD1:antigen complex is the last of a series of events taking place in different cellular compartments, where CD1 molec ules are assembled and traffic, and where antigenic lipids are internalize d, processed or synthesized. Since CD1d loading with antigenic lipids takes plac e mostly in lysosomes, lysosomal LTPs or enzymes of the lipid degradation pathway were the first molecules studied in order to understand how stimul atory CD1:lipid complexes and thymic selection of iNKT take place. By the analysi s of mice knocked-out for particular LTPs or enzymes it has been possible to identify some of the key players on the generation of stimulatory CD1:antigen comple xes, like saposins [84] and Hex-b deficiencies in enzymes of the lysosomal g lycosphingolipid degradation pathway or in lysosomal lipid transfer proteins cause imbalances in lipid metabolism [208]. As a consequence of these d efects, lipids accumulate inside lysosomal compartments, where CD1:lipid anti gen complexes are generated. In a first study, I analysed two mouse models of imbalanced lipid metabolism, -Gal -/- mice (a model for GM1 gangliosidosis) and NPC-2-/- mice (a 218 model for Niemann Pick C2 disease). The genes knock ed-out in these two models encode proteins that localize inside lysosomes. In both models generation of stimulatory CD1d:lipid complexes was impaired and d evelopment of iNKT, but not of other T cells, was defective. The data suggest that the accumulation of storage l ipids is the main cause of impaired thymic selection of iNKT cells. Indeed, ac cumulation of storage lipids in both models disturbed lipid antigen presentation to iNKT and affected the formation of stimulatory CD1d:lipid antigen complexes on the cell surface. Presentation of exogenous lipid antigen to iNKT cells was improved by pre-treatment of APC with NB-DNJ, an inhibitor of glycosphingolipid biosynthe sis known to reduce pathological lipid storage in vitro and in vivo [330]. Although the accumulation of lipids impairs lipid a ntigen presentation in both -Gal - /- and NPC-2-/- cells, the underlying mechanisms are different. Dif ferent types lipids accumulate NPC2 -/- mice. The phenotype and TCR repertoire among the residual iNKT cell populations in -Gal -/- vs . NPC2 -/- mice is therefore differently influenced by the quantity and type(s) of lipid antigens that can form stimulatory CD1d:antigen complexes. In a second study, I analysed whether CD1e function ally interacts with other CD1 family members, thus participating in the generatio n of CD1:antigen complexes. Mature CD1e is a soluble protein, and the immunolog ical function reported until now is to assist the processing of complex glycolip id antigens presented by CD1b molecules [16]. CD1e or or CD1d, I that CD1e presence in APC influences in se veral ways the response of specific clones to endogenous and exogenous lipid a ntigens. CD1e can directly 219 participate in loading and unloading of lipids onto and from CD1d. I performed these studies both in the human system and in a tra nsgenic mouse model. I observed that the nature of the antigen is critical for interaction with CD1e. Moreover, the data showed that, at least for CD1d-m ediated antigen presentation, CD1e influences the type of cytokines released by h uman iNKT cell clones by altering the number of stimulatory complexes on the surface. CD1e could influence lipid antigen presentation by several mechanisms: i) increasing solubility of lipid antigen by extractin g them from membranes in order to facilitate their association with CD1 molecules and thus their presentation to T cells; ii) participating in lipid processing; iii) facilitating loading of lipid antigens on other CD1 molecules, and iv) facilitating unloading of non-stimulatory lipids from CD1. Kinetic studies demonstrated that CD1e participates in the formation of CD1d:lipid antigen complexes at early time points, while it fa cilitates the unloading of the complexes at later time points, thus contributing t o the fine tuning of the immunological response of iNKT cells. This function might be important during infections, thus limiting antigen presentation only when bacteria are present and produce antigenic lipids. This hypothesis is suppor ted by the fact that CD1e facilitates presentation of Sphingomonas antigens to iNKT cells, particularly when the bacteria are pulsed only for a short period of time. Importantly CD1e also accelerates the \"switch off\" of the response at lat er time points, thus avoiding prolonged iNKT cell activation. In these studies I also found that LTPs residing in cellular compartments different from lysosomes are also relevant for iNKT cell stim ulation. ApoE, a serum protein involved in transport of lipid inside the cell and MTP, an ER-resident LTP involved in correct folding of CD1 molecules are two example s of non-lysosomal LTPs 220 influencing CD1d-mediated selection and peripheral activation iNKT cells. However, it was never investigated whether LTPs res ident in the cytoplasm, which is one of the most important cellular compartments where lipids are generated, modified and distributed to different membranes, ar e also involved in iNKT cell development and stimulation. In a third study I analysed the role of a non-lysos omal LTP, SCP-2, in regulating thymic development, peripheral numbers and function al activation of iNKT cells. SCP-2 is associated with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER, mitochondria and peroxisomes, and has been ascribed the important fu nction of distributing lipids among these membranes [124]. SCP-2 does co-loca lise with the antigen- binding domains of CD1 molecules, and therefore can not participate in CD1 antigen loading. Scp-2-/--APC were defective in presenting endogenous lipids to autoreactive iNKT cells and showed an altered lipid composition. Inde ed, in Scp-2-/- mice iNKT cells thymic development is partially blocked. This arres t occurs at two maturation checkpoints, which have been associated with intrat hymic antigen stimulation necessary for expansion and terminal maturation of iNKT thimocytes [230]. SCP-2 contributes to lipid trafficking within peroxisomes , and we found that its deficiency affects the repertoire of lipids of peroxisomal ori gin. SCP-2 might be involved in the synthesis of iNKT cell selecting ligands, or in lip id traffic within cells, relevant for iNKT cell stimulation. In conclusion, this study has revealed a novel leve l of regulation that involves lipid transport within cytoplasm and cellular organelles, generation of complex lipids, and accumulation of stimulatory selecting lipids. The increasing knowledge of the CD1 system shows th at CD1 and MHC systems share several similarities. The two systems evolved to react to different kinds of 221 challenges, while common features have been maintai ned. It is interesting to note that in both systems a stringent quality control me chanism exists that disciplines the correct loading of antigens. In both cases this function is exerted by chaperone proteins, that are located in different cellular co mpartments. The evolution of the CD1 system in primates indicat es that recognition of lipid antigens is beneficial to the organism and suggests that this class of antigens might be considered for therapeutic approaches. The lack of polymorphism of CD1 molecules is instead an important difference with t he MHC system and its physiological implications remain unclear. Lipid recognition has been considered as a \"simpler \" version of peptide recognition. A more complex picture is, instead, emerging showin g that lipid antigen presentation is complex and is involved in several physiological and pathological immune responses. Studies in this field in a near f uture will clarify how the immune system has selected the most appropriate strategies to enlarge the repertoire of recognized antigens and cope with different pathoge ns. 222 223 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.
