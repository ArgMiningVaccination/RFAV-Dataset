PLEASE ONLY CONTACT ME IF YOU ARE SERIOUS AND COMMITTED TO MAKING CHANGES IN YOUR LIFE. Making changes is not easy and sometimes extremely hard, so I want to acknowledge you for loving yourself enough to do it. YOU DESERVE IT ALL! The healing, the relationship, the abundance, the happiness, the peace that you are craving. And I'm here to help you to make all of that happen. Please make sure you read the description of the specific services I offer (and do not offer) entirely before deciding whether we could be a good fit. Thank you! Better yet - look me up online - you can easily find me by searching for my name. You will learn more about me and what I do, and read reviews on other platforms. I would appreciate you contacting me directly on my web site and not here. If you do so, in appreciation, I will send you my book \"The Art & Science of Real Magic\" for free! Please note that Spiritual Life Coaching is not covered by insurance. All sessions are done virtually over Zoom unless you are based in Los Angeles, in which case in-person sessions can be arranged. Please note that I am not working with anyone under the age of 18. I also do not remove \"black magick,\" or curses, cleanse houses of \"evil spirits,\" or predict your future (I help you create it :)). Some of the most common challenges I help my client with are: ~ Learning and practicing self-compassion, self-forgiveness, self-love ~ Mindfulness, and other forms of meditation ~ Stress, anxiety and depression, some cases of panic attacks ~ Career - finding their life's purpose, starting/changing a career ~ Healing their relationships with others, setting boundaries, releasing old relationships that don't serve them anymore ~ Creating new relationships by healing the painful experiences from the past ~ Developing wealth consciousness to create abundance ~ Consciously designing and creating the future they desire ~ Helping them establish new habits, stopping unhealthy habits, managing their time better, and keeping them accountable ~ Unleashing creativity and letting it flow in all areas of their lives ~ Spiritual awakening and its many \"symptoms\" (please read more about this below) ~ Healing emotional traumas from the past, inner child work ~ Helping them find their \"why\" for the purpose of their existence ~ Building an unshakable confidence that is not based on external circumstances ~ Cultivating mental, emotional, and spiritual resilience ~ Establishing and/or maintaining a spiritual practice ~ Integrating spirituality into their lives to thrive as Awake Beings ~ Dreamwork - dreams as a way to communicate with the personal and the collective unconscious ~ Working with energy centers (chakras) and energy channels. Spiritual Life Coaching is founded on the understanding that we are spiritual beings in our essence having a human experience. This means that whether we are trying to overcome anxiety, depression, limiting beliefs, or emotional trauma, healing cannot be complete without including our spiritual dimension. In fact, I can state with absolute certainty, based on my personal experience, and my experience working with my clients, that only when we reconnect with and begin living from our True Self as spiritual beings, we are able to transcend our limitations, heal the wounds from the past, and blossom into the full potential of our Unique Genius. The \"symptoms\" of Spiritual Awakening ~ Feeling that nothing is right with us, our life, and the world. An ever-present vague sense of discontentment. ~ Feeling different from others, not feeling the sense of belonging with most people. ~ Dissatisfaction with our achievements and our life, even if it's considered successful by society's standards. ~ Disappointment with our current religious views and beliefs. ~ Losing interest in things we once were passionate about. ~ Questioning our identity or our sense of identity dissolving, confusion about who we are and where we belong. ~ Finding our friends whose company we used to enjoy to be boring or unpleasant. ~ Loss of meaning, apathy, emotional emptiness, sense of groundlessness. ~ Doubting our deeply held beliefs. Distrusting authorities, role models, and experts. ~ Depression caused by any of the above, yet seemingly having no obvious reason. ~ Addictions and other unhealthy ways of coping with the discomfort. ~ Asking the big questions: Is there God? What is Reality made of? Who am I? What's the purpose of Existence? While some of these could be caused by other reasons, I invite you to consider the possibility that those reasons themselves could be a sign that it is time to look deeper for answers. Qualifications: ~ Ph.D. in Metaphysical Counseling ~ Master's Degree in Metaphysical Science ~ Certified Mindfulness Meditation Teacher ~ Certified Life Coach ~ Certified in Interpersonal Neurobiology ~ Certified NLP Practitioner ~ Certified Hypnotherapy Practitioner ~ Certified EFT Practitioner ~ HeartMath Facilitator ~ Science of Mind Practitioner ~ Certified in energy healing modalities: Reiki (levels 1-4), Reconnective Healing, and Quantum Healing I also studied and practiced many other modalities and techniques and have extensive experience in overcoming my own anxiety, depression, panic attacks, severely limiting beliefs, low self-esteem, various health issues, relationship problems, and many other challenges that I struggled with for many years. And now I'm successfully helping my clients heal their anxiety and depression, and transcend their limiting beliefs to live fully and freely as their most authentic selves; to create a life of passion, purpose, and success that is in alignment with their greatest vision for themselves.
