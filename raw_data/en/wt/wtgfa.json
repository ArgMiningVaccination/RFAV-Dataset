With a new scientific understanding, we now understand the real benefit of acupuncture therapy: acupuncture can help by improving blood flow to sore areas, which boosts oxygenation in tissues and helps the rehabilitation process. At Pico Rivera Animal Hospital, we feel that we can obtain the best results by using veterinary acupuncture as a supplement to medical therapy to help restore your pet's health and vitality. Veterinary acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into an animal's body at precise points called meridians, where the blood vessels converge with the nerves. These precise pinpricks allow for increased blood flow, which can be helpful for promoting healing. Our vets often recommend the use of acupuncture or other types of Chinese medicine for a number of issues, including: Medical treatments such as chemotherapy can feel very uncomfortable for your pet. They will often be combined with acupuncture in an effort to relieve some discomfort, helping your cat or dog to fight their illness. Acupuncture can often be used for injury rehabilitation. Conditions such as arthritis, nerve injuries, and hip dysplasia also tend to respond well to acupuncture. Acupuncture treatment can help encourage increased circulation, which can help hot spots, granulomas, and allergic dermatitis. It can also improve healing and reduce pain, leading to less itching and subsequent over-grooming. Acupuncture may stimulate digestive secretions, which helps to promote healthy digestive activity. Conditions such as diarrhea or nausea may benefit from increased blood flow. The immune-calming and anti-inflammatory capabilities of acupuncture treatment can improve asthma, allergies, and other conditions. Veterinary acupuncture for cats & dogs provides a number of benefits, including: Our Pico Rivera animal clinic is accepting new patients!
