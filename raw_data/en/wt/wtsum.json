We take a whole-body approach to health, healing and wellness at Release. Our providers are skilled in the disciplines of functional and lifestyle medicine, determining the root cause of symptoms and illness by looking into multiple contributing factors such as your lifestyle, your environment, and your genes. Treatment is then developed based on individual results rather than a one-size-fits-all plan. Lifestyle medicine helps individuals wanting to eliminate chronic symptoms & illness, those looking to make lasting changes by keeping their metabolic, hormonal, & gut health in balance, and anyone hoping to improve the way they feel inside and out. We are all unique so there is no right size fits all strategy to optimum wellness. We will explore the wellness practices you are familiar with and introduce you to others that may fill some gaps in your holistic well-being routines. This is a good starting point, but boosting self-awareness to determine which work best for you is even more important. After all, what is medicine for some does not offer the same healing benefits or might even cause harm to others. As you sample and explore these wellness modalities, we will encourage you to notice and monitor your inner world to help you identify the foods, exercise regimens, and patterns of behavior that serve you and those that don't, in order to make purposeful decisions. Once established, we help you integrate your successful formula for well-being into your daily routines so that they become sustainable habits. An engagement with our Lifestyle Medicine Providers encompasses: A Partnership You are the expert of you. We bring depth and creative knowledge of many wellness modalities, strategies and tools. Together we form a powerful team to optimize your well-being. Total Well-Being Our practices are founded upon the 5 pillars of wellness: Physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual. They are all important. Often people focus on just one of these areas, typically physical wellness, but It's important to ensure that we are caring for ourselves in all of these areas consistently to optimize well-being and stay in balance. Root Cause We will not focus on symptoms and fixing them, instead we search for root cause. We will work with you to investigate issues and imbalances that might be standing in the way of feeling amazing and living your best life. Alternative Medicine Our methods utilize alternative approaches, which focus on stimulating the body's ability to heal itself rather than allopathic medicines. These strategies include energy healing, yoga, mindfulness, herbal supplements, essential oils, and many more.
