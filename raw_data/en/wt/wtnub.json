Ayurveda is widely regarded as one of the oldest medical systems in the world. It originated in India where Ayurvedic practices predate written records and have been handed down by word of mouth. It provides a prescription for living your best life in alignment with your bodies own natural rhythms and tendencies. Ayurvedic medicine aims to integrate and balance the body, mind and spirit. This balance leads to health, happiness and the prevention of illness. Every individual has a distinct balance, and our health and well-being depends on getting the right balance for the 'Dosha' or constitution. When these rhythms are balanced the body is healthy. Ayurvedic treatment is tailored to each person's constitution type. We invite patients to be active participants because many Ayurvedic treatments require changes in diet, lifestyle, and habits. Ayurvedic treatments rely heavily on herbs and other plants - including oils and common spices. Currently, more than 600 herbal formulas and 250 single plants are included in the pharmacy of Ayurvedic Medicine. Your consultation will involve a detailed health history, pulse, tongue and eye diagnosis and a diet and lifestyle plan very specific to you and your constitution. The prescription of herbal formulas may also complement this as well as different body therapies to help to correct any imbalance that you may currently be suffering from. What we don't do... we won't ask you to become a pseudo Indian man or woman!! We offer practical ways to tweak your existing diet to optimise digestion and assimilation. This is an approach everyone can follow, is so simple you won't believe you've missed it and is "}
