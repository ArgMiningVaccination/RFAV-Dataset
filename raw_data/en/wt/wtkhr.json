Come visit to experience how halotherapy can assist you in your wellness lifestyle. Halotherapy is a 100% natural treatment for adults and children that gently cleanses the respiratory system. Dry salt is highly absorbent, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-viral. It works like a sponge and a tooth brush for your lungs. As you breathe, the pure dry salt that is misted in the air during your 45-minute session, it naturally helps to clear the airways and loosen particles of dust, pollen, and toxins we breathe in daily. In addition to respiratory benefits, dry salt can have a positive effect on skin and be naturally calming to help relieve stress, anxiety, and fatigue.
