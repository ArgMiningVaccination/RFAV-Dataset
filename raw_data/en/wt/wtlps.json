We've discovered a number of plastic-free vitamin and supplement options so we can now supplement sustainably. Jump to: Plastic-free vitamin and supplement options are finally a thing! A number of companies are now providing low waste supplement solutions in order to reduce the large amount of plastic waste created by daily vitamins. Numerous hard plastic bottles litter the bottom of our bathroom cabinets, filled with supplements we take to improve our health and vitality, depending on our individual needs, genetics and diets. Not only wasteful in terms of packaging, the tablets themselves are often wasted, forgotten and gone out of date after the initial motivation to improve your health fades. A few sustainable supplement suppliers are trying to change all of this, removing all plastic from their packaging and making it home compostable instead, and finding ways to build the habit of taking your tablets daily without fail and without wasting them. Note: while no packaging and reusable packaging are best, some things, like health products, will come individually packaged, so plant-based plastic-free compostable packaging is the best we have right now. Another note: vitamins don't replace a balanced diet. Eating a nutritious, varied, plant-rich, locally sourced diet in the first place is healthier and more sustainable.

They are Australian made and they come in certified compostable packaging. Its vitamins and minerals are made solely from pure and potent certified organic superfoods. Unlike synthetic versions known as isolated nutrients, they are highly bioavailable because they contain a host of phytonutrients that include proteins, enzymes and other nutrients. While 'synthetic' vitamins are made in a laboratory (i.e. 'man-made') and tend to be a slightly different shaped molecule to the natural version, 'natural' vitamins are identical to the forms found in our food or body. Fyto explains the difference between natural and isolated synthetic vitamins and minerals in more depth, why natural vitamins are better than synthetic, and how you spot a synthetic vitamin when you're next buying your supplements (with scientific references!) [here](https://one.organic/blogs/article/natural-vs-synthetic-vitamins-whats-the-difference?aff=1055). Fyto food supplements come in compostable ziplock packets containing 60 capsules.

It notes that it is hard for vitamins to be effective if taken incorrectly and answers the question of how to not forget to take your vitamins by sharing the following tips to ensure you create a daily habit and strict regime: Create a daily reminder on your phone Practice habit stacking - pair up your vitamin routine with a daily habit to help you remember, for example keep them with your gym gear if you do a daily workout, next to your coffee or tea, or next to your toothbrush to be reminded each morning when you reach for it If you do miss a day, Vitable says you shouldn't double up. Just continue taking as normal and try to find a better solution to forgetting to take your supplements.
