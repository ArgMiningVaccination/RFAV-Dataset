Researchers analyzed productive and unproductive behavior during other pandemics such as the 9-11 terrorist attacks, Ebola, and SARS. They found four ways mentally strong people help themselves rise above stressful events. Here are some suggestions based on evidence of how mentally strong people respond to crises: 1. Limit news and media exposure - Too much of anything can be stressful. Mentally strong people limit their news exposure and limit exposure to distressful images shown on the news. 2. Accept their feelings as normal - Whether the loss of a job, homeschooling children, the inability to attend a funeral or see a loved one in a nursing home or otherwise, mentally strong people understand that feelings are normal and typically temporary. 3. Limit toxic people - While you may be able to tolerate some toxicity with friends, family, and colleagues during non-pandemic times, eliminating toxic energy is vital when you are in survival mode during COVID-19. 4. Focus on self-care - Mentally strong people consistently use self-care and attempt to be flexible with new routines. Health experts say practicing these behaviors may not only help people manage the pandemic, but also decrease the likelihood of any long term mental health issues as a result of COVID-19. "}
