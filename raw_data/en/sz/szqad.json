Yet the deeper aspects of homoeopathy are, like religion, contrary to the materialistic principles that 'Scientists' would have us believe regulate material existence. Homoeopathy In order to see any such connections we must first state concisely what homoeopathy is. The basic ideas upon which homoeopathy rests may be stated as follows: From the above list we can make certain speculations and conclusions regarding the nature of a living organism. The doctrine of the vital force fits so closely the facts of homoeopathy that it is remarkable that science has never shown much interest in the subject. One reason may be that all Vitalist theories about life come very close indeed to the spiritual, and science is never prepared to get tangled up with subjective truths. This is where religion comes in. Religion In spite of all the differences between the various religions, there are some things that all religions have in common. We can list them. Conclusions James Tyler Kent was probably the greatest homoeopath to see the connection between religion and homoeopathy. His homoeopathic writings are full of religious speculations and they are well worth reading. Some quotes which I give at the end of this article serve to illustrate some of his ideas. In conclusion, what we can say about homoeopathy and religion is that there are some definite connections between them. They agree very broadly about the nature of man and of life, they support each other logically and they complement one another. In my view homoeopathy is a spiritual technique, a spiritual discipline, that heals sickness by addressing that in each of us - vital force and spirit - from which the body, was created and by which it is maintained. In this sense therefore homoeopathy is far more than a system of medicine. When practised properly it holds out to humanity a means of self-understanding, self discovery and self-help as important and as valid as any religion on earth. Quotes from Kent \"You cannot divorce medicine and theology. Man exists all the way down from his innermost spiritual, to his outermost natural. \"There is an innermost to everything that is, or else the outermost could not be. \"All matter is capable of reduction to its radiant or primitiveform. \"The vital force dominates, rules and co-ordinates the human body. \"There is no cell in man that does not have its Will and understanding, its soul-stuff, limbus or simple substance. \"Man cannot be made sick or be cured except by a substance as ethereal in quality as the vital force. \"There are two worlds; the world of thought or immaterial substance and the world of matter or material substance. \"It is the imperfect machine that causes death. The vital force is of the Soul and cannot be destroyed or weakened. It can be disordered but it is all there. \"Radiant substances have degrees within degrees, in seriestoo numerous for the finite mind to grasp. \"Thinking and willing establishes a state in man that identifies the condition he is in. As long as man continued to think that which was true and held that which was good to the neighbour, that which was uprightness and justice, so long man remained free from the susceptibility to disease, because that was the state in which he was created. \"Man today is destroyed as to his interiors so that truth looks as black as smoke, and false philosophy as bright as the sun.\" [HOMOEOPATHY "}
