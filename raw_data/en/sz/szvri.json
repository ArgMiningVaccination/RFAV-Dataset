Paul Shattock, director of Sunderland University's autism research unit, believes the absence of biological markers of \"traditional\" autism in the urine of some children could indicate that their condition was caused by measles. He stressed more work was needed to establish a firm link with the triple jab, saying evidence from his unpublished study of 4,000 cases of autism was strong, but not conclusive. Mr Shattock's intervention in the [MMR](https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr) row comes as the government and the medical research council tries to reassure parents that international studies have found \"strong positive evidence\" of no link between the vaccine and autism, cases of which have soared in recent years. Much of the doubt has been sown by Andrew Wakefield, a researcher who claims he was effectively forced out of his job at a London hospital and who now works in the US. But Mr Shattock believes there is substance in Dr Wakefield's argument that the measles vaccine is involved. And because it only involved a small sub-group of autism cases, he argues that the surveys used to justify MMR's safety would not necessarily have picked up the problem. Mr Shattock, much of whose contribution to autism studies has centred on diet, said urine samples from the 10% of parents who blamed their children's condition on the jab and reported a sudden decline after the vaccine were often different from samples provided by the 90% of parents who did not think there was a link. Peter Dukes, of the medical research council, yesterday told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Shattock should \"publish his research and come forward to "}
