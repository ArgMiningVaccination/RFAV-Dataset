Common pills for cold remedies are often used as the basis for the production of the drug. The meth \"cook\" extracts ingredients from those pills and to increase its strength combines the substance with chemicals such as battery acid, drain cleaner, lantern fuel and antifreeze. These dangerous chemicals are potentially explosive and because the meth cooks are drug users themselves and disoriented, they are often severely burned and disfigured or killed when their preparations explode. Such accidents endanger others in nearby homes or buildings. The illegal laboratories create a lot of toxic waste as well\u2014the production of one pound of methamphetamine produces five pounds of waste.
