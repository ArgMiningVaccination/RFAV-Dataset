Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) A natural allergy relief remedy that works without nasty chemicals! A win-win for sure for you and your pet! My 8-year-old staffy has always struggled with summertime itchiness - his skin can't handle the heat! These have really made a difference this year and calmed down his irritated skin. He will even eat them as a treat! Aller-911\u00ae Allergy Aid Soft Chews After one canister a lot of Zeke's itching seems to be in abeyance. Fall seems to be his worst time of the year, as well as an allergy to grain. Putting him on a different diet has helped. For right now his ears are clean and I haven't had to use any medication for his feet and chin in 2 months. He really seems to like them as he trots over to get them at breakfast/dinner time so that's a plus too.. "}
