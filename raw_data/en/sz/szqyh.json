I went through one of the darkest chapters of my life. After my mother passed my heart was broken. It was then that my own personal meditation practice saved me from the depths of depression. When I began to feel more grounded with the idea of my mothers transition, I was guided to write the meditations in this album to help others heal from heartbreak, abandonment, trust issues, feelings of betrayal and other core wounds we carry as human beings. It wasn't until I was recording the album with my amazing music producer, Neil Zimmerman, that I realized one day while walking the beach, that recording this album was another layer along my healing path. I began to realize then that it wasn't necessarily the world I was writing this album for like I had originally thought, it was my very own sensitive heart that was being resuscitated back to life through the words, affirmations and sound healing in this album. Needless to say, this is a very special album in my own healing journey and I invite you to experience the healing as well. All the tracks are very special to me. There is sound healing, spoken affirmation, an element of water, and breath instruction woven throughout the tracks. These alignment tools move energy through and out of the body to help dissipate any unprocessed emotions before they get stuck and lead to chronic pain and dis-ease. Heart Medicine: Guided Meditations for Healing the Heart is available for download through all major music platforms: Apple iTunes, Amazon Music, Google Play, Spotify, Napster and many more.
