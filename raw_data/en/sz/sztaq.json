Vaccines train the immune system to protect against SARS-CoV-2.3Monoclonal antibodies provide protection when the immune system cannot or has not had the time to respond.6 Vaccines stimulate a broad, long-term, adaptive immune response .3,4 Vaccines require time for the host to develop protective immunity.5 Some vaccines require multiple doses to achieve full efcacy.1,6 Monoclonal antibodies provide immediate immunity by neutralization or direct killing of SARS-CoV-2, which treats the active infection without requiring host immunity to the virus.5 Monoclonal antibodies confer temporary protection , as the antibodies are not produced by the host.4,5The Complementary Roles of Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies in Combating the COVID-19 Pandemic SARS-CoV-2COVID-19 Vaccine Fully Vaccinated Infected High-Risk PatientExposed PROTECTED RECOVEREDmAb treatment WHY ARE BOTH NEEDED? The effect of evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2 on vaccine and monoclonal antibody efcacy is not fully understood.Vaccines and monoclonal antibodies are tools to combat COVID-19. They complement each other based on their differences in the onset and duration of protection.1,5,8 *The length of the protection provided by vaccines and monoclonal antibodies against COVID-19 is still unknown.
