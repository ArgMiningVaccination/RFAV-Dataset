Naturopathic medicine is a distinct health care profession, emphasizing prevention, treatment, and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods that encourage individuals' inherent self-healing process. Naturopathic medicine is not simply the diagnosis and treatment of disease with natural agents. It is a practice based upon the restoration of health. The practice of naturopathic medicine includes modern and traditional, scientific, and empirical methods. Although health is the natural state of the being, it is influenced by the interactions of the person with the existing environment, both internal and external. Principles of Naturopathic Medicine. The Healing Power of Nature Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Cause The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm Naturopathic physicians follow three primary guidelines to avoid harming the patient: Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; Avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; and Acknowledge, respect, and work with individuals' self-healing process Doctor As Teacher Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Prevention+Wellness Naturopathic physicians emphasize the prevention of disease and promotion of wellness by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, health habits, and diet and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. How are Naturopathic Doctors trained? A licensed naturopathic physician (ND) attends a four-year, graduate level on-site naturopathic medical school. A licensed ND is educated in all of the same basic sciences as an MD, including anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, pathophysiology, physical, clinical, and laboratory diagnosis. Naturopathic students also study holistic and natural approaches as well as therapies with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. In addition to a standard medical curriculum, naturopathic physicians study clinical nutrition, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, psychology, naturopathic philosophy, physical medicine, and counseling. Naturopathic medical students take courses which address conventional, naturopathic, and integrative medicine, and functional medicine approaches to such health systems as: gastroenterology, immunology, infectious disease, urology, neuroscience, nephrology, endocrinology, and urology. A naturopathic physician must pass a rigorous professional board in order to be licensed by a state or jurisdiction. For more "}
