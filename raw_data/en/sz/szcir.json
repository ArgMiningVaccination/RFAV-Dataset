We'll also provide practical ways to protect these vital divine gifts. Previously: Although removing our tonsils may lower the risks of tonsil cancer and alleviate specific symptoms, scientists have unexpected findings ... The lymphatic system is our \"immune network manager,\" designed to keep internal and external toxins and invaders away from our body. It's truly a reflection of the miraculous design of the divine, flawless in both structure and function. The lymphatic system circulates a clear fluid called lymph through an extensive and intricate network of vessels throughout the body, thereby eliminating waste, toxins, and foreign particles, including viruses. The lymphatic system is a recycler, scavenger, and immune system chaperone. It works closely with the cardiovascular system and looks similar, with a network of veins transporting fluid. These two systems are assigned different tasks and work in tandem. But while blood has the heart to pump it throughout the body, lymph relies on a very different mechanism in order to circulate. Origin of the Lymph Lymph originates in the blood. As blood circulates throughout our body, it transports nutrients and oxygen via numerous tiny blood vessels called capillaries. Capillaries deposit nutrients and blood into the space between the cells, which makes up [one-sixth](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/hall_textbook_of_medical_physiology.pdf) of our total body volume. The capillaries also reabsorb small components from these spaces. However, large particles such as proteins and lipid-protein complexes, which can't be reabsorbed into the capillaries, are absorbed into lymphatic vessels, forming \"lymph.\" Other components, such as toxins and viruses, are often too large to be reabsorbed into the blood and are thereby absorbed by the lymphatic system. Nutrient and Fluid Recycler The lymphatic system also absorbs the excess fluid between cells and recycles it back into the blood, where it's then recirculated. The average person has a blood volume of [five liters](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30252333/#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20blood%20circulating,lower%20blood%20volume%20than%20men), with a lymph flow of approximately [two to three liters](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/hall_textbook_of_medical_physiology.pdf) per day, recycling up to half of the blood volume. Without lymphatic flow, a healthy person would die within [24 hours](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/hall_textbook_of_medical_physiology.pdf). And when a person suffers significant bleeding, their lymphatic vessel flow [is increased,](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8799953/) evidence of the lymphatic system's dynamic role in maintaining blood volume. Although clear, the lymph contains abundant nutrients, including proteins and fats. The lymph flowing through the intestines directly absorbs large fat molecules and serves as a major part of the [supply chain](https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/lymphatic/) of fatty nutrients for the body. The lymphatic system also helps clear fat from the body. Scavenger and Cleanser Lymph means \" [spring water](https://etymologeek.com/eng/lympho-)\" in ancient Greek, hinting at its function of cleansing our cells and organs. Our lymphatic system removes substances too large to be absorbed by the capillaries, including damaged cancer cells or cellular debris and other disease-associated substances from the cellular space, such as bacteria, viruses, inflammatory factors, toxins, and vaccines. Our bodies are exposed to countless contaminants regularly: more than 82,000 different toxins ( Fluids, germs, and viruses can enter lymph vessels but can't leave at will. All of the collected toxins and invaders are transported to the lymph nodes for clearance. But the lymph nodes do more than clear out unwanted substances; they also play a critical role in immune function. Strategically Placed Fortresses: Lymph Nodes Because the lymph system is clearing out unwanted substances, it's perfectly placed to detect and respond to any pathogenic viruses and bacteria. The lymph system can respond by generating antibodies and mature immune cells to help us fight against invading germs or viruses. At each critical position of the body, tiny bean-shaped masses serve as immune central hubs called [lymph nodes](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/lymphatic-disorders/overview-of-the-lymphatic-system). They filter all the lymph fluid. Then, the immune cells inside the nodes engulf and destroy the pathogenic materials that are filtered out, protecting the body from spreading infections. Some lymph nodes are clustered under the skin, particularly around the neck, armpits, and groin. Others reside deep within the body, surrounding the vital organs. There are approximately [800 lymph nodes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557717/#:~:text=Lymph%20nodes%20are%20found%20at,as%20well%20as%20in%20malignancy.) monitoring the conditions of our cells and tissues at a microscopic level. A healthy person has a healthy lymphatic system, with a constant smooth flow of lymphatic fluid, which can remove cancer cells, viruses, toxins, and more from our tissues and cells, preventing the vicious cycle of disease. Even a minor illness can be effectively resolved with the powerful self-healing ability of the lymphatic system, avoiding outcomes that are more difficult to treat. Gut-Specialized Lymphoid Tissue Everything one swallows eventually makes its way to the small intestine. Accordingly, a type of specially designed [mucus membrane lymphatic tissue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557457/#:~:text=However%2C%20Peyer's%20patches%20keep%20the,cells%20to%20the%20immune%20structures.), called Peyer's patches, which resemble lymph nodes, lines the small intestine. This lymphoid tissue frequently samples material within the small intestine, recognizing and destroying potential pathogens and keeping the intestinal flora at appropriate levels, preventing a large number of infections. Signs of an Impaired Lymphatic System When a lymph node becomes enlarged or red, it's often because of an accumulation of toxins, viruses, or other pathogens. Because of the one-way passive design, the vessels can also become clogged. A congested lymphatic system can lead to a buildup of various toxins or metabolic wastes in the space between cells, essentially surrounding the cells with garbage. [New research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.039) reveals that the lymphatic vascular system plays a significant role in numerous health conditions. Defects in the lymphatic system's structure or function have been identified in: - obesity - atherosclerosis - heart attack - Alzheimer's Disease - Parkinson's Disease - stroke - trauma - tumor - glaucoma - inflammatory bowel disease Even subtle lymphatic function changes could have an effect on the body's ability to fight off illness. Signs of a dysfunctional lymphatic system include: [brain fog, [overweight](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1642) pain, and fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4397133/) Simple Ways to Boost Lymphatic Flow The one-way lymphatic system has no active pumping mechanism and needs [passive and active movements](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27219461/) to make lymph flow. These include breathing, intestinal activity, physical movement, and muscle contraction. All these squeeze the lymphatic vessels, creating lymph flow and pushing toxins out of the body. If you find yourself experiencing signs of a clogged lymphatic system, detoxify your body by boosting the lymphatic flow through the following methods. Sleep Getting enough sleep matters. [A study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1241224) published in the journal Science found that during sleep, the brain lymphatic system clears neurotoxins (e.g., beta-amyloid, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease) from the brain and spinal fluid. The study highlights the importance of adequate sleep for this brain-drainage process to occur fully. Exercise The lymphatic flow becomes very active during exercise because of surrounding muscle contractions and body movement. This provides pressure to flow, often increasing lymph flow [10- to 30-fold](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/hall_textbook_of_medical_physiology.pdf). Deep Breathing Lymph is carried back into the blood system via a duct in the upper part of the chest. Deep breathing promotes this process because it generates suction. A study found that gentle arm exercise combined with deep breathing can [significantly improve](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16353491/) lymphatic obstruction in the arms. Healthy Food Eating healthy, natural, whole foods and avoiding processed foods high in preservatives will reduce the detox burden on the lymphatic system. One study shows that a [high-fat diet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4888550/) undermines lymphatic function. Another study showed that drinking water can [increase](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30431330/) lymph flow to promote nutrient absorption in the gut. Green vegetables containing [anti-oxidative chlorophyllin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15110092/) and [ginger](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665023/), [citrus fruits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8264544/), [flaxseed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808865/), and [garlic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417560/) can help reduce the risk of lymphatic congestion. Drinking Enough Water Dehydration can cause the lymph to become less fluid, leading to congestion and slower toxin elimination. Drinking enough water is crucial for maintaining healthy lymph flow. The more hydrated the body is, the better the lymphatic system can flush out toxins. Next: The lymphatic system not only is an indispensable protector but also could be a hidden path for toxins to spread throughout the body. It can be a spreading route of COVID-19 vaccines, which are linked with severe life-threatening events in the brain and heart.
