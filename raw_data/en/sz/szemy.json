Why Ayurveda? Ayurveda, 'The Science of Life', is an ancient system of healing from India. This holistic system looks at how the five elements manifest uniquely in each individual and addresses imbalances based on your unique constitution. The result? A modality that 'sees' you as a person, and not as your symptoms or disease. This is not a one-size fits all approach. How we approach clinical Ayurveda Our clinically trained Ayurvedic practitioners work with clients in four areas: food practices, lifestyle practices, Yoga, and herbal supports. This multi-pronged approach is truly holistic and addresses physical, energetic, and mental wellness. Your health concerns and goals are the guiding principle for this work. You and your practitioner will work together as partners to cultivate the practices that will enable you to feel HOW YOU WANT TO FEEL. Ayurveda is a profound way to address a variety of health issues. Do you want to... Improve your energy, digestion, elimination, and sleep? Re-envision your current lifestyle? Compliment other healing modalities? Support a time-of-life change like peri/menopause? Provide holistic support for illness and disease? Bring more vibrancy to your life? This ancient science is a deep well of practical tools to empower YOU to create the health you've always wanted. What makes for a successful Ayurveda client? There are some common factors that we see for our clients that experience the most success in our clinical Ayurveda work. Curious and open to changes in food, lifestyle, and wellness practices.

These consultations are conducted virtually via Zoom. Kristin is currently taking new clients, and works under the mentorship of Kara Aubin. Ayurvedic Practitioner: Professionals with full clinical training in disease pathology, as seen through the Ayurvedic model. They also practice prevention and health promotion through the focus on diet and lifestyle.
