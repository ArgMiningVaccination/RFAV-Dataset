They can all be caused by an underlying imbalance in your hormones. As a woman, it's perfectly normal and healthy to have fluctuations in your hormone levels. But sometimes, your levels can swing too far in one direction - either producing too much or not enough - and throw your whole system off balance. Even a slight imbalance in your hormones can trigger significant symptoms that can put a serious damper on your health and well-being - physically and emotionally. But the good news is, you don't have to simply accept an imbalance in your natural hormone levels. A cutting-edge therapy known as [bioidentical hormone replacement therapy](https://www.silvertreewellness.com/services/) can work wonders when it comes to restoring hormonal balance and helping you get back to feeling your best. In this blog post, we're going to explore the potential signs that you may have an underlying hormonal imbalance, exactly what bioidentical hormones are, how they work in your body, and the best way to tap into the power of these healing hormones. Hormonal Imbalance In Women While our bodies rely on dozens of different types of hormones to function optimally, there are three primary sex hormones that can have a particularly profound impact on your physical and mental well-being as a woman. These three primary sex hormones are: - Estrogen - Progesterone - Testosterone If your body is producing too much or too little of any of these hormones or their ratios become imbalanced, it can create a whole slew of hormone-related issues. Let's zoom in on some of the symptoms and downstream issues a hormonal imbalance can create and when it might be time to consider hormone replacement therapy to correct it. When Should A Woman Consider Hormone Replacement Therapy? One of the primary ways that hormonal imbalances manifest is during a process known as menopause. During the menopausal transition also known as perimenopause, your body's natural production of sex hormones begins to slowly decline. This transition often begins between ages 45 and 55 and can take several years to reach true menopause - which is considered a full 12 months after your final menstrual cycle.2 While menopause may be one of the more common causes of hormonal imbalances, it certainly isn't the only time you may experience symptoms associated with an imbalance in your hormone levels. Some signs that might indicate you have an underlying hormone imbalance include:3,4,5 - Hot flashes or night sweats - Vaginal dryness or pain during sex - Difficulty sleeping - Significant mood swings or increased feelings of irritability, anxiety, or depression - Fatigue, lack of energy, or exhaustion - Brain fog, difficulty concentrating, and reduced mental clarity - Urinary urgency or an increased need to pee - Irregular menstrual cycles - Decreased strength - Unexplained weight gain or extreme difficulty losing weight - Low libido or decrease in sex drive - Dry skin and/or acne - Thinning hair If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it might be time to consider getting your hormone levels checked. And if you do in fact have an underlying hormonal imbalance, correcting it can work wonders for your overall health, mood, and appearance. One of the most effective ways to restore equilibrium to your hormones is through a therapy known as hormone replacement therapy. What Does Hormone Replacement Do to Your Body? As the name implies, hormone replacement therapy replaces and restores your optimal hormone levels. By replacing the hormones that your body is no longer able to produce optimal levels of, you can effectively reverse any imbalances. Restoring balance to your primary sex hormones has a ripple effect, helping to promote balance among all of your hormones, neurotransmitters, and overall body. But when it comes to hormone replacement therapy, not all hormones are created equally. You see, the hormones used in hormone replacement therapy can come from different sources. One of the two primary forms of hormonal replacement therapies used to correct an imbalance is known as synthetic hormone replacement therapy. Synthetic hormones are manufactured in a lab and have a molecular structure that is similar to, but not identical to, the hormones produced by your body. Once administered, your body is able to convert these synthetic hormones into a usable form to help correct a hormonal imbalance. But there's another option when it comes to hormone replacement that is much more accurate - a type of hormone replacement therapy that utilizes what's known as bioidentical hormones. What Are Bioidentical Hormones? While bioidentical hormones are also produced in a lab, they are synthesized from all-natural compounds extracted from plant sources. Because they come from natural sources, bioidentical hormones are able to exactly replicate your own hormones - having identical molecular structures. To better understand what makes bioidentical hormones superior, think of your hormones as a key. Your hormones are designed to fit into specific receptors on your cells - similar to how a key fits into a lock. While synthetic hormones may be a close fit, they don't perfectly lock into these receptors. Bioidentical hormones, on the other hand, are an exact replica of your natural hormones - allowing them to perfectly lock into your cellular receptors. Not only are bioidentical hormones more effective, but they are also safer - with studies finding bioidentical hormones tend to have significantly fewer unwanted side effects than their synthetic counterparts.6 This is particularly important when receiving hormone replacement therapy for an extended period of time. Can I Take Bioidentical Hormones Forever? Exactly how long you receive bioidentical hormone replacement therapy will be entirely unique to you. Some people do well with a short round of bioidentical hormones to help relieve symptoms and assist their body in restoring balance. Others may benefit from a much longer bout of hormones to help them transition. Working with a trusted and experienced practitioner who regularly assesses your symptoms and hormone levels is the only way to truly determine how long you'll need to receive bioidentical hormones. But rest assured, there are many patients who safely receive some form of bioidentical hormones throughout their lifetime without any adverse effects. So, What Is the Best Way to Take Bioidentical Hormones? Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy can be administered in a number of ways such as: - Orally via pills or capsules - Sublingually through a tablet that dissolves under your tongue - Transdermally or through a cream rubbed into your skin - Injected into your muscle or vein through a needle - Through patches placed on your skin But one of the simplest and most effective ways to receive bioidentical hormones is through the insertion of a subcutaneous pellet. What Is a Bioidentical Hormone Pellet? Bioidentical hormone pellets are tiny pellets about the size of a grain of rice that contain a concentrated dose of carefully calibrated bioidentical hormones. These tiny pellets can be inserted beneath your skin (usually somewhere near your upper buttocks). Once inserted, these hormone pellets dissolve over a period of time - slowly releasing a steady stream of bioidentical hormones into your bloodstream. Bioidentical hormone pellets tend to be best for a couple of reasons: - They are super simple and don't require you to try to remember to take a pill or put on a messy cream every single day. You can essentially \"set it and forget it\" until your next appointment with your provider. - They dissolve slowly and release a steady stream of hormones - eliminating fluctuations in your hormone levels and allowing for a more consistent hormonal balance. The simplicity and potency of bioidentical hormone pellets can deliver life-changing results if you're struggling with any kind of hormonal imbalance.
