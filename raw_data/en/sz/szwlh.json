Tuesday, April 24, 2018 [USA Student Health Center Receives AAAHC Reaccreditation](http://medschoolwatercooler.blogspot.com/2018/04/usa-student-health-center-receives.html) The center has been accredited since 2013 and has been granted the maximum reaccreditation term of three years. Only 20 percent of student health centers in the country receive this recognition. \"This is an important milestone in the continuing growth and success of our Student Health Center,\" said Beverly Kellen, director of operations for the center. \"Pursuing accreditation demonstrates our commitment to providing the highest levels of patient care to our students, and the same high level of quality in our business practices. Achieving accreditation by AAAHC is proof that we have met the rigorous standards of a nationally recognized third party.\" Organizations seeking accreditation by AAAHC undergo an extensive self-assessment and on-site survey by AAAHC expert physicians, nurses and administrators. The survey is consultative and educational, presenting best practices to help an organization improve its care and services. Kellen emphasized that not all ambulatory health care organizations seek accreditation, and not all that undergo the rigorous process are granted accreditation. \"Going through the process challenged us to find better ways to care for our patients, and it serves as a constant reminder that our responsibility is to strive to continuously improve the quality of care we provide,\" Kellen said. The USA Student Health Center offers comprehensive primary health care services including women's health, sports medicine, travel medicine and psychiatry services. Student health also encompasses health education and wellness programs that empower students to make healthy lifestyle choices. Program topics include sexual assault, tobacco cessation, reproductive health, substance abuse prevention, nutrition, stress management and relaxation. Kellen points to the importance of students taking care of their mental health as well as their physical health. \"Psychiatric services are a very important aspect of our holistic approach to medicine,\" she said, \"and this service has been very well received by our students.\" In the fall of 2016, the clinic relocated to the heart of the university's campus, making its services more accessible to the student population.
