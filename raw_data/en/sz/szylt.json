We demonstrate that targeting WEE1 up-regulates immune signaling through the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viral defense pathway with subsequent responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade even in cGAS/STING-deficient tumors, which is a typical phenotype across multiple cancer types. WEE1 inhibition increases endogenous retroviral through down-regulating FOXM1. ERVs trigger dsRNA stress and interferon response, increasing recruitment of anti-tumor T cells with concurrent PD-L1 elevation in multiple tumor models. Furthermore, combining WEE1 inhibition and PD-L1 blockade induced striking tumor regression in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. A WEE1 inhibition-induced viral defense signature provides a potentially informative biomarker for patient selection for combination therapy with WEE1 and ICB. WEE1 inhibition stimulates anti-tumor immunity and enhances sensitivity to ICB, providing a rationale for the combination of WEE1 inhibitors and ICB in clinical trials. Graphical Abstract Introduction Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has improved outcomes in multiple malignancies ( [Carbognin et al., 2015](javascript:;)). However, only a subset of cancer patients benefits from ICB ( [Zou et al., 2016](javascript:;)). To extend the clinical benefits of ICB to a more significant number of patients, many trials combining ICB with small molecule inhibitors are currently underway. In preclinical models, DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and bromodomain inhibitors restore cytotoxic T cell functions and reverse the immune-suppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment and demonstrate synergistic activity with ICB ( [Dunn and Rao, 2017](javascript:;)), supporting DNA to cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in tumor cells activates the stimulator of the IFN genes (STING) pathway. Activation cGAS/STING pathway induces IFN production and boosts host antitumor immunity ( [Kwon and Bakhoum, 2020](javascript:;)). However, the cGAS/STING pathway is commonly aberrant in a number of cancer types, including colorectal carcinoma, melanoma, and ovarian cancer ( [de Queiroz et al., 2019](javascript:;)). Therefore, it is essential to identify alternative approaches to induce IFN activation, especially in cGAS/STING-deficient tumors. Wee1-like protein kinase (WEE1) ensures that cells with DNA damage arrest and allow time for DNA repair by inhibiting CDK1 (also known as CDC2) G2 arrest, causing cells with unrepaired DNA damage to enter mitosis and undergo mitotic catastrophe ( [Matheson et al., 2016](javascript:;)). increasing clinical trials reported that WEE1 inhibitor (Adavosertib/AZD1775) monotherapy or combined with gemcitabine demonstrated promising clinical activity and synergistic anti-tumor effects in multiple cancer types with limited treatment options, such as recurrent and platinum-resistant serous ovarian carcinoma ( [Leijen et pancreatic cancer ( [Cuneo et al., However, the potential role of WEE1 inhibition in modulation of the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy remains poorly understood. Expression of tumor endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) leads to IFN pathway activation and improved responses to immunotherapy by altering both innate and adaptive immune responses ( [Ca\u00f1adas et al., 2018](javascript:;)). For instance, decreasing DNA methylation by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors ( [Chiappinelli IFN signaling, thus promoting antigen presentation, immunogenicity, and cytokine production, which subsequently synergizes with ICB. Herein, we demonstrate that WEE1 inhibition increases expression of a suite of IFN-responsive genes through up-regulating ERV expression and subsequent double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent pathways in cancer cells. Our findings provide a novel insight into mechanisms underlying the actions of WEE1 inhibitors, thereby providing a rationale for combination strategies between WEE1 inhibitors and ICB in cancers. Results AZD1775 activates tumor immune responses by activating the IFN pathway and increasing T cell infiltration The IFNs, including type I IFN (IFN- and IFN-), type II IFN (IFN-), and type III IFN (IFN-), play a critical role in tumor immune system interactions ( [Garris et al., 2018](javascript:;); [Lasfar et al., 2016](javascript:;); [Zitvogel et al., 2015](javascript:;)). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database showed that higher IFN signaling in ovarian cancer is associated with improved prognosis ( [Fig. S1 A]). IFN signaling activation has the potential to enhance ICB in various cancers ( [Chiappinelli et al., 2015](javascript:;)). We thus used HCT116-Dual cells, a reporter cell that has been widely used for high throughput screening of IFN activation, to determine whether a series of targeted inhibitors induced IFN signaling ( [Fig. 1 A]). Surprisingly, cell cycling checkpoint AZD1775) and WEE1i having the best effect ( [Fig. 1 A]). Despite previous reports of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) altering IFN signaling, the PARPi, HCT116 1 A]), to a KRAS mutation mediating resistance to PARPi monotherapy, as we previously reported ( [Sun et al., 2017](javascript:;)). Interestingly, multiple MEK/ERK inhibitors induced profound IFN signaling potentially due to the abrogation of MAPK pathway in KRAS mutant HCT116 cells resulting in DNA damage and STING pathway activation ( [Sun et al., 2017](javascript:;)). We verified cells (ID8) after AZD1775 treatment showed that DNA damage repair genes, especially the homologous recombination repair pathway, were down-regulated ( [Fig. 1 B]). Consistent and ID8 cells ( [Fig. AZD1775-induced genes were consistently enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms related to dsRNA binding, IFN response signaling, and immune effector process ( [Fig. 1 C], top). Further, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed up-regulation of gene sets encompassing the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and cellular defense response to the virus ( [Fig. 1 C], bottom). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed enrichment D significantly CXCL10 release from OV90 cells, an essential downstream IFN target involved in T cell chemotaxis ( [Fig. S1 F]). Next, we assessed in syngeneic Strikingly, was highly active in C576BL/6 mice, these anti-tumor effects were markedly attenuated mice ( 1, E-G]). Consistently, markedly increased tumors infiltrating CD3+ T cells, mainly CD8+ T cells, without altering the CD4+ T cells and regulatory T (T reg) cells ( [Fig. 1, H and I]). cGAS/STING pathway is frequently defective in cancer cells Drugs targeting DNA damage response pathways have been reported to promote anti-tumor immunity by activating the dsDNA-activated cGAS/STING pathway ( [Wayne et al., 2021](javascript:;)). However, many studies reported the frequently defective cGAS/STING pathway in multiple cancer types ( [de Queiroz et al., 2019](javascript:;)), wherein the ability of dsDNA to activate cGAS/STING would have limited clinical significance. GO terms associated with double-strand RNA binding and KEGG analysis with the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway suggested that WEE1 inhibition may activate IFN signaling through the alternative dsRNA. We thus evaluated the expression of cytosolic sensors for dsDNA and dsRNA in 11 human ovarian cancer cell lines. Consistent with previous reports, the expression of STING was shallow in 6 of the 11 cell lines examined ( [Fig. 2 A]). Further, cGAS was also diminished in 7 of 11 ovarian cancer cell lines while the dsRNA sensors, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and DDX58, but not IFIH1, were expressed at readily detectable levels in most cell lines ( [Fig. 2 A]). To assess the ability of ovarian cancer cells to respond to dsRNA or dsDNA, we compared ISG expression after stimulation with poly I:C (a synthetic dsRNA analogue) or dsDNA90 (a synthetic dsDNA analogue). As expected, only poly I:C A and B]). AZD1775 induces ERV expression in ovarian cancer cells We next analyzed ERV expression using RepeatMasker in the RNA-seq data of ID8 cells. Remarkably, AZD1775 increased ERVs expression ( [Fig. 2 B]), further verified by a subset of randomly selected ERVs using RT-qPCR in ID8 and cells ( staining a dsRNA-specific antibody (J2) in ( with AZD1775, we IFN signaling in WEE1 knockdown cells, further suggesting that of AZD1775 are on-target ( [Fig. S2 G]). Moreover, consistent with report to cytosolic sensors induces MAVS treatment ( [Fig. 2 G]). Taken together, WEE1 is a key regulator of the expression of a group of ERVs in murine and human ovarian cancer models. dsRNAs are mainly responsible for WEE1 inhibition mediated IFN responses We next assessed the role of the dsDNA/dsRNA sensor pathway in WEE1 inhibition-induced IFN activation by [Fig. S2 H]). cGAS while STING knockdown only modestly decreased, AZD1775-induced IFN signaling in OVCAR4 cells ( [Fig. 2 H]), suggesting the cGAS/STING pathway does not appear to be a critical mediator of WEE1i-induced IFN signaling even in OVCAR4 cells with moderate cGAS and high STING protein levels ( [Fig. 2 A]). In contrast, knockdown of MAVS indicating that DDX58 is a key mediator. Previous studies have shown that DDX58 preferentially binds to short (<300 bp) dsRNAs that have blunt ends, whereas IFIH1 recognizes longer dsRNAs (>1,000 bp) with no end specificity and cooperatively assembles into a filament on the dsRNA ( [Reikine et al., 2014](javascript:;)). Thus, the effects of WEE1i on IFN signaling may be mediated by short dsRNAs rather than long dsRNAs. Consistently, AZD1775 increased almost all immune mediators revealed by the NanoString platform, indicating a broad effect on immune signaling ( [Fig. 2 I]). Unsurprisingly, cGAS or IFIH1, essentially reversed the induction of the suite of immune mediators, while STING knockdown modestly decreased the effects of WEE1 inhibition on immune mediator expression ( [Fig. 2 I]). Consistently, in contrast with dsRNA accumulation, aggregation was AZD1775-induced IFN signaling ( K]), of WEE1 inhibition on the IFN response were triggered by dsRNA from ERV transcription, but not by dsDNA after reverse transcription of ERVs. Decreased H3K9me3 after WEE1 inhibition contributes to dsRNA stress and promotes IFN activation A recent study ( [Bowling et al., 2021](javascript:;)) showed that the accumulation of mis-spliced transcripts results in dsRNA accumulation and IFN response in tumor cells. However, there was no enrichment of spliceosome-associated pathways ( [Fig. 1 C]) and no significant ( [Fig. S3, A and B]) owing to DNA methylation and histone modifications represent fundamental regulating ERV expression ( [Mager and Lorincz, 2017](javascript:;)). However, no significant revealed that active ERVs [Els\u00e4sser et Moreover, OV9O [Fig. F]; cells [Fig. S3, G and H]). Interestingly, SETDB1 and H3K9me3 had fallen by almost half after 24 h of AZD1775 treatment compared with control cells, then gradually declined over time with the ISGs massively increasing after 48 h of WEE1 S3 I]), indicating Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) showed LTR fragments ( [Fig. 3, D-F]). Integrated analysis of the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data revealed that up-regulated ERVs were directly bound by H3K9me3 and enriched within 60 kb of an H3K9me3 peak ( [Fig. 3, G and H]). Remarkably, at these up-regulated ERVs ( [Fig. 3 I]). To exclude the possibility H3K9me3 directly bound the up-regulated ISGs, we investigated H3K9me3 peak distributions near up-regulated ISGs. As expected, ChIP-seq analysis failed to identify up-regulated ISGs promoters ( [Fig. 3 J]). Thus IFN/antiviral responses induced by AZD1775 appear to be, at least in part, due to up-regulation of ERVs by H3K9me3 depletion. FOXM1 binds to the SETDB1 promoter regulating ERVs transcription To identify mechanisms underlying the effect of AZD1775 on SETDB1 expression, we performed reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis to assess signaling pathway perturbations in response to AZD1775 in eight ovarian cancer cell lines. AZD1775 decreased phosphorylation of its direct target (CDC2_pY15) and increased DNA damage (H2AX-pS140; [Fig. 4 A]), suggesting these effects were on target and generalizable. Consistent with our previous studies ( [Fang et target genes were significantly down-regulated by WEE1i as indicated by Enrich analysis ( [Chen al., [Kuleshov et al., B]). The E2F pathway that regulates was also suppressed by WEE1i ( [Fig. S4, WEE1i decreases FOXM1 activation. Interestingly, FOXM1 down-regulation recapitulated the effects of WEE1i on most target proteins in OVCAR4 cells, except for upstream cell cycle-related proteins (CHK1, CDC2_pY15, and CDC25C; [Fig. 4 C]), supporting that FOXM1 mediated many of the effects of WEE1i. Moreover, IFN response genes were positively enriched after knockdown siRNA or E]). The OV90 cells ( [Fig. S4, F-H]). These results suggested that the activation of IFN pathway by AZD1775 is likely mediated by FOXM1. We thus determined whether decreases in FOXM1 expression after AZD1775 decreased SETDB1 and its subsequent effect on ERV expression. In the TCGA pan-cancer database, there was a positive correlation between SETDB1 and FOXM1 in most cancer lineages, including ovarian cancer ( [Fig. S4 I]). In 4 D], right), further supporting FOXM1 as the critical player in WEE1i-mediated regulation of SETDB1 as well as H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. Furthermore, NanoString analysis showed that FOXM1 overexpression the immune-related genes ( [Fig. 4 E]). We next explored how FOXM1 regulates SETDB1 expression. The ENCODE database and ChIP-seq data in [GSE40767](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40767) revealed FOXM1 enrichment at in [Fig. 4 F]). FOXM1 enrichment genome-wide studies, we verified the binding of FOXM1 at the SETDB1 promoter using ChIP-PCR in OV90 cells, which was decreased by AZD1775 treatment ( [Fig. 4 G]). Together, these data support the contention that the effects of AZD1775 on FOXM1 and SETDB1 are causal factors for the induction ERVs and IFN/antiviral responsive genes mediated by WEE1 inhibition. induces PD-L1 expression through IFN signaling Both RNA-seq and RPPA data showed that AZD1775 increased PD-L1 in ovarian cancer cells ( [Fig. 1 B] and 4 A]). We verified that AZD1775 induced PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner ( [Fig. 5, A and B]). Increased cell membrane expression of PD-L1 was confirmed after AZD1775 treatment by flow cytometry ( [Fig. 5, C and D]). A recent study showed that the soluble PD-L1 isoform could be produced by exaptation al., 2019](javascript:;)). However, AZD1775 showed no effect on the expression of soluble PD-L1 (CD274-L2A) transcripts by qPCR primers specific to F]). IFN can induce PD-L1 expression, which allows tumor cells to evade immune surveillance ( [Dorand et al., 2016](javascript:;)). We 5 H]). JAKs mediate receptor ( [Shuai and Liu, 2003](javascript:;)). Notably, ruxolitinib, a increases in IFN-sensitive transcription factors ( [Fig. and PD-L1 expression ( [Fig. 5 J]), supporting an role IFN in PD-L1 up-regulation. Significantly, knockdown of cells. AZD1775 combined with ICB represses tumor growth in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner PD-L1 expression correlates with clinical response to anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 therapy in ovarian cancer ( [Disis et al., 2019](javascript:;); [Hamanishi et al., 2015](javascript:;)). To determine the effects of combined AZD1775 and PD-L1 on anti-tumor immunity in vivo, we used the ID8 (STING-deficient) syngeneic ovarian cancer mouse model. While anti-PD-L1 monotherapy did not significantly decrease or AZD1775 alone modestly decreased ID8 tumor growth, the combination of AZD1775 and anti-PD-L1 reduced tumor growth markedly ( [Fig. 6 A]) and prolonged survival time ( without notable side effects ( [Fig. S5 A]). Consistently, we observed increased immune cell characterized by positive CD45 cells ( [Fig. S5 B]) and higher tumor-infiltrating cells tumors composed predominantly of CD8+ T cells ( [Fig. 6 C]). Of note, AZD1775 did not affect T cell proliferation in vitro ( [Fig. S5 C]), consistent with a lack of deleterious effects on CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, we observed increased PD-L1 on ID8 tumor cells by flow cytometry after AZD1775, while PD-L1 on DC cells was also induced ( [Fig. 6 D]). Importantly, the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+ IFN-+ cells and other functional parameters, like granzyme B and Ki-67, significantly increased after AZD1775 monotherapy, further augmented by combination therapy ( [Fig. 6, E-H]). Additionally, expression of the inhibitory PD-1 on CD8+ T cells was reduced after PD-L1 treatment and combination treatment ( [Fig. 6, I and J]). The T reg cells were moderately decreased after combination therapy, and the CD8/T reg cell ratio was increased by AZD1775 or combination treatments ( [Fig. 6, K-M]). To assess the generalizability, CT26, syngeneic mouse models. AZD1775 combined with PD-L1 resulted in marked tumor growth delay in MC38-bearing mice ( [Fig. 7, A and B]). Notably, the combination treatment resulted in complete tumor regression (CR) that persisted >50 d after treatment cessation in three of nine treated mice, while no CRs were achieved in the monotherapy group ( [Fig. 7 A]). Moreover, combination therapy rendered mice resistant to a rechallenge with a subsequent injection of MC38 cells 2 wk after stopping therapy ( [Fig. 7 A]). The observed tumor-suppressive effects were CD8+ T cell-dependent because the therapeutic benefit of the combination treatment was abrogated when MC38 cells were injected for the third time after antibody-mediated depletion of CD8+ T cells ( [Fig. 7 A]). Furthermore, we depleted CD8+ T cells before and during the MC38 tumor challenge and treatment. Again, the anti-tumor effects of AZD1775 and combination therapy were eliminated by anti-CD8 treatment ( [Fig. S5 D]). Notably, we and PD-L1 were up-regulated in MC38 in vivo ( [Fig. S5, E and F]), consistent with the effects in vitro. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis of MC38 tumors revealed that AZD1775 up-regulated the expression of genes related to IFN signaling, cytokine, and antigen processing and presentation ( [Fig. 7 C]). At the same time, combination therapy showed more intense up-regulation of these genes, especially T cell chemokines, further supporting a role of T cells in the efficacy of the combination therapy ( [Fig. 7 C]), which was also consistent with our in vitro results that AZD1775 increased ERVs, ISGs, and PD-L1 expression in MC38 efficacy synergistic H]), further supporting the critical role of dsRNA sensor in response to WEE1i and the combination treatment in vivo. Compared with MC38-bearing mice, the overall anti-tumor effect was weaker in CT26- and B16-bearing mice ( [Fig. 7, G and H]). In contrast with MC38, AZD1775 or combination treatment did not induce ERVs, ISGs, or PD-L1 in CT26 and B16 vitro ( [Fig. S5, I-P]). Interestingly, the expression levels of dsRNA sensors DDX58 and MAVS were lower in CT26 and cells than in MC38 cells ( [Fig. 7 I]), which could at least partially explain the lack of IFN activation after WEE1 inhibition or poly I:C IFN activation may be informative biomarkers for response to AZD1775 To further explore the molecular underpinning of responses to AZD1775, we developed AZD1775-resistant cells by culturing AZD1775-sensitive cells (ID8) in the continued presence of AZD1775 for 6 mo, at which time drug-resistant cells emerged (ID8R; [Fig. 8 A]). Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis demonstrated lower in ID8R cells compared with 8, B and C]). Furthermore, also blunted in ID8R [Fig. 8 D]). Interestingly, we found down-regulated in ID8R cells ( 8 by IFN receptor (IFNR) knockdown or JAK inhibition increased the resistance of parental ID8 cells to AZD1775 ( [Fig. 8, F and G]). In summary, the degree of IFN pathway activation induced by AZD1775 may reflect the ability of AZD1775 to induce cell death. To explore whether FOXM1 and SETDB1 could also predict IFN pathway activation in response to AZD1775, we assessed ISGs after AZD1775 on 44 cancer cell lines. As expected, higher FOXM1 and SETDB1 were associated with IFN pathway activation in response to AZD1775 ( [Fig. 8, H and I]). ID8 and MC38, which have relatively high FOXM1 and SETDB1, were more responsive to AZD1775 than CT26 and B16 ( [Fig. 8 vivo culture of patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOSs) to assess the therapeutic effect of AZD1775. As expected, patient samples with higher expression of FOXM1 and SETDB1 assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed a better response to AZD1775 ( [Fig. 8, K and L]). Furthermore, analyses of the associations between gene expression signatures and AZD1775 sensitivity in the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) showed that cells with a high FOXM1 pathway score ( [Fig. 8, M and N]) or SETDB1 expression ( [Fig. 8 O]) were more sensitive to AZD1775. These findings demonstrated that baseline levels of FOXM1/SETDB1 and induced IFN pathway activation could predict response to AZD1775. Discussion Taken together, our data demonstrate that targeting WEE1 up-regulates ERVs, IFN activation, and PD-L1 in tumors. This response may be critical in cGAS/STING-deficient cancer cells representing a common phenotype across multiple cancer lineages. The ability of WEE1i to induce ERV expression is due to interrupting H3K9Me3 repression of ERVs expression. Consequently, WEE1 inhibition increases anti-tumor T cell infiltration sensitizes tumors anti-PD-L1. Pre-treatment levels of FOXM1, SETDB1, and induced ISGs signature predicted response of tumor cells and patient PDOS to WEE1 inhibitor combinations, providing potential selection biomarkers for human trials. WEE1 controls genomic stability by regulating replication origin firing or stabilization of replication forks ( [Dom\u00ednguez-Kelly et al., 2011](javascript:;)). WEE1 inhibition leads to DNA double-strand breaks and single-stranded lesions, stimulating immune responses through the IFN pathway ( [Paludan and Bowie, 2013](javascript:;)). However, cGAS/STING levels are deficient in most ovarian cancer cell lines, consistent with previous reports of cGAS/STING pathway defects in ovarian cancer ( [de Queiroz et al., 2019](javascript:;)). Indeed, we showed that even though cGAS/STING is functional in a minority of cell lines (such as OVCAR4), STING inhibition only modestly decreased AZD1775-induced ISGs, supporting a critical role of the dsRNA pathway in WEE1i-induced IFN signaling and immune activation. We also demonstrated that WEE1i-induced ISGs require DDX58/MAVS, which was largely intact in most ovarian cancer cell lines. Together, these observations indicate that dsRNA signaling plays a critical role in AZD1775-mediated activation of the IFN signaling pathway, especially in cGAS/STING-deficient cancer cells. It is important that AZD1775 could still activate IFN signaling pathways through dsRNA and thus enhance the effect of PD-L1 immunotherapy even in tumors such as ovarian cancers where STING signaling defects are common. FOXM1 activity is generally up-regulated by Since WEE1 is a negative regulator of CDK1/2, one would expect that WEE1 inhibition would up-regulate FOXM1 activity through relieving inhibition of CDK1/2. However, we found that AZD1775 remarkably decreased FOXM1 after 48-72 h of treatment in ovarian cancer cells, consistent with our previous publication ( [Fang et al., 2019](javascript:;)). Our studies focused on the relatively long-term effects of the WEE1 inhibitor. Interestingly, a recent paper ( [Diab et al., 2020](javascript:;)) showed that WEE1i caused an initial increase in CDK activity that lasted up to 8 h. However, this transient increase in CDK activity was followed by prolonged CDK inhibition throughout the remainder of WEE1i treatment and recovery in human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. Thus, rather than simply functioning as a CDK activator, WEE1i paradoxically suppressed CDK activity after prolonged treatment in HPV negative HNSCC cells, similar to what we observed in ovarian cancer cells. Mechanistically, the decreased CDK1/2 activity during and after prolonged WEE1i treatment (24 h) in HPV-negative HNSCC cells was associated with increased p21 (CDK inhibitor) binding to CDK1 and that WEE1 inhibition up-regulated p21 levels were up-regulated in our ovarian cancer models by RNA-seq. Moreover, the E2F pathway, a key regulator for FOXM1 expression, was suppressed after WEE1 inhibition by GSEA analysis. Therefore, relatively long-term effects and suppression of the E2F pathway may contribute to the down-regulation of FOXM1 by WEE1 inhibition in our studies. ICB using single-agent antibodies has demonstrated modest activity in epithelial ovarian cancer, with a median response rate of 10-15% ( [Disis et al., al., 2016](javascript:;); [Matulonis et al., 2018](javascript:;)). We have observed that targeting WEE1i elevated PD-L1 and enhanced CD8+ T cell recruitment in vivo, suggesting that these cancers could potentially benefit from the combination of AZD1775 and immunotherapy. Indeed, the combination of AZD1775 and PD-L1 blockade showed significant efficacy in controlling ID8 and MC38 tumors. High ISGs expression overlaps with the immune reactive subtype of TCGA ovarian cancer ( [Chiappinelli et al., 2015](javascript:;)) and correlates with long-term benefit in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 therapy in melanoma patients ( [Snyder et al., 2014](javascript:;)). Similarly, ISGs were significantly increased after AZD1775 treatment in ID8 and MC38 cells. In contrast, in CT26 cells, only part of the ISG repertoire increased, and in B16 cells, there was almost no ISG increase, which is consistent with decreased responses to the combination of AZD1775 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, suggesting that ISG induction may be an informative biomarker. In summary, in addition to dsDNA/cGAS/STING responses, there is an alternative pathway for WEE1i-induced IFN production through the dsRNA/RIG-1/MAVS cascade. Given that STING responses are compromised in a significant number of tumors, and particularly ovarian cancer, this is of potential importance to the clinical implementation of WEE1 inhibitors. As several WEE1 inhibitors are now under clinical evaluation, there is an urgent need to understand better the potential mechanisms and combinations that could benefit patients. Further, our study has identified biomarkers that could potentially be used to enrich the population of patients likely to benefit from combination therapy with WEE1i and ICB. Together, these studies warrant exploration of the combination in clinical trials.

Flow cytometry For tissues of ID8 xenografts, tumor tissues were cut into small pieces and digested using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec; cat #4035581) according to the instructions, on a shaking table for 1 h. A 200-mesh stainless steel filter was used to remove the remaining mass of tissue. After centrifugation (300 g, 10 min), single immune cells were collected and resuspended in stain buffer (BD Biosciences; cat #4032357). Samples were either directly incubated in the dark at room temperature for 40 min. As for IFN- detection, the single cells were stimulated with Leukocyte Activation Cocktail (BD Biosciences; cat #550583) for 6 h before being IFN- antibodies. Beckman Coulter flow cytometry (Cytoflex LX) was used to analyze the components of immune cells in the tumor, and FlowJo V10 software was used to quantify populations. CFSE labeled CD8+ T cell proliferation assay Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from healthy humans and CD8+ cells from the suspension were isolated by magnetic bead purification using CD8a microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec; cat #130-117-044) according to the were labeled with 1 \u00b5M CFSE (TOPSCIENCE; cat #150347-59-4) in PBS for 10 min at 37\u00b0C and stop staining using an equal volume of complete medium.

The level of proliferation was based on the FITC/FITC channel. Generation of AZD1775-resistant cells ID8 cells were subjected to AZD1775 in gradual increasing concentrations to generate AZD1775-resistant cells until cells adapted to 50 \u00b5M AZD1775. Monoclonal cell populations of the ID8-resistant cells were isolated by limiting dilution. Individual clones demonstrated different degrees of resistance to AZD1775. Cells were cultured in the absence of AZD1775 for a minimum of 1 mo before using them for experiments. Cytotoxicity measurement Cell viability measurements were performed by Cell Counting Kit-8 analysis (Dojindo Laboratories; cat #CK04). 3,000-5,000 (depending on cells) cells were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h, followed by drug administration for 48 h. The media were carefully replaced with 100 l fresh media supplemented with 10% CCK8 in the dark. Fresh media were used as a control. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h in the 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The graphics were generated in GraphPad Prism 8. 3D microfluidic ex vivo culture AIM Biotech 3D Cell Culture Chip (AIM Biotech; cat #DAX-1) was used for 3D culture. Human ovarian cancer tissues were digested by a Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec; cat #130-095-929). Following tumor dissociation, the samples were filtrated at a diameter between 40 and 100 \u00b5m and the filtered suspension was collected. A microsphere suspension consisting of 10 \u00b5l of above filtered suspension, 143 \u00b5l of rat tail collagen IV, 19 \u00b5l of PBS, 23 \u00b5l of H2O, and 5 \u00b5l of 0.5 M NaOH was mixed, and every 10 \u00b5l of suspension was pipetted into one gel channel. After culturing 3D culture chips in the 37\u00b0C thermostatic incubator for 30 min, 120 \u00b5l of complete culture medium was pipetted into each material channel. Microspheres were cultured for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in a thermostatic incubator and then treated with DMSO or AZD1775 for 24 h. Last, the living cells (green) and dead cells (red) were stained by acridine orange (AO) and propidium iodide (PI; cells were resuspended in PBS at a final concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/100 \u00b5l and then injected intraperitoneally into the female and NOD/SCID mice (HuaFu Kang Biotechnology). C57BL/6 or NOD/SCID mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 5 or 6 per group) 2 wk later and treated with vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and 0.2% Tween 80, oral gavage) or AZD1775 (60 mg/kg/d, oral gavage), 5 d on, 2 d off. For the ID8 xenografts model of combined AZD1775 and immune checkpoint suppression, the C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 5 or 6 per group) and treated with vehicle (oral gavage, 5 d on, 2 d off), AZD1775 (60 mg/kg/d, oral gavage, 5 d on, 2 d off), PD-L1 (200 \u00b5g per mouse, intraperitoneal injection, every 3 d for six doses), or combination of AZD1775 and PD-L1. Fluorescence images were conducted after 4 wk of drugs administration to show the residual tumor. Survival curves were generated by Kaplan-Meier. Tumor tissue and blood were obtained after the mice died or were sacrificed for further tissue analysis. MC38, B16, and CT26 105 CT26 cells were inoculated into the subcutaneous tissue flank of 8-10-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice (MC38 and B16) or BALB/c mice (CT26). Mice were randomly divided into four groups on the third day after cell injection, and drugs were administered by vehicle (5 d on, 2 d off, oral gavage), AZD1775 (60 mg/kg/d, 5 d on, 2 d off, oral gavage), and PD-L1 (200 \u00b5g per mouse, intraperitoneal injection, every 3 d for six doses), or combinations of AZD1775 and PD-L1. Tumor volumes were measured every 3 d and calculated using the formula V = (L \u00d7 W2)/2 (L, length; W, width). Mice were treated for 25 d. The mice of complete tumor regression in the MC38 model were re-challenged with MC38 cells injected subcutaneously into the contralateral flank. Tumor volumes were measured every 3 d until the 67th day to have a second stop. CD8 neutralizing antibody was used from day 80 (200 \u00b5g per mouse every other day, intraperitoneal injection, for three doses) for mice in the group of combination before injection of MC38 cells for the third time on day 85 (200 \u00b5g per mouse twice weekly) and tumor volumes measured and calculated as mentioned above. Mice were treated until day 25 and sacrificed for tissue harvest. RNA-seq analysis Raw reads were trimmed, and the collected clean data were aligned to hg38 or mm10 using STAR ( [Dobin et al., 2013](javascript:;)). Reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) normalized bigwigs were generated by deepTools ( [Ram\u00edrez et al., 2014](javascript:;)). Differential expression genes analysis between groups of samples was performed in R with DESeq ( [Anders and Huber, 2010](javascript:;)) from a with R package ClusterProfiler ( [Yu et al., 2012](javascript:;)). The prerank mode was used. The signed fold change \u00d7 log10 (P value) metric was used for preranking the genes. Heatmaps for RNA-seq were generated using The RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and WGBS datasets generated during this study are available at the National Genomics Data Center, part of the China National Center for Bioinformation (accession no. CRA003527, National Genomics Data Center-Genome Sequence Archive; [http://cncb.ac.cn](http://cncb.ac.cn)). ERV elements identification All transposable element (TE) analysis was performed using the Repeatmasker annotations downloaded from [http://www.repeatmasker.org](http://www.repeatmasker.org) (Repeat Library 20140131). ERV elements identified by RepeatMasker (class \"LTR\") were quantified. Differential expression for repeats was performed with edgeR the same way as for genes. ChIP-seq analysis Raw reads were mapped by Bowtie1 ( [Langmead et al., 2009](javascript:;)), and duplicate reads were removed. Only uniquely mapped reads were retained. RPKM normalized bigwigs were generated by deepTools, and the tracks were visualized with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV; [Robinson epic2 ( [Stovner and S\u00e6trom, 2019](javascript:;)) for broad peaks with a false discovery rate of 0.05. Heatmaps for ChIP-seq data were generated using the EnrichedHeatmap ( [Gu et al., 2018](javascript:;)) bioconductor package. Genomic coordinates for TEs were downloaded from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser (RepeatMasker track) of the GRCh38 assembly. H3K9me3 overlapping ERVs were computed with the intersect module of the bedtools suite, defining overlap when at least 1 bp of the regions overlapped. To test for enriched H3K9me3 binding at TE classes and ERV families, we used the TEanalysis software shuffle_bed.pl ( [https://github.com/4ureliek/TEanalysis](https://github.com/4ureliek/TEanalysis)). WGBS analysis Raw by trimming adaptors with Trim levels using MethylDackel ( and signal track bedgraph files were generated using MethylDackel first and then converted to bigwig format using the UCSC bedGraphToBigwig ( [Kent et al., 2010](javascript:;)) utility for visualizing in IGV. AZD1775 sensitivity analysis in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and CTRP Gene expression data were downloaded from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia ( [https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle)). The sensitivity data of AZD1775 were obtained from CTRP ( [https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ctrp/](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ctrp/)). The FOXM1_PATHWAY gene list was recruited from the literature, and the FOXM1 pathway score was calculated by the mean expression value of all genes in the pathway. Based on the drug area under the curve (AUC) values of AZD1775, cell lines were divided into three equal parts, with the high one third of the AUC values being defined as the AZD1775-resistant group and the low third of the AUC values being defined as the AZD1775-sensitive group. A heatmap for FOXM1 pathway genes in the AZD1775-resistant and -sensitive groups was generated using pheatmap. Cell lines were also divided into high or low groups based on FOXM1 pathway score or the expression of SETDB1 using the same method. TCGA data analysis For the association of IFN pathway genes (IFN_GSVA: REACTOME INTERFERON SIGNALING; IFN-_GSVA: HALLMARK INTERFERON ALPHA RESPONSE; IFN-_GSVA: HALLMARK INTERFERON GAMMA RESPONSE) expression with survival, vital patient status (dead and alive) was used as a surrogate end point, and patients were dichotomized by GSVA score ( [H\u00e4nzelmann et al., 2013](javascript:;)). The hazard ratios (HRs) and log-rank test were performed using the R Survival package (version 2.41.3). TCGA pan-cancer gene expression data Pearson's correlation coefficient for SETDB1 and FOXM1 expression was calculated in each cancer species. GEO data analysis We collected seven FOXM1 ChIP-seq datasets from GEO ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)) Browser ( [Mei et al., 2017](javascript:;)). Dataset information is listed in [Table 3]. The quality control and data analyses of these datasets were reported by ChiLin ( [Qin et al., 2016](javascript:;)). RPKM-normalized bigwigs were generated by deepTools, and the tracks were visualized with IGV. Statistical analysis Significant differences between the two groups were analyzed using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to compute correlations between variables, using a t test to assess the significance of the correlation. For comparisons of multiple groups, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used. All statistical analyses were done using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc.). Data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 8 software.
