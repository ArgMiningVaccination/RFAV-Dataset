DEFENDANT'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES 6. Defendant promoted doTERRA products and business opportunities through numerous means, including through: her websit e https://www.holisticesse Defendant has represented that certain doTERRA essential o il and supplement products (\"doTERRA Products\") are effective in preventing and treating Coronavirus Di sease 2019 (\"COVID-19\"). 7. Defendant organized a series of eight webinars featuring doTERRA distributor presenters who were current or former health-car e practitioners, scheduled to take place weekly between January 12 and March 2, 2022. Defendant heavily promoted these webinars on her website and social media accounts, providing information to enable people to register and join the webinars on Zoom. The first three webina rs - on January 12, 19, and 26, 2022 - were all titled \"The Path Forward: Protocols for the Current Climate.\" 8. Defendant moderated the first we binar on January 12, 2022, which had approximately 500 participants. In Defendant's opening remarks - which preceded remarks from 3 Case 2:23-cv-00009 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 PageID.4 Page 4 of 17 other doTERRA distributors claiming that speci fic doTERRA Products could prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19, including long-haul COVID, in both adults and children - Defendant stated: \"Tonight, what we're discussing is solu tions that you can have in your home, protocols that have been found to be completely effectiv e and amazing by practitioners who are actually working with patients w ho are struggling right now and that they have been very successful with.... Tonight is just about solu tions. It's about coming t ogether and talking about things that we know work, things that you can do right now. And so tonight, the layout is we're going to discuss a little bit about prevention, we're going to talk a little bit about treatment, we're going to talk about post-COVID issues and we're going to talk about recovery for those of you or people that you may love or know that may have struggled from vaccine reactions.\" 9. Defendant was a presenter at the Janu ary 19, 2022 webinar, during which she explained that her background was as a me dical ICU step-down nurse and stated: a. \"If you have a doTERRA wholesale account, go into the kits and collections. Guess what? There' s one named Immune Support. I mean, a lot of the things that we'r e going to talk about right now, doTERRA has already put them t ogether in bundles for you, where you save even more. So go check those out. So some of the things that you want to have on hand as you're stepping up support - maybe you fe el like something might - might be brewing in you right now, these are the things that you should be bumping up. So your LLV [Lifelong Vitality Pack] ... if you're not eating a healthy diet, if you're already d ealing with deficiencies, or if you're dealing with a disease proces s, the four of each bottle a day is not enough. I know some of you ar e like, I can't swallow it. Yes, you can. You can swallow another capsule if it means you will maintain your health, I promise. Black pepper, a massive anti-infla mmatory oil. Black pepper is so incredibly powerful.... You understanding these little things that Kelly and I are sharing with you right now, they can sa ve lives, but you need to know.... 4 Case 2:23-cv-00009 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 PageID.5 Page 5 of 17 Anyways, black pepper, aromatic sc ience. You can click on the oil. Black pepper - look at all the powe rful research on the power of black pepper essen tial oil, right? Glutathione, another amazing, amazing tool. DDR Prime is - just like LLV should be part of your daily routine, DDR Prime should be a nonnegotiabl e, especially with all the exposures we have in this worl d beyond just what's going on with COVID. Turmeric, guys, turmeric is like - it's a fad right now.... We have a form of turmeric that has a 96 perc ent bioavailability. That's pretty much unheard of.... We're actually able to take those amazing - that curcumin and the tumerones and they're actually able to be utilized by the body to do all the powers that it can with reducing inflammation in the body. And this - this virus, it - it th rives in inflammation. And we often look at like, whoa, somebody has these symptoms and somebody has these symptoms and, yeah, it's different variants and it's going to attack a little bit di fferently, but it thrives in the place that we have the most inflammation, and people see symptoms that are very different because those are where their body is inflamed. PB Assist Junior or PB Assist Plus - PB Assi st Junior for the kids, we'll talk about in a minute - 70 percent to 80 percent of your immune system is in your gut. That's the food you eat, that's the things you drink, that's the complete lack of an immune system. If you've taken antibiotics, you have to restore - you have to restore your immune system. You have to put those good bacteria back in there so the bad bacteria don't get out of whack. When the bad bacteria get out of whack, guess what? It makes your body incredibly vulnerable to viruses and other pathogens that come in, because it's like, ugh, I'm trying to deal with what's going on down here, I can't handle one more thing, you deal with it up there, and your body's like, oh, but you're the immune system, I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do, and then we get ill, right? 5 Case 2:23-cv-00009 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 PageID.6 Page 6 of 17 Same thing with On Guard Plus. Th is is On Guard Oil plus black pepper plus melissa. It has all thes e extra amazing oils in it, right, and this makes it really easy fo r you not to be lik e let me just figure out my own little formula, right? It's already done for you. But, again, when we're already fe eling something brewing, one to two capsules a day, it's not e nough. It's time to up it. Maybe you're taking two capsules every three hours instead, right, and using these. Also, like just throwing this out because of what Kelly shared, I just had family fly into town. So guess what? In the car, On Guard spray is getting sprayed everywhe re, there's On Guard wipes in there, right? I'm telling ever ybody put the oils in your hand, it's time to breathe it in. We' re going to make sure those pathways are clear before we go hugging and s nuggling on the grandkids, right? There are amazing things that we can do to set our body up for success.\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"When you need to step up support\" was displayed. This slide included labeled depictions of several doTERRA Products, including LLV (Lifelong Vitality Pack), black pepper essential oil, DDR Prime, Turmeric Dual Chamber Capsul es, PB Assist, and On Guard Softgels.] b. \"Lifelong Vitality, at least a fu ll dose daily. You can up it from there, especially when something's brewing. Two to four of the doTERRA Turm eric Dual Capsules; four if you're over 175 pounds. Two drops of bl ack pepper essential oil. I did that with a little bit of hone y just recently. It was really wonderful. So that's a great wa y to get your black pepper in you. Two doTERRA On Guard Softgels twice a day. You can increase it to three times a day. Two doTE RRA DDR Prime Softgels daily; four of the PB Assist Probiotics daily....\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"When you need to step up support\" was displayed.

And I think sometimes when we look at - but this is a really, big, scary thing that we - we undermine the importa nce of utilizing our essential oils. Again, just like Kelly men tioned earlier, massive amount of research on eucalyptus right now. So some things that I would be reaching for on a daily basis if I fe lt like I might be coming under the weather, eucalyptus is one of them. Simply, in our household, it's really easy. When my kids are in the shower, usually there's at least tw o at a time, two girls, two boys, two girls, taking time in the s hower, I'm just go ing around shower to shower in the house and throwi ng eucalyptus in the back of the shower. It's a really easy way to kind of steam it in. If we need a little bit more intense support, a steam mug. You take a coffee mug, you fill it about ha lfway with boiling water. If you have a child, you need to be m onitoring them, obviously, boiling water. And you put in your oils, right? Things like Breathe, things like eu calyptus, tulsi basil, Air X. I love using lemon. I love putting On Guard in there. Guys, there have been moments that I have put oregano in there. I will tell you that that is very wicked feeling, but it's what I needed to knock out whatever was going on in my sinus cavity. So simply eucalyptus, frankin cense, On Guard, these are all amazing. It steams up. You just throw a towel over your head and you're just kind of breathing it in. If you have a little one, please help them to keep their eyes close d. You're going to also prefer to have your eyes closed as well. It's not going to feel good.... A diffuser should be going in every room of your house. That is a simple, easy, daily routine that is protective, that is supportive, 7 Case 2:23-cv-00009 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 PageID.8 Page 8 of 17 easy, and you can rotate between Breathe - it's not a coincidence that doTERRA brings things out like Holiday Joy and Holiday Peace in the wintertime. Diffuse them. There's a very good reason why they came out at the time of year that they came out. Northern Escape, things like that. Abode. Purify. Use all the oils. Rotate between them. They all have amazing properties, and bei ng able to rotate between these powerful tools is such a beautiful gift. And I will tell you, the last tip in our house, every single day, I add oils to the air filters of my home. One, it cleans out whatev er's floating through my house, and I have a lot of people in my hous e so I need the air as clean as possible, right?\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"When you need to step up support\" was displayed. This slide included the text \"The Steam Mug breathe eucalyptus tulsi basil air x\"; a depiction of doTERRA Breathe Respiratory Drops; a depiction of a diffuser and a bottle of doTERRA essential oil; and labeled depictions of Abode, Eucalyptus, and Purify doTERRA essential oils.] d. \"Gargling, I love how people wanted to make fun of this last week, that we said use mouthwash and everything's all better. That's most definitely not what we sa id. But being aware that where a virus tends to replicate and thri ve in the body, including oral and nasal passages, and cleaning out th ose pathways so it doesn't have a place to breed is in credibly important. So by no means am I saying that doTERRA's On Guard mouthwash is going to cure COVI D. But I am telling you if you know that this virus likes to hang out up your nose and in your mouth and it likes to replicate rea lly fast right there, why would we not get that cleaned out of our mouth and our nose. And diffusing is a great way to do it. I mean, oils right in the hand, breathe in and I'm killing off what's sitting and tr ying to thrive inside my nasal passages, right? Immune Honey, this is a great wa y to give it to kids, obviously older than one, but kids like hone y and that's an easy way to be able to get oils in them. So this is a great recipe that Dr. Wong shared last week.... 8 Case 2:23-cv-00009 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 PageID.9 Page 9 of 17 So the recipe that Dr. Wong - Ti na Wong shared, it says ten drops of each in the honey. It is ten drops of frankincense, ten drops of lemon, ten drops of On Guard, ten drops of tea tree, and a half a cup of honey. And for five days, you can add in the ten drops of oregano. Obviously, for lit tle ones, that might be a little bit much, but for us adult ones, that's great. But only five days with it - with the oregano in it. So maybe you want to make yourself up two batches and then you can give yourself a break in between.\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"When you need to step up support\" was displayed. This slid e included a recipe for \"Immune Honey\" and the text: o \"Steam mug as needed (don't be afraid to add other oils like lemon, frank, ginger, melissa) ... o Gargle 4x per day with onguard mouthwash o Diffuse abode, onguard with a dditional eucalyptus around the home o Support for airways: Breathe ble nd, breathe stick, breathe drops o Support for the throat: Immune hon ey, gargle with OG mouthwash + can add 1 drop of oregano + cl ove for intense throat support... o Epsom Salt baths with deep blue, air x, lavender...\"] e. \"So I know for a lot of people, there's a good amount of people that are actually ge tting diagnosed with Long Haul and, you know, for a virus that has done such a brilliant job at causing an immense amount of inflammation, for some people, that inflammation process doesn't stop and it just - it just cascades into something a lot larger and it tends to work its way through the body. So what are you going to do if the symptoms last a lot longer than they are for everybody else? And it's the same things that we've been doing. LLV - and, again, you might need to up the dose. Zendocrine Complex, we're going to support your detoxification organs. DDR Prime, it's an incredibly powerful oil. Again, regardless of - regardless of COVID, DDR Prime should be something that we all consider ta king on a daily basis, and same thing with turmeric. We're tryi ng to calm our body down. It is overreacting. It's - it's over-fight ing and there's damage being left behind. So what can we do to calm ourselves down, to calm our body systems down? I cannot speak hi ghly enough of the Turmeric Duo 9 Case 2:23-cv-00009 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 PageID.10 Page 10 of 17 [sic] Caps. I'll talk about the CRS, but the Turmeric Duo [sic] Caps are amazing and, again, you can take more than one to two a day, just like we've been talking for some of the other protocols. You can up the amount that you're using every single day.\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"WELLNESS for Prolonged Support\" was displa yed. The slide included labeled depictions of several doTERRA Products, including LLV (Lifelong Vitality Pack, which includes xEO Mega, Microplex VMz, and Alpha CRS+), Zendocrine and Turmeric Dual Chamber Capsules.] f. \"Okay. So let's crank through the pe diatrics. Guys, it's basically a repeat for adult, just in kid dos es, right? So we have the kids' Omegas, the A to Z Chewables. I happen to love - there's some really great brands of other vitami ns out there that I use in addition to our A to Z, especially a B and vitamin D, things like that - that spray. My kids love them, our vitamin C spray. So things like that, adding extras in for your kids, great. The On Guard Chewables, amazing. Same thing that we would tell you to use. PB Assist, kids PB Assist Jr. is amazing. Oils to have on hand, Kelly al ready mentioned the power of Stronger. It's definitely an amaz ing oil for kids. It's great for adults, too. Frankincense every single day. That's going on my - it's going on my chil dren's bodies, right?\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"Pediatric Wellness + Immune Support\" was displayed. This slide included labeled depictions of several doTERRA Products, including A-Z Chewables, IQ Mega, On Guard Chewables, PB Assist Jr, frankincense essential oil, a nd Stronger essential oil.] g. \"LLV, there's a lot of cardiovascular and neurological issues that people are seeing post-vaccinati on. Again, I'm not telling you don't do it. I'm just telling you if you were to have a reaction, here are some things you can do, right? So LLV, kids Omegas, lots and lots of Omegas. In fact, for those who are dealing with post- vaccination reactions, you're goi ng to quadruple the Omegas from our LLV. I can't - or you've got to find another Omega that you can add in. Omegas, you should be taking about 4,000 milligrams 10 Case 2:23-cv-00009 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 PageID.11 Page 11 of 17 to deal with the inflammatory pro cess, especially neurological or cardiovascular. Zendocrine Complex, this is an amazing one. Maybe you want to start with one or two, but you're going to work your way up. You might be taking six to eight of these a day. Turmeric Duo [sic] Cap, again, it's an inflammatory process.... The idea of a vaccine, the way that they work is they're telling your immune system to do someth ing, and if the immune system wasn't prepared to do so, it's goi ng to overreact. It 's going to be the dog that bites you. How do we calm things back down? Turmeric Duo [sic] Caps are amazing. DDR Prime, amazing. Copaiba, amazing. They should be things that we're using every single day in much larger doses than we would on just a daily maintenance routine.\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"POST- VACCINATION SUPPORT BASICS\" was displayed. This slide included labeled depictions of several doTERRA Products, including Lifelong Vitality Pack (which includes xEO Mega, Microplex VMz, and Alpha CRS+), Zendocrine DDR Prime, and Copaiba Softgels.] h. \"There's also amazing research on essential oils that inhibit the SARS-COVID-2 [sic] spike protei n. And one of the things I like doing is if you just come into the abstract, it actually lists off what are some of the chemical compounds that do this, right? So monoterpenes - some of these should sound a little bit familiar, monoterpenes, cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol, geraniol, cinnamyl acetate, L-4-terpineol, thymol. These are things that are actually in several of our oils, right? So again, diffusing on a daily basis and getting those oils on, a powerful, powerful resource.\" [Defendant made these statemen ts as a slide titled \"SUPPORT PROTOCOLS FOR POST VACCINAT ION\" was displayed. This slide displayed the abstract from an article titled \"Computational evaluation of major components from plant essential oils as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\"] 11 Case 2:23-cv-00009 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 PageID.12 Page 12 of 17 10. Defendant was one of several presenters at the third Z oom webinar in the series, on January 26, 2022. During this webinar, Defendan t introduced herself as a former medical ICU nurse and made the following statements: a. \"We all have medical backgrounds. I've given many vaccinations. I'm just wanting you to be realistic that if that is the choice that you have made and a reaction happened, we don't want y ou to feel hopeless or helpless.... So if your decision was to get vaccinate d or if you needed to because of a job or someone you loved and they ar e having a reaction or they had a reaction that they're stru ggling with afterwards, we just want you to know that there's a really great set of tools to have on hand and some things that are really supportive.... When we talk about adults, LLV, and I don't know if this was mentioned or not already, our LLV was formulated to take an ideal healthy diet to ideal nutritional levels. That's what it was formulated for. So someone's already depleted - somebody's alre ady struggling with a massive inflammation process. You might have to take more than four of each of those capsules, especially your IQ Megas [sic]. Omegas are a very powerful anti-inflammatory and when we look at where the inflammation is following post-vaccination, it is cardiovascular and neurological, your two targeted areas. They also happen to be two areas that really love Omegas and Omegas can be incredibly powerful at soothing and calming and being incredibly supportive for. So if it were me, I would be looking at the Omegas and I would probably be tripling the amount of Omegas that I was taking if not more, because Omegas are that powerful. Zendocrine Complex, obviously, suppor ting the detoxification pathways, supporting the parts of your body syst em that deal with inflammation. We've actually seen a lot of recent stories about people who have had - even just having the virus itself, but also post-vaccination, it's triggering type 2 diabetes. We want to support th e organs that are all getting more inflamed. So Zendocrine Complex on a daily basis is amazing. Can't speak highly enough about the Turmeric Duo [sic] Caps. If you haven't noticed, they have been me ntioned at every part of this 12 Case 2:23-cv-00009 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 PageID.13 Page 13 of 17 presentation and that is because infl ammation is the cause of most of the issues we see with both the disease process but also post-vaccination. Turmeric. And I would be doing the sa me dosage that Eliza shared with you for while you're dealing with an ac tive infection. We're going to also follow the exact same protocol s for post-vaccination, right? DDR Prime, again, throughout this entir e presentation, we've talked about it, we cannot speak highly enough of it. This should be part of your daily regime. And copaiba, again, another amazing essential oil that is incredibly powerful and targeted for cardiovasc ular and neurological issues. So amazing set of tools that we actually have on hand.\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"POST- VACCINATION SUPPORT BASICS\" was di splayed. This slide included labeled depictions of several do TERRA Products, including Lifelong Vitality Pack (which includes xE O Mega, Microplex VMz, and Alpha CRS+), Zendocrine DDR Prime, and Copaiba Softgels.] b. \"There was also a really great - resear ch on different oils that are protein - yeah, spike protein inhibitors. So ag ain, when we talk about diffusing, if you're just worried about exposure, pe riod, diffusing couldn't be a more powerful tool. I took my kids out to day just because I don't feel like bringing anything else into the hous e, we're using On Guard surface spray, using it on our hands, but I also have my kids put a drop or two of essential oil in their hand s, take a deep breath. So just like we talked about flushi ng out those nasal cavities, breathing in an essential oil either because it's diffused, because you have it in your hands, because I put it on my kids' ches ts and they tent it up like this. This is a great way to be very protectiv e for your mucosal linings, for your - and for your airway, right?\" [Defendant made these statemen ts as a slide titled \"SUPPORT PROTOCOLS FOR POST VACCINATION\" was displayed.
