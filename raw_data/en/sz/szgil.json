HISTORY OF CARROT SEED OIL Carrot Seed Essential Oil is derived from the dried seeds of the Daucus carota botanical, more commonly known as the Wild Carrot or \"Queen Anne's Lace,\" as it is referred to in Europe. Carrot Seed Essential Oil is commonly mistaken for both Carrot Seed Carrier Oil and Carrot Carrier Oil. The former carrier oil is obtained by infusing a vegetable oil with cold-pressed Wild Carrot seeds, while the latter is the result of infusing a vegetable oil with macerated Wild Carrot or Carrot root then straining it. Thus, both are infused oils, though one is infused with the seeds and the other with the root. The essential oil, however, is commonly steam distilled from the seeds. The use of Carrot Seed Oil originated in the time of the ancient Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, French, and Indians, who used it to soothe inflammation and ease indigestion. In some of these geographic regions, it was combined with the essential oils of Bergamot and Lemon to address the same ailments. Carrot Seed Oil has found uses in traditional Chinese medicine, which applies it as a bath or massage oil to address muscle pain or as an effective treatment for intestinal ailments such as dysentery and worms. It is also traditionally used in the manufacturing of perfumes to contribute its woody nuance to scents that are \"Oriental\" and \"aldehydic.\" When used in other cosmetics, it is a traditional and popular moisturizing agent for all-purpose body lotions. CARROT SEED OIL BENEFITS The main chemical constituents of Carrot Seed Essential Oil are Carotol, Daucene, beta-Bisabolene, and Daucol. Used in aromatherapy applications, Carrot Seed Oil is known to have stimulant properties that enhance circulation as well as brain and nerve functions. It boosts energy levels and promotes alertness. By stimulating the release of digestive fluids and enzymes, hormones, and the muscular contractions of the intestines, it maintains the efficient movement of the digestive system and the metabolism. When diffused, the warm, earthy, woody, and herbaceous yet mildly-sweet scent of Carrot Seed Oil has a soothing, refreshing, and grounding effect that is known to diminish feelings of fatigue, weakness, anxiety, and stress. It is known to boost the operation and efficacy of the digestive system as well as the respiratory system by strengthening mucous membranes to protect the body against parasites and viruses. When Carrot Seed Essential Oil is combined with any of the following oils, it is known to contribute to a blend that is aromatically appealing: Avocado Carrier Oil, and Bergamot, Cardamom, Cedarwood, Geranium, Juniper, Lavender, Lemon, Lime, Orange, and Sandalwood essential oils. As a tonic, Carrot Seed Oil is known to tone muscles, tissue, the stomach, and the skin to enhance their strength and function, maintain the movement of digestive fluids, and prevent skin from sagging, respectively. By removing bodily toxins such as urea and uric acid as well as environmental toxins like pesticides and other chemical residues that enter the body through the diet, Carrot Seed Essential Oil helps boost immunity, reduces muscle and joint inflammation, addresses fluid retention, and soothes the discomforts of arthritis, edema, gout, and rheumatism. Carrot Seed Oil works as a supporting and protective agent that not only enhances skin health but that also repairs damage on skin that has been exposed to pollution and environmental stress, which leads to symptoms of aging. Furthermore, it stimulates the growth of new tissue and new skin, thus promoting a clearer, brighter, evenly toned complexion. By contributing moisture, it relieves skin from irritation associated with ailments such as acne, boils, dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, and sores, leaving skin looking and feeling smooth, firm, nurtured, revitalized, and generally healthy. Regular use of Carrot Seed Essential Oil on the dry and cracked skin can result in the softening of calluses, the faster healing of scars, the calming of irritation, and the fading of redness and unwanted marks such as age spots.

As a digestive tonic, Carrot Seed Oil is known to stimulate the appetite and promote the expulsion of gas, which eases bloating, colic, and flatulence. Its diuretic properties make Carrot Seed Oil beneficial for increasing the frequency with which the body expels waste and toxins through urination. This, in turn, helps prevent the causes and symptoms of several ailments that are associated with a buildup of toxins, which include fat, bile, uric acid, and harmful bacteria that are known to contaminate the excretory system. Similarly, it cleanses the kidneys, soothes the discomfort of kidney stones, and eases menstruation to promote regularity and to make it less painful.
