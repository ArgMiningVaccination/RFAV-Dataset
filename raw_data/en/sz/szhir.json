Many things can lead to a vertebral subluxation. Some of the more common causes I've found are: - A vertebra going out of place (\"misalignment\") because of a slip or fall (i.e., \"macrotrauma\"). - The entire spine misaligning globally due to [poor posture](https://draxe.com/do-you-have-good-posture-how-to-straighten-up-now/). - Joint swelling caused by damage done to the intervertebral joint. - An inflammatory response caused by a poor diet, lack of pure water or psychological stress. - [Osteoporosis](https://draxe.com/osteoporosis-diet-5-natural-treatments/)or degenerative changes of the spine or intervertebral discs. - Trigger points and tight back muscles that pull the vertebrae out of place. TAKE BACK YOUR LIFE. Discover Chiropractic is a well known Chiropractic Clinic of Manhattan, Kansas. Discover Chiropractic Clinic is a chiropractic clinic which has qualified Doctors of Chiropractic (D.C.), licensed by the State and who practices chiropractic medicine -that discipline within the healing arts which deals with the nervous system and its relationship to the spinal column and its interrelationship with other body systems. Chiropractic treatments have been proved effective in many problems, such as continuous back pain, neck pain, headache, digestive problems, balance difficulties, whiplash and other collision injuries, occupational and sports injuries. Some of the other diseases in which chiropractic treatment is helpful are Sciatica, Scoliosis, Fibromyalgia, TMJ disorders etc. \" I began chiropractic care under Dr. Adam Paquette in efforts to help my scoliosis. I was living with non-stop pain in my back, hips, and hands. The severity of my pain always interrupted my daily activities and routines. After trying physical therapy without seeing results, a family member suggested chiropractic. I was at first skeptical. I had doubts that Dr. Adam would be able to help me. I was also very concerned about the cost of receiving care. However, after visiting with Dr. Adam and his staff, I was very optimistic. Dr. Adam designed a treatment plan specifically to me which included adjustments, electrical stimulation, vibration platform, stretches and exercises. Everything was explained to me thoroughly and every question I had got answered. The results of receiving chiropractic care from Dr. Adam were life changing. I feel like a normal person again. I am now living with very little pain and am back to my normal self. I would highly recommend chiropractic to anyone; it has bettered my quality of life! - Amber F. \" Patient Testimonials stop talking START LIVING. If you haven't visited a chiropractor before, you might be missing out. Millions of people around the world have experienced the incredible benefits of [chiropractic care](https://draxe.com/your-chiropractor-could-be-your-newest-antioxidant/). One of the best things about chiropractic care is it's a drug-free and surgery-free path to healing naturally. People have reported chiropractic benefits help to improve: - - - - Neck pain - [Arthritis](https://draxe.com/natural-arthritis-cures/)and joint pain - Scoliosis - - - - Organ function - Surgery prevention There are a lot of misconceptions about chiropractic practices and how chiropractors are trained. In fact, did you know many chiropractic programs also incorporate an entire year of PhD-level advanced nutrition training? However, most of the benefits of seeing a chiropractor come from getting a chiropractic adjustment. Let's talk about the philosophy, history and evidence-based research of chiropractic care. What Chiropractors Believe Chiropractors pride themselves on taking a natural, drugless approach to helping their patients reach their health goals. Essentially, the basic principle upon which the entire profession is built is that the body has the amazing, innate ability to heal itself (under the right conditions), and it is the chiropractor's job to help create an environment to facilitate this. Because the nervous system controls every cell and organ in your body, chiropractors focus their attention on the health of your spine being properly aligned and, if there are shifts, helping the spine come back into alignment. Vertebral Subluxation At the core of the numerous chiropractic miracle stories is a concept known as \"vertebral subluxation.\" When chiropractors use this phrase, they refer to mechanical compression and irritation to spinal joints and nerves. In Harvey Lillard's case, the nerves affecting his sense of hearing were compromised, and once D.D. Palmer freed his body of this \"neurological insult,\" his hearing was restored. - For someone else, it could be sciatica - Or gastrointestinal complaints - Or (fill in the blank) When you consider how most cells and organs in your body are controlled by nerves traveling through your spinal canal, it's mind-blowing to consider how vast the side effects can be! Importance of Posture The problem that we see in Western cultures is that our unnatural habit of sitting down all day does a number on our spines \u2014 not to mention our [posture](https://draxe.com/do-you-have-good-posture-how-to-straighten-up-now/)! We're glued to our cell phones, iPads and laptops! Far too many live their lives hunched over and with their necks stuck out like turtles. Doctors call this \"forward head posture,\" and studies prove that for every inch your head sticks out from a true center of gravity, your neck bears an extra 10 pounds of stress. Just think about how common and dangerous this can be for your health! During posture evaluations, chiropractors regularly observe many of their patients carrying their head two to three inches forward, which is an extra 20-30 pounds of pressure on their neck!

These symptoms were a result of Carpal, Cubital, and Ulnar Tunnel. I had been dealing with this severe pain for four years. I had tried surgeries and physical therapy, and some medications with little or temporary relief. I found myself unable to play the piano, which is very important to me. I saw Discover Chiropractic at a booth at the bridal show. I had never been to a chiropractor before and was not sure what chiropractic care even was. I had some doubts that a chiropractor could even help me. When I arrived, everyone was friendly and helpful, unlike any other doctor's office I had been to. Dr. Adam recommended a treatment plan specific to my needs. Within the first few treatments I was able to feel my hands; I was also able to start playing the piano for small amounts of time. I am now able to play the piano until I want to stop without interruptions from pain and numbness!! I would recommend chiropractic care to ANYONE that is sick, suffering, or in pain! I have told many people about my experience. Chiropractic care is awesome and I can feel the difference. I am happy I went and that I no longer have to take medications or have further surgeries!! ~ Rachel J. After ten years of neck and lower back pain, and countless doses of Vicoden and Skelaxin, I knew the method of treatment I was using was not working. I had only been to a chiropractor once in my life and was very skeptical as to whether it would help me. My inability to complete my boxing class without pain was frustrating and getting old fast. My friend and I were talking about my situation and he told me about Dr. Adam and HealthSource Chiropractic. My experience at the office was very positive. Between the adjustments, electrical stimulation, and the posture pump, I experienced a 180 degree turn around in my overall health. I have told many people about Discover and the difference Chiropractic care can make. I am now able to complete my boxing classes and coach my sons various sports teams. ~Mike \" \" \" \" After suffering from fairly severe neck pain for years, I had finally had enough. I received an offer that I could not refuse for a chiropractic consultation with Dr. Adam. It had been five years since I had received any chiropractic care, and knowing chiropractic would help me, it was time to take the first step to wellness. When I first got to the office, I had an excellent impression. The staff was wonderful, the doctor was thorough, and did a great job. Along with the treatment plan that was designed specifically for my needs, I was given exercises, stretching instructions, and a comprehensive program to follow. The results I have experienced are wonderful. I would recommend chiropractic care to anyone. My son even became a patient and experienced excellent results as well. He is now able to participate in sports without the severe pain. If you give chiropractic care a chance, the results are amazing. I am addicted! Carla S. For six years I suffered from sever neck and back pain. I was told I needed surgery. I have tried everything from physical therapy to injections, but they only offered short term relief. I found myself helpless and addicted to oxycotin for the extreme pain, however, I was able to finally wean myself off of them. I had been to other chiropractors previously and was very skeptical. I then found Dr. Adam and Discover Chiropractic. My sister-in-law explained her success with this office and encouraged me to join in the fun! I had my doubts but right away I began seeing improvement. When I walked into the office I was surprisingly and completely impressed. Due to previous bad experiences at other offices, I expected much less. After my exams and meeting with Dr. Adam, it was very clear that to get the results I desired, I needed to make every appointment and follow my treatment plan. Family members of mine have come into the office and have experienced life changing results. We all are happier, healthier, and pain free! I would and do refer this office. I talk to others about my positive results all the time. I trust chiropractic. With the teachings and positive atmosphere of this office, I am now open to treatments that have positively impacted my pain free life. ~Leslie E. "}
