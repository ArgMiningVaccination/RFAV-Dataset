It was easily set up with all the tools that we needed to communicate and promote the program, well done! We had positive responses and it continued to be a tool for their wellbeing.

Virtual MeditationWorks Wellness Wednesday Julie Denton Chief People Officer & Stephanie Roche Director Centralized Training Recipe Unlimited A huge thank you to Traci & Ryan! Your generosity to provide moments of self-care to healthcare professionals was tremendously appreciated at CAMH. Having the Airstream on campus allowed for people to stop, pause and enjoy a moment of peacefulness during these challenging times. Both staff and patients vocalized their gratitude and left with smiles. The guided meditations allowed us all to connect virtually and was a reminder that although we are socially and physically distancing, we can still be together as a community. Thank you so much MeditationWorks!
